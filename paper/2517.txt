                      The Implications of Insurance for
                        the Efficacy of Fiscal Policy




                                   ABSTRACT




           Various tax policies provide consumers with forms of insurance.

       Social security has the payoff characteristics of an annuity.   The

       income tax provides consumers with a degree of income insurance because

       the government shares part of the individuals income risk.

       Redistributive taxes can be used to spread aggregate income risks across

       different generations.   The effects of these and other tax policies are

       shown to depend crucially on the nature of existing private insurance

       arrangements

                             I.   Introduction

      What does insurance have to do with the macroeconomic effects of

fiscal policy?   To an economist schooled in the traditional Keynesian

                                                                       In the
multiplier analysis, the answer would be a resounding "nothing!"

simplest Keynesian paradigm, the effects of fiscal policy are analyzed

using the multiplier, which is based on a simple marginal propensity to

conume,   The role of uncertainty--not to mention insurance--   is   not at

all apparent in this analysis.    However, macroeconomics and the analysis

of fiscal policy have progressed well beyond this simple framework.

Consumption behavior continues to be stressed in analyzing the effects of

fiscal policy, but the mechanisms chat are currently emphasized are quite

different from chose in the early Keynesian framework,

      Most recent theoretical research on the effects of fiscal      poLiy

proceeds by examining the effects of fiscal policy on the consumption and

portfolio decisions of individual consumers.     The macroeconomic effects

of fiscal policy are then determined by aggregating the behavior of

individual consumers.   If all consumers are identical, then, of course,

aggregation is particularly simple.    Alternatively, if, as in much of the

research presented below, there is heterogeneity among consumers, then

the aggregation of individual behavior must explicitly take account of

general equilibrium considerations and market-clearing relations.

      The preferred frameworks for analyzing individual consumption

behavior are the life-cycle model of Modigliani and Brumberg L22 and the

permanent income model of Friedman l2J.     Each of these approaches is

based on explicit utility maximization by an individual consumer subject

to the constraints that face that consumer.      The important insight shared

by these theories is that consumers form their consumption decisions on
                                                                                2



the basis of their lifetime income rather than simply their current

income as in the Keynesian consumption function.    Optimal consumption

behavior requires consumers to forecast their future after-tax incomea.

Therefore, in responding to a tax change, for example, consumers must

forecast the future course of taxes as well as the current tax,       Because

future incomea and taxes are not perfectly predictable, there is a demand

by tisk-averse consumers for insurance. The savings and consumption

decisions of individual consumers will be greatly affected by whether
insurance of various types is available and, if ao, at what price. In
particular, the responses of individual consumers to various changes in
taxea   depend on the nature of available insurance arrangements.

        In discussing the importance of insurance arrangements, a broad

definition of insurance will be used.    For the purposes of this paper,

insurance will he defined as amy contingent arrangement that allows

individual consumers to mitigate random fluctuations in marginal utility.

This definition ia deliberately general in order to convey the view that

insights about insurance can be applied to questions that at first glance

do not appear to have anything to do with insurance.

        The majority of this paper is devoted to situations in which

individuals face idiosyncratic risks.   More precisely, much of the

analysis examines situations in which a group of individuals all face the

aeme ex ante probability distribution for a random variable; but, cx

post, different members of the group obtain different realizations of the

random variable,    If each individual's realization of this random

variable were publicly obsenable,    there would evidently be soope for

private insurance markets to pool these idiosynoratio risks.    By

contrast, the last pert of this paper will ignore idiosyncratic risks and
                                                                                  3




will focus instead on aggregate risks, in which all members of   a   cohort

experience the same realization of the random variable.   In this

situation, the scope for private insurance is less evident, but   a   fiscal

authority could provide insurance.

       The particular risks analyzed in this paper are of three sorts.

The first risk, which is discussed in section II, is associated with the

fact that individuals do not know in advance exactly when they will die.

After analyzing the implications of this individual longevity risk for

individual saving and the distribution of wealth, this framework is used

to analyze the effects of social security in the presence of alternative

private insurance arrangements. The second risk, discussed in section

III,   is associated with the unpredictability of future income, and it

gives rise to precautionary saving.   An income tax provides a form of

insurance against fluctuations in income and thus mitigates the need for

precautionary saving.   This interaction of the insurance aspects of the

income tax and saving behavior has important implications for the effects

of fiscal policy.   The third risk, which is analyzed in section IV, is a

cohort-wide income risk that cannot be shared in private insurance

arrangements.   However, a fiscal system of taxes and transfers can be

established to share this risk optimally across generations.     After
                                                                              -



presenting the features of an optimal system, the viability of such a

system is discussed.



                             IL   Longevity Risk

        Before analyzing the saving behavior of consumers in the presence

of longevity risk, it is useful to summarize briefly the implications of

the life-cycle model under the assumption that each consumer knows in
                                                                                       4



advance how long he or she will live.          The life-cycle model has two

fundamental components.          First, each individual cares about lifetime

utility and, consequently, attempts to have a smooth profile of

consumption over his or her lifetime.          Second, there is a typical life-

cycle pattern of income in which individuals earn labor income during

early and middle adulthood and are retired in late adulthood.              In order

to qckieve the same level of consumption during retirement as during

working years, it is necessary for individuals to save some of their

labor income and accumulate wealth during their working years.             Then chic

wealth       is   gradually decumulated to provide for consumption during
retirement,
         In   a particularly restrictive form of the life-cycle model,

consumers are assumed not to have bequest motives.           In this formulation

then,    it is optimal for a consumer to end life with precisely zero

wealth.              this implication is simply not borne out by the data.
              However,
While    the implication that consumers die holding zoro wealth is perhaps
too    strong to be expected to hold exactly,     many   studies have indicated
that    consumers decumulate wealth far too slowly,       or not at all.    Does

this failure of elderly consumers to decumulata their wealth indicate the

importance of a bequest motive, does it indicate an imperfection in life

and/or health insurance markets2, or does it indicate some more basic

flaw in the model?         Although this question is still waiting for a

definitive answer, recent research, which has focussed on the role of

insurance markets and bequest motives, has produced a rich array of

 insights.

        A.   Absence of Private Annuities

        To begin the study of saving and bequests under uncertain

 longevity, it is convenient to start with as simple a model as possible.

 This model is taken from Abel [1).             A   similar model of individual

 behavior, which does not include a capital stock, is analyzed in

 Eckstein, Eichenbaum and Peled [10).

        Suppose that each consumer can live for at most two periods.                For

 the moment, assume that a consumer does not have a bequest motive and

cannot buy life insurance or annuities.               In the first period, the

consumer receives an inheritance,          I,   and inelastically supplies one unit

of labor thereby earning labor income Y.               Also in the first period, the

consumer pays a tax T and consumes an amount              c.   Therefore, the
consumer's total wealth at the end of the first period of life, which is

denoted by W, is

                    W       l+YTc                                       (1)

        Suppose that this wealth is held in the form of riskless capital

and let R denote the gross rate of return on wealth between the first anc

second period.    Thus, at the beginning of the second potential period of

life,   the consumer's wealth, including accrued
                                                 interest, is R W.               At the

beginning of the second potential period of life,              the consumer gives

birth to C heirs.       After the C heirs are born, the uncertainty about the

consumer's longevity is resolved. With probability p. the consumer dies

at the beginning of the second period and the consumer's estate is

divided equally among the     G   heirs;    thus each heir receives R W/G.

Alternatively, with probability l-p, the consumer survives.               Each

surviving consumer receives a social security benefit S.               Knowing that
this is   the last period of his or her life,           the consumer consumes
                                                                                   distriE

      Equation (10) relates the inheritance of a type j consumer to the

wealth of a type j-l consumer. Using this relation to substitute for the

inheritance in (9) yields

                              +    (1-a)   R                          (11)

     -Equation (11) can be used to solve for the wealth of all consumers.

Technically, it is a first-order linear constant coefficient difference

equation with the boundary condition given by (7).              This equation can be

easily solved.       It can be shown that the wealth of a young type j

consumer,            increases monoconically in     j   and,   if (l-a)R/C < 1, it

approaches a finite limit as j approaches infinity.              Rather than present

the complete solution here4, it is convenient to focus on the average

value of         in the steady state, which is denoted as W*.            It can be

shown that

                 0/[l-(l-a)pR/Gj                                      (12)

      The variable W* is an interesting macroeconomic quantity;               in

particular, it is the per capita value of the private capital stock2                 To

see that W* is the per capita stock of private capital, recall that

surviving old consumers consume all of their resources. Thus, all

private saving in the economy is done by young consumers.              Since capital

is the only asset in this economy, the saving of young consumers, which

averages W* per capita, is equal to the private capital stock.

      This simple model endogenously generates a cross-sectional

distribution of wealth.           The mechanism generating the cross-sectional

4  See Abel [1J for a complete solution.
5  Strictly speaking, W* is equal to the total private capital stock of
the economy divided by the number of young consumers, rather than divided
by the total number of consumers.
variation is that a fraction p of each cohort of consumers dies young and

thus leaves accidental bequests to their heirs,            in this model, all of

tha cross-sectional variation in wealth results from cross-sectional

variation in bequests.          An additional feature of this model ia that it

predicts a potentially aubstantial ratio of bequests to total private

wealth.    Indeed,    since a fraction p    of   esoh type of consumer diea young,

the ratio of bequests to total private wealth is equal to p.

       Fully Funded Social        Seturi    Although the model presented above

is quite simple,      it provides some important insights into the effects of

a   social insurance program.        In particular, this model can he used to

examine the effects on consumption, capital accumulation and the

distribution of wealth of either a fully funded or a pay-as-you-go social

security system.

       First, consider the effects of a fully funded social security

system.    In such a system,       the government collects a tax T from each


young consumer and investa the proceeds in capital.            In the next period,

the social ascurity fund is worth FT and is distributed evenly to the

surviving members of the cohort of elderly consumers. Thus, each

surviving consumer receives a social security payment S such that

          FT        (l-p)S                                         (13)

       The effects of the introduction of social security can be evaluated

by comparing the equilibrium values of variables under the social

security system with the values that these variables would attain in the

absence of social security (with T          S     0).   The consumption of type 0

consumers can be calculated by substituting the relation between the

social security parameters S and T in (13) into (6) to obtain

          c0    -    a   (Y   + pT/(1—p)}                          (14)
       Inspection of (14) reveals that the introduction of fully funded

 social security increases the consumption of young type 0 consumers
                                                                     by

 apT/(l-p).    This increase in consumption reflects the intra-cohort risk

 pooling of the social security system.            Each consumer contributes   1'   to

 the social security system, but a fraction p of each cohort dies
                                                                  young
 and thereby surrenders its claim to social security benefits to the

 remiing   fraction 1-p of the cohort.            Thus, risk pooling increases the

present value of lifetime resources of each survivor by pT/(l-p).

Multiplying this increase in lifetime resources by the marginal

propensity to consume, a, yields the increase in consumption of young

type 0 consumers

      The wealth held by young type 0 consumers can be calculated by

substituting the relation between the social security parameters S ann T

from (13) into equation (7) to obtain

                —   (l-a)Y   -   T   -   a p T/(l-p)               (15)

      The introduction of fully funded social security reduces the wealth

held by young type 0 consumers, and this reduction in wealth is

decomposed into two parts in (15).            First, even if a young type 0

consumer maintained consumption unchanged with the introduction of social

security, the consumer's wealth would decline by the amount of the soca1

security tax, because first-period disposable income is reduced by T.

Furthermore,   as explained above, a young type 0 consumer increases

consumption by apT/(l-p), which reduces saving by an additional apT/(l-



      Because the saving of young type 0 consumers is reduced

introduction of fully funded social security, those type 0 consumers who

die young leave smaller bequests in the presence of social security than
                                                                                   12



in its absence.        Therefore, the introduttion of social security reduces

the inheritances received by type 1 consumers. These consumers in turn
leave ameller bequests in the presence of social security than in its
absence,    Indeed,     in the new steady state the accidental bequest left by

each type j consumer is reduced by the introduction of social security.

Therefore, the introduction of social security reduces the inheritances

received   by   all consumers    (except for type 0 consumers   who   receive no
inheritance     in either case).     Because the only source of cross-sectional

variation is the intra-cohort variation in inheritances, it follows that

fully funded social security narrows the steady state distributions of

consumption and wealth.6 In addition to reducing the intra-cohort

variation in wealth, the introduction of fully funded social security

affects the average level of wealth in the economy and the size of the

national capital stock,         The national capital stock (per young person),

K,    is equal to the sum of the private capital stock, W*, and the capital

held by    the social security system, T.      Recalling from (12) that the

private capitol atock is proportional to              and recalling that the

introduction of social security reduces the value of        WW),      it follows

that the introduction of social security reduces the private capital

stock,     Moreover, it can be shown that the reduction in the private

capital stock, W*, is greater than T.         Therefore, the national capital

stock, K*       W* +    T,   declines in response to the introduction of social

security.

         The effect of social security on the average level of consumption

labor income endogenous. He further modifies the model to make social

security taxes proportional to labor income and shows that linking
social security tax to income leads to different results about the
distribution of wealth.

can be calculated using the national income identity. To derive this

identity, let Nt denote the number of young consumers born in period                       t.


The assumption that each consumer has G children implies that Nt —                    GNi.
Cross national product in period t is equal to the labor income of young

consumers, NtY, plus gross capital income, R ?ç1(W*±T).7 Cross national

product is allocated to consumption and saving.                     Total consumption is

equal-to the consumption of the young consumers, Ntc*, plus the

consumption of the surviving old consumers,                  (lp)N1x*.      Gross national

saving is equal to the saving of the young consumers,                          pius the

      Equation (16) simply tate5 that gross national product is equal to

consumption plus gross investment.               Dividing both sides of (16) by Nt and

      The   left hand side of       (l7     is aggregate consumption per capita.

7  The definitions of gross national product, gross capital income, gross
national saving and gross investment used here differ somewhat from those
dsed in the national income accounts. Recall that one unit of capital in
period t yields R units of the consumption good in period t+l. Using
more standard terminology, R is equal to 1 - d ÷ r where d is the rate of
depreciation and r is the rate of return on capital before subtratting
depreciation, With this notation, gross national product in period t is
    + rN 1(W* + T); gross capital income is rNti(W*+T); gross
investment, which is net investment plus depreciation, is      N(W*+T)
Nrl(w*+T) tl(w*+T); gross saving of the young generation is
and gross saving of the old generation, which is net saving plus
depreciation, is (lp)Ntix* + d(l-p)N51W*,       In the special case of
complete depreciation, d    1 and therefore R   r.  In this case, gross
national product is NtY +           + T); gross capital income is
                                  tl(W*
  ti(T*+T) gross investment is Nt(W*+T); gross saving of the young
generation is NtW*; and gross saving of the old generation is zero, Thus
in the case of complete depreciation, the concepts of the gross nationai
product, gross capital income, gross national saving and gross investment
used in the text correspond to the standard national income accounting
definitions.

Recall that the introduction of fully funded social security leads to a

reduction in the national capital stock, K*, on the right hand side of

              If the rate of interest exceeds the population growth rate,         rhen
(17).

R/G   -   I    is positive and the reduction in K* implies a reduction in

consumption per capita.            Alternatively, if the interest rate is less chan

the population growth rate, then R/G             I is negative and the reduction in

the national capital stock K* implies an increase in consumption per

capita.

          The relation between aggregate consumption and the aggregate

                                                                famous Golden Rule
capital stock in (17) is related to Phelps's            1,23)


result.         In order to maintain a constant level of capital per capita, it

is necessary that the capital stock grow at the same rate that population

grows.         Thus, if the level of capital per capita is to be increased
                                                            in each
permsnently by one unit, then the level of gross investment

period must be increased by C units per capita.              The benefit of

increasing the capital stock by one unit per capita is that gross capital

income is increased by         R   units per capita.   If R is greater than C, then

the increased capital stock will increase steady state consumption;

whether the economy should temporarily decrease consumption in order to

accumulate capital and increase long-run consumption depends on society's

preferences for present consumption relative to future consumption.

Alternatively, if        R   is less than C, then steady state consumption can be

increased by a decrease in the capital stock.             There is no tradeoff

between current and future consumption in this case.                An increase in

current consumption will reduce the capital stock and increase future

consumption.         Clearly, if an economy is ever in the case with        R   < C, it

should decrease its capital stock; this would increase consumption at all

dates, which would be Pareto-improving.8

       The case in which R is equal to G receives special attention.                       In a

model with a neoclassical production function, the rate of return on

capital, R, is a strictly decreasing function of the capital stock;

hence, there is a unique value of the capital stock for which                   R   — C.

This value of the capital stock is called the Golden Rule capital stock

The   lden    Rule capital stock is the capital stock that maximizes the

permanently sustainable level of consumption.                  Any capital stock greater

than the Golden Rule capital stock is too large in the sense described

above, because R would be less than C.

       Pay-as-you-go Social Securitii                 A pay-as-you-go social security

system differs from a fully funded system in that the social security

system does not hold any capital under a pay-as-you-go system, the taxes

collected from the young consumers are used to pay the benefits to the

old consumers in the same period.                In each period,   the young cohort is

G/(l-p) times as large as the su1iving old cohort.                  Therefore, setting

total tax collections from yoing consumers equal to the total benefits

paid to the old consumers yields the following relation between the

social security parameters S and T

               —
         GT          (l-p)S                                             (18)

       The   consumption         of young type   0 consumers is calculated by

substituting       (18)   into (6) to obtain

                    -     aY +   al   -
                                          (l-p)R/G]   (S/R)              (19)

       Equation (19) indicates that the consumption of young type 0

consumers may either increase or decrease with the introduction of pay-

as-you-go social security, depending on whether G exceeds or falls short

up with an inefficient overaccumulation of capital.
                                                                                 16



of (l-p)R.   This result is to be contrasted with the finding that fully

funded social security unambiguously increases   c°      To understand this

difference, one can view the social security tax T as the price paid for

a contingent claim that pays S if the consumer lives for two periods.

The gross rate of return on this claim is S/T.      If this gross rate of

return, S/T, exceeds the rste of return available on the consumer's

portfelio, R, then the introduction of social security will effectively

make the consumer richer and will increase consumption.     However, if the

rate of return on social security falls short of the rate of return on

the consumer's portfolio, then the introduction of social security will

reduce the consumption of young type 0 consumers.     Now obsene from (13)

that the rate of return on fully funded social security, S/T, is equal to

R/(l-p) which exceeds R if p > 0.   Thus, fully funded social security

leads to an increase in        Alternatively, (18) implies that the rate

of return on pay-as-you-go social security, S/T, is equal to G/(l-p)

which may be greater than, less then, or equal to R.      Therefore, pay-as-

you-go social security may lead to en increase, decrease, or no change in



      Although the introduction of pay-as-you-go social security may

either raise or lower (0), inspection of (7) reveals immediately that it

                                                           w(0)        As with
unambiguouly reduces the saving of young type 0 consumers,

fully funded social security, the reduction in          implies that the

inheritance received by each type j consumer   (j   > 0) is reduced.   Again,

the reduction in all nonzero inheritances implies that the cross-

sectionel variation in wealth is reduced.   Also, the reduction in

agein implies that the per capita value of private weelth, W*, is reduced

by the introduction of social security.   Under pay-es-you-go social
                                                                               17



security, the government does not hold any capital; the national capital

stock is equal to the private capital stock.     Because pay-as-you-go

social security reduces the private capital stock, W*, it also reduces

the national capital stock.     Again (17) indicates that consumption per

capita will fall if the interest rate, R, exceeds the population growth

rate, G, but will increase if R is less than C.

     -B.     Annuities

         The model presented above has yielded some important insights about

the behavior of individual and aggregate saving, and about the effects of

social insurance, in the presence of uncertain individual longevity.

However, the model has at least two unsatisfactory implications.      First,

because consumers are assumed to be selfish, they would choose to hold

all of their wealth in annuities, even if the annuities were not


actuarially fair.     Provided that an annuity pays a greater return than

riskless capital in the event the consumer survives, the consumer would

choose to fully snnuitize his or her wealth.    Thus, there is an incipient

demand for annuities, and a satifactory treatment would either include

annuities or would provide an economic reason why there are no annuities

in equilibrium.     The model presented above simply rules out annuities by

assumption. However, annuities will be introduced into the analysis

below.

      The second unsatisfactory feature of the model is that the children

of the richest consumers are among the poorest members of the economy if

their rich, but selfish, parents live for two periods and thus leave no

bequest.    In this model, the only channel for the preservation of   a

family's wealth across generations is through accidental bequests which

occur with early death.    This feature of the model can be eliminated by
                                                                               18



introducing a bequest motive,     In order to be able to focus first on the

implications of an annuity market, the introduction of the bequest motive

will be delayed until section C.

      Now suppose that there is a competitive market for annuities.9

Each dollar invested by a young consumer in an annuity yields Q dollars

in the following period if the consumer    auives;    the consumer's estate

recaivea nothing if the consumer dies after only one period of life.

Insurance companies sell these annuities end invest the proceeds in

riakless capital which pays a gross rate of return R.     In the following

period, insurance companies distribute the premiums with accrued interest

to the aurliving annuitanta in proportion to their contributions when

young.    The gross rate of return earned by aurvivora is equal to R/(l-p).

         The introduction of a competitive annuity market into the model

dramatically alters the nature of the equilibrium and the effects of

social security.     Because R/(l-p) exceeds R, annuities dominate riskleaa

capital and all consumers would choose to hold all of their wealth in the

form of annuities. Therefore there would he no bequests--accidental or

otherwiae,     Hence, there would be no cross-sectional variation in wealth.

In this situation, it is appropriate to uae a "representative consumer"

model,

         In the presence of an annuity market offering a gross rate of

return Q, the consumption of a representative old consumer, x. is

           x     QW+S        Q[Y-T-c]+S                     (20)

         The optimal level of consumption when young can be calculated by

9 Kotlikoff and Spivak [20] discuss the role of the family in helping to
provide annuities. The annuity protection offered by family members is
not, of course, as complete as the insurance available in competitive
annuity markets, Nevertheless, this annuity protection does affect
consumer behavior.
                                                                                            19



substituting the lifetime budget constraint (20) into the utility

function (3) and then differentiating the resulting expression with

respect to c.           Setting this derivative equal to zero yields

           c        a [Y    -   T + S/QJ                                  (21)

where,    as earlier,       the marginal propensity to consume, a, is equal to

l/[l+(l-p)DJ.        Equation (21) states that the consumption of a young

coner          is proportional to the present value of lifetime resources

where the       future   social security benefit, S, is discounted by the

actuarial rate of return Q.                 Alternatively,   recalling that in a

competitive annuity market Q                  R/(1-p), the consumption   function in (21)

can   be written as

           c       a [Y    -    T   +   (l-p)S/R1                         (22)

         The consumption function in (22) indicates that in the presence of

a   competitive annuity market, the appropriate concept of lifetime income

is the expected present value of income.

               FNflded     Social Security:         Now consider the effects of

introducing a fully funded social security system as characterized by

(13).     Substituting the social security parameters from (13) into the

consumption function (22) yields

           c       aY                                                    (23)

         Equation (23), which presents the optimal level of consumption of a

young consumer in the presence of a fully funded social security system,

displays a remarkable result.                This equation indicates that the optimal

level of c is independent of the values of the social security parameters

T and S.       Thus, the optimal level of c is invariant to the introduction

of fully funded social security.

         The reason for the irrelevance of social security in the presence
                                                                                20



of a competitive annuity market is that fully funded social security

                                                     As stated earlier, a
simply provides consumers with a redundant asset.

consumer's claim to the social security benefit S can be viewed as an

asset with a gross race of return equal to S/T.    Under fully funded

social security, this rate of return is equal to R/(l-p), which is

precisely equal to the rate of return on privately available annuities.

Thux, zhile the social security system essentially forces young consumers

to purchase an annuity. the consumers cen exactly offset this effect by
reducing their holdings of neivate annuities by an equal amount, Because
the   payoff characteristics of the private annuity are identical to those

of social security, the consumer can obtsin exactly the same state-

                                                        of social
contingent stream of consumption after the introduction

security that could be obtained before its introduction.     Furthermore, it

will be optimal for the consumer to offset the effect of social security,
                                                                        Since
beceuse the initial state-contingent consumption plan was optimal.

the introduction of fully funded social security doee not change any

relative price and does not change the consumer's opportunity set in any

way, the original optimal plan remains optimal.

        The irrelevance of fully funded social security in the presence of

a competitive annuity market is an example of a more general phenomenon

that is   knom   as the Ricardian Equivalence Theorem.   Briefly, the

Ricardimn Equivalence Theorem states that chsnges in the timing of lump-

sum taxes, holding constant the path of government spending, have no

effect on the allocation of consumption.     The reason is essentially that

consumers can, and will, offset the effects of such changes by adjusting

their savings and/or bequest behavior.

        As shown above, the Ricardien Equivalence Theorem applies to fully
                                                                               21


funded social security in the presence of an actuarially fair private

annuity market.     However, there are at least two sources of departure

from the Ricardian Equivalence Theorem in the case of fully funded social

security.     First, it should be noted the invariance of consumption to the

introduction of fully funded socical security is a direct consequence of

the fact that the rate of return on social security is exactly the same

as the rate of return on private annuities,      If, for some reason,   the

rates of return on private annuites and social security were not

identical, then the Ricardian Equivalence Theorem would not hold.       For

example,    if the rate of return on social security exceeded the rate of

return on private annuities, then the introduction of social security

would increase the expected present value of lifetime income and would

iead to an increase in the consumption of young     consumers°    Of course,

the question then arises as to why the government would be able to offer

a higher rate of return on annuities than the private sector could.       It

would appear to be difficult the make the case that the government is

more efficient in providing annuities, and it would also appear to be

difficult to make the opposite case, a priori.     An alternative

explanation, which is discussed below,    s   that if consumers face

different mortality risks, and have private information about these

risks, then the private annuity market would be subject to adverse

selection.    However, the government could, by requiring a compulsory

level of social security coverage, be immune to adverse selection and

thus offer a higher rate of return.

      A    second reason why the Ricardian Equivalence Theorem may not hold

10 Karni and Zilcha {l7} examine the effect of social security in the
presence of unfair annuity and life insurance markets in a model that
includes a bequest motive.

           Pay-as-yougo         Social Security Although a fully funded social

security system is ineffectual in the presence of a competitive annuity

market, this is not true, in general, for a pay-as-you-go system.                                   To

determine the optimal level of consumption under pay-as-you-go social

security, substitute the social security parameters from (18) into the

consumption function (22) to obtain

                    —    a Y + a [G/R   -
                                            I]   T                                  (25)

           If   the      rate of interest exceeds the population growth rate,                       then

C/R - 1 is negative and the introduction of social security leads to a

reduction in consumption of young consumers,                         The reason for this

reduction is quite clear.               The rate of return on pay-as-you-go social

security, S/T, is equal to G/(l-p) and the rate of return on private

annuities is R/(l-p).             Thus, if R         >   G, then the introduction          of social

security        forces     young consumers to hold           annuities    with   a lower     rate    of

return      than        is available in the private market.              Therefore, consumers are

made poorer by the introduction of social security and they reduce their

consumption.

           If the rate of interest is less than the population growth rate,

then G/R        -   1   is positive and the introduction of social security

increases consumption.             Furthermore, the introduction of social security

is Pareto-improving in this case.                    In the period in which pay-as-you-go

social security is introduced, the members of the old generation are

clearly better off because they receive the social security benefit S

without ever having had to pay social security taxes.                            In addition, each

subsequent generation is made better off by the introduction of social

security because it provides them with an annuity that dominates the

annuity available in the private market.       The fact that the introducticn

of social security is ParetoJmprovingindicates that the initial

equilibrium was not Psretoefficient.        Indeed, the Golden Rule results

discussed above indicate that if     R   < C, and if the capital stock ia

positive, then-   the economy suffers from an inefficient overattuisulation
of capital.   As applied to pay-asyou-go social security when       R   < C, the

Coldga Rule result indicates that any increase in T and        S is Pareto-


improving   until private saving   by young consumers    is driven to zero (or,
with a neoclassical production function, until      R   is equal to C).
      Beruestotive
      me preceding analysis introduced annuities but hss the shortcoming
that there are no bequests in the model. As a consequence, the
distribution of wealth is degenerate.        In order to generste bequests in a

model with a competitive annuity market, a bequest motive is introduced

in this section,       The two most common formulations of the bequest motive

are altruism and the joy-of-giving.        Although these specifications are

similar in many respects, they have different implications for the

validity of the Ricardisn Equivalence Theorem and the efficscy of fiscal

policy.

      Altruism:     The altruistic specification of the bequest motive

became popular in macroeconomics after Eerro's [4) presentation of the

Ricardian Equivalence Theorem.       Under an altruistic specification of the

bequest motive,    a   consumer obtains utility from the utility of his heirs

as well as from his own consumption.        Consider a consumer born in period

t who consumes c0 in period t and, contingent on survival, consumes

in period t+l.     Let Vt denote the total utility of this consumer and let

                                                                     is
Vt+l denote the total utility of his or her representative heir, who
                                                                                           25


born in period t+i.            Suppose that the consumer's utility function is

          Vt          in   c + (i-p)D   in         +     Et(Vt+i}        (26)

where EtC      )   denotes the expectation conditional on information in period

t.   The parameter         ,   which is assumed to lie between zero and one,

measures the strength of the altruistic bequest motive.

         The utility of an altruistic consumer depends on his or her

chiJdren's utility, which in turn depends on their children's utility,

and so on.         Thus, the utility of      a   consumer depends on the entire stream

of consumption over his or her              own   lifetime   and over the lifetimes of

all of his or her descendents,              Formally, the recursive specification of

altruistic preferences in (26) is a linear difference equation that is

satisfied by the following infinite-horizon utility function12

         Vt           zE0(3rln     c+   +    (i-p)Dln   xc÷i+j)}         (27)
                     1—0

         Now consider the effects of social security in the presence of an

altruistic bequest motive,            it is easiest to begin with the case in which

all consumers live for two periods with certainty (formally p                   0).

First,    consider a fully funded social security system in which RT                  S.

As in the case without a bequest motive, fully funded social security

will have absolutely no effect.              In response to the introduction of fully

funded social security, young consumers will maintain their original

levels of consumption and will simply reduce their private saving by F.

in the following period, when they are old, their portfolios of private

assets will be worth RT less than in the absence of social security, but

they will receive a social security benefit of S — RT that allows them to

12  Douglas Gale [13, pp. 55-61] has emphasized that equation (27) is
only one of an infinity of solutions to the difference equation in (26).
However, (27) is the specification that is generally used in the
literature.

maintain the original level of old-age consumption.
        Now   consider the introduction of psy-as-you-go social security in
which   S     CT.     Under altruistic preferences, it turns out chat this

policy also has no effect.         The old consumers who are alive in the period

in which social security is introduced will receive a payment of S but

they will not increase their consumption at all.            Instead, they will

                                                                           This
chogse to increase their bequest to each of their heirs by S/C.

increased inheritance exactly offsets the tax burden T levied on each of

the young consumers,         Thus, all young and old consumers are able to

maintain the original levels of consumption. Because all relative prices
and marginal rates of substitution remain unchanged, there is no
incentive for anyone to change consumption.
        The discussion above demonstrates that in the absence of longevity

risk and with altruistic preferences, the Ricardian Equivalence Theorem

holds   both for fully funded social security and for pay-as-you-go social
security.      That is. private consumption is invsriantto the introduction

of social security whether it is fully funded or pay-as-you-go.           When

longevity risk is re-introduced into the model, the Ricardian Equivalence

Theorem     does    not hold quite so generally.   It   doer continue to hold for
fully   funded social security.       Because the rate of return on fully funded

social security, S/T, is equal to the rate of return on private

annuities. R/(l-p). young consumers respond to the introduction of social

security by reducing their holding of private annuities by T;            they

maintain their consumption unchanged.

        The effects of pay-as-you-go social security in the presence of

longevity risk and altruistic preferences are more interesting.            Consider

the period in which the pay-as-you-go social security system is
                                                                                     27



introduced,       All surviving old consumers receive a social security

benefit S     * GT/(l-p).   However, because a fraction 1-p of families have a
                                                                    do
surviving old consumer and the remaining fraction p of the families

not have a surviving old consumer, this payment      to   surviving old

consumers induces a redistribution of wealth across families.             In

particular, there is a redistribution from families without a surviving
old &nsumer to families with a surviving old consumer Each surviving
old consumer will see that the present value of his or her family's
resources is increased by the introduction of social security.
Therefore,     surviving old consumers will increase their own consumption

somewhat and will also increase their bequests somewhat in order to share

.he increase in wealth with subsequent generations.         By contrast, the

young   consumers   in families without survivors will see       a   decrease in
their   families' wealth and they will reduce their own         consumption    and

their bequests.

        The argument above indicates that the Ricardian Equivalence Theorem

fails to apply to pay-as-you-go social security under longevity risk,

even if consumers have altruistic bequest motives.         However, a staunch

defender of the Ricardian Equivalence Theorem would not concede the case

so quickly.       A defense of the Ricardian Equivalence Theorem would argue

        the                                                          insurance
that          analysis in the paragraph above has ignored a relevant

market.       (ore precisely, if the introduction of social security was at

least conceivable in the prior period,      then each young consumer would

have taken steps to guard against the risk of having social security

introduced during a period in which there were no surviving old consumers

in his or her family.       Each young consumer in the previous period would

have agreed to give up any social security benefit,        S,    received in the
                                                                                                 28



subsequent period in exobsnge for (l-p)S to be psid ro the consumer, or
his    estate, in the following period.               If this sort       of tax    liability
insurance      arrangeaont wets in foroe, then the introduction of pay-as-you-

go    social   security would have no effeot on the allocation of privete

consumption.       Although         this argument is theoretically sound, it will

undoubtedly strike aany readers as far-fetched. This type of insurance
arrangement is       not typically observed in practice, either because of

legal prohibitions on trading future social security benefits or because

of the liaited ability and/or willingness of consumers to anticipoto and

write contracts for oIl conceivable contingencies.

         2of-oivno: The               altruistic specification of           the bequest cotive
often implies that individual consumers will take actions to completely
nullify the effects of various lump-sum tax and transfer policies. An
alternative specification of the bequest motive is the joy-of-giving.
Under the joy-of-giving, consumers obtain utility from their own

consumption       and from leaving a bequest,           The utility from leaving the

bequest depends only on the size of                 the bequest;        it does not depend on

the utility or consumotion of the recipients of the hequest. An example
of a utility function that displays a joy-of-giving bequest motive is
         In   c    (l-p)   U   In   x1 + pH(BD) + (l-p)H(88t)               (28)

where          is the bequest if the consumer dies sfter one period, and

is the bequest if the consumer survives for two periods.                           Under the

specification in       (28)    ,    the utility from leaving a bequest of size h is

11(b);    it is assumed that H'(h)         >   U   and 11(b)   <   0.

          To analyze optimal consumption and portfolio behavior under the

utility function in (28), let At denote the amount of wealth that the

consumer holds in the form of annuities at the end of                      period     t;   the
                                                                                                  29



remainder of the portfolio, I             +   Y - T -   t    At, is held in the form of
riskless capital.        If the consumer dies young, the bequest,           B,         is equal

to the value of riskless capital with accrued interest

        D_              {I+Y-T-ct-A]R                                   (29a)

      Alternatively, if the consumer survives for two periods, wealth in

the second period consists of the principal and interest on annuities as

well as on riskless capital;              in addition, the consumer receives a social

security benefit, S.             Total available resources are allocated to

consumption,   x1,       and to the bequest,                so that

      BS       [I   ÷    -   r    -
                                      c   AtR    +   AtQ + S
                                                               -
                                                                   x1   (29b)

      The young consumer's consumption and portfolio decisions can be

solved by substituting (29a,b) into (28) and then differentiating with

respect to    c,             and A,.      The solution to this problem is presented

in Abel [2]        The discussion below focusses on a few interesting

implications of optimal behavior.

      Optimal behavior implies that the consumer would be indifferent

between investing an additional dollar in riskless capital or in

annuities)-3        An additional dollar invested in annuities would be worth

Q dollars in the following period if the consumer survives.                     This

additional wealth could be used to increase the bequest                 B3 by    Q units,

thereby increasing expected utility by (l-p)Q H'(B5t).                  Alternatively, an


13   If the consumer faces a binding constraint on the holding of
riskiess capital or annuities (such as a nonnegativity constraint), then
he would not in general be indifferent about whether to invest an
additional dollar in riskless bonds or in annuities. For this particular
optimization problem, the consumer will choose to hold positive amounts
of both riskiess bonds and annuities provided that H' (b) approaches
infinity as b approaches zero; thus, any nonnegativity constraints on the
holdings of capital or annuities would not be binding.
extra dollar invested in riskless        capital would be worth R dollars in the

following     period regardless of whether the consumerdies         or   survives.    In
either    case,   the consumer could increase the bequest by R dollars,

thereby intreasing expected utility by (l-p)PJ{(B5t)              pRH'(S°)    dollars.

Therefore, the consumer will be indifferent between investing the dollar

in riskless capital      -and   annuities if

             (l-p)Q H(BSt)         (l-p)R H'(B5t) + pR FU(B0t)      (30)

         Recall that if the annuities are actuarially fair,         then (l-p)Q       P.

In this case,      it follows directly fron (30) that    S°   =   Btt,    That is, in

the presence of actuarially- fair annuities, the consumer plans to leave

the same bequest whether he or she lives for one or two periods.               This

result depends on the fact that the marginal utility of a bequest does

not depend on whether the consumer lives for one period or for two

periods.      In particular, the joy-of-giving function     11(b)   does not depend

on   whether the consumer lives for one period or two periods. (The sane
result also holds under an altruistic bequest motive.) The intuition
behind this result is that actuarially fair annuities permit the consumer
to completely insure the consumption basket which consists of c,
B°t, and       The strategy to achieve full insurance is implemented by

holding just enough riskless capital to provide for the desired bequest
and   just   enough   annuities (including the contingent claim      on   the future
social    security benefit 5) to provide for second-period consumption.4

         The introduction of a fully funded social security system has no

effect under a joy-of-giving bequest motive.         The reason, as in the

absence of a bequest motive, and as in the presence of an altruistic


14    See Sheshinski and Weiss [241.
                                                                                31



bequest motive, is that the annuity provided by the social security

system offers exactly the same payoffs as the privately available

annuity.    Therefore, consumers can, and will, choose to fully offset the

effects of social security.

      The effects of pay-as-you-go social security under the joy-of-

giving bequest motive differ quite dramatically from the effects under

a1truism.    The difference is most clear in the case in which all

consumers live for two periods with certainty     (p'-O).   Recall that under

altruism, when the pay-as-you-go social security system is introduced,

old consumers simply bequeath the payment, S, to their children in order

to compensate them for their increased tax of S/C per capita.       However.

under the joy-of-giving bequest motive, it would nbc be optimal for old

consumers to maintain their consumption unchanged while increasing their

bequests by S.   The reason is that the utility from leaving a bequest

depends only on the size of the bequest and not on the utility or

consumption of the heirs.    Thus,   in response to receiving the payment S.

old consumers would increase both their consumption and the bequest they

leave.   Essentially, consumption and bequests are both goods that enter

the consumer's utility function, and, furthermore, these are the only

arguments of the utility function.     Consumption and bequests are each

specified to be normal goods in (28) so that in response to an increase

in income, the consumer optimally increases consumption of both of these

goods.

      The analysis in the paragraph above indicates that for the purpose

of analyzing the Ricardian Equivalence Theorem, it is extremely important

whether the bequest motive is of the altruistic or joy-of-giving variety,
                                                                                   32



The reason is that under altruistic preferences the consumer cares about

the entire stream of his or her family's consumption.        Because the

consumer does not care about the size of bequests per se, he or she is

indifferent among changes in bequest patterns that maintain the initial

Bllocation of consumption.      Thus,    in response to certain lump-sum tax and

transfer policies, the consumer maintains the original path of

consamption simply by rearranging bequests.        However, under the joy-of-

giving bequest motive, the consumer cares directly about the level of

lequests, and therefore does not find it optimal to rearrange bequests

while keeping consumption unchanged.

      eteroeneousMortalit-Probabilities

      Up to   this point   it has been    assumed that all consumers face

identical   mortality   probabilities cx ante.    However, if consumers have

different probabilities of survival, then there are additional channels

through which fiscal policy may operate.         in addition, heterogeneity of

cx ante mortality probabilities raises the possibility of adverse

selection in the   private   annuity market, which has iaportant consequences

for the pricing of annuities and for the efficacy of fiscal policy.

      The implications of heterogeneous ex ante mortality probabilities

are clearest in the absence of a bequest motive so the discussion below

will be confined to this     caseJ5      in the absence of bequest motive, and

in the presence of private annuities, all consumers will choose to hold

their wealth entirely in annuities and hence there will be no bequests or

inheritances.    The major strategic decision in developing a model with

probabilites and a joy-of giving bequest motive are examined in Abel [2]

heterogeneous mortality probabilities is whether to assume that an

individual consumer's probability of dying, p, is known only by that

consumer or whether it is a publicly available bit of information.          The

discussion below begins with the assumption that each consumer's value of

p is known by insurance companies. Next,     the discussion will turn to the

case in which the value of an individual's mortality probability is

priv,ae information,      These two cases are based on Abel      and [fl,

respectively,
         Public Knowledge of Mortality Probabilities:   Suppose that the ex

ante mortality probability of each consumer is known to everyone,

including insurance companies.      Under this assumption, of course,

competitive insurance companies will offer annuities with different rates

of return to consumers with different values of p.      Annuities will be

priced to be actuarially fair to each consumer so that    a   consumer with a

                   of dying young can buy annuities that offer a rate of

         If follows immediately from (31) that consumers with a high

probability of dying young will be able to purchase annuities with a high

rate of return.     Equivalently, these consumers can buy a given contingent

payoff in the second period more cheaply than could healthier consumers

who have a lower value of p.     However, the expected rate of return on

annuities,              is identical for all consumers and is equal to R.

      Suppose that all consumers have logarithmic preferences as

specified in (3).     Let c(p) denote the consumption of a young consumer

with accidental bequests.       In that case, the source of cross-sectional

variation was accidental bequests;          by reducing savings, social security
reduced accidental bequests and cross-sectional variation,             In the

present model, there are no bequests.          The source of variation, in the

absence of social security, is the difference in marginal propensities to

consume which results from different mortality probabilities.

        In    addition to reducing cross-sectional variation in consumption,

the introduction of fully funded social security reduces the aversge

fe1of consumption of        young consumers.     This reduction in average
consumption      arises because the social security aysten transfers resourres

from   consumers with a high marginal prooensity      to   consume   (high   p

consumers)      to consumers with a
                                  marginal propensity to consume (low p
                                      low

consumers), This result can be derived formally by defining t(Z(p) as
the population average value of some arbitrary function Z(p).16 With
this dafinirion. the average consumption of        young ronsumers     is E(c(p)
where

             E(c(p))    E(a(pflY      E((p*p)a(pflT/(lp*)       (35)
        it    can be shown formally that ENp*.p)a(p))      is negative.

intuitively, the reason is that E((p*p)a(p))         is equal to E(p*-p)E(a(pfl

5
    Cov(p*p,a(p)).     Because E(p*.p) is, by definition, equal to zero,         it

follows that E((p*p)a(p))      is equal to Cov(p*p,a(pfl.        Since pt-p is




16 At a formal level, let f(p) denote the density function of the cx
ante mortality probability p. With this definition, the average cx ante
probability p* is equal to
                                  I
J0 pf(p)dp. Now define E(Z(p))   f0 Z(p)f(p)dp so that E(Z(pfl is the
average value of Z(p).
                                                                                 37



decreasing in p and a(p) is increasing in p, this covariance is negative.

Therefore,

              E((p*p)a(p))   <   0                           (36)

        The inequality in (36) implies that the coefficient of T in (35) is

negative.    Therefore, as argued above, an increase in T leads to a

reduction in average consumption of young consumers

      Private Information and Adverse Selection: Now suppose that there

is heterogeneity of cx ante mOrtalIty probabilicies      and that indi:idual

                                                     More specifically,
mortality probabilities are private information

suppose that each individual consumer knows nis or her own     e ante
                                                                value of
mortality probability, but that no one else knows that person's

p.   However, the distribution of cx ante morrvli:y probabilities in the

population is public knowledge.      This informa'ion structure gives rise to

a classic adverse selection problem       In the case of annuities, the high

risk consumers from the viewpont of insurance crspanies are those

consumers with a low mortality probability p.      These consumers will

demand more annuities tian the consumers with     hto   mortality

                                                          receive annuity
probabilities and they will be more likely to survive and

payments.

        In general, the equilibrium in the presence of adverse selection is

either a pooling equilibrium     in which consumers do not reveal thear

private information, or a separating equilibrium in which the optimal

behavior of consumers reveals their private information        To simplify the

                                                                       be
determination of the market equilibrium, an additional assumption will

made.    In particular, assume that an insurance company cannot determine

whether any given consumer has purchased annuities from other insurance
                                                                                                  38



companies.    The foroe of this assumption ia to rule out separating

aquilibria in which consumers with different mortality risks face

different rates of return on annuities. If insurance companiea tried to

charge higher prices (i.e., offer lower rates of return) to consumera

with low p, then these consumers would masquerade aa high                    p   consumers and

would buy only a small amount of annuities at a given inaurance company.

Than these consumers would aatisfy their relatively large demand for

annuities by purchasing additional annuities from one or more other

companies,    Therefore, an insurance company's attempt to separate its

customers by offering different quantities of annuities at different

prices would fail.     Insteed, the market would be characterized by ooe

rate of return that is offered on all annuities.                      Because of adverse

selection, this rate of return would have to be lower than R/(l-p*),

which is the actuarially fair rate based on population average mortslity.

         In the absence of a bequest motive the demand for annuities by s

consumer will be equal to the consumer's savings, which is equal to
firstperiod income, Y - T, minus consumption in the first period. Let

A(p;Q) denote the amount of annuity demanded by a young consumer with a
mortality probability    p when the rate of return on annuities is                  C).   Using

the consumption function in (21), it follows that

          A(p;Q)       [1-a(p)]   fY   -
                                           TJ       -
                                                          a(p)S/Q            (37)

         Equation (37) implies that in the absence of social security (S                      T

  0),    the demand for annuities is invariant to the rate of return they

offer,    This invariance is a consequence of the offsetting income and

substitution effects associated with logarithmic utility.                      Now recall

that a'(p)   >   0 which implies that 1         -
                                                        a(p)   is a decreasing function of p.
                                                                                                            39



Thus, if Y     -
                   T     -
                              S/Q >       0, then the demand for annuities is a decreasing

function of p.

      The equilibrium rare of return on annuities is such that the

expected profit of insurance companies is equal to zero,                            Insurance

 (40) is a decreasing function of Q.                  Therefore,   the expected profit of

the annuity industry is strictly decreasing in the rate of return offered

on annuities,        In addition, note that if the rate of return on annuities

is actuarially fair based on the population average probability p*, i.e.

if Q      R/(lp*),     then the first term on the right hand side of (40) would

be equal to zero,        In this case, r/Y would equal E((p*p)a(p)}Q which is

negative.        Therefore, any rate of return on annuities greater than or

equal to R/(lp*) would lead to expected losses for the annuity industry

and could not an equilibrium.

         The equilibrium rate of return of annuities must yield zero

axoected profits on annuities.                   In this case, with logarithmic utility.

and in the absence of social security, this rate of return is unique.

Setting the axpected profit,              ir,    equal to zero in (38) yields

             Q      A E(l-a(p)) /         E((l-p)(la(p)))                  (41)

         Thllj Funded Social         Securim          Now consider the effects of

;rtvoducing      fully' funded social security.            Although   social security has
tha   payoff characteristics of an annuity, there is an important

difference between social security and the annuities available in the

private market,       Because the social security system focces all young

consumers to "purchase" equal amounts of the annuity it provides, the

social security system is immune to adverse selection.                    The rate of

return implicit in social security, S/T, is equal to R/(l-p*) as in (33).

       To calculate the effect of social security on the national capital

stock, substitute the relation between the social security parameters S

and T in (33) into the annuity demand function (37) to obtain

         -   [l-a(p)]Y       T
A(p;Q)                   -       -

       Recall   mat     as a consequence of adverse selection, R           -

Thetefore, equatcon (42) indicates ttat the introduction of fully funded

social security reduces the deaand for annuities by uore than T,                     hence,

the private capital stock falls by more than T.                 The demand for annuitiec

would decrease by precisely                 ifQwore   equal to R/(l-p*).       However,

because social security provides an annuity with a larger payoff than is

available on private annuities, the introduction of social sectrity

expands the opportunity set of all consumers and hence induces all

consumers to increase their runs uctrion when souno,                This increae in

consumption means that the private capital stock falls by rora than T.

Therefore the national capital atock, whrch is equal to the private

capital stock plus T, suco declineat/

       In order to determine effects or social terurity on the equilibrium

rate of return on private annuities first ralculate the change in the
structure of the demand for priucte annuities. Differentiating the
annuity   demand function in (42) with respect              tol    and evaluating the

increasing function of p.           rnerefore, consumers with a hign value of p

reduce their demand for annuIties by a greater umounc rust consumers with

a low value of p.       Since consumers with          a   high value ol p began with a

lower annuity demand than low p consumers, it is clear that the high p

consumers reduce their demand for annuitiea by a larger fraction than do

17 This reduction in the private capital stock depends on the abaence of
a bequeat motive, If there is a sufficiently strong joy-of-giving
bequest motive, then the national capital stock may increase in response
to the introduction of fully funded social security. See Abel [2].

       in concluding the discussion of armuity markets, it is useful to

examine the quantitative effect of adverse selection in private annuity

rarkeAs.     Friedman and Warshawaky ill] and Warshawaky [25[ have analyzed

annuity prices and the mortality experiences of annuity purchasers in. the
United States. They found that annuity purchasers tend to live longer
than the a:ierage American as tabulated in the U.S. Life. Tables. To get a
aeaanre of how nuch longer annuity purchasers live, they calculate load
factors -     gross load factor is defined as the ratio of the price paid
             The

for an annuity to the expected present value of the payments accruing to
an annuity purchaser;  the net load factor i.s equal to the gross load
faoto-z ?oinus one. These load factors are calculated under two different

assumptions about mortality: in one calculation, the mortality
p-rohab-iiities are taken from the U.S. Life Tables and in the other
calculation, the mortality probabilities are calibrated to match the
'oortelitv experience of annuity purchasers. Not surprisingly, they found
that the expected present value of payments using annuity purchasers'

mortality is greater than the expected present value of payments using

the L'S. Life Table.        Therefore, the load factor based on annuity

ourchasers' mortality is less than the load factor based on the U.S. Life

Table.      Very roughly, the average net load factor based on the    US. Life

Tahie was around 30 cents on the dollar; the average net load factor

based on the mortality of annuity purchasers was about 15 cents on the
dollar.    The difference   in load factors,   15   cents on the   dollar   was

attributed    to adverse   salection8   However, the extent to which the

difference in mortality probabilities was private information or public

information could not be determined from these studies.

         Although the load factors reported in these studies are

substantial, they do not appear to be large enough to explain the

widepread shunning of annuity markets by private consumers, Friedman

and Warshawsky    ll]   attribute a   boat   pact of the reluctance of

consumers to buy annuities to a bsqieat motive, out unanswered questions

remain,    For example, to what 0x'tnt do corsumers nold bequeathaoie

wealth rather than level-payment annuities as a precaution against the

need to make very large medical expenditures?          Perhaps this risk of

catastrophic medical expenditure explains the fact that retired consumers

decumulate their wealth much yore alowy than predicted by the life-cycle

model.     Clearly more research iito these ciaks and consumers' reactions

to these risks is needed

presence of longevity risk has examined several different sets of

assumptions about bequest nocives, the type of fiscal policy and the

availability and pricing of snnuities Rather than summarise all of

these cases, a few of the major themes will be highlighted.            The insight

of the Ricardian Equivalence Theorem is that fiscal policy will affect


18 Moce precisely, Friedman and Warshswsky [11 examine data for the
period 1968-1983 and find load factors of 32-48 cents on the dollar using
the 1,1,8. Life Tables; they find load factors of 18-33 cents on the dollar
sfter allowing for adverse selection. Warshawsky [25 examines data from
the period 1919-1984 and finds load factors of 10-29 cents on the dollar
using the U.S. Life Tables. He attributes 8 to 16 cents on the dollar of
these load factors to adverse sslection.

private economic activity only if it changes the opportunities available

to individuals,      Such changes in opportunities could take the form of

changes in relative prices     c-c   changes   in-   the present value of resources.

      In applying the insight of the kicardian Equivalence Theorem to

social   security,   it is useful to think of social security as an annuity
because consumers pay someth-ing when they are young in exchange for
somgthing that they will receive only if they sunive, Clearly, if there
is no market in which consumers can buy annuities then the introduction
of social security changes consumers' opportunity sets by providing on
sonuity.                the introduction of social security affect rho
            Not only does

roving decisions of consumers who receive no ir-herirantes, it also
reduces the itheritamces of those people who do receive them.
Alternatively, if there is a private market for annuities, then the
Introduction of social security will have an effect only if the annuity
provided   bysocial secu.rity offers different terms than those offered by
rsvstery traded annuities. If consumers have identical mortality
probabilities and if the rate of return on private annuities is
actoerially fair,    then fully funded social security offers the same rate

of roturn as private annuities and thus has no effect,             This invariance

of economic behavior to the introduction of fully funded social security

holds regardless of whether consumers have a bequest motive or not and

holds regardless of the form of the bequest motive,

      There are several reasons why the rate of return on social security

may differ from the rate of return on private annuities.             First, pay-as-

you-go social security offers an expected rate of return equal to the

copulation growth rate rather than the rate of return on capital.             Thus,
in general, pay-as-you-go social security offers a different rate of

return from the rate of return in competitive annuity markets.           Second,

if consumers have different mortality probabilities and if individual

consumers possess private information about their own mortality

probabilities, then the private annuity market will be subject to adverse

selection which drives down the rate of return on annuities.           In this

case, -fully funded social security would offer a higner rate of return

than private annuities.     Third, even if each individual consumer's

mortality probability is publicly known, then socia security will Lava

an effect if the government decides not to discriminate on the basis of

mortality probabilities.     In this case,      the government offers the same

taxes and benefits to   a    consumers, but ic the      pr atS   market consumers

face different prices for a given level of second-period benefits.

Therefore, for at   leat   sorru   consumera    social secnrity will offer a

different rate of return ciun pcivte annuities.

      It might seem that if        me   rate of return on cociat security is

different from the rate of return on pcivateiy araiab_e annuities, then

the introduction of social securit' aouid cave an effect on private

saving decisions.   This presumption is indeed true if consumers do not

have bequest motives or if they I-ave joy-of-giving bequest motives

However, if consumers have altruistic bequest motires, then it may be

that social security has no effect even though it offets a rate of return

that differs from che rate on any privately traded asset.          For instance,

in the absence of longevity risk,         fully-funded social securaty would have

no effect even though the rate of return on social security differs from

the rate of return on capital.          However, in the presence of longevity
                                                                                46



risk,   the Ricardian Equivalence Theorem could fail to hold even under

altruism



                                III,   Income Risk

        In the previous sections of this   paper,    the risks have been

confined to uncertainty about the length of an individual's lifetime.

The market for life insurance and annuities allows consumers to reduce

the affects of these risks and, as discussed above, the functioning of

these   markets has important implications for the effects of fiscal
toiicv. This section will ignore longevity risk and focus instead on me
risk associated with an individual's future labor income. Future labor
income is risky for two reasons, First, there is a chance that a
consumer   will not be able to work as a result of an accident or illness.

fecond, even if the consumer is able to work,        future income will

            as   a result cf fluctuations in productivity or in the demand
oc ass or her  services, Because disability insurance is available to
reduce, or even eliminate, the first of these sources of income risk, the
discussion will     ignore this source of risk, focussing instead on the

second source of income risk.

        At first glance,   it appears that there is no insurance available tc

reduce the risk associated with fluctutations in productivity or in

demand,    Although there is no active insurance market to reduce the

riskiness of a future income stream, the income tax system provides a

form of income insurance,      If the income tax rate is constant, say at

27%, then the government essentially shares 27% of the risks associated

with fluctuations in labor income.      Not only does the income tax provide
                                                                                                    47



risk reduction as would more conventional types of insurance, it is also

subject to the problem of moral hazard,                   as discussions of the Lsffer

Curve have made clear,           More precisely, while the income tax provides

some insurance against fluctuations in labor income,                     it also provides a

disincentive to       wor,c;    the Leffer Curve is based on the possibilsry that

a tax rate increase will reduce work effort to such am extent that intone

taxrevenue would decline.                 In order to isolate the risk-reducIng effects

of   the income tax, and to fooss or precautionary saving the analysis
will be based    the sssumpt400. ma labor supply Is perfecci" mnelssrcc.

         Now consider a young consumer's saving derision.                     When making    this

unit in period 1 and inoreasing savings by one unit.                             If Cl is increased

by one unit,             then the consumer's utility increases by                u'(c1
Alternatively, if the oonsumer saves an additional unit,                            then seccnd

         Equation (48), which displays Robert                     Hall's   [l5    famous random walk

theory      of consumption, indicates that                 the expectation       of future
ronaumption          is    equal to current consumption.            Equivalently, oonsumptioc-
follows a random walk, The reason is that, with concave                            utility,
consumers attempt             to mitigate fluctuations in consumption over time,                        in
response to an increase in                 income,    a consumer increases both current


consumption and planned future consumption.                         In the case with quadratic

utility and equal rates of interest and time preference (both are zero in

this particular case), it turns out the intreases in c1 and the expected

value of c2 are exactly equal.         Under a more general utility function,

consumption does not follow a random walk exactly, but the marginal

utility of consumption does follow a random walk as in (46)

      The optimal level of c1 under quadratic utility can be determined

                                                                condition

      The consumption function in (49) displays rUe permanent income/life

cycle theory of consumption.         It satea that conaumprion Ia a function of

the expected preaent value of lifetime income, net of taxes.               In this

parricular example, it is optimal to consume one half

lifetime income in the firat period              The consumption function in (49)

also illustrates the certainty equivalence principle. More generally,

the certainty equivalence principle applies to optimization problems with

a quadratic objective funcrion and linear constraints with additive


uncertainty.      It states that optimal decision :ules depend on the

momenta of the distributions of the random variablea.             In particular, the

variance of the random variables is irrelevant and may as well be assumed

If there were actuarially fair insurance against the risks associated
with second-period income, the consumer would buy it. However, the

consumer    would choose the same level of 01 regardless of whether or rot

such insurance is available, In terms of the specification of the

         The consumption function in (52) displays precautionary saving.

Consumption in the first period                       s a linear and decreasing function of


the variance of second-period after-tax income.                             Therefore, saving is a

linear and increasing function of the variance of future after-tax

income.

         C.        Fiscal Policy

         The simple consumption function in (52), which displays

precautionary saving, can be used to examine the interaction of
                                                                           In particular, this

more general utility function by Louis Chan                           6I     In this particular

model, as in Chan's model, income is exogenous so that the incentive

effects of taxes on labor effort will be ignored.                               By treating income as

                                                           the income
exogenous, this model focusses on the insurance aspects of

tax,

          Suppose that the second-period tax consists of a head tax,                             t,   plus

a proportional income tax, at rate r                       (0 <   r   <   1), so that


               t2
                        —      t     +    y2                                              (53)
                                                                                                          52



and after-tax income is given by

              y2
                   -
                       t2 — (1      -
                                        r)y2     t*                               (54)

         Now consider an increase in the income tax                      rater   accompanied oy a

reduction in the head tax t* that leaves the expected second-period tax

payment, E(t2), unchanged.                 Because the axpected tax payment is held

fixed, this change in tax structure leaves E(y2                      -
                                                                         t2}   unchanged.

However, the increase in r reduces the variance of after-tax income,

var(y2
          -
              t2), which       is equal to (l-r)2var{y2}.            l.t   follows immediately

from (52) that this reduction in the variance of after-tax income indcces

an increase in first-period consumption.                     Thus,   uhen the income insurance

associated with the income tax is increased, there is a decline in

crecautionary saving ,Note, in addition, that this increase in the
income tax rate,            compensated by a decrease in the heed tax, leads to an

increase in expected utility.

        The    next step      in the analysis ci fiscal policy is to                   examine

agredate income and to specify the relation between individual- income
and aggregate income.               Let   £2   denote the   fevel of aggregate income per
capita   in the second-period,                 Suppose that individual income, y2, is

           y2           2       a                                                 (55)

where a represents the idiosyncratic random component of income and E(e)

  E(e              0.   These assumptions imply that the idiosyncratic component,

a, is uncorrelated with aggregate income Y2.

        In examining various tax and transfer policies, one must make sure

that the policy changes satisfy the government's budget constraint.                                F-or



simplicity, suppose that all consumers pay the same tax. t1, in period 1

and that all consumers pay the same head tax, t*,                        in   period     2.   Second-
period tax bills will differ across consumers to the extent that their

second-period incomes differ                     The government budget constraint states

that total tax revenues over the two periods must equal total government

spending over the two periods.                        Letting g denote the total value of

government spending, the government's budget constraint is

                 +    t*       ÷    rY2           g                                    (56)

     -The lifetime tax liability of an individual may be calculated by

adding r e to both aides of (56), and using the fact that y2                                   Y2 + e    to


obtain

         Obsenie that the left hand side of (57) is equal to t1                                t2.
Therefore,      equation (57), along with (55), can be used to rewrite the

first-order condition (51) as

         exp[-kc1]

           E(expHk(y1 +

         To calculate the expectation on the right hand side of (58). the

distributions of the random variables Y2 and e must be specified.                                    :t has

already been assumed that a has a mean equal to zero and that                                    and e

are uncorrelated.              ln addition, assume that                       and e are each normally

distributed.         Under this assumption, the expectation on the rig'nt hand

side of (58) can be calculated.                           Simplifying this expression yields

         The consumption function in (59) embodies both the optimizatior. of

the individual consumer as well as the government's budget constraint.

It can    be    used to examine the effects of various fiscal policies                               Note
                                                                                        54


that the government's budget constraint involves four policy variables:

the first period tax     the second-period head tax t*, the second-period
                     t1,

income tax rate a, and the total value of government expenditure, g.

However, only two of these four variables, namely g and a, enter the

consumption function in (59).              Thus, consumption in the first-period does

not directly depend on the first-period tax, t1, nor on the second-period

heocttax t*, Thia obsenation immediately auggeata a policy change for
which the Ricsrdian Equivalence Theorem applies   Consider a one do] lar
incrosse in the first-period tax, t1, accompanied by a decrease in rho
asrond-period head tax cc, This rhange satisfies the government budgor
constraint,     It
                is clear from (59), that since neither of these tax
parameters enters the consumption function, this temporary tax increase
has no effect on consumption.
      Next, consider a tax change for which the Ricardian Equivalence
Ihooter, does not apply. In particular, consider an increase in the firs:
Period tax ci that     is    accompanied by an
                                        appropriate decrease in the
recrnd-period income tax rate a, as determined by the government budget
conscrsint, In examining the effacts of this tax policy, it is useful to
focus   on two special cases of the rsndor: processes for income.          First,

oonsider the case in which there is no uncertainty about future aggregate

income Y7.    In this case, which corresponds to the case considered by

Bsrsky, Msnkiw and Zeldes [5], the consumption function in (59) can be

written as

              [y1    E(Y2)
                             -
                                 g   -

        It follows immediately from (60) chat the increase in
                                                              ci and the
accompanying decrease in a will reduce first-period consumption, provided
that Vat           0,   The reason for this reduction in consumption is that

the reduction in the future tax rate r               implies   that the government will

be sharing a smaller fraction of the idiosyncratic income risk.                          As a

consequence, the consumer will face a greater income risk and thus will

increase precautionary saving.

        Alternatively, consider the case in which aggregate income                          is


unc?rtain but there is no idiosyncratic risk (i.e.                     varte}      0.     In this

case, the consumption function in '59) can be written as

               =    y1    + E{Y2    -
                                        g   -
                                                (l/2)kVar{Y2)/2             (El)

        In the absence of idiosyncratic income risk                   none of the three tax

parameters enters the consumption function in (61),                     Therefore, an

increase in t1 accompanied by an approprate decrease in r has                      rio   effect

on consumption.         Thus,   the Ricardian Equivalence Theorem applies in this

case.     The reason is that       even though there is uncertainty about future

aggregate income and about the tax rate on future income,                       there is no

uncertainty about the future tax liability of any consumer.                        Each

consumer pays an extra dollar in taxes in period                 1.     Therefc.re, the

aggregate tax revenue in period 2 must be reduced by one dollar per

capita.     Because the idiosyncratic component of income has been assumed

to be identically zero, each consumer knows with certainty that his or

her second-period tax bill will be equal to the aggregate per capita tax

bill,     Since the aggregate per capita tax bill will fall by one dollar,

each consumer knows with certainty that his or her future taxes will fall

by one dollar, exactly offsetting the one dollar increase in period 1

taxes.     Therefore, there is no change in the optimal level of first-

period consumption.

       The   effect of   changes in the tax rate        r   have dramatically different

effects depending on whether the uncertainty associated with second

period income is idiosyncratic or is common to all consumers.                     If the

second period income risk is idiosyncratic, then an income tax allows

consumers    to share   risks with other, Therefore, a reduction in the
                                      each
income tax rate would reduce the extent of insurance and would lead to

inopeased precautionary saving.            By   contrast,   if   there is   no

idiosyncratic component to second period income risk, then individual
consno,ers cannot reduce their risks by abating with other consumers  In
this case, the incone tax does not provide any insurance and the
Ricsrdian Equivalence Theoreo holds, Although aggregate risks cannot be
shored across members of a generation, it is possible that aggregate
risks could be shared across generation. Intergenerational risk sharing
is examined in the next section.


                         Intergenerational gisk Sharing
                         IV.

      Virtually all of the risks diacusaod in previous sections are
within-generational risks in the sense that different members of the                       same

generation obtain different realizations of a random variable.                     Except
icc problems of adverse selection and moral hazard, these risks could be
potcntially    shared among members of the same cohort,               By contrast, this

section   will focus     on    risks that cannot be abated        among members    of the
same   cohort because     all    members   of a given cohort face the same risk cx
post as well as ax ante. To be more specific, this section will examine
income shocks    that strike all      members     of a cohort to exactly the        same
degree.    If there is to be any risk sharing, it must be done by sharing

risks among two or more generations.

      Intergenerational risk-sharing has been studied by Roger Gordon and

Hal Varian 114]; the discussion below draws heavily on their analysis and

extends their model to allow for population growth.            Consider an econony

with overlapping generations of consumers, each of whom lives for two

perio4a.    Each generation is C times as large as the generation that

preceded it.    A consumer who is born in period t receives a perfectly

storable deterministic endowment       w   in period r and receives a random

endowment   el   in period t÷l.       Suppose that er+l has a mean of rero and

is identically and independently distributed across generations.             For


simplicity, conaumption is confined to the second period of life.            Let


c+1   denote the consumption in period t+l of a consumer born in period t

The realized value of the consumer's utslity in period t+l is            u(c÷1,
where the utility function u(     ;    is sr'ictiy increasing and strictly

concave.

       All members of generation c         face   the sane wat:e of the random

variable e+1.     Therefore, there is no scope for within-generation risk-

sharing.    Also, because adjacent generations are simultaneously alive for

only one period, there is no scope for private markets to share risks

across memhera of adjacent generations. rherefore, if there is to be

intergenerational risk sharing, then a long-lived institution, aurh as a

government, must be involved.

       Consider the following scheme to share risks.            Suppose that the

government levies a tax of r               (where 0     r   I) on each old consumer
                                  e+i
in period t+l. and uses the proceeds of the tax to give a subsidy of r
                                                                                                      58

                                                       ta-I,                     e÷1
negative, then old consumers receive an unlucky realization of income and

the tax levied on old consumers is negative.                    Thus, if           is negative,
                                                                           e÷1
the tax aystem transfers resources from the young consumers to the old

consumers.      In. the presence of this tax           system,    the consumption of an old

consumer      in period t±l is

Thus,   this tax   scheme     spreads the risk associated with the random
endowment     across   two   adjacent generations.

        Now   consider the value of         the tax rate       a that maximizes     the   ox   ante
utility                           t
         of a generation consumer, Ecu(ct÷1)), where the expectation is
calculata-d at the beginning of the consumer's life, prior to observing
the realization of the random variable e5. This is the tax rate that a
0000u.uer would choose if he had no knowledge of the particular
realirstions ci random income that would occur during his lifetime.                            The

 soulstion of the optimal value of a is simplified by using (62) to
observe that the expectation of consumption, E(c_+1), is invariant to the
tax rate a (because E(c,
                      eta     w),  Thus, because the utility function u()

is concave, the optimal tax rate is the rate that minimizes the
unconditional variance           of consumption.       It follows immediately from (62)

that   the unconditional variance of consumption is

respect to a and setting the derivative equal to sero to obtain2

         Observe from (64) that in the absence of population growth,                               i.e.

with C —          1,   the optimal value of r is equal to 1/2,               In this case,

optimal risk spreading across pairs of adjacent generations involves eacn

generation having a 50% stake in each of the cwo drawings of e that take

place while that generation is alive,                          More generally, with G >       1,   the

optma1 value of               r is greater than 1/2.             Substituting the optimal value

of r from (64) into the expression for consumption (62) yields

         If C is greater than one, then the coefficients on                         e   and          are

each less than 1/2.                   Thus,    in the presence of population growch,          it is

possible for generation t                     to   have lass chan a 50% stake in the risk

associated with              e and et+i.            Each old consumer lays off more than half

of the old-age income risk on rhe younger generation.                          However, because

the younger generation has more people than the older generation                               it can

absorb this increased risk with an increase in risk per person chat is

smaller than the reduction in risk per old :onsuiner.

         B.       Time Consistency

       The optimal intergenerational fiscal insurance system presented

above was derived under the assumption that this system will remain in

force.        However, it may turn out that some cohorts may not want to

participate            in the fiscal risk-sharing arrangement.              Whet,   a generation is
old   and receives a positive value of et+l, this generacion would like to

sever its participation.                      This type of desire to pull out of a system

will not be considered here.                        If these old consumers had, when they were

generations. Gordon and Varian [14] show that sharing the risk across
more generations leads to even higher ex ante utility.
                                                                                        66



young, voluntarily decided to participate in the risk-sharing

arrangement,    then they will not he allowed to renege on their implied

contract just because they received a positive value of e,1.

       The interesting question concerning the viability of the fiscal

insurance system is whether young consumers in period t will, after

                               choose to participate in this system.         The
learning the value of     e,
reaon   they may choose not to participate is that if          e    is negative, they


are required to make a net transfer to old consumers,              If the value of

the risk reduction provided by th,e fiscal insurance system is less then
the value of the required transfer, then these young consumers will
choose not to participate. However, if the valua of the risk reduction
exceeds the    value of the required transfer, then young consumers would

choose to participate in the fiscal insurance system,ZP

       Gordon and Varian [14) argue that young consumers in period c vill

refuse cc participate in the fiscal insurance system whenever at <             0.

Their modal assumes a constant population size so, for the moment,

suppose that G      I.   To keep the argument simple, suppose that e, is a

drawing from a finite set and let          e   < 0 be the minimum possible value of

a,    First, suppose that at         -a,   In this case,   each young consumer is

required to pay    /2    in taxes.     If in the following period,     ecu    in,

then each generation t consumer would receive a fiscal subsidy of ,/2 end



22   This analysis assumes that if a generation decides not to
participate in the fiscal insurance system when it is young, then it is
precluded from receiving panenta from a fiscal insurance system when it
is old. Otherwise, if young consumers bedreved that the choice of
whether or not to participate in the fiscal system when young would have
no effect on whether they would receive payments when they were old, then
young consumers would never choose to pay the fiscal insurance tax.
thus would have consumption equal to        w   -
                                                    ,    which is the same that

consumption would have been without participating in the fiscal system.

However, if in the following period,        e+i     >    -, then     the consumer will

either receive a fiscal subsidy less than           J2     or will pay a tax.    Thus,

the consumer will end up having paid more into the system than he or she

got out of it.   Therefore, the best that the young consumer can hope for

is to-break even by participating in the system, and, in general, the

consumer will be worse off cx post.         Clearly, such a consumer will choose

not to participate in the system in this case,

       The argument above establishes that if             e     -a, then the generation

t consumers will not participate in the fiscal insurance system.                 Now

suppose that there is some value e*          - such        that the generation t

consumer will choose to participate in the system if and only if e > e*.

It is now straightforward to demonstrate, by contradiction, that e*

cannot be negative.      Suppose that   e       e* < 0.       In this situation a young

generation t consumer is required to pay            e*j/2,      ut   how much will the

consumer receive in the following period?                If         < e*, then the
                                                              e+l
generation t÷l consumers will not join the system, and hence the

generation t consumer will receive nothing from the fiscal insurance

system.   If et+l   >   e*, then the generation t consumer will either receive

a subsidy smaller than Ie*I/2 or will pay a taK.                In either of these

situations, the consumer is worse off for having participated in the

fiscal insurance system.      Only if   e1      —   e*   will the generation t

consumer end up as well off under the fiscal insurance system as without

it.   Thus, as above, the consumer cannot possibly be made better off by
                                                                                       62



joining the fiscal insurance system and will, in general, he made worse

off.   Therefore, he or she will not join.        Thus, e* cannot be negative.

       Gordon and Varian discuss mechanisms that would avoid the repeal of

the intergenerational fiscal- ins'rance system.        For example, if large

enough costs are imposed on any young cohort that tries to repeal tha

fiscal insurance system, then no generation will ever repeal the system,

and,i     equilibrium the costs will not have to be borne,           For example, if

the abandonment of the fiscal insurance system leads to economic or

social upheaval, then the young generation may decide that the costs

axceed any pecuniary gains from avoiding partiripation in the fiscal

!nsurance system.

       In addition to the mechanisms discussed by Gordon and Varian for

sustaining a fiscal insurance system,      there is the possibility that

population growth can sustain the system.         If all generations have the

same nuoher of consumers, then the size of the maximum transfer paid by a

       consumer   is   equal to the size of the   maximum    transfer that this
consumer could    possibly receive when old, Therefore, as argued above.
when a young consumer is required to make         the maximum possible transfec,

the consumer cannot possibly expect to benefit from participating in the

fiscal insurance system.      However, if each generation is G times as large

as the preceding generation, then the largest transfer that can be

received by an old consumer is G times as large as the largest transfer

that a young consumer could be required to make,            Thus,   even if a young

consumer had to pay the largest possible transfer, it is still possible

that the consumer could receive an even larger transfer in the following

period.    Depending on the consumer's attitude toward risk, it may turn
out that even faced with the largest required payment when young, the

consumer would choose to participate in the fiscal insurance system.

         To demonstrate that population growth may be able to sustain

voluntary participation in the fiscal insurance system, it may be clearer

to use a numerical example than an algebraic proof.                   Suppose chat each

generation is twice as large as the generation preceding it, i.e.                        ,   0       2.

In    t,his case,   it follows from (64) that an optimal fiscal insurance

system will set r       equal     to 4/5.       Substituting C    2 and r        4/5    into the

equation for consumption (62) yields

                      w   + 0.4    e.,    0.2   et÷1                        (66)

         The value of consumption in (66) is based on the assumption that

the fiscal insurance system remains intact,                  As an example, suppose that

w      11 and that there are only three possible values for                 e:   -10, 0, and

10.     Assume that e       -10 and e           10 are equally probable and let q < 1/2

denote this common probability.                 Therefore, the probability that e                0   i
l-2q.     Thus, since consumption, c+i, depends on               e   and e±i,         there are

nine possible value of        c          which are displayed in Table       1.     Eaco row

corresponds to a value of           e and each column corresponds to a value ci
e+l.
         Consider a young consumer in period t and suppose that et                           -10, cc

that this young consumer is faced with paying the largest possible

transfer.      To determine whether this consumer will choose cc participate

in the fiscal system, the values of consumption in the first row of Table

1 must be compared with the values of                  c1   if the consumer does not

participate in the system.               These values are shown in Table         2.
                                                                                              64



          Comparing the values of consumption in the first row of Table 1

with the values of consumption in Table 2, it is clear that neither row

dominates the other in a stochastic dominance sense.                  By participating in

the fiscal insurance system,        the consumer reduces the variance of

consumption from 200q to      Sq   at the cost of reducing the expected value of

consumption from 11 to 7.         Whether a consumer views the reduction in risk

as sgoath the price depends on his or her attitude toward risk and on the

value of q.       Clearly the more aversion the consumer has to risk               the note

attractive is the fiscal insurance system.

          Suppose that the utility function is u(c)               l000exp[-kc]    whero k

is the coefficient of absolute risk aversion.                Assume that q       0.25.   ii

k     I, then the expected utility if the consumer participates in the

fiscal insurance system is -2,17;          the expected utility if the consumer

does not participate in the aystem is          -   91.97.    Thus, the system will ho

sustained    by   voluntary participation is this case.
          In the example above,    all   generations voluntarily choose to
rarticipate in the fiscal insurance.          Secause       all   generations obtain
higher    utility   with the introduction of the fiscal insurance system, such
a   system is Pareto-improving.       In this particular example, the net rate

of return on savings is zero, so that using the notation from section II,

R    1.    Therefore, in this example, R      <    C so that Golden Rule

consideratioms indicate that a Pareto-improvement could be achieved by

increasing consumption and reducing saving.             The determination of the

optimal fiscal system, which might include both an element of

intergenerational risk sharing and an element of lump-sum
                                                                             6

 intergenerational transfers to stimulate consumption, remains an open

 question for research.



                             V.   Concluding Remarks
       This paper has analyzed the effects of various fiscal
                                                             policies in
 situations in which individual consumers face various sorts of risks.

 Metoologically,    the research presented in this
                                                   paper is quite
 neoclassical    Although the models employed in this paper are very much

 in the spirit of those embraced by the so-called new classical school of

macroeconomics, the results differ quite dramatically from some of the

most well-known new classical results.     In particular, the Ricarian

Equivalence Theorem, which essentially states that lump-sum tax policies

have no effect    is an important result that pervades much of the new

classical literature.     The results reported in this paper often deviate

importantly   from the RLcardian Equivalence Theorem. The departures from
the Ricardian Equivalence Theorem, and hence the effects of fiscal
policy, depend importantly on the availability and the nature of
insurance   arrangements to protect individual consumers against various

types of risk.    It is perhaps ironic that the traditional Keynesian

model, which emphasizes the effects of fiscal policy, has no place for

insurance arrangements to interact with fiscal policy.    it is in the

neoclassical framework, which is based on the optimizing behavior of

consumers facing risk, that the interattion of insurance and fiscal

policy becomes apparent,    Further research into the nature and evolution

of insurance arrangements will help to extend
                                              understanding of the
effects of fiscal policy.
