          The Potential for Using Excise Taxes to Reduce Smoking


                                  ABSTRACT


        We   examine the potential for reducing cigarette, smoking through in-
creases in   cigarette excise taxes by estimating the price elasticity of demand

for cigarettes. Using information on individual smoking behavior for a sample

of adults in the 1976 Health Interview Survey, we estimate the adult price

elasticity of demand for cigarettes to be - .45.   Moreover, we find that price

has its greatest effect on the smoking behavior of young males and that it

operates primarily on the decision to begin smoking regularly rather than

via adjustments in the quantity of cigarettes smoked by smokers. It follows

that, if future reductions in cigarette smoking are desired, Federal excise

tax policy can be a potent tool to accomplish this goal, but only in the

long run. An exèise tax increase, if'maintatned tn rea' terms, woUld

discourage smoking      participation by successive cohorts of young adults

and those reduced smoking levels would be reflected in aggregate smoking as

these cohorts mature. In the short run however, the impact of an excise tax

increase on aggregate cigarette consumption would be relatively small.

 1.   Introduction

           In the last decade, soaring health care expenditures in the U.S.

have been associated with only small improvements in health levels. As a

result, many health care observers have concluded that the primary potential

for improving health and moderating the growth in health care costs lies in

preventive medicine and in encouraing individuals to alter unhealthy behaviors

(Fuchs, 1974; Look, Moore and Zeckhauser, 1981).
                                                     Cigarette smoking, regarded
for over 25 years as a significant contributor to poor health, is perhaps the

best èxàmole of an unhealthy behavior leading to substantial health care costs.

The direct(health-care)and indirect costs of smoking were estimated to have

been nearly $30 billion in 1976 (Luce and Schweitzer, 1977).

          Public and private sector initiatives to discourage smoking have

included the dissemination of information from the 1964 Surgeon General 's

Report on smoking and health, anti—smoking television advertising tied to

cigarette conuiercials (the Fairness Doctrine), a ban on all cigarette ad-

vertising on radio and television, and the labelling of cigarettes with

warning messages. Warner (1977) presents evidence that these policies may

have had a substantial effect on smoking and estimates that 1975 per capita

cigarette consumption would have been 20 to 30 percent higher in the absence
                                  1

of these anti—smoking policies.       On the other hand, cigarette consumption

per capita,while currently about 10% below the peak established in 1963, has

not declined appreciably in the past decade(U.S. Department of Agriculture, 1981).

IThe effects of these policies are also discussed in Hamilton (1972); Ippolito,
 Murphy and Sant (1979); Klein1 Murphy and Schneider (1981); Lewit, Coate and
 Grossman (l98l);and Warner (1981). Not all of these studies agree on the
 relative importance of different government policies on smoking behavior.
                                                                      2.




          In this paper, we examine the potential for reducing cigarette

smoking through increases in excise taxes, a public policy that could lead

to permanent reductions in smoking. During the past three decades, the

federal excise tax has not been used as a policy tool to discourage smoking

despite the large and growing federal share of health care expenditures and

the large number of studies linking cigarette smoking and poor health.2 In

fact, the federal policy of holding the excise tax constant at eight cents per pack

since 1952 translates into a substantial reduction in the tax in real terms.

There is evidence, however, that state and local governments have used their

cigarette excise taxes to discourage smoking. The considerable anti—smoking

publicity associated with the Surgeon General's Report in 1964 was followed

by 23 state and local tax increases compared with no more than a dozen in any

of the preceding 14 years (Warner, 1977). State and local taxes have continued

to increase over time in many states; however, the ability of state and local

governments to raise their own cigarette taxes is limited because of the presence,

of cigarette bootlegging from low to high tax areas (Intergovernmental Perspective,

l978).


2There have been several attempts to increase the federal excise tax in recent
 years because of concern over the health effects of cigarette smoking (Miller,
 1976).


3me economies of several states depenl importantly nn.the qrowinq of totacco
 and the production of cigarettes. At the state level, thee states maintain
 very low excise taxes. At the federal level, the economic interests of
 these states and the tobacco industry have apparently succeeded in blocking
 any increases in the federal tax since 1952, despite the Surgeon lènerals
 Report in 1964 and the anti-smoking campaign waged by government and voluntary
 groups since then.
                                                                            3.




 2. Previous Estimates of the Price Elasticity of Demand for Cigarettes

              The impact of excise tax changes on cigarette demand depends on

 the extent to which changes in excise taxes are reflected in cigarette

 prices4 and on the responsiveness of cigarette demand to price. The litera-

 ture shows a broad range of cigarette price elasticity estimates. Studies

 completed since 1970 using U.S. data have yielded estimates ranging from - .4

 to —1.3 (Miller (1970); Mann (1971); Padillo (1971); Naniltbn (1972);

Schrabel (1972); Kellner (1973); Miller (1974); Fujii (1980); Klein, Murphy

 and Schneider (1981)), These estimated elasticities are generally high enough

 to suggest that excise taxes rates can have a substantial impact on cigarette

 consumption. For example, Warner (1977) borrows from these findings to attri-

 bute a substantial portion of the decline in cigarette consumption which took

 place between 1963 and 1972 to the significant increase in
                                                              cigarette prices
during the period. There is reason to believe, however, that such conclusions

may not be reliable guides for policy makers with an interest in reducing health

care costs through excise tax induced reductions in cigarette smoking. This

is true for two reasons: 1) the crosssecti6nefJ teàre biased upwards

because cigarette consumption is inaccurately measured; and 2) the time series

estimates are not stable because of the high correlation between cigarette

price, income, and trend variables, and furthermore, reflect a short run

response to changes in price rather than the long run or permanent response

which is of interest to policy makers.



41f cigarette supply is perfectly elastic,excise tax changes will be fully
 reflected in cigarette prices. This would appear to be a reasonable approxi-
 mation for most modest tax changes. In fact, Barzel (1976) presents evidence
 that cigarette prices have risen by more than the amount of state unit tax
 increases.
                                                                            4.




           Cross section studies are generally relied on to provide price

 elasticity estimates because multicollinearity among the independent varia-

 bles is usually less of a problem than in time series estimation and because

 the estimates are considered in most cases to represent the long run or

 complete response of quantity demanded to changes in price. Cross section

 studies of cigarette demand, however, have generally provided elasticity

 estimates that are biased upward in absolute value because the unit of obser-

vation has been the state and the dependent variable has been tax-paid cigarette

sales per capita. For many states, tax-paid sales do not reflect actual con-

sumption. This disparity results from the fact that excise taxes vary sub-

stantially between states while state cigarette markets are not completely dis-

tinct or separable. Therefore, smuggling or bootlegging of cigarettes froni low

tax to high tax states occurs and as a result, tax—paid sales are a biased

measure of consumption. Using sales data causes the elasticity of demand to

be bias?d because in high tax (price) states own consumption is under-

estimated by sales and in low tax (price) states own consumption is overesti-

mated. Thus, the response of cigarette demand to price is exaggerated.

          In this paper, we more accurately measure the price elasticity of

demand for cigarettes than has heretofore been possible by using information

on the actual amount of cigarettes smoked by individuals who face different

cigarette prices. The data set we employ is the recently released 1976

Health Interview Survey (HIS), which contains information on the smoking

behavior of a large sample of individuals in different tax (price) locations.
                                                                                3.




 ifl   addition, the data contains information on an   arrayof   individual

and household characteristics sufficient to allow for the estimation of a

well specified demand relationship.


3. Specification of the Detand for Ciqarettes Ecuation

             In specifying thedenand function that we estimate in this paper,

we assume that the demand fr cigarettes is a linear function of price, income

and taste variables where health and other considerations can enter the rela—

tior.ship via the taste component. Specifically, the ñnictfon is

                 = a   ÷ b P +
                                 cX   + d
                                            R +                               (1)

The dependent variable in the equation car1 tither be the amount smoked by the

th individual in the 5th locality or a dichotomous variable indicating whe-

ther the individual is a smoker. The independent variables include the

 average" price (Ps) of cigarettes in the th locality; a vector (X1) of

individual and household characteristics including family income, family size,

education, age, sex, marital status, health status, and race; a vector (Ri)

of region and city size characteristics; and a random disturbance team

Scrne of the       vcriabies are measures of an individual's command over re-

sources and others are proxies for "taste' variables. Almost all of them

have been shown in previous studies to be related to differences in the pro-

pensity to smoke cigarettes (National Clearing House for Smoking and Health,

1976). The region of residence and size of place of residence variables are

included to partially control for cross—sectional differences in the cost of

living which are not otherwise reflected in our price or income measures.
                                                                                 6.

         We estimate the damand for cigarettes equation over all   individuals
(smokers and non—srokers) as well as over smokers only. implicit in our single
equation approach is the assumption that variation in the supply curves across

sample locations due to differences in excise tax rates identifies the demand

curves we specify.

Average Cigarette Prices

          Differences in state and local cigarette tax rates in the U.S. cite

substantial and account for almost all the variation in the market price of

cigarettes. In 1976, state taxes equalled 24% of the retail price of ciga1

rettes on average and varied from 6% in North Carolina to 43% in Massachusetts.

Because of the state tax differences, the "average" price of cigarettes in

1976 was 57.3t a pack in Massachusetts and 36.6c a pack in North Carolina.

In addition, local taxes can substantially increase cigarette prices in certain

markets. The most notable of these in 1975 were in New York City (8 per pack-

age) and in Chicago (St per package).

          Information on retail cigarette prices, excise tax rates, sales taxes

and a composite cigarette price is available from the Tobacco TarCoUnëiT

(1980). The Council calculates an 'average' retail price per state by taking

a weighted average of reported retail prices plus applicable sales--taxesof:

cigarettes sold by carton lot,by the single pack over-the—counter,and by the

single pack through vending machines. The weights are the national proportions

of cigarettes sold in these ways.5 This composite retail price is the basis




51n all states, the unit price of cigarettes is lowest when they are purchased
 in carton lots while substantial mark ups are associated with purchasing ciga-
 rettes by the single pack. In 1976, 56% of all cigarettes were purchased in
 carton lots while 29% of sales were of over-the-counter single packs and 15%
 single packs in vending machines. Because the price of cigarettes within a
 locality may vary according to the way in which they are purchased, the use
 in a demand equation of the weighted average price variable as a measure of
 the price faced by actual and potential smokers is preferred to using the price
 actually paid by smokers. This is because heavier smokers have a greater in-
 centive to purchase cigarettes cheaply. To the extent that they economize on the
 purchase price of cigarettes, the price paid is a function of the quantity
 demanded and the coefficient of an actual price paid variable in a demand
 equation would be biased due to the reverse causality.

for the price measure used in this study. In order to determine the prevailing

cigarette price for each observation in the HIS, we located each of the 430

 Primary Sampling Units (PSU's) in the HIS on a map.   The composite

cigarette price for each state was assigned to each PSU depending on state

of location. If there was any local cigarette tax applicable to the site,

the local tax rate was added to the composite retail price. When there was

more than one price attributable to a particular PSU, prevailing price was

determined by using population weights of the various geographic components

within the PSU to calculate an average composite price for the PSU.

Cigarette Price Differentials and Bootlegging

          Because of differences in state and local excise taxes on cigarettes,

substantial price differentials exist across geographic boundaries. Since

cigarettes are relatively easy to transport across these boundaries, they are not

infrequently purchased in low tax areas for resale or personal consumption in

high tax areas. This bootlegging activity falls into three categories: 1) large

scale smuggling of truckloads of cigarettes from low tax areas for distribution

through regular retail/wholesale channels in high tax areas; 2) minor smuggling

from low tax areas for resale to friends and acquaintances at a profit but at

less than full retail price in higher tax areas; and 3) the crossing of tax

boundaries by individual consumers to purchase cigarettes at lower prices for

personal consumption.

          Large scale smuggling for resale has become an important law en—

forcement and tax collection problem in certain high tax states. There Is

reason to believe that many cigarettes processed in this manner are sold

through regular distribution channels at prices approximating the fully taxed
                                                                       8.




  retail level (Advisory Commission on
                                          Intergovernmna Re'ations, 1977).
 This is because large scale
                               snuggling requires distribution through a large
 network of retail dealers and the sale of
                                              these cigarettes at substantial
 discounts from fully taxed retail price would greatly facilitate their

 detection by law enforcement officials.6     To the extent that cigarettes smuggled

 on a large scale are sold at fully taxed retail prices, individuals in

a PSU where large scale smuggling exists can still be assumed to pay

 the prevailing retail price for cigarette as reported by the Tobacco Tax

 Council (1980). Accordingly, large scale smuggling should not bias estimates

 of the price elasticity of demand for
                                          cigarettes obtained from our methodology.
           Little information exists on the prevalence of or the prices charged

 by small scale cigarette smugglers.
                                         Because, for the majority of smokers,
 the transactions costs associated with
                                          relying on small scale smugglers are
likely to be high, it is unlikely that the
                                              presence of small scale smuggling
substantially biases our estimates of the average price of cigarettes.

          A potential problem arises, however, in the case of individuals
who reside in areas bordered by lower price (tax) areas. In these cases,

smokers and would-be smokers have the
                                         opportunity to purchase cigarettes
at less than the own area retail price



61n addition, anecdotal evidence suggests that large scale
                                                           smuggling has become
 dominated by "organized crime". This would tend to discourage the price com-
 petition among suppliers of bootlegged cigarettes necessary to cause a decline
 in the price of smuggled cigarettes. (Advisory Corrmiission on Intergovernmental
 Relations, 1977).
                                                                          9.




 if they are willing to travel for that purpose or, perhaps more importantly,

 if they travel into the lower price areas for other reasons. There is

evidence that the purchase of cigarettes in lower price adjacent areas is

not unconinon.7 For example, in 1978 per capita tax paid cigarette sales

were 50% lower in New York City which imposed a local 8 per pack cigarette

tax than in the rest bf New York State. In fact, per capita cigarette sales

in New York State outside New York City were above the national average despite

the fact that state ckgarette taxes and hence retail prices were also above

the national average. Similarly, annual tax paid cigarette sales in New

Hampshire were 278.8 packs per capita in 1977 while in neighboring Massachu—

setts the comparable figure was 118.9. State cigarette taxes were 9 a pack

higher in Massachusetts than in New Hampshire in that year. If we assume

that the cigarettes purchased in New Hampshire beyohd the national average

of 133.6 packs per capita were consumed in Massachusetts, per capita "consump-

tion" in Massachusetts would rise to 139 or approximately to the national

average. This would imply that as much as 15% of the cigarettes smoked in

Massachusetts might have been purchased in New Hampshire. Although large

scale smuggling may account for a substantial portion of these tax paid



7Clearly, for any individual, the tendency to purchase cigarettes at the lower
 price depends on the size of the price differential and the transactions costs
 associat'ed with purchasing cigarettes in the adjacent area. As transactions
-costs decline, a smaller price differential will be required to induce pur-
 chases in the adjacent market. Within a given market, transactions costs for
 individuals who live near or coninute to a lower price area may be small or
 non-existent. For other individuals within the same general geographic area,
 such as those who live some distance from the boundary, transactions costs
 may be sufficiently high so that only a very substantial price differential
 would induce them to purchase cigarettes in the adjacent area.
                                                                      10.




sales differentials, the substantial amount of across boundary comuting for

work and recreation in these areas affords ample opportunity for the "incidental"

purchase of cigarettes in adjacent low price areas by many residents of high

price areas.

          Generally then, the "average" price of cigarettes reported by the

Tobacco Tax Council will overstate the actual cigarette prices faced by 1indivi—

duals in high price areas which border lower price areas. Border price dif-

ferentials are relatively corrinon in the United States. In these cases, the use

of this "average" price variable can lead to biased estimates of the price elas-

ticity of demand for cigarettes. To correct for this problem, a procedure was

developed to identify and eliminate from our sample observations in PSU's where

because of the possible existence of "incidental" bootlegging average prices

reported might not accurately reflect prices faced by consumers. A 20 mile

wide band was drawn completely around each PSU and the prevailing retail price

of cigarettes within this band determined for each PSU.8 A "restricted" sample

of the HIS data set was then obtained by deleting from the full sample indi-

viduals in PSU's where the own average price was greater than the price within

the 20 mile band. This restricted sample should then consist almost solely of




8As noted previously, the purchase of cigarettes in adjacent areas at lower
 prices is largely a function of travel costs. Twenty miles was arbitrarily
 chosen as the distance beyond which price differentials would not substantially
 affect cigarette purchases for own consumption.

individuals who face cigarette prices equal to those of their own state and

accurately represented by the Tobacco Tax Council price series. in this

paper, demand estimates are presented for the full HIS sample and the re-

stricted sample.



4. Data

           The 1976 Health Interview Survey (HIS) was a nationwide

survey whit'n collected data weekly by household interview for the purpose of

determining the health status of the U.S. civilian noninstitutionalized popu-

lation. The 1976 HIS sample is comprised of 28,033 individuals between the

ages of 20 and 74 from 430 survey sites (PSU's) nationwide. The survey population

 is representative of the population of the United States. All the variables

included in the analysis, with the exception of cigarette prices, •are reported

on the public use data tapes purchased from the National Center for Health

Statistics (NCHS). Average cigarette prices were calculated for each PSU

in the HIS based on data from th Tobacco Tax Council (1980) and placed on

the data tape under an arrangement with NCHS which preserved the confident-

iality of the respondents in the Survey. After editing, the data set
contained 19,266 observations with information on the smoking behavior of

individuals 20-74 years of age.9

5. Results

          Definitions, means, and standard deviations of the three dependent

variables and the independent variables are presented in Table     The surrniary

statistics are presented for the entire HIS sample and for the restricted

sample. Inspection of the sample means reveals that the two samples are not

substantially different. Not unexpectedly, the mean price in the restricted

sample is lower than the mean price in the entire sample and by extension the

mean price in the excluded PSU's. There are, however, a substantial number of

observations from high priced PSLVs in the restricted sample and the range of

cigarette prices for the restricted sample (35.3 to 57.6 per pack) is nearly

as large as the range (35.St to 62.U per pack) for the entire sample.

          The most substantial difference between the two samples is in their

geographic representation of the nation. The restricted sample contains pro-

portionately more observations from the West (29%) than the total sample (18%)

and fewer observations from the Northeast (11% in the restricted sample vs. 24%

in the total sample). This is largely because the Northeast contains many



9Editing consisted primarily of eliminating observations for which little
information on smoking behavior was available. In addition1 the 1976 HIS
included a small number of observations in PSU's that NCHS could not identify.
Since we could not calculate appropriate average prices for these observa-
tions, they were eliminated from our rking sample.

 small political divisions with varying tax rates while the West is dominated

 by larger geographic areas with more uniform tax rates. Representation of the

 other regions is approximately equal in both samples.

          OLS regression estimates of the demand for cigarettes (quantity

smoked by smokers and non—smokers)    ,   the smoking participation rate and the
quantity smoked by smokers for both the total and the restricted sample are

presented in Table 2. There are substantial differences in the estimated price

effects in the two samples —   the   price coefficients and corresponding elasti-

cities at the mean are almost twice as large in the restricted sample as in the

total sample. Moreover, the price coefficient          only achieves statistical

significance at the 5 percent level of a one—tailed test in the quantity smoked

regression for the total sample (column (a)) while it is more robust in both

the quantity smoked and smoking participation rate regressions (columns (b) and

(d)) in the restricted sample.

          The estimated coefficients of the other independent variables are

generally not sensitive to the sample chosen)° These findings are consistent

with measurement error in the full sample price variable which biases the full

sample price coefficient toward zero.        The exclusion of a disproportionate

number of observations from the Northeast from the restricted sample adds

additional support to this hypothesis. In particular, Connecticut, Massa-

chusetts, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania have all been identified

as states with serious cigarette smuggling problems (Advisory Commission on

Intergovernmental Relations, 1977).     It is estimated that as many as one out

of each two packs of cigarettes sold in New York City are bootlegged

(Advisory Connission on Intergovernmental Relations, 1977). Because of the

apparent measurement error bias in the full sample results, we will rely on

price effects estimated from the restricted sample in the remainder of this

paper.

          Regression estimates over the restricted sample for smoking parti-

cipation, and quantity smoked by smokers are presented in columns Cd) and

(f) of Table 2. The results suggest that an increase in the price of ciga-

rettes would reduce cigarette consumption primarily through reductions in

the smoking participation rate (price elasticity =   -.26),   while having a

much smaller impact on the quantity of cigarettes demanded by smokers (price

elasticity =   _.1O).h1   Because quantity smoked by smokers is not_very sensitive




'1These elasticities are computed at the means and the price coefficient in
  the quantity of cigarettes demanded by smokers regression is not statistically
  significant at conventional levels.
                                                                                23.




 to price, higher cigarette prices would appear to effect cigarette demand by

 affecting the decision to smoke or not rather than by causing existing smokers

 to reduce the amount of cigarettes they smoke.      This distinction i deve-

 loped more fully in the next section. The combined or total price elasticity

 of -.42 is at the low end of the range of recent estimates. This is not sur-

 prising given the reliance on tax paid sales as the quantity measure in previous

 cross section studies.12

          The income elasticity of .08 is also small relative to previous

estimates. This point is taken up in the concluding section of the paper.

 In contrast to price, income appears to impact cigarette demand primarily by

 influencing the number of cigarettes consumed by smokers rather than by affect-

ing the smoking particpation rate.'3

Cigarette Demand by Different Age Groups

          Because price appears to impact cigarette demand primarily through

its affect on the decision to smoke or not, demand equations were estimated

across the following age groups in the restricted saniple2o-25 years, 26-35

years, and over 35 years. The price coefficients and elasticities at the means

from these estimated demand equations are presented in Table 3. These



12Actually,the bias away from zero in the price elasticity estimates of these
  previous studies is offset to some extent by the bias toward zero resulting
  from the failure to take account of the lower prices in adjacent jurisdictions
  faced by many smokers. However, the sale of cigarettes smuggled on a large
  scale at the legal price level suggests that the foniier effect dominates the latter.
  As further evidence of this upward bias, we estimated a demand for cigarettes
  equation across states using 1976 state taxable sales as the dependent variable
  and a number of state specific variables including per capita income and corn—
  posite price as independent variables. The estimated price and income coeffi-
  cients were both statistically significant at conventional levels and the esti-
  mated elasticities at the means of 0.77 for income and -1.70 for price were both
  substantially greater than our estimates of these parameters using the HIS data.

t3Ihe income elasticity of the smoking participation rate at the means is .03 and
  the income elasticity of the quantity smoked by smokers is .06.

estimates are from regressions which included all the independent variables

included in the regressions in Table 2. While we do not present or discuss

the effects of these other independent variables on smoking, it should be

realized that a11 the estimated price effects presented in this paper control

for the effects of these other variables. The estimated price effects from the

smoking participation regression are estimated by a FIML logit procedure, the

preferred estimation procedure when the dependent variable is dichotomous

(INerlove and Press, l973).'

         Since most regular smokers begin smoking before age 25(NatiOflal Clearing

House for Smoking & Health,1976) and since smoking is in some sense "addictive"

(Krasnegor.1976a), our previous results suggest that the smoking participation de-

cision of the younger age group may account for much of the aggregate price effects

found across all age groups. To a great extent, the results sumarized in Table 3

bear this out. The cigarette demand equations for smokers and non-smokers yieldeca

price elasticity of —.89 for the 20-25 years age group, a figure twice as large in

absolute value as the price elasticity for the other age groups. Furthermore, the

smoking participation price elasticity of -.74 for the 20—25 year olds accounts

for a great portion of the aggregate price elasticity of this age group. This



'4Fhe sinking participation rate equations were estimated by both OLS and FIML
  logit procedures for all the age and sex subsamples of the restricted sample
  rerorted in Tables 3,4 and 5. In all cases, the price effects obtained from
  the OLS regressions were almost identical to those obtained when the FIML logit
  procedure was used. We present the results of the logit estimates because
  they are preferred on theoretical grounds. The entire HIS sample and the entire
  "restricted" sample were too large to be accommodated by our logit program.
  Those results, reported In Table 2, were obtained by OLS regression. Given
  the size of the sample in each of these two instances and the similarity between
  the OLS and logit estimates in the subsample estimates, we feel confident that
  the OLS estimates presented in Table 2 are nearly identical to what logit
  estimates would be.

 is not to say that the results for the older age groups do not show some

 price sensitivity. The price coefficient is statistically significant in

 the demand for cigarette equations for the over 35 year old group and nearly

 significant for those 26-35 years old. The price elasticity of demand at the

 means for both these groups of about —.45 is not insubstantial. In the case

 of the 26—35 year olds, price appears to operate primarily through smoking

 participation while the decomposition of the aggregate price effect for the

 older age group is less conclusive.



           The results reported here that price has its greatest effect on

 the smoking behavior of younger people and that it operates primarily via the

 decision to begin smoking regularly rather than on the quantity smoked is consistent

 with results reported by Lewit, Coate, and Grossman (1981). Lewit, Coate

 and Grossman (1981) used another large micro-sample, the Health Examination

.Survey, 1966—1970, and a methodology similar to that described in this paper

to examine cigarette demand by 12-17 year olds. They report a total price

elasticity for the quantity smoked by teenage smokers and non-smokers of -1.4

and a smoking participation elasticity of —1.2. Thus, the pattern of larger

price elasticities in the younger age groups and the attribution of price effects

primarily to the smoking participation decision is confirmed in another sample.

Cigarette Demand by Age and Sex

          Further insight into the effects of price on cigarette demand can

be gained by looking in some detail at the price elasticities of different

age and sex groups.   -
                          In   previous specifications, sex differentials in ciga-

rette demand were represented by a dummy variable, The price elasticity
                                                                            28.




results presented in Table 4 for males and Table 5 for females are based on

separate regressions for each sex in each age group. Thus, price effects

can now differ by sex as well as by age.

          The results indicate that cigarette demand by females is generally

not sensitive totprice (Table s) while males (Table 4) appear more sensitive

to price than was implied by previous results where male and female price

effects were contrained to be equal. For 20-25 year olds, for example, the

price elasticity for quantity smoked by smokers and non-smokers was -.89 for

both sexes combined, -1.40 for males, and small and not significantly different

from zero for females.

          Even for males, however, the effect of price on smoking behavior

varies with age. The coefficient of price in the regression for men aged

26—35 years fails to achieve statistical significance and price elasticities

at the mean are much smaller than for the younger group. Price does, however,

seem to act to reduce smoking by males more than 35 years old (Table 4).

Here the impact qf a price is split between changes in the smoking

participation rate and changes    in the quantity smoked by smokers.   It appears,

therefore, that to some extent price (tax) increases may have a beneficial

effect on the health of older males, a group that has experienced the greatest

health losses due to cigarette smoking(u,S, Public Health Service, 1979).

6. Implications of the Research

          In this paper, we have attempted to assess the potential for using

excise taxes to reduce smoking by measuring the price elasticity of demand

for cigarettes. Excise tax increases will discourage smoking to the extent

 that excise tax increases are passed on to smokers in the form. of higher

 retail cigarette prices. Barzel (1976) has presentedevidence that

 retail cigarette prices have more than reflected state excise tax increases.

          Our empirical results have indicated: 1) that the price elasticity

of demand for cigarettes is - .42; 2) that price impacts cigarette demand

primarily by affecting the decision to begin smoking regularly among members

of the population less than 25 years; and 3) that price effects are much

larger for males than females —   in   fact our estimates shw a price elasticity

near zero for females over 20 years old.

          The results have implications for any future Federal government

attempts to influence cigarette demand through excise tax policy. The short

run impact of an excise tax Increase would be small. For example, if the

federal excHetax was doubled to 16 cents a pack,•ánd if the tax increase

was completely passed on to the consumer, then the average retail price

would increase by about 13% (using the average 1979 average retail price as a

reference). Accordingly, applying our estimated price elasticity of -.42,

cigarette consumption would fall by about 5.5%. The fall-off in demand would

result from approximately a 3.9% decline in smoking participation and a 1.3%

decline in the quantity of cigarettes smoked by smokers. In the long run,

however, the impact of such a tax increase would be much more substantial.

Our results imply that a doubling of the excise tax would lead to a 17%

decline in smoking participation by males 20—25. Furthermore, it may be

reasonable to expect that overtime the response by females to price changes

could approach that of males. Until the mid-1970's, trends in smoking par-

ticipation of males and females in the United States were markedly different.

Male smoking rates peaked in the mid—1960's at 51 percent of the male popu—

lation and have fallen continously since then, to 37 percent in 1979, the

latest year for which figures are available(U,S. Public Health Service, 1980)

Female smoking rates peaked later than male rates and were relatively constant

through 1976, the year in which the HIS data used in this study were collected,

More recent data, however, show a decline in female smoking, with participation rates

down to 28 percent from the 33 percent plateau of the late sixties to mid-seventies

(U.S. Public Health Service, 1980). At least to some extent then, one aspect of fe-

male smoking Is becoming similar to that of males.16

          In the long run, an excise tax increase, if maintained in real

tens, should continue to discourage smoking participation by successive genera-

tions of teenagers and young adults, while gradually impacting the smoking

levels of older age group as the smoking discouraged cohorts move through

the age spectrum. Moreover, since the discouraging effects of an excise

tax increase would operate largely through the participation



    is beyond the scope of this paper to determine why price seems to affect male
 smoking behavior but not female smoking behavior or to explain differences in
 aggregate smoking behavior by the two sexEs. We would only point out
 that since males and females face the same prices for cigarettes and since
 the real price of cigarettes has fallen during the 1970's, the differential
 behavior cited above cannot be attributed to the level of or to changes in
 the price of cigarettes.

decision rather than through quantity adjustments by existing smokers, several

arguments that excise tax increases may not have beneficial health effects

loose force.   In particular, some have argued that smokers respond to higher

prices by switching to higher tar and nicotine brands, by inhaling more deeply,

or by reducing idle burn.'7All of these compensatory behaviors by smokers

would greatly reduce any health benefits which might be obtained from reducing

the number of cigarettes smoked because of higher taxes. These arguments,

however, are obviously not relevant to the smoking participation decision and

are inconsistent with our findings of small quantity adjustments by smokers.

          Some final words are reserved for a discussion of income elasticity

of demand for cigarettes. The size of the income elasticity has had important

implications for evaluations    of federal government policies to discourage

smoking   (Hamilton 1972; Ippolito, Murphy. and Sant, 1979; Klein, Murphy,

and Schneider, 1981). Our estimated income elasticity of demand, .08 (Table

2), is about one—tenth the size of the estimate obtained by Ippolito,

Murphy, and Sant (1979) from time series data and about one-tenth the size of

Hamilton's (1972) estimate which was obtained from a cross state analysis of

,tax paid sales data. As a result, the models of both Hamilton (1972) and

Ippolito, Murphy, and Sant (1979) tend to attribute more of the secular varia-

tion in per capita cigarette consumption to variations in income than would a

model incorporating our estimated income elasticity. For example, Hamilton

(1972) estimates that annual cigarette consumption would have increased from

3506 cigarettes per capita in 1953—55 to 4482 cigarettes per capita in 1968-70

due to the substantial increase in income during that period. Since consump-

tion only Increased to 3868 cigarettes per capita in 1968—70, he credits the

health scare and anti-smoking advertising under the Fairness Doctrine with

   substantially reducing smoking below the level it otherwise would have been.

  To the extent to which Hamilton's estimate of an income induced increase in

   smoking may have been too large, he may have overstated the impact of the

   health scare. Moreover, his analysis of the differential effects of the Fair-

  ness Doctrine and advertising bàn policies may also require reconsideration

   if they too rely substantiall' on an overstated income effect. Of course,

   it Is possible that the income elasticity of demand for cigarettes has

  declined substantially in recnt years for many reasons including the health

  scare and related government programs. In fact, Klein, Murphy, and Schneider

   (1981) assess the impact of government cigarette policies within the context

  of a time series model wherein the income elasticity of demand for cigarettes

  falls as income rises. As a result, their estimated income elasticIty for
                                                                                 18
