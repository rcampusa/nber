                         Does Deductibility Influence
                               Local Taxation?



                                  ABSTRACT




        Recent proposals to reform the U.S. tax code all contain signifi-

cant reforms of the cufrent provision allowing for the deductibility of

state and local taxes.

        This paper examines the effect of deductibility reform on the reve-

nue decisions of the largest U.S. cities. The analysis of eight alternative

reforms concludes:   (1) total taxes change very little in the long—run,

falling at most by 13% and, for many cities, even rising slightly; (2) fees

and license revenue (predominantly a tax on firms) generally fall, in some

cases by 30% or more; (3) the net effect on total revenues (tax plus fees)

is generally small, never declininq by more than 12% even with full loss of

deductibility; and (4) policies to offset city revenue losses are effective

in neutralizing the negative effects of deductibility reform.

                                  by

                           Robert P. Inman



     For the first time since the adoption of the income tax in 1913.

the federal government is considering a major, fundamental overhaul of

the United States tax code. Members of Congress from both parties and

the Reagan Administration have offered reform proposals which greatly

simplify the present tax system, while also advancing, it can be

argued, the dual objectives of economic efficiency and tax equity.

All reform proposals contain changes in the federal tax law which may

hive important implications for the financing of state and local

governments. Foremost among these changes is the removal, fully or in

part, of the current deductibility of state and local taxes from

household income when calculating federal tax payments. There is

tentative evidence (Zimmerman. 1983; Noto and Zimmerman, 1984) to

suggest the present deductibility of state—local taxes may stimulate

the provision of state—local government services by providing a

subsidy to state—local taxation. There is more conclusive evidence

(Rock, 1984) to show that the deductibility of state—local taxes

reduces the progressivity of our overall (federal—state—local) tax

system. If we were to remove the federal deductibility of state—local

taxes we might then observe a smaller, and possibly more efficient.

state—local public sector as well as a more progressive combined tax

system.

     The purpose of this research is to examine as carefully as




                                       1
 current evidence allows the effects on local finance of federal and

 state deductibility of local taxation. The analysis first estimates

 the impact of past changes in federal and state deductibility on the

 decisions of our largest cities to use property, sales, and income

 taxes as   well   as    user    fees and licenses for the financing of public
            1
services.       The     sample    for this econometric analysis is the forty—one

largest U.S. cities (excluding Washington, D.C. and Honolulu because

of their unique         financial   relationship to federal and state

governments, respectively) for the twenty—one fiscal years, 1960—1980.

A data base of this breadth and           depth    is needed if we   hope   to

accurately reveal the influence of such a sporadic policy change as

fedsral and state tax           deductibility. 2   Given econometric estimates of

city responses to changes in federal and stats deductibility, the

analysis then predicts the effects on the level and structure of local

finance  of a variety of alternative federal reforms for the deduction
of state and local taxes. Reforms considered include the
Administration's        initial proposal for full removal of deductibility,
proposals (such as the Kemp—tasten and Bradley—Gephardt tax reform
bills) for selective removal, and finally, a series of               compromise
proposals which remove deductibility but offer increased revenue—
sharing aid or percentage tax credits for local taxes in hopes of
softening the blov to after—tax incomes or public services received
by local taxpayers.


II. Deductibility and the Local Decision to Tax
     Cities budget subject to constraints. Legal              constraints

influence local finance by defining the fiscal choices available to

cities. Economic         constraints    set the limits   to how many dollars     can



                                               2
 be allocated along each dimension of choice. Political constraints

 detail the process by which dollars are so allocated.           Together the

 three constraints set the local budget. I will focus here on only one

 aspects of the local public budget —         the revenue decision — and    the

 effects of tightening one of the constraints —         the   economic
constraint — through the removal of deductibility for local taxes.

     For this analysis I will assume that the level and structure of

loc•l revenues are set by a majority rule process involving two or

note coalitions of voters.         Since the budgetary process will

generally require decisions on several policy dimensions the usual

media voter model will not apply.3            Rather, city budgets will emerge

from a bargaining process among the relevant voter coalitions.

Ideally, we would like to specify and estimate a structural model of

this bargaining process, unraveling coalition preferences and the

political weights in the process. That task is beyond us here.4 We

can, however, specify a reduced—form model of local budgeting which,

subject to the usual caveats regarding structure stability, will allow

us to estimate the effects on local finance of changes in

deductibility. Is section III, I will outline one possible structural

model of local finance which helps to rationalize the observed

reduced—form estimates.

     A generalized. reduced—form specification of revenue allocations

by city i in year s can be specified as:

 (T), individual taxes        (t           •   r     1 ...) and fees and licenses (F) are

seen to depend upon the vector of legal, economic, and political

constraints 11is' Equation (4) is s budget identity which defines

total non—debt revenue (K) as the sum of taxes and fees.5

       Included in the vector                      as legal constraints are local city

spending obligations for education (DED = 1 if the city has primary

responsibility for education. 0 otherwise), and welfare (ML 1, if

the city has primary responsibility for AFDC welfare, 0 otherwise) and

state prohibitions on the use of local taxes other than property

taxation (DI = 1 if city can use the income tax. 0 otherwise; DSS 1

if city can use selective sales taxes, 0 otherwise; and DGS — 1 if

city can use a general sales tax, 0 otherwise).6 In addition, states

often place restrictions on the rate of local property taxation;

either as a limit to the nominal, or •ill (tax pir *1000 of assessed

value), rate or (more recently) as a limit to the effective (or •srket

value) rate. The more coon state—imposed limit to nominal rates is

specified as the inverse of the state mill rate limit (RLIM) while the

state limit to the effective property tax rate is specified as a

    rite limit applies) dummy variable (LEVYLIM).7

           The economic constraints included in
                                                         are per capita city

                                                      not open—ended matching)
    aid programs (CAID), federal aid from general revenue—sharing

    (RSAID),   and a city cost—of—living index (Pt).8
                                                            Also included in the
    vector       Us an economic constraint will be the ability of a city to

    export a portion of its local tax burden either
                                                          by taxing non—
    residents or by using federal and state tax code provisions which

 allow the deduction of, or credits for, local taxation. Local
                                                                             tax
 exportation through non—resident taxation or deductibility will in

 effect lower the 5rice to residents of raising local revenues; the

direct burden of local taxes is reduced by the share of the burden

exported.

           To make this notion of tax exportation precise, and       to   allow us
to test for the effects of deductibility on local finance, I have

specified a variable called the burden price of taxation.9            A dollar
raised from local tax t         will   reduce resident incomes not by *1, but

rather by (r) dollars (cr)             j 1), where     is called the burden
price of tax r and is defined by:



t
    (r).
           t(1_   (f) (f) (f)
                     p   q      —6(a)p (s) q(a) —y (r))(1—O (r) ),

where           = 1 if the local tax is claimed as a federal
                                                             deduction, 0
otherwise; 5( 1 if the local tax is claimed as a state deduction,
o   otherwise;         and p(s) equal the portion of the local tax which




                                              S
 can be deducted against federal or state income taxes, respectively;

           and q(5)   are   the taxpayer's marginal federal and state income tax

 rates, respectively;               is percent of the local tax dollar which can

 be credited towards federal and/or state taxes; and                         is the

 portion of tax r paid directly by non—residents. The burden price

will differ across taxpayers in the same locality as 8,q, p and t

 differ; 9(r) will be identical for ill taxpayers within a given city.

           The actual specification of (r) for each of the taxes in this

 study will be a weighted average of individual ¶(5 scross taxpayers

 from the city's 25th percentile income level (weight =                    .25),   from the

city's 50th percentile income level (weight                      .50), and from the

city's 75th percentil, income level (weight —                    .25).   Separate values
of 8 (defined as the          percent   of households with the given income who

itemize their deductions),10 q (defined as the effective marginal

federal and state tax rate for the given income)111 and y (defined as

the rate of state tax credit for the given income)12 are defined for

each local tax for each income class; p is always uniform for all

income classes in a given state (either 0 or 1). The deductibility

                                                                 is calculated
first for each income class, and then the weighted average across the

three income classes is calculated for property taxation (denoted

FrPROP),      for   general sales (BTGS), for selective sales (BTSS),               and for
income taxation (BTINC).           The non—resident share of a local tax
     (r)
(0         ) will also vary by tax and      is   defined for property taxation as
the    percent   of city property assessed as commercial—industrial (PCI).

for general sales taxation as the percent of city taxable general

sales purchased by non—residents (PNRGS), for selective sales taxation

as the percent of city taxable selective sales purchased by non—

 residents (PNRSS), and for local income taxation as the percent of

 city wages earned by non—residents (PNKY).13 The city's average

 burden price for each tax,                   is       then the simple product of its

 deductibility component and one minus the non—resident                     share: TP =
 BfflflOP(1 — PCI)         BTGS(1 — PNRGS),                      BTSS(1. — PNRSS). and   INC

 this analysis) for the      possible        distinct effects of the deductibility

 and non—resident share components of the

      For completeness, we must recognize that in addition to taxes,

 local fees sad   licenses   say      also   be exported to non—residents. While
 fees and   license   are not deductible                    —   n(s) —0) nor supported by
 credits (y —   0),   they may   be   paid by non—residents. I denote this

non—resident share of fees as PNRF. 14                   The residents' share of fees

 (1—PNRF) will be included as element of the vector I
                                                                       is
     As a final conent on the specification of the burden price of

local finance, we must also note that the non—resident share of

revenues includes not only revenues paid today by those in other

jursidictions but may     include      the present value of revenues paid by
future residents which go to support today's services. How do future

taxpayers subsidize current services? Two mechanisms are available:

by underfunding public employee pensions and by rolling—over short—

term debt.15 Unless local land markets or labor markets capitalize

these debts (and there is no good evidence that they do or do not),

future residents will bear a fraction of the current costs for city

services. A precise estimate of the fraction of local revenues paid

by future taxpayer's is not possible, but I do include in X. a likely




                                                   7
 determjnsnt of this share: the difference between the national rate

 of return on 6—month Treasury Bills and the city's interest rate for

 short—ten debt, discounted by the after—tax rite of return from 6—

 month T—Bills for the average income resident (AREINI1.      ARnINr

 measures the arbitrage advantage of holding city dollars in interest

 bearing accounts and financing today's public services through

 borrowing.   As ARBINT rises, the non—debt sources of current period

 revenues — taxes and fees — are
                                 likely to decline if shifting to
 future residents occurs.16

     The political constraints on local revenue choices are

 specified by two variables which measure the relative size of

residential voting coalitions — the percent of city households whose

income exceeds the national 75th percentile income     lenI   (PCRICB) and

the percent of city households whose income is below the national 25th

percentile income level (PCPOOR) — one variable designed to measure

the relative mobility of city tax base to the suburbs —       the   log of
the ratio of city to suburban income (LRCSI)17   —   a time trend (TEAR)

and a city    fiscal crisis duy variable   (cRISIS —   1, for years    after
the New York City crisis 1975 to 1980, 0 for prior years) 18 to capture

any sytematic shifts in voter or bond market preferences for revenue

levels or mix, and, finally, a vector of city duny variables to

control for each city's unique political environment and the city's

status quo budget.


     While these variables are a reasonable first step to specifying

the structure of revenue choice, they surely do not capture all

relevant economic and political forces. It is assumed that what

factors have not been systematically specified will have only a

 stochastic influence across cities and time. The error structure of

 the revenue model therefore allows for
                                                     cross—equation correlation of
 the error terms —           political    or economic shocks which influence

 taxes,- or tax mix, are likely to influence fees as veil — and
                                                                permits
 a lagged adjustment to these "shocks through a first—order

 autoregressive process unique to each revenue instrument.              Thus.

       The model is estimated by generalized least squares allowing for

tax—specific autocorrelation and for the cross—equation correlation of

errors. When estimating this system of revenue equations, the total

tax identity Lt = T allows us to either estimate all tax equations
and calculate T as the sum of each (r)               or to estimate T and all but
one of the
                       equations calculating the omitted individual tax as a

residual. The latter strategy is adopted here. Revenue systems

involving total taxes, property taxes, general sales taxes, selective

sales taxes, income taxes, and fees and licenses are estimated. The

omitted tax category is a residual of miscellaneous specialized city

taxes which is never more than five percent of city revenues,t9                 All

financial variables and city income are measured in real dollars

(deflated by P1) per capita.

equation is for 'other taxes' which accounts for only 1.2% of total

own    revenue    for the full sample.

        Before examining the effects of deductibility on city fiscal

choice, it is instructive to suaarize briefly the influence of the

legal and political constraints as well as the effects of the economic

variables income, aid, and relative prices. The constraints influence

city revenues largely as expected. Cities responsible for public

education (DED) have higher taxes,
                                           predominantly property taxes.

 Cities with responsibility for welfare (DWL =    1, for Baltimore, Boston
 to 1970, Denver, Indianapolis since 1971. New York City, Norfolk, and

San Francisco) are the larger, older cities. Real taxis per capita

 (and possibly services) are lower, with property taxes enjoying most

of the reduction. Tax relief is given to homeowners to compensate for

the added burden of paying for at least a part of welfare outlays.

Cities restricted to general sales taxes (DGS) and/or selective sales

taxes (DSS) raise less revenue than cities with access to an inocre

tax (DI). Tax access clearly has a revenue effect. Nominal mill rate

limits (RLIX) have no statistically significant effect on revenues as

cities adjust assesaent rates or vote to override the limit. An

effective rate limit on property taxation (LEVYLIM) does reduce

revenues but thr effect is neither quantitatively nor statistically

significant in our sample cities.

     Of the political constraint variables, a larger pool of rich

househelds (PatCH) seems to reduce taxes overall and property taxes

in particular; the revenue nix is biased towards sales taxation and

wage income taxation as PatCH rises. A larger pool of very low

income families marginally increases total taxes, and particularly

general sales and income taxes. The results suggest the possibility

of a majority rich—poor coalition which lowera property taxes,

increases services, and shifts the tax burden to the middle class (and

possibly fins) through the taxation of wages and retail sales. There

has been a steady annual (YEAR) upward trend in real city revenue from

all sources, a trend which has   not   been offset by the effects of the

New York City fiscal crisis or by the apparent increased taxpayer

awareness of city fiscal performance in the 1975 to 1980 period




                                        11
  (CRISIS). The measure of middle class exit to the suburbs (LRCSI) has

  the expected negative effect on taxes, notably property taxation.

 Economic competition appears to be a more effective check to the

 growth of large city revenues than legislative constraints, at least

 as they are now fashioned (RLIM, LEVYLIM)•

      Relaxing the public sector's economic constraint through an

 increase in residential incas. (CINC) or by reducing the costs of

 goods and services in the region as a whole (PT) both increase the

 city's own   revenues   and public services. An increase in the city's

 grants—in—aid from categorical programs (CUD) or from general revenue

 —sharing (ESAID) results in only marginal tax relief; almost all aid

 is spent on public services in these large cities. The variable

 AREINT measures the attractiveness of deferred financing and
                                                                     has a
 negative   effect on property taxes and    an   total taxes; the behavioral

reaponse measured by the elasticity of T with respect to ARBINT is

only —.02, however. The residential share of fees and licenses (1—

PNRF) has no statistically or
                                  quantitatively important effect on
taxation;     when significant in the fees equation the elasticity is

only .08.

     Overall, the legal, economic, and political constraints have

plausible effects on city revenue behavior. That are the specific

effects of deductibility? Tables 1 and 2 detail the estimates of the

effects on city financing of changes in tax burden prices, and

explicitly, the deductibility components (B1PROP, BTINC/SAL,        B'l'SS,

BTVS, and BTINC) of those prices. Table 1 illustrates an important

result; the deductibility component and the non—resident component of

tax burden prices often have opposite, and statistically significant,

effects on city revenues. The differences were most noteable for



                                       12
 property tax burden prices; dedactiblity (BTPROP) has a positive

 effect while the shire of taxes borne by residents (1—PCI) has      a

 significant negative effect on local taxation:     signs are reversed in
 the fee equation. The two components of             do not behave as one,
 as the initial specification suggested.2° This result was true not

 only for the full sample regressions
                                         reported in Table 1, but for the

 various subsample regressions as well. As I shall argue below

 (Section B) there are good reasons for
                                          these differences, p•rticularly
 in a reduced form model such as is estimated here.21    Since our

 central concern is predicting the effects of the deductibility

 component on financing, I focus my discussion on these coefficients.

Further, all policy simulations will use these direct estimates.

     Table 2 sunarizes the influence of
                                            deductibility provisions on
 local finance both for the full sample and for the three subsamples of

cities. Subsample 1 consists of cities who only have •ccess to

property taxes, selective sales taxes, and fees; subsample 2 consists

of cities who only have access to property taxes, selective sales

taxes, general sales taxes and fees; and subsample 3 consists of the

remaining cities who have access to property, selective
                                                           sales, income
taxes, perhaps general sales, and fees. The elasticities of total

taxes (T), each available individual tax, (ti"), fees (F), and total

revenues (T + F) with respect to changes in deductibility
                                                          are reported
in Table 2. The results show that the removal of deductibility

(Bl'PROP, BTSS, BTGS, and BTINC all rise towards 1) will increase taxes

(BTSS in subsszples 1 and 3 and BTINC in subsample 3 are the

exceptions), generally reduce fees, and, as often as not (BTSS and

BflNC are the significant exceptions), increase
                                                  total city revenues.

On their face these results are, I suspect, counter—intuitive. But

two points need to be made. First, our intuition is about the short—

run; the results reported here are equilibrium, long—run estimates of

the effects of deductibility on revenues. There is a plausible long—

run explanation for these results; see section 111—B.   Second, since

the deductibility components all have mean values of    .85 or higher

(see Data Appendix), the selective removal of deductibility will imply

at most an 18% increase in the relevant tax price variable (i.e.1 .85

to 1.0 is a change of 18% percent). The long—run effects of reform on

total revenues CT + F) will be modest, therefore, ranging from a

possible increase in revenues of 18% (BTPROP in Subsample 3) to a

possible reduction of 25% (BflNC in Subsample 3). For most reforms

now being discussed, the equilibrium revenue effects will be much

 B. Unraveling the Revenue Restonse: Short—Ran Politics Meets Long—

         Run Economics


         Dissecting the long—run, equilibria response of city revenues to

 deductibility reform requires *    three step argument. In step one, I
 argue that deductibility reform will have a selective effect on city

 taxpayers which will create pressure for upper income households to

 exit the center city for the suburbs. in step two. I outline the

 city's likely short—run response to that pressure as a readjustment of

 the local tax rates to favor the upper incom, classes. In step three,

 the long—run effects of these rate adjustments are described through

the long—run tate—revenue schedule (the familiar "Laffer curve"). If

cities are on the downward aide of the long—run revenue schedule, then

rate reductions to offset deductibility in the short—run ray actually

increase city revenues.

     The removal of deductibility of state and local taxes will have

selective effects on taxpayers within our cities.     Only those who

itemize will be directly affected. Evidence reveals these families to

be the middle and upper income taxpayers, most often homeowners. The

loss of deductibility will ask. local tax payments more expensive for

these residents. The effect of this now more expensive local budget

may be   to drive the marginal (just indifferent) upper   incomeS families

from the central cities to the suburbs. Exit will     occur even though
deductibility reform     applies in the suburbs as well. The reason is

the relatively pro—poor bias of city, as compared to suburban, public

budgets; see Inman and Rubiafeld (1979).

     A simple example makes the point. Upper income families who jive

within the city make a transfer to lower income families which they



                                       15
  would not make were they to live in
                                              the suburbs. Suppose the value of
  this transfer ii *200
                              per year paid as city taxes. For families in
  the   30 percent tax bracket, (the typical itemizer),
                                                        the net cost of
  the pro—poor subsidy is *140 (—*200 —         deduction of 160). If the
  family prefers the city to the suburbs it nst therefore derive .

 benefit from city living (above any public services received) of at
 least *140 —       for   example, lover conuting costs, excitment of city
 life, or perhaps the altruistic benefits
                                                  of helping (or living with)
 the poor. The marginal (just
                                      indifferent) upper income family derives
 a net benefit of city living of
                                       exactly *140/year. Nov remove the
 deductibility of local taxes. The net cost of the within city pro—

 poor transfer rises from *140/year to *200/year.
                                                           Families who value
 city living less than *200/year will
                                              now (ignoring transaction costs)
 exit to the suburbs.

        The potential loss of its middle and upper income taxpayers is
                                                                       a
 fiscal threat the city cannot
                                     ignore. The city has two possible

responses: increase services to the upper income neighborhoods and/or

selectively lover those taxes which fall
                                                 most heavily on the rich and
middle class. The political
                             reaction will no doubt be a combination
of the two, as cities attempt to
                                 balance the competing interests of
the rich and poor.

        The route to lower taxes, is of course, to lower the rates. In

the   short—run when the tax base in the city is
                                                 relatively fixed, city
revenues will fall. In the longer
                                        run, however, lower city tax rates
may   stimulate   within city investment by existing households and firms
as well as possible       new firm locations,   increased work effort, and
added retail activity. The expansion
                                              of economic activity within the




                                         16
 City in response to lower tax rates will increase
                                                                     the city's taxable
 base. In the long—run, the increase in base begins to offset the

 initial fall in revenues because of the rate reduction. If the base

 increase is large enough, revenues may actually increase. This long—

 run relationship between tax rates (u) and revenues (t) (popularly

 called the "Laffer curve") is described in Figure 1. The long—run

 schedule is the trace of points along various short—run (fixed, or

 very inelastic base) schedules, where the tax—rate intersects its

 equilibrium short—run schedule for its given tax base. As tax rites

 rise (0<          C ...
                           <g14), tax base falls, and conversely. For each tax
 the more elastic is the tax base to rate changes, the lower will be

 the revenue maximizing rite .,22 Because of the long—run tax rite

revenue relationship, a decline (increase) in rites say reduce

 (increase) revenues —         if   the initial rate is 0 S.    ,s    C i   — or
 increase (reduce) revenues —           if   u C u   <   1. To understand the

effects of deductibility reform we must know, therefore, on which side

of the revenue—maximizing rate aS            the   city's tax structure now

resides. I shall argue that it is likely cities are to the right of

pjS   for   property and sales taxation and to the left of i'               for   income

(wage) taxation. This third and last step permits us to untangle the

observed long—run effects of deductibility reform.

       The city's decision to set a local tax is, of course, a political

decision, Yet no city politican, it would seem, should rationally set

rates beyond fl*; he would lose both votes and revenues! lby then

might u)     p'   for local taxes? The answer lies in the long—run

elasticity of the local tax base and the time horizon of politicans

relative to the time required to achieve a long—run tax base

equilibrium. If the political time horizon is shorter than the

 feasible but likely. Buchanan and Lee (1981) were the first to make

 this important point. Figure 2 illustrates two possible equilibria.

 The dashed lines in Figure 2 represent the elected officials' chances

 of re—election as a function of revenues (a "good' to be spent on

 services) vs. tax rates ( a "bad"). As tax rates rise, increasing

 amounts   of   revenues are needed to offset the political losses from the

 rate increase; thus the political re—election curves bend upward.

 Higher re—elect ion curves reflect preferred combinations of revenue

 and rates. the elected officials select that rate which maximizes

 their chances of re—election.          The next election is generally only
 two   years   away and never more than four. Voter myopia ("what have you

done for me lately") compresses a        politican's time horizon still
further. 23      As a consequence elected officials select that rate which

is rational, subject to the short—run (fixed—base) tax rate—revenue

schedule. The short—run revenue schedules are the (nearly)

straightliues — denoted       B(p) — in    Figure 1. It is feasible for the
tax rate chosen subject to an always rising short—run            revenue
constraint      to also be a long—run   equilibrium on the downward        sloping
portion of the long—rn revenue curve; for example                ) g in Figure
2a.

       It is also likely. For those local taxes whose tax bases are

sensitive in the long—run to tax rate changes, the peak of the long—

run schedule will occur at relatively low values of          u    Further,    if

politicans' re—election curves are flat" —          i.e.,   voters value

targeted expenditures relative to general tax rate relief — we can

well expect a tangency to the right of 0.          Such cities will be caught

in a "revenue trap" or "fiscal crisis" where increasing rates only

reduce tax base and revenues in the long—run. Available evidence

suggests that local property taxes and local general sales taxes are
                                      24
likely to have elastic tax bases.           Further, politicians in the

larger and older cities which comprise our sample are likely to face

"tight" expenditure needs and hence "flat" re—election canes between

revenue (i.e., expenditures) and tax rates. If so, tax rate—revenue

allocations such as those in Figure 2a result. For property and

general sales taxation, an equilibrium tax rate s >              is both

feasible and plausible.

       The available evidence on the elasticity of local income tax

bases to rate changes suggest a relatively inelastic base.25 If            this
is so, then the peak of the income tax revenue curve will result at

relatively high local rates. The equilibrium tangency of the

politicans' still "fiat" re—election curves to the short—run revenue

schedule may therefore occur to the left of x'; see Figure Zb. Thus

for local income taxes, it is feasible and likely that ji < u

       No systematic argument regarding tax base elasticity for the set

selective sales taxes seems possible.           This tax category includes

numerous miscellaneous taxes which vary greatly across sample cities.

Some of these taxes are likely to have elastic bases (tobacco, liquor,

entertainment, hotels) while the tax base of others will be rate

inelastic (public utilities). Cities' leg•l access to the individual

taxes may be restricted as well. For some cities (those who use

public utility taxes) u   <   s   is likely, while for others (those who

tax   consumption and entertainment) i      )   L is   more plausible.

      What are the implications of this political economic view (i.e.,

"structural model") for interpreting our reduced—form estimates of the



                                           19
effects of deductibility reform on city revenues? First, the proposed

model is long—run; since most of the variation in deductibility is

cross—section variation, the econometric results are long—run results

as well. Second. the model does help us to understand the possibly

counter—intuitive results of deductibility reform. For the full

sample results, a fall in property and/or income plus sales tax

deductibility stimulates total taxes, particularly from property

taxation. This result is explained by the political decision to lower

tax rates to keep the rich and upper middle class itemizers within the

city, a decision which, in the nd actually helps city revenues. It

should be noted that in the short—run city revenues decline and

services — most likely those allocated to the poor — are reduced.

Note too, that as rates fall, city politicans are moved to a

politically less preferred (lower chance of re—election) rate—revenue

allocation.

     The three sets of subsample results can also be understood in

light of this model of short—run politics and long—run economics. - For

cities in subsample 1, the loss of property tax deductibility leads to

a rise in property tax revenues as predicted. But selective sales tax

revenues decline; the reason is most likely a combination of effects.

Subsample 1 cities have access to only property and selective sales

taxes. Lowering the property tax rate is a first priority. In the

short—run, however, revenues and public services will decline and to

offset, at least partially, this revenue loss selective sales tax

rates may be increased. In the long—run, if u   >   t   for   selective

sales taxes (an elastic tax base), revenue will decline. (A similar

story, but with tax roles reversed, can be told for an increase in




                                    20
 BTSS.) For cities in subsample 2, we observe a similar fiscal

 reaction to the loss of deductiblity of property taxation, As BTPROP

 is increased, property tax rates are reduced and long—run revenues

 increase. To offset the short—run revenue loss, general sales tax

 rates may be increased, but as cities are likely to be in the

 declining range of this tax's long—run revenue curve (g> is),
                                                                 general
 sales tax revenues decline •s BTPROP rises. The tax rates for the

 selective sales taxes may rise or fall, but if they fall and p > z

 for those taxes (see below) then revenue        will rise with BTPROP

as is observed in subsample 2. The loss of general sales tax

deductibility (Bros rises) will lead to a short—run reduction in

general sales tax rates, but since p ) p° long—run revenues from t (OS)

rise. Property tax rates and selective sales tax rates may be

increased to soften the short—run revenue loss, but since both taxes

are on the downward side of their long—run revene curves (p ) p')

revenues will fall in the long—run. The loss of selective sales tax

deductilibity (BTSS increases) for sample 2 cities will first lower
these rates. If so, and as long—run t (SS) rises, we must conclude
                                             -




that sample 2 cities are on the falling segment of their long—run

revenue carve, that is, u > ,.   The reduction in short—run revenues

is offset by rate increase for general sales taxes, which (as p > p5)

leads to a long—run decline in          Property revenues rise slightly

in the long—run, implying that property rates were initially reduced

as BitS rose. Finally, for cities in subsample 3, the loss of

property tax deductibility again reveals the familiar pattern. As

flROP rises, property rates are reduced and property tax revenues

rise in the long—run. To offset the short—run loss of revenues, tax

rate, on local income taxes are likely to be increased. As a



                                   21
 consequence, long—run revenues rise for income taxes (as p < p).

 With the increase in BTPROPJ the rates for selective silos taxes may

 rise of fall, but if they fall (as they did in subsample 2) and if     ji


 tS for   these taxes (see below) then revenues       will decline as
observed.     The loss of income tax deductibility (BTINC increases)

leads to a lowering of income tax rates and a short—run and long—run

loss of income tax revenues (again as z < p). To offset the short—

run revenue loss, property tax rates and selective sales rates may be

increased; these adjustments will lead to the estimated long—run

decline in property tax revenues (as    p > is') and long—rn increase in
selective sales revenue (if p ( s'). The loss of selective sales tax

deductibility (BTSS up) is likely to lead to a lowering of these

rates. If so. and as           declines, we must conclude that sample 3

cities are on the rising segment of their selective sales revenue

curve that is, p C u'       Finally, the fall in       is offset by our

incresse in income tax revenues as income tax rates are raised.

        The reactions of user fees and license revenues to changes in

deductibility also show a logical pattern.      The bulk of fees and

license revenues are charges to business for city services (transport.

sewerage, sanitation, airports). While my    measures of deductibility
focus    ou households as taxpayers, the variation in household tax

prices from deductibility provisions, tax credits, and state    tax rates
are   likely to be positively correlated with a deductibility benefit

for firms as   well.   If so, an observed loss of deductibility threatens

firm exit from the city too. A logical strategy for cities is to

lower firm taxes. Fees and license revenues is one of the major

 taxes cities now impose on business. Thus an increase in BIflOP,




                                      22
 BTINC, BTGS, and BTSS should have negative effects on fees (F).

 Generally they do. The only important exception is the positive

 effect of an increase in BTSS on F for subsample 2; the positive

 adjustments in F are very nail however, for BTSS varies at most by 4%

 (thus F varies by about 5% =   1.22 x 4%). Vhere swings in tax prices
 are important, the elasticity of foes is negative.

      With most reduced—form analyses one can only speculate as to the

 underlying structure which produces the observed behaviour. This

 study is no exception. Yet such speculations are a useful test" of

 the validity of the empirical analysis. Do possibly counter—intuitive

 empirical results have a plausible and consistent structural

explanation? If so, our confidence in those estimates increases. I

have argued that the empirical results of Tables 1 and 2 can be

supported by such a structural explanation. To be sure, more research

is needed to reveal the true structure of local fiscal choice, but the

model presented here of short—run politics and   long—rn   economics must

be regarded as a plausible contender.26


IV. Deductibility Reform and City Revenues

     Table 3 summarizes the predicted effects of alternative

deductibility reform proposals on city revenues, first for our full

sample and then for each of the three subsamples. (A data appendix

lists the cities in each subsample.) For each reform, I estimate the

implied dollar change from the average 1980 values of real (deflated)

taxes per capita CT) and real fees per capita (F) for each sample.

The initial 1980 levels of taxes and fees are listed in Table   3. I
also calculate the percentage change in taxes or fees from their 1980

values.

         Policy options 1 to 4 remove deductibility for local property

  taxation only (1), general sales
                                     taxation only (2), income taxation
  only   (3). and finally for all local
                                           taxes Simultaneously (4). To
  estimate effects of reform on revenues, the revenue elasticities in

  Table 2 corresponding to each tax price and sample were
                                                          multiplied by
  the percentage increase in each
                                    deductibility component. I assume the
 deductibility component of tax price will rise to 1.0 when federal

 deductibility is removed. This is an overestimate of the change in

 tax price since state deductibility of
                                             local taxes and state tax
 credits for property taxation
                                  may not disappear. The estimates in
 Table 2 are therefore maximal estimates
                                             of revenue adjustment. The
 total effect on city revenues will be the sum of the dollar changes in

 taxes and fees.

      Policy options 5 to 8 all seek to reduce
                                                   the possible negative
 effects on state and local revenues of reform while retaining the

 potential efficiency and tax equity advantages of removing

deductibility. To reduce the potential revenue loss to state and

 local governments, particnlarly in the short—run, we can either allow

partial deductibility (options S and 6) or offer offsetting subsidies

to taxpayers (option 7) or to local
                                       governments (option 8) directly.
Each of these modified proposals,
                                    however, will reduce the net savings
to the Treasury from reform.    Treasury and ACIR (1985 chapter 3)

estimate that option 4, full removal of deductibility, will save *34

billion of federal tax revenues
                                  annually. Policy optiona 5—8 allocate
some of theee savings to ease the burden of reform. To Insure

comparability, the policy parameters of proposals 5 to 8 are set so

that each costs approximately *19 billion in lost federal revenues;

see ACIR (1985. chapter 3).




                                      24
     Option.5only allowsdeductibil ity of local taxes which exceed a

floor of 1% of taxpayers' adjusted gross income. I have assumed the

typical itemizer is in the 28% marginal tax bracket and has an

adjusted gross income of *40.000. Thus under option 5 the taxpayer

can deduct all state and local taxes over *400. Since most taxpayers

pay in excess of *400/year in state—loc.l taxes, the taxpayers can

still itemize marginal local tax payments. The price effect of

deductibility remains. However, itemizers loses .28 x *400 in lost

deductions or approximately *120/year. This income loss can reduce

local taxes and fees (see Table 1; CIINC coefficient). If we assume

the resulting loss in income per capita is about *30 per year

(*120/year + 4 members per family), then revenues will decline as
                        27
shown in Table 3, row 5.

     Policy Option 6 is a variation of policy 5; taxpayers are still

allowed to deduct but now only to a ceiling of 6.S% of adjusted gross

income. Beyond this ceiling local taxes are not deductible. For the

typical itemizes in the 28% marginal tax bracket and earning Mo,ooo,

state and local taxes up to *2600 per family will be deductible (=

 .065 x *40,000). Only taxpayers in very high tax states and cities

will be affected by the 6.5% ceiling. Those affected will lose

deductibility for taxes above *2600. but they retain a fixed gain   of
*728 (—.28 x $2600) from the deduction up to the ceiling. The effects

of this reform on city revenues is difficult to predict precisely.

Cities whoes itemizers pay less than their ceiling in state and local

taxes are unaffected by the reform. Cities whose typical itemizers

pay more than their ceilings may adjust revenues. This adjustment is

estimated as a combination of the revenue effects of optLon 4 offset




                                   25
by the revenue increases which remit from increased resident income

 (from income with option 4) because of the fixed gain from the partial

deduction (n   *728/family   or *182 per capita). See Table 3. row 6.

     Policy option 7 partially offsets the loss of deductibility by a

tax credit for local taxation defined as y in our •arlier definition

of the tax price. The size of the credit is set so as to cost the
                                                                         28
Treasury approximately $19 billion: y — .07 under this reform.

Co.bining lost deductibility with a 7% credit will increase the

deductibility components of sales income, and property tsr prices

from their initial values (      .86) to    .93. The resulting revenue

adjustments are reported in Table 3, row 7.

     Option 8 gives the city the direct revenue assistance to offset

any negative effects of deductibility reform.       In this reform •ll

state—local tare. lose federal deductibility but state and local

governments receive *19 billion in revenue—sharing aid as

compensation. I estimate that approximately $33 per resident will be

returned to local governments.29      Not all of the *33 transfer goes to

city services, however; some (a small amount) may be allocated to tax

relief (see Table 1; RSAID coefficient). Table 3, row 8 estimates the

equilibrium changes in tax and fees under option 8. to estimate the

total revenue effects of this reform, the *33 transfer must be added

to the estimated changes in fees and taxes.

     Other reforms are of course possible and have been suggested.

Table 3's results bound the likely effects of the other major reform

proposals. The lemp-lasten proposal which would retain deductibility

for property taxation (at 25% rate only however) but disallow

deductibility of sales and income taxes will have effects

approximately equal to the sum of those for policies 2 (sales) and 3



                                       26
(income) in Table 3. The Bradley—Gephardt tax reform plan drops sales

tax deductibility (option 2) and lowers the rate (to 14%) at which

property and income taxes can be deducted. The effects of this reform

are bounded between thosefron option 2 (only sales) and option 4

(full removal).

     That is the effect of deductibility reform on city revenues?

Four conclusions emerge frog the policy simulations in Table 3.

First, total taxes change very little in the long—run, falling by at

most 13% (reform 3, subsample 3) and generally rising slightly.

Second, fees and license revenue (predominantly a tax on fins)

generally fall, often significantly (policies 4,6, and 8 for

subsamples 2 and   3). 30   Third, the net long—run effect on total

revenues (AT +F) of full deductibility reform (options 4 to 8) is

usually positive, but when negative, the revenue loss is at most 12%

of pre—refora revenues (—       —*24.68/1201 for option 4, subsample 2).

Fourth, the offset policies 5      to   8 reduce the revenue effects

significantly. In fact, the revunue—sharing offset (policy 8)

substantially increases city revenues once we add *33 per capita of

revenue—sharing aid to the city budget.

     While the results in Table 3 should be encouraging to the

proponents of state and local deductibility reform, we must remember

that these estimates apply only to large cities and they measure only

the long—run effects of dropping deductibility. States and suburban

goveraents say behave quite differently; see lenyon (1985) and

Graslich (1935). And    there    is no doubt that in the short—run cities

will feel the pressure to lower taxes and public services.




                                          27
V. Conclusion: Should We Drop Deductibility?

       Removing the deductibility of state and local taxes has emerged

as the cornerstone of the recent efforts to reform the current federal

tax code. While numerous other deductions or 'loopholes ire closed

by the Treasury's tax package, it is state and local deductibility

reform which provides the revenues needed to lower overall rates and

to raise the level of personal exemptions. While fewer loopholes or a

simplier tax code is always a worthwhile objective, one suspects it is

tat relief which makes the Treasury's proposal so politically

appealing. Yet it is important to consider the removal of state and

local tax deductibility as a policy in its own right, not simply as a

source of new federal revenues. The enpirial analysis presented here

may help us to decide the issue.




       First, the major efficiency gains from deductibility reform, at

least for our central cities, will come not from     lower   local public

spending but from a more efficient structure of local taxation.

Deductibility reform is likely to lower tax rates on property1 retail

sales, and wage income in the center cities. Each of these taxes is a

source of significant resource misallocation, discouraging the

efficient location of housing and productive capital.31 Further, as

our   central   cities appear to be on the downward aide of their rate—

revenue schedules for property and sales taxation, lower rates may

actually mean more revenues and thus public services. Deductibility

reform "shocks" the central city away from a politically expedient.



                                       28
 but economically inefficient. structure of local finance.

        Second, there are gains in public sector equity, but a full

 federal—state—local budgetary incidence will be required to weigh the

 pluses and minuses across income classes. The removal of

 deductibility itself and the return of those revenues as lower tax

 rates and higher personal exemptions clesrly helps lower income

 families.   Only rich families are         itemizers, while all households gain

from the reduction in federal rates. The likely incidence effects

within   the local public sector      are more difficult to judge. Local
taxes   nay become more regressive to the extent cities can        legally   tilt

their rste structures, and city services (as argued in 111—B above)

are likely to become more pro—rich. Yet city services may also

increase for all households in        the   long—run as city revenues rise. It

is not clear the center city poor will lose services in the long—run.

Public services in the suburbs are likely to fall, however. If

suburban governments have avoided the politically inefficient           revenue

trap0 and are still on the rising portion of the tax rate—revenue

schedule, then   the   loss of deductibility will lesd to lower service

demands by as much as ten percent (Gramlich. 1985). Thus

deductibility   reform nay   narrow   public service inequities between city

and suburban residents. On balance lower income, non—itemizers gain

federal tax relief and    possibly    lose local public services. Upper

income itemizers within the city pay higher federal taxes but gain

local public services. Upper income ite.izers within the suburbs will

pay higher federal taxes and lose local public services. Whether

these re—allocations constitute a net gain in social equity clearly

depends on   one's   sense of fairness and relative weighting of public




                                            29
vs. private goods.

be too little variation in the dependent variable over the sample

                                   31
deductibility or taxpayer itemization (often used as a proxy for

deductibility). Therefore the estimated infloence of deductibility

may be badly biased in such studies. Estimation using pooled cross—

section, times—series data is the only solution to these proble.s.

local income taxation as well, but information on the exact limits

were not available for all years of our sample. That data were

available showed little variation (rates usually between 1% and 2%)

across the cities in our staple. Thus the tax—access dummy variables

DI and DOS will, in effect, be rate limit dummy variables where DI —0

and DOS   0 mean a rate limit equal to 0.

     It is important to emphasize that even when cities face effective

rate limits, tax revenues from the constrained tax are still

endogenous as city's often retain control over tax base and always

retain control over enforcement and collection, Tax rates are only

one, though probably the most important, of the control variables to

limit local revenues.

mOat programs are limited by income, only those taxpayers in each city

who are income eligible are allowed a value of y > 0. If in age

restriction also applies (often only taxpayers over 62 are eligible),

y was multiplied by the percent of households in the city over the age

limit. A similar adjustment was made if the program was limited to

homeowners; y was multiplied by the percent of households who are

homeowners. Unfortunately data on age and hone ownership by income

class ire not available by city; thus a more precise estimate of the

average rate of credit could not be calculated.

     The percent of general sales taxation paid by non—residents

(PNRGS) was estimated as the ratio —    (total   retail sales in the city —

resident   purchases)/(total retail sales in the city), where resident

purchases was approximated by the share of residents' disposable

income apent on taxable items. Taxable items under general sales

taxation generally include all expenditures except services,

transportation, health care, and housing; the taxable sharp was

estimated to be .6 of disposable income (see Honthakker and Taylor

(1970) or Rock (Table 1. 1984). Data for retail sales in the city and

       The percent of selective sales taxation paid by non—residents

(PNRSS) is in principle estimated by the ratio —         (total   selective

sales in the city —     resident   purchases of selective sales)/(total

selective sales in the city), where 'selective saless is defined to

include public utility sales in cities which tax public utility sales

and entertainment, hotel, and recreation activities in cities which

tax these activities. Data on entertainment, hotel and recreation

expenditures in cities are available from Sales Management. Survey of

Buying Power; 1960—1980. The residents' expenditures on

entertainment, hotel and recreation within the city was           estimated   as

 .03   of residents' disposable income; this share is one—kilt of the

total share of disposable income generally allocated to such

activities; see Houthakker and      Taylor    (1970). Data on public utility

sales are not available by city. I therefore assumed all of public

utility taxes — the bulk of which are paid by firms —             fall   on non—

residents. With this adjustment PNRSS is now approximated by the

ratio —   (public   utility taxes +   G(total   selective sales taxes —     public
utility taxes)/(selective sales taxes), where 0 equals the non—

residents share of entertainment, hotel, and recreation expenditures

17The variable, ratio of city to suburban income (KCSI), has been used

with some success in other work Unman, 1982) to measure the potential

mobility of city residents to suburbs. Cities whose mean household



                                         37
income is low relative to mean suburban income have poor residents

surrounded by relatively rich suburbs (small valu,s of RCSI) while

cities whose sean income is high relative to mean suburban inocme have

relatively rich residents surrounded by poor suburbs (high values of

RCSI). In both instances, acceptable suburban housing will be

unavailable to city residents who wish to leave. Exit will therefore

be limited. Regions where mean city and suburban incomes are

approximately equal will have acre extensive suburban housing options

for city residents, and the threat of exitwill be more intensely felt

by city officials. The ideal specification is therefore RCSI and

RCSI2. This specification was    tried,     and in all cases a minimum or

aaxnaum was achieved well beyond the limits of our sample. To

conserve degrees of freedom the log specification was therefore

adopted.



18For a discussion of the New York fiscal crisis and similar crises in

Cleveland and Philadelphia. see Inman (1983). Prompted by these

events, the period 1975 to 1980 was      a time    of increased public

scrutiny of central city budgets and tax      structures.

      omitted   tax category is defined as        other   taxes by the U.S.

Bureau of the Census public.tion, City Government Finances.



20The difference. are generally statistically significant. The

initially hypothesized specification is that T — a +               +     + e,
where r = (l—BTPROP)(l—PCI).   If included separately the estimated
                                     A
coefficient of (1—BTPROP), denoted         should equal P       (1—PCI) while

 PtIRINC/SAL) from Table 1 does not reject the equality of those

 coefficients however; t a
                              G/a
                                    —   .43.   Yet over all subsample revenue

 regression. we can generally reject equality of the components of r GS
  SS        INC
      and v     . La I shall argue below there are compelling reasons

for different effects of these variables on city revenues; see section

Ill—B.



21The arguments for the separate effects of deductibility and non-

resident taxation on city revenues raises the possiblity that PCI,

PNEGS. PNRSS, and PNRI are not exogenous but in fact deternined in

part by revenues. To test for the possibility of serious simultaneous

equation bias in our estimates of the effects of deductibility on

revenues, I re—estimated all models excluding PCI, PNRGS, PNRSS, PNRT,

and (for similar reasona) ASBINT. The coefficients on the

deductibility variables were essentially unchanged.



22'rax revenues       are maximized at the rate where ati8u a                +
           ao     where (r)   pB(p) and (w) is the elasticity of tax

base, B(jt). with respect to the tax rate u• As the tax base becomes

more responsive to changes in tax rate, the elasticity becomes more



                                         39
negative and the value of atia declines. For constant

elasticities at least, this implies that              will reach 0 at

lower values of M as tax bases become sore elastic.



23See Fair (1978). Given the high mobility of voters into and out of

local comeunities, the what—have—you—done—for_ne_latelys mentality

may be rational for local voters as well. See Inman (1982) on pension

funding.



24See Grieson (1974) on property taxation and Grieson fl j. (1977)

for sales taxation.



25Labor supply elasticities are generally lot, but sOre iaportantly

the elasticity of job location with respect to tax rates is also

modest. Gruenstein (1980) estimates that while Philadelphia does lose

jobs with tax increases, total wage tax revenues are still increasing.



26The implicit structure of the model presented here will define local

tax rates U(r)) and revenues (t(t)) as the outcome of an economic

process which defines a long—run revenue schedule —      t (r)   —   f(ja
                                                                            (r)
                                                                                  ;T).

where 7 are exogenous economic variables — and a short—run political

reaction function which selects (11(t),   (r))   combinations subject to a

set of political variables (Z) and current period tax bases which are

themselves a function of 7 and past revenue policies —               —


Z. 7;g), tr). Equilibrium allocations occur when

the political resction function intersects the long—run revenue curve;

see Figure 2. The reduced form of this model becomes:




                                    40
                 (r)
             t           t (r) (T,Z;,71,2)


Which is the specification outlined in equations (1) —        (5) above.
Economic constraints define the 7 variables while political

constraints and legal constraints are included in Z.        Deductibility
reform influences             directly through 7 and indirectly through the

political reaction function via 7_i.



27Tbe subsample results are based upon estimated effects of CINC on T

and F from subsample revenue regressions not reported here, The

effects are similar to those given in Table 1 for the full sample.

Subsample regressions are available from the author upon request.



28The credit is defined so as to return $19 billion to the state and

local sector as a subsidy to state and local taxation. I estimate

state and local taxes to be about $260 billion in 1985; thus y =

*19b1*260b        .07.




29The general revenue sharing program will spend $19 billion per year

or $85 per capita. Approximately 39 percent of total state and local

taxes are raised by local governments. If federal aid is divided

between the state and local sectors according to resident taxes paid.

then 39 percent of total aid or *33 per capita (— .39 x *85) will be

given to local governments.



301t should be noted that the Treasury's most recent proposal

continues to permit firms to deduct state and local taxes as a



                                          41
business expense. If the argument in section III is correct that fees

ire reduced to soften the blow to firms of lost deductibility, then

the induced reduction in fees under the Treasury pin should be less

than the losses reported in Table 3. There may still be pressure to

lower fees under the Treasury proposal to the extent that lost

deductibility for households is shifted to firms. For example, fins

ny bear the burden of differential local wage and sales taxation. In

any case, the fee reductions in Ttbl• 3 are likely to be an on outer

estimate of the revenue loss with deductibility reform.



31See, for example, Grieson (1974) sad   Kaurin (1981).
