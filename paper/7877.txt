I.     Introduction

       At least since Nelson (1959) and Arrow (1962), economists have been aware that

competitive markets may fail to provide the socially optimal level of R&D investment.

Technological innovation is beset by uncertainty, imperfect monitoring and imperfect property

rights that lead many to conclude that R&D investment by private firms is too low (Griliches,

1998; Romer, 1990). In this context, special attention is paid to the role of small, entrepreneurial

firms since such firms may be particularly susceptible to the capital and product market

imperfections identified by Arrow and Nelson. Specifically, technology-based entrepreneurs

may be unable to raise R&D investment capital (Kamien and Schwartz, 1982; Holmstrom, 1989)

and be poorly positioned to extract the social value created by their innovations (Teece, 1987;

Anton and Yao, 1994).

       From an empirical perspective, perhaps the most puzzling fact about innovation by small

technology-based firms is how concentrated it is among a small number of economic sectors.

Even after limiting attention to sectors which experience high overall rates of R&D investment

and innovation, only a small subset of these sectors are associated with high rates of R&D

investment innovation by small, entrepreneurial firms (National Science Foundation, 1999). For

example, during the rapid increase in the level of venture capital financing during the 1990s, VC

expenditures have been targeted at a relatively narrow set of sectors, such as software

development, telecommunications, and biotechnology (Kortum and Lerner, 1998).                These

patterns raise a critical question: what are the drivers of inter-industry variation in small firm

R&D financing?
                                                                                                                  2


          We address this question by considering three (not mutually exclusive) forces:

technological opportunity, appropriability and capital constraints. To the extent that economic

sectors vary according to these factors, R&D expenditures and realized rates of technological

innovation will vary accordingly. For example, at a given point in time, some sectors may

experience higher levels of technological opportunity (i.e., the ability to generate an innovation

of a given social value for a given level of expenditure); it should not be surprising that these

sectors are associated with the highest rates of R&D investment and realized innovation. Indeed,

most prior analyses of the skewed distribution of R&D expenditures have focused on variation in

the level of technological opportunity as the “culprit” for uneven financing and rates of

technological change among economic sectors (Schmookler, 1966; Rosenberg, 1974; Adams,

1990).1

          However, particularly when considering the distribution of innovative activity by smaller,

more entrepreneurial, firms, concentration may also result from differences in the salience of

either product market imperfections (i.e., appropriability) or capital market imperfections (i.e.,

capital constraints). Appropriability is the degree to which technological innovation results in

spillovers to consumers or more established firms, thus limiting the extent to which an innovator

extracts the marginal social product associated with their innovation. Small firms face particular

appropriability problems, either because they are less likely to possess “complementary assets,”

such as a brand-name reputation, a distribution system, or installed base (Teece, 1987), or

because of their relative inability to obtain complete intellectual property for their innovations

(Anton and Yao, 1994; Gans and Stern, 2000). To the extent that sectors differ substantially in

terms of the importance of complementary assets or the strength of intellectual property, it is

1
 Most quantitative work in this area attempts to analyze whether publicly financed basic research provides a spur to
private R&D expenditures by increasing the level of technological opportunity in specific areas (Adams, 1990;
                                                                                                                   3


likely that sectors with low levels of appropriability will be associated with the lowest levels of

investment and innovation by small research-oriented firms.2

        Finally, R&D investment may be constrained by capital market imperfections (i.e.,

contracting problems between investors and inventors). By its very nature, R&D investment by

external investors engenders information asymmetries and contractual incompleteness between

the financier and the research firm (Kamien and Schwartz, 1982; Holmstrom, 1989). Among

other concerns, contractual incompleteness can result in (a) inefficient effort provision by the

research firm (Aghion and Tirole, 1994; Hellman, 1998a), (b) the potential for hold-up by the

research firm of the investors (Anand and Galetovic, 1999) or (c) an adverse selection problem

whereby external investors cannot distinguish between profitable and unprofitable projects

(Stiglitz and Weiss, 1981; Hubbard, 1998). To the extent that the salience of these imperfections

for small firms varies across different industrial segments, R&D expenditures and the level of

technological innovation will reflect this variation.3

        The goal of this paper is to develop and implement an empirical framework that begins to

disentangle these alternative sources of inter-industry variance. Specifically, we derive a test for

the presence of variation in the salience of capital and product market imperfections across

industrial segments, while simultaneously allowing for controls for the level of technological



Toole, 1999; Hall, 1999).
2
  While several researchers have attempted to document both the extent of inter-industry variation in appropriability
and the variation in the mechanisms used to appropriate the rents from innovation in different industries (Levin, et.
al., 1987; Cockburn and Griliches, 1988; Klenow, 1996; Cohen, Nelson, and Walsh, 2000), prior research tends to
focus on the appropriability conditions facing larger established firms (for which data has been more readily
available). Moreover, because the analysis focuses on projects which are themselves funded by the private sector,
these prior analyses have not disentangled the relative salience of technological opportunity, capital market
imperfections, and appropriability.
3
  Prior empirical work on the impact of capital market imperfections focuses on the sensitivity of R&D expenditures
to measures of capital liquidity (e.g., measures of firm’s cash flow), both for broad samples of firms (Hall, 1992;
Hao and Jaffe, 1993; Geroski, 1994) as well as for studies specifically focused on smaller firms where capital
constraints may be more likely to bind (Himmelberg and Petersen, 1994). However, prior research has not linked
capital constraints to the sectoral concentration of R&D funding.
                                                                                                                   4


opportunity for individual R&D projects. In so doing, our results shed light on the sources of the

concentration of small-firm R&D financing.

        Our test relies on evaluating the empirical relationship between the performance of R&D

projects performed by small firms but subsidized by the Federal government (more specifically,

through the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program) and the level of private

finance for small firm venture financing in those sectors.4 After controlling for technological

opportunity, if subsidized project performance is highest in those sectors where private funding

is lowest, this suggests that differences in funding across segments are, at least in part, the result

of differences in capital constraints. Alternatively, if subsidized project performance is highest

in those sectors where private funding is high, this suggests that differences across segments are

the result, at least in part, of variation in the level of appropriability.

        Consider two extreme examples. First, suppose the only differences across sectors are

from variation in the salience of capital market imperfections (i.e., there is no variation in the

level of appropriability or technological opportunity). In this environment, the lowest level of

private R&D financing will be associated with sectors most constrained by imperfections in the

capital market. As well, the most promising projects that go unfunded by the private sector (i.e.,

“marginal” projects) will be associated with these same under-funded sectors. If the subsidy

program targets these “marginal” candidates, there will be a negative relationship between the

sector-specific average performance of subsidized projects and the sector level of private

financing.



4
  By examining performance differences across subsidized projects, this paper differs from prior attempts to evaluate
inter-sectoral differences in the environment for small-firm R&D. By and large, such studies have analyzed samples
that are subject to an important selectivity – they have indeed been funded by the private sector (Mansfield, 1995;
Griliches, 1998; Hall, 1988; Hall, 1992; Himmelberg and Petersen, 1994) and so it is difficult to isolate the
differences in capital market imperfections from more downstream issues such as the appropriablity regime.
                                                                                                                        5


         On the other hand, consider an environment in which differences across sectors are

driven solely by variation in the level of appropriability. In this case, sectors with the highest

level of private funding will be associated with the highest level of appropriability. At the same

time, high-appropriability sectors will offer the most attractive “marginal” candidate projects for

the subsidy program. Consequently, under this scenario, there will be a positive correlation

between average sector-level project performance and the level of private investment at the

sector level. As we show in Section III, it is possible to consider variance in both capital

constraints and appropriability at the same time: if the SBIR funds projects “on the margin” then,

under the simplest functional form, the correlation between subsidized project performance and

the level of funding is equal to the difference in the variance associated with appropriability and

the variance associated with capital constraints.5

         We explore these ideas using a novel dataset of SBIR-funded projects.6 As described

further in Section V, the survey identifies performance measures at the project level and

incorporates detailed controls for firm size, organizational and financial structure, and the

commercialization strategy associated with each innovation.                        The main empirical exercise

evaluates the relationship between project-level performance and the level of private venture

financing in the industrial sector to which each project belongs. Our principal finding is that

project-level performance is strongly positively correlated with the level of private venture

capital. Even after incorporating various controls (including two distinct measures to control for

technological opportunity), a doubling of the level of private venture capital is associated with


5
  Section III also highlights several limitations associated with this test (along with potential remedies), including the
importance of (a) controlling for technological opportunity, (b) accounting for the SBIR project selection
mechanism and (c) the direct impact of subsidy financing on project performance.
6
  As such, our approach differs substantially from prior work on the SBIR (in particular Lerner (1996) and Wallsten
(2000)). Both of these prior studies seeks to identify the incremental benefits of an SBIR grant relative to privately
funded research; in contrast, we examine the differences across funded firms in order to understand how different
segments differ in terms of the environment for innovation for smaller firms.
                                                                                                                  6


over a 50% increase in expected project performance.                       Simply put, the most successful

subsidized projects are in those industrial segments that have attracted a high rate of private

investment.          Consistent with our framework, we interpret these results as suggesting that

industrial sectors vary in their degree of appropriability for research-oriented small businesses; in

other words, variation in appropriability helps explain the relative concentration of venture

capital activity in a small number of industrial segments.



II.        The Concentration of R&D and Venture Capital Expenditures

           Our starting point is the concentration of venture financing among industrial segments.

Consider first the concentration of privately funded R&D expenditure. Figure 1A presents the

Lorenz distribution of R&D funding relative to value added across the manufacturing sector of

the U.S. economy.7 Relative to the distribution of aggregate economic activity (even confined to

the manufacturing sector), a small share of sectors (such as the pharmaceutical, computer

equipment, and transportation industries) account for most of privately financed R&D (e.g., the

Gini coefficient is .60).

           This relative concentration of innovative investment becomes even more pronounced

when one examines venture capital financing or the financing of R&D in small and medium-

sized firms. Using data drawn from Kortum and Lerner (1998), Figure 1B compares the relative

distribution of venture financing by industrial segment relative to the (already concentrated)

privately financed R&D investment. Though there are difficulties in uniquely assigning venture

capital investments into specific SIC-oriented sectors, Figure 1B suggests that, even among

         R&D j
of   VALUE ADDED j
                     .
                                                                                                          7


R&D-intensive sectors, a very small number receive a very high share of the overall funds from

venture capital sources (here the Gini coefficient is .54).8 Taken together, Figures 1A and 1B

suggest that the concentrated nature of investment by small firms is not merely driven by

difference in raw technological opportunity (which would presumably be reflected in the

aggregate R&D distribution shown in 1A) but depend on the ability of small firms to attract

finance for risky but potentially valuable innovation investments and their ability to translate

their technological success into private economic returns (thus accounting for the additional

concentration present in 1B). The remainder of this paper develops an empirical framework

testing for the presence of two alternative drivers of this “excess” concentration: appropriability

and capital constraints.



III.    A Simple Model of Sector-Level Variation in Innovative Expenditure

        This section derives a test for the sources of variation among sectors resulting in the

concentrated nature of venture financing activity. Our test relies on the association between the

performance of government-subsidized projects and the level of private financing available in

different economic sectors. We demonstrate that, if variation in capital constraints is important

for understanding differences across sectors, the average performance of SBIR grantees is likely

to be negatively associated with observed levels of venture capital funding. This is because the

funding mechanism identifies high potential performers only in industries where those are not

otherwise likely to be funded. Alternatively, a positive association between average performance

and venture capital funding will be indicative of the relative importance of appropriability as

8
  Indeed, while economists have mostly ignored this observation, its validity is a widely accepted and well-
documented feature of the venture finance industry (www.ventureone.com). As well, similar concentration is
                                                                                                   8


explaining differences across industries in terms of small firm research financing. To derive this

empirical test, we first develop a model of the equilibrium level of private funding for small firm

research in the presence of both appropriability and capital constraints and then derive the

implications for the performance of subsidized projects. In addition, our discussion highlights

several potential limitations (and associated remedies) for our proposed test, including those

arising from (a) the importance of controlling for technological opportunity (b) alternative

funding mechanism for SBIR project selection and (c) the direct impact of government subsidy

on project performance.



Players, Payoffs and Choice Variables

       Our model focuses on the relationship between funding and performance of research

projects undertaken by independent research units (each is denoted as an RU). A single RU, j,

can potentially engage in R&D for a single project requiring a single unit of capital investment.

Capital financing may be provided by two sources: a venture capitalist (VC) or by a government

subsidy. We assume that the capital contribution of the VC is contractible and competitive (i.e.,

there are a potentially large number of homogenous VCs who contemplate financing RU

projects). If the project is financed, a commercializable innovation is generated with probability

p. p may be endogenous, in that the success probability may depend on either the effort or ability

(type) of RU j.

       If the R&D project is technologically successful, the innovation creates a total social

value, Vj, of which the RU (and their equity partners) appropriate v j (V j , γ i ) where γi

parameterizes the ‘distance’ between Vj and vj in industry i. vj(.) is assumed to be non-decreasing

                                                                                                  9


in Vj and γi. γi therefore measures the level of appropriability in industry i. Of course, there are

many potential determinants of γi, including the strength of intellectual property and ease of

technological imitation (Arrow, 1963; Anton and Yao, 1994), the degree of product market

competition (Kremer, 1998), and asymmetries among innovators and competitors in the

ownership of “complementary assets” necessary for effective commercialization (Teece, 1987;

Bresnahan, Stern, and Trajtenberg, 1997).       Variation in each of these factors can result in

differential levels of appropriability for independent RUs, insofar as each may increase the

“wedge” between the private and social returns associated with innovation.

         As well, for each industry i, there is a distribution of the total social returns across

potential projects. Specifically, we assume that each project is drawn from an industry-level

distribution that is uniform over [0,Vi ] . By construction, then, a shift in Vi is equivalent to

shifting out the level of technological opportunity in industry i.



The Level of VC Funding

         The equilibrium level of private venture finance in industry i will be determined by the

measure of projects whose private expected benefits exceed the marginal private cost of project

funding. We assume that, for each industry i, these costs are determined according to c( Fi ,θ i )

where Fi is the total level of industry funding, θi parameterizes the industry-specific difference

between the private and social cost of capital, and c(.) is non-decreasing in both Fi and θi. That

is, the supply curve of capital for RU projects is (potentially) upward-sloping and, relative to the

socially efficient schedule, the impact of capital market imperfections is to shift upward the

supply schedule of capital.

                                                                                                10


       This is obviously a reduced-form specification; the net impact of imperfections in the

capital market reflects more specific contracting hazards between investors and inventors,

including (a) inefficient effort provision as the result of imperfect monitoring (Holmstrom, 1989;

Aghion and Tirole, 1994; Hellman, 1998a), (b) inefficient grouping of projects with different v

as the result of imperfect observability of project quality (Stiglitz and Weiss, 1981) and (c)

potential ex-post expropriation of the rents from innovation by the investors as the result of

imperfect property rights over the inventor’s knowledge (Anton and Yao, 1994; Gans and Stern,

2000). In Appendix A, we demonstrate that, consistent with our characterization, each of these

individual effects results in raising the private cost of capital above the social cost of capital;

however, since we do not disentangle the differential impact of each of these more nuanced

mechanisms in the empirical work, here we aggregate these effects into the single index of the

level of imperfections in the capital market, θi.

       The demand for capital from VCs is determined by the distribution of expected private

returns for projects, pvj, and so will be downward-sloping as the result of the distribution of

project quality. The equilibrium level of funding will be determined by the interaction between

private capital demand and the upward-sloping marginal cost of funding (see Figure 2). The

number of funded projects, Fi, is determined by the distribution of project value in the industry;

the social value of the marginal project is equal to Vˆi = Vi − Fi . This relationship allows us to

derive how the equilibrium level of funding and marginal expected performance relate to the

structural parameters of the model:

                                 pvˆi (Vi − Fˆi , γ i ) = c( Fˆi ,θ i )             (1)
                                                                                                           11



In terms of total funding, Fˆi (Vi , γ i ,θ i ) is increasing in Vi and γi but falling in θi. That is, an

increase in technological opportunity ( Vi ) or appropriability (γi) shift demand and hence Fˆi

upwards, while an increase in capital imperfections (θi ) shifts supply upward, reducing Fˆi . Of

course, since projects are undertaken only if pv j (V j , γ i ) ≥ c( Fi ,θ i ) , the level of private

investment will be less than socially desirable as long as there are any capital market

imperfections or less-than-perfect appropriability.

        Expected marginal project performance ( pvˆi (Vi − Fˆi (V ,θ i , γ i ), γ i ) ) will also be sensitive

to the degree of capital imperfections and the level of appropriability. While greater capital

market imperfections will be associated with higher vˆi (as the result of upward shifts of the

capital supply curve along the capital demand curve), lower levels of appropriability will be

associated with lower expected marginal project returns (as the result of movement downward

along the capital supply curve).



Marginal Project Performance and Private Funding Levels

        These comparative statics allow us to derive our test for the presence of alternative

sources of variance across industrial segments.              On the one hand, while the expected

performance of the “marginal” project in industry i, pvˆi , is increasing in the level of capital

constraints (θi), low levels of appropriability are predicted to be associated with lower

performance levels for the marginal project. On the other hand, both capital and product market

imperfections will contribute to lower levels of overall private funding ( Fˆi ). As a result, after

controlling for technological opportunity, the sign of the correlation between private funding and
                                                                                                           12


marginal project performance provides a test for the presence of variance in either the level of

capital constraints or appropriability across multiple economic sectors.

Proposition 1. Consider a set of industries where the level of private funding and marginal
project performance are determined according to (1). Then
        (a)    If Var(γ i ) = 0 , Cov[vˆi , Fˆi | Vi ] ≤ 0
        (b)    If Var(θ ) = 0 , Cov[vˆ , Fˆ | V ] ≥ 0
                           i             i   i   i


In other words, if there is no variance in the level of appropriability (capital constraints), then,

after controlling for the level of technological opportunity, the correlation between private

funding levels and marginal project performance will be non-positive (non-negative).

Consequently, a finding of a positive (negative) correlation allows us to reject

Var(γ i ) = 0 (Var(θ i ) = 0) .

        Proposition 1 follows from the fact that if only θi varies (and there is no variance in

appropriability and we control for technological opportunity), then the industry equilibrium pairs

(vˆi , Fˆi ) lie along a single capital demand curve. As a result, increasing the level of capital

constraints will be associated with increases in the performance of marginal projects alongside

decreases in the overall level of funding (and conversely for the case of variance in (γi).

        Moreover, if we are willing to assume specific functional forma for c(.) and v(.) we can

extend Proposition 1 and derive the structural relationship inherent in the covariance between

industry-level R&D funding and marginal project performance. In the simplest (linear) case, the

covariance of Fˆi and vˆi is negatively correlated if and only if the variance of θi exceeds the

variance in pv(.) (and vice versa).

Proposition 2. Suppose that c( Fi ,θ i ) = Fi + θ i and v(Vi , γ i ) = Vi − (α − γ i ) and that Vi , γi and θi
are independent random variables and γ i ∈ [0,α ] . Then the correlation between marginal

An Empirical Test for the Presence of Variance in the Level of Appropriability and/or Capital
Constraints

            To translate Propositions 1 and 2 into a concrete empirical test, we need to identify

measures of the equilibrium pair ( Fˆi , vˆi ) across different industries.                                                              In that regard, given a

selection of industrial segments, Fˆi , the level of private R&D financing (for small firms), is

readily observable. However, if the sample of projects are funded and performed by the private

sector, it will be difficult (if not infeasible) to identify a measure for vˆi , the performance of the

“marginal” project for each industry. Since private R&D financing is provided to projects which

exceed the funding criterion, only a small set will be “on the margin” in terms of funding

viability in any given industry. Instead, we propose to use the performance of projects that are

subsidized by the government but performed by small and medium sized firms in the private

sector as our measure of vˆi , namely a set of SBIR-funded projects.

            From a public finance perspective, an efficient R&D subsidy program specifically funds

projects that satisfy the social but not the private criterion for investment. As a result, to the

extent that a government program funds projects also considered by the private sector, then,
                                                                                                14


under efficient funding, subsidized projects will consist of those just below the private funding

threshold (i.e., the marginal projects in each industrial segment). Even if the government does

not specifically seek to identify marginal projects but offers a funding source which is “less

preferred” than private venture finance, then the government will once again end up subsidizing

those projects which just miss out on private funding. As well, by examining the SBIR (a

subsidy program specifically targeted at R&D financing for small firms), we implement our test

in order to evaluate the constraints on small firm financing (i.e., we examine the covariance

between private venture finance for small firms and the performance of SBIR projects). In so

doing, our examination focuses on an area where variation in appropriability and capital

constraints are particularly important (for small firms) in contrast to the more general pattern of

technological opportunity that may be driving the concentration of aggregate R&D expenditures.

Consequently, the performance of projects resulting from a subsidy aimed at small and medium-

sized firms provides a useful index of industry-level marginal performance of small firms.

While we consider several limitations to this measure (and potential remedies) below, the

relationship between the performance of subsidized projects ( vˆi ) and industry-level private

financing ( Fˆi ) provides a concrete empirical approach to determining the relative salience of

capital constraints and appropriability in explaining the variance of small-firm venture financing

across industries.



Limitations and Potential Remedies

       Without further amendment or caveats, it would seem that the proposed procedure

provides a consistent test for the hypotheses in Proposition 1 only under relatively stringent

conditions: variance in technological opportunity is either absent or controlled for, the
                                                                                                                       15


government-subsidized projects are at the margin of industry performance, and there is no direct

impact of the government subsidy on project performance itself. While relaxing each of these

assumptions requires a somewhat more nuanced interpretation of our results, we can address

each concern so that, while we keep each of these factors in mind, we are able to implement the

test implied by Proposition 1.

         First, as Proposition 1 highlights, a consistent hypothesis test for the presence of variance

in the level of capital constraints or appropriability is conditioned on a control for the level of

technological opportunity. Indeed, traditional evaluations of the sources of R&D funding are

often unable to disentangle the salience of market imperfections from the overall level of

technological opportunity.9           However, we employ two separate mechanisms to provide a

consistent control for the level of technological opportunity for each of the subsidized projects in

our sample. As discussed earlier, our analysis focuses on the relationship between the level of

private venture financing aimed at small firms and the performance of subsidized projects aimed

at small businesses. As such, we are able to include R&D expenditures by large firms in

industry i as a control for the level of overall technological opportunity in industry i. For

example, in the pharmaceutical industry, the level of funding by established pharmaceutical

firms provides a useful measure of perceived technological opportunity ( Vi ) in that industry

relative to the impact of market imperfections (γ i ,θ i ) specific to (smaller) biotechnology firms.10

As well, we employ a direct measure of technological opportunity – a measure of the public

9
  This inability to disentangle these factors is made difficult for two distinct reasons. First, most prior analyses focus
on the funding and performance of projects which are themselves funded by the private sector and so each project, at
least in expectation, has sufficiently overcome the presence of market imperfections to take advantage of market
opportunity (see, for example, Griliches and Cockburn, 1988; Hall and van Reenen, 2000). Second, because prior
analyses examine all firms within an industry, there is no “reference” group for which market imperfections should
be less salient but for which the level of technological opportunity should be similar to the focus group.
10
   Of course, in a specific microeconomic environment, smaller and larger firms may have differential incentives to
respond to a given technological opportunity (perhaps because of incumbency, scale economies, or the like).
                                                                                                              16


“stock” of scientific and technological knowledge associated with each project in the sample (in

the tradition of Rosenberg (1974) and Adams (1990)). Between these two measures, our analysis

provides a set of (reasonably) consistent controls for technological opportunity.

        Second, our proposed implementation to test Proposition 1 is based on the assumption

that subsidized projects are “marginal” – those projects in a given industrial segment just below

the threshold of private funding. Of course, the subsidy program could use other selection

criteria for allocating funds. For example, if projects are selected to ensure the political success

of the program, then the subsidized projects may be “cherry-picked” – the best possible projects

available to program administrators rather than the set which are socially but not privately

worthwhile.11 On the one hand, the possibility of cherry-picking qualifies our interpretation of

the results. Specifically, under a cherry-picking selection mechanism, the specification continues

to provide a consistent test for the existence of variation in the level of appropriability across

sectors but becomes a less powerful test for identifying the impact of variance in capital

constraints. While a marginal project selection mechanism “balances” the impact of variation in

appropriability with the impact of variation in capital constraints, a regime that selects only the

“best” projects provides the most powerful test about appropriability at the expense of being able

to identify the impact of capital constraints at all.               On the other hand, even if project

administrators are attempting to cherry-pick projects, they may be greatly limited in that strategy

if subsidized funding is a less preferred source of capital than private venture financing. For

example, whereas the usual delay between application and grant of a subsidy is several months,

venture financiers can immediately fund projects that they deem worthwhile. As well, VCs


However, at an industry level, there is likely a positive correlation between the overall incentives of these two
classes of firms, and so we abstract away from these nuanced effects in the present analysis.
                                                                                                                17


provide additional services beyond financial capital, including access to a network of contacts

and expertise in managing research-oriented start-up organizations (Stuart, Hong & Hybels,

1999; Hsu, 2000). Indeed, most of the respondents in our sample of SBIR firms reported

(qualitatively) that they would have preferred to attract venture finance to their projects if it had

been available to them. As such, we interpret our results both (a) keeping in mind that the

possibility of cherry-picking accentuates the impact of variance in appropriability in terms of the

estimated parameter and (b) that it is likely that SBIR-funded projects may in fact tend to be

relatively marginal projects, at least at the time of the application to the SBIR program, due to

funding preference of private entrepreneurs.

        Third, even if the government is selecting projects that are marginal from the perspective

of the private sector, the program itself may have a direct impact on the performance of the

subsidized projects that impact the salience of the test. Indeed, by construction, the SBIR

alleviates the capital constraints facing funded firms. In contrast to the tradeoff that emerges

between the provision of incentives and the taking of equity in the analysis of private investment,

the SBIR extract neither equity nor debt from the grantee. In fact, quite the opposite. The

incentives to perform the research are preserved and incentives to divert the fruits of research

away from equity holders are minimized. However, as a hands-off subsidy, SBIR grants cannot

alleviate product market imperfections or the lack of technological opportunity in a given field.

If intellectual property rights are weak in a given area, SBIR funding cannot overcome this

general bias.12 Thus, similar to the project selection mechanism, the SBIR program itself likely

reduces the power of the test for identifying the impact of variance in capital constraints (as

11
   Indeed, Wallsten provides evidence that SBIR administrators in fact do attempt to choose the “best” projects and
interprets his evidence to suggest that the SBIR funds many projects which would have received private funding
anyway (Wallsten, 2000).
                                                                                                             18


subsidization overcomes some of these constraints) and increase the power of the test for

variance in the level of appropriability (since the SBIR does not affect sector-level differences

along this dimension).

        Finally, while novel and informative, the proposed test should be interpreted

conservatively. Even under the best of circumstances, the procedure can only reject a hypothesis

of no variance in the level of appropriability (or capital constraints); rejecting this zero-variance

hypothesis along one dimension (e.g., appropriability) does not preclude the presence of variance

along the other dimension. Indeed, Proposition 2 suggests that, under the simplest functional

form and marginal funding, the estimated parameter will be equal to the difference in the

variances and so we interpret our results so that evidence in favor of one source of variance by

no means rejects variance along the other dimension. Moreover, while the model allows for a

balanced test between the variance associated with capital constraints and appropriability, it is

likely that the test will be more powerful for finding evidence for differences in appropriability;

the project selection mechanism and the incentive effects of the program mitigate against finding

direct evidence for capital constraints.



III.    The SBIR Program and R&D Investment by Small Firms

        This paper uses Proposition 1 in order to evaluate how an evaluation of the performance

of government-subsidized small R&D-intensive firms helps us understand the concentration of

research funding across industries and technology segments. To do so, we exploit data about

projects funded by the Federal government’s SBIR, the largest individual source of R&D


12
  Indeed, while VC funding may provide non-pecuniary value to the firm through managerial expertise or access to
a network of contacts, the SBIR focuses on funding technology development per se and contributes essentially no
additional commercialization services.
                                                                                                               19


financing for small to medium-sized firms in the United States. SBIR funding provides a unique

and informative source of variation in the funding of small, research-oriented firms.                       First

authorized as an NSF program in 1982, the SBIR program requires that all Federal agencies that

support a minimal level of R&D activity are required to set aside a certain percentage of their

funds for extramural grants to fund R&D projects by small business.13 The principal legislative

goals of the program are to:

        (a) increase the commercialization rate of innovations resulting from Federal research,
        (b) enhance the ‘competitiveness’ of small firms in technology-intensive industries; and
        (c) enhance the participation of small firms as well as women and minority-owned
            businesses in the Federal contracting process (GAO, 1995).

        As described earlier, the economic impact of the program is to alleviate some of the

capital constraints facing funded firms while having no direct impact on the product market

environment. However, from a political perspective, the program’s support seems to derive in

part from (ever-increasing) political demand to focus R&D expenditures towards more near-term

development projects and to areas which have a clear relationship to medium-term economic

growth (Cohen and Noll, 1993). Combined with political rhetoric that simply assumes that

research-oriented start-up firms are the engine of long-term economic growth, and that such

firms face a severe “funding gap” arising from the unwillingness of investors to shoulder the

risks of early-stage financing, the SBIR has been a popular program whose scope has been

consistently expanded since its inception (GAO, 1995). Indeed, during the 1990s, the SBIR was

the single largest source of early–stage R&D financing for small firms in the United States with

annual expenditures over $1 billion.




13
  This percentage has varied over time (from 1.25 in the 1980s up to 2.5% as of 1997). As well, the SBIR defines a
small business as a US-owned firm with less than 500 employees. Further details of the SBIR are discussed
extensively in GAO (1995), Wallsten (1998), and Lerner (1997).
                                                                                                                20


        Despite its political support, the program has been somewhat controversial. In part, this is

because neither the legislative nor regulatory rules governing the program mandate the program

fund projects on the margin (which would determine performance according to the first part of

Proposition One).       As highlighted dramatically by Wallsten (2000), the program’s funding

guidelines seem to focus on funding the most attractive grant applications from either a technical

or commercialization perspective.14 Indeed, perhaps as a consequence of this selectivity, Lerner

finds that firms funded by the program do tend to have an accelerated rate of growth compared to

similar firms (Lerner, 1997). However, Lerner emphasizes that this “boost” to firm-level growth

seems to be localized according to the location or technology focus of the firm, a contention that

our framework implicitly revisits and explores in much greater detail.

        More generally, we refocus analysis of the SBIR away from program assessment per se

and towards the exploitation of two structure of the SBIR to evaluate the sources of R&D

concentration. First, because the program is administered through a variety of Federal agencies

(Agriculture, Defense, HHS, etc.), whose missions span the scope of the economy’s activities,

the expenditures of the SBIR program are much more widely dispersed (across industries and

technological areas) than privately funded R&D. This wedge between SBIR expenditures and

private funding is particularly salient if one focuses on investment or R&D expenditures

specifically for small (or venture-backed) firms.              In other words, a specific if unintended

contribution of the SBIR program is to expand the supply of capital to research-oriented, smaller

firms to a set of industries and technologies which, for one reason or another, do not currently

attract high levels of such funds. As a result, the program is extremely useful for identifying

14
  As a result, the main focus of prior research (GAO, 1995; Lerner, 1997; Wallsten, 1998; 2000) has been on the
assessment of the marginal contribution of SBIR funding (and government venture capital more generally) to the
performance of subsidized firms. Towards this goal, these analyses are framed in terms of the counterfactual of the
expected behavior or performance of these firms, in the absence of the subsidy program. Indeed, both Lerner (1997)
                                                                                                      21


projects across a set of industrial segments that vary greatly in terms of their level of private

venture financing. Second, as discussed earlier, the use of a subsidy program (in contrast to

examining privately funded projects) allows, in principle, for the identification of projects in

each industrial segment which are socially but not privately worthwhile and so are on the margin

of the funding threshold. While it is possible that the program does potentially experience some

cherry-picking (which mitigates against this benefits), the fact that SBIR funding tends to be a

less “preferred” source of external capital suggests that we the use of subsidized projects are a

superior sample for performing our test (relative to prior work which examines projects which

are themselves funded by the private sector).



IV.     Data

        This paper presents results from a novel dataset of 100 projects funded by the SBIR since

1990. The data were gathered via a field-based proprietary survey conducted by the authors. This

project-level data was then supplemented with public data on each firm’s patenting behavior,

SBIR grant history, and covariates related to the industry, business segment, and scientific

underpinning associated with each project. In this section, we first review our procedure and the

elements of our survey (highlighting the sample selection and data gathering process) and then

review the summary statistics for the sample (Table 1 includes the definitions of all the variables

used in the analysis; Table 2 provides means and standard deviations).




and Wallsten (1998; 2000) focus their results around the comparison of a group of SBIR-funded firms and a
“matched sample” of firms who are observationally similar ex ante but who do not receive SBIR funding.
                                                                                                                 22


Survey Data Sources and Sample Selection Method

        The data is drawn from several sources; most importantly a survey conducted between

December and February 1999 (see Appendix B for a copy).15 The sample is drawn from a list

(compiled by the Small Business Administration) of the (approximately) 200 largest historical

beneficiaries of SBIR grants.16 For survey participants, we requested information about their

most successful project funded by the SBIR (for most firms, there was only one (or at most two)

SBIR-funded projects which the firm considered technologically successful). By focusing on

projects that overcame the substantial technological hurdles associated with innovation, the data

provide information about the relative economic returns of projects in different industries that are

at least successful in a technical sense.

        At the firm level, we collected background information on the organization’s employees

and promotion policies; financial information about corporate ownership, expenditures and

revenues; and corporate governance. At the project level, each company was asked to provide

information on the commercialization and financing history of the technology project, including

revenues through sales and licensing of the technology, the importance of the technology in

achieving various goals of the firm, key personnel involved in setting the commercialization

strategy of the company, and information about the commercialization strategy itself.17



15
   Along with a similar survey of the commercialization histories of venture-backed firms, the data from this survey
are being used to study a variety of phenomena associated with the incentives, strategies, and performance of
research-oriented start-ups and, in particular, on the impact of the Federal SBIR subsidy on each of these issues.
16
   The overall response rate to the survey was approximately 50%. Firms contacted but not responding seemed to be
randomly mixed between firms not having a commercial product and those too busy or not willing to respond.
Within the organization, the respondent was typically one of the following individuals: the director of R&D, the
director of sales or marketing, or the CEO. Most of the surveys (approximately 75%) were filled out over the
telephone, with the balance either faxed or mailed back. All respondents were guaranteed that their individual
responses would be kept confidential.
17
   Whenever possible, we used publicly available databases to verify information from the survey responders. For
example, we verified the number of patents assigned to each organization through both the US Patent and
Trademark Office’s web site and the IBM patent database.
                                                                                                              23


        From this survey, we construct both project-specific and firm-specific variables (see

Table 1 for definitions). First, we define the project-level variables. We define performance in

terms of the aggregate annual revenues from product sales, licensing, and intellectual property

exchanges (REVENUE 98).18 For each project, we identify the number of PATENTS awarded

since the grant as well as the project-level SBIR AWARD SIZE (from the USPTO and the Small

Business Administration, respectively). In addition, we identify all firms who receive at least

some of their overall revenues not through direct product market sales but through licensing

arrangements or intellectual property sales. We denote these firms COOPERATORS insofar as

nearly all of these firms are involved in cooperative contracting with more established product

market incumbents; it is useful to note that this cooperative behavior is in lieu of competition

with the same firms who have arranged to “buy out” the SBIR awardees’ product market

position (Anton and Yao, 1994; Gans and Stern, 2000; Gans, Hsu, and Stern, 2000). We also

include several dummy variables, which denote the technology, product and customer base types

of each project (UPGRADE, MADE-TO-ORDER, NOVEL SYSTEM, and LARGE

CUSTOMER BASE).              Finally, we calculate one measure of overall product development

efficiency (TIME-TO-MARKET) that is simply the overall time from initial product conception

to the first sale of this product to any customer (either directly or through licensing).

        As well, we include several firm-specific variables that describe the more general

financial and organizational structure of the firm. In terms of the measurement of performance, a

portion of our analysis is organized around the determinants of current firm size

(EMPLOYMENT 98). We use the initial value of this measure as a key control in most of our

empirical analysis (BASELINE EMPLOYEES), in order to control for the initial size of the firm.


18
   All of the qualitative results are robust to using the data on total project revenues (indeed, they are highly
correlated). However, this would further reduce the number of usable surveys by approximately one-third.
                                                                                                 24


As well, the analysis examines variables related to financial structure, VC EQUITY SHARE and

INSIDER EQUITY SHARE. The difference between these is while the first confirms the

potential importance of the “certification” hypothesis (SBIR grants lead to VC funding which

leads to overall performance), the latter allows us to capture the pure associated between

performance and maintaining a closely held organization. Similarly, FOUNDER CEO proxies

for the overall entrepreneurial culture and authority structure of the firm.



Sources and Definitions of Industry and Segment-Level Variables

       A critical element of the analysis is the relationship of project-level performance to

measures of private and public investments in the industries, technology segments or scientific

areas associated with each project. Specifically, we want to distinguish three concepts: overall

investment in businesses or R&D by small firms, aggregate private R&D in the project’s

industrial area, and the scientific and engineering opportunities present in the technological areas

inherent in the project.

       To capture the first, we assigned each project to one of eleven technology segments

identified by Venture One (see Figure 3A). For each segment, we measure the VC FUNDING

STOCK as the (undiscounted) sum of venture investing in that segment between 1985 – 1992.

We also present results for the VC CAPITAL FLOW, which are composed exclusively of the

1992 disbursements. We also assign each project (firm) to a single three-digit SIC; the NSF

Science and Engineering Indicators provides data for each SIC on SIC-LEVEL R&D

EXPENDITURES, SIC SALES, and SIC-LEVEL SMALL FIRM R&D EXPENDITURES.

Finally, we measure the project’s association with scientific or engineering opportunity by

constructing a SCIENCE STOCK for each project. First, we assigned each project to one or
                                                                                                                25


more scientific and engineering fields (out of a total of 14). In contrast to the mutually exclusive

nature of the prior variables, the science base of each project can be composed from multiple

sources. For each area (e.g., physics or chemical engineering), we computed the (discounted)

Federal Funding stock in that area (equal to 1990 FUNDING + .8 1988 FUNDING + .6 1986

FUNDING). Each project’s SCIENCE STOCK is simply the sum of the individual field-level

stocks for fields associated with that project.

        In addition, we attempt to provide additional controls for the environmental heterogeneity

among firms by including a number of variables from the survey that attempt to capture the

firm’s perception of the appropriability environment relevant for their specific project.

Specifically, we include several variables that relate to the relative importance of differences

source of intellectual property (PATENTS, SECRECY, SPEED TO MARKET), each of which is

measured as a 5-point Likert scale variable. As well, we include several (five-point Likert scale)

variables measuring the importance associated with the control of different complementary

assets (MANUFACTURING, DISTRIBUTION, BRANDING, SERVICING).



Summary Statistics

        Out of a total 100 responses, 74 were fully usable for the empirical work reported here.19

However, for most of the analysis, we exclude the small number of observations (3) that were

clearly so-called SBIR “mills”; these organizations have a much more diverse research portfolio

from the rest of the sample and also have a different relationship with funding agencies. This

leaves us with 71 total observations for the majority of our analysis.



19
   Most of the non-responses were because of non-reporting of all 1998 revenues (e.g., sales reported but not
licensing revenue). We have checked our results including all results, even those for whom the data was incomplete;
the qualitative results are unchanged.
                                                                                                                     26


         Among these 71, the average project reports approximately 6.5 million dollars in

revenue, compared with an average award size of 1.5 million (but note the high standard

deviations associated with each). As well, these organizations seem to be highly productive in a

technical sense. On average, each has been issued over 9 patents that were applied for since the

first SBIR grant associated with the specific project here (all chosen projects have their first

funding date after 1990). In addition, almost a third of the sample earns at least some its revenue

through cooperative licensing or IP exchanges (most often with product market incumbents). As

well, the average commercialization length of projects is a little over four years, though some

outliers in part drive this (from biotechnology and the like). Finally, at the firm level, while most

of these organizations are quite small at inception (35 employees on average), they tend to

experience substantial growth over time (the average firm has nearly 90 employees by 1998).20

         As suggested earlier, the principal empirical exercise of this paper will be to relate

project-level performance measures (REVENUE 98 and EMPLOYMENT 98) to segment-level

measures of private investment activity and the technological environment. Figure 3 presents the

distributions of the three principal measures we use to capture these effects: 1992 VC FUNDING

STOCK, SCIENCE STOCK, and SIC-LEVEL R&D EXPENDITURES. Each of these measures

provides a distinct way of capturing the degree of environmental heterogeneity facing different

SBIR-funded projects in terms of the level of technological opportunity and realized private

investment activity. Whereas the VC FUNDING STOCK (Figure 3A) measures the skewed

distribution of entrepreneurial activity and is divided into several segments which do not

precisely map into the traditional SIC classification, Figure 3B and 3C measure differences in


20
   As well, in terms of the internal organization and finance of the firms, over 50% of equity is retained by insiders;
perhaps surprisingly, while 25% of the sample had attracted some form of VC or “angel” financing, the equity share
of these investors is quite small (the average level of equity held by these outside investors across the full sample is
less than 7%). In addition, in nearly 60% of the firms, the CEO is one of the original founders of the firm.
                                                                                                  27


investment in alternative scientific and engineering fields upon which many of these innovations

draw and differences across sectors in terms of aggregate R&D expenditures, respectively.

Whereas SCIENCE STOCK and R&D EXPENDITURES will tend to be sensitive to differences

across sectors in terms of technological opportunity, only VC FUNDING STOCK will be

sensitive to the differences across sectors in terms of the degree of appropriability or the salience

of capital market constraints facing small research-oriented firms. Consistent with the SIC-level

motivating statistics we presented in Table II, Figure 3 highlights both the skewed nature of both

venture financing and R&D funding (e.g., telecommunications, medical care technologies, and

software make up over 60% of the aggregate 1992 VC FUNDING STOCK).

       In terms of their overall summary statistics, while the VC FUNDING STOCK is

measured as the cumulative investment in given areas over 8 years, one can see that the

aggregate average level of SCIENCE STOCK and R&D EXPENDITURES are considerably

higher, particularly given that SCIENCE STOCK depends on the summation across three years

of investment and R&D EXPENDITURES is measured from a single cross-section. As well, the

Appropriability Mechanism measures (control variables for the environment) are each Likert

measures; not surprisingly, the mean of each varies from a little above 3 to just over 4.



V.     Empirical Results

       We now turn to our evaluation of the principal hypotheses of this paper (recall

Proposition 1). Specifically, we are concerned with the degree of variation across sectors in

technological opportunity (Var(V )), the degree of appropriability (Var(γ)), and the relative

salience of capital constraints (Var(θ)). Our empirical test provides evidence about the relative

salience of these factors in explaining the large differences in R&D funding for small firms
                                                                                               28


across industries that we highlighted in Section II. Specifically, we test for the relationship

between project-level performance and the level of private investment in each project’s industry

or technological segment, controlling for project-specific or firm-specific factors that also may

affect performance. In Tables 3-5 and Figure 4, we present our main finding from this analysis:

controlling for project-level, firm-level and other environmental characteristics, revenue is

increasing in the level of venture capital funding for small firms in a given technology segment

and, more tentatively, in the science stock associated with a given technology. In contrast,

performance is not statistically related to overall R&D investment in a given area or the overall

size of an industrial segment. These basic findings are robust to several quite stringent tests of

robustness, including the inclusion of additional controls for appropriability, project-level and

firm-level factors, as well as variation in the measurement of the level of financing for small

research-oriented firms (some of these results are presented in Appendix C). As well, in Table 6,

we show that there is also a positive relationship between an alternative measure of performance

(EMPLOYMENT 98) and the industry-specific level of venture financing.



The Performance of SBIR-funded Development Projects

       We begin in Tables 3 with the relationship between L REVENUE 98 and each of the

alternative measures of private investment and technological opportunity. The most striking

result is that, whereas SCIENCE STOCK, SIC R&D EXPENDITURES, and SIC SIZE are

uncorrelated with project-level performance, 1992 VC FUNDING STOCK is both statistically

significant and quantitatively important: doubling the level of venture funding in an industrial

segment is associated with over a 50% increase in measured revenue (see (3-1)). As well, in (3-

5), we demonstrate that our principal result concerning the VC FUNDING STOCK is robust to
                                                                                                  29


the inclusion of the alternative measures of the segment-level environment (which remain

themselves insignificant and lower in magnitude). When considering these results, it is useful to

recall that the inclusion of SCIENCE STOCK and SIC R&D EXPENDITURES allow us to

distinguish between measures of overall technological opportunity and variation in the level of

appropriability or capital constraints impacting small, entrepreneurial firms.

       Figure 4 dramatically illustrates this finding. While average project revenue is closely

associated with the level of venture financing by segment (indeed, the lowest four segments have

average performance levels strictly below the upper four segments), the performance of the SBIR

projects seems, at best, to be negatively associated with aggregate R&D expenditures (which is

driven primarily by expenditures by larger firms in each industry. In other words, under the

logic of Proposition 1, these results suggests the presence of differences across industrial

segments in terms of their appropriability environment (i.e., Var(γ) > 0), even after incorporating

two direct measures capturing variation in technological opportunity across segments.

       While the sample size is limited, these results provide strong evidence in terms of the

presence of variation in appropriability. However, it is important to recall that the results do not

reject variation in capital constraints; instead, the impact of variation from appropriability

outweighs the impact of variation from capital constraints in these data. Given some of our

earlier concerns about the details of the project selection mechanism (i.e., the possibility of

cherry-picking) and the impact of subsidized funding on project performance (which will tend to

ameliorate the impact of capital constraints), it is perhaps not surprising that our main empirical

findings are in support of variation in the level of appropriability. By itself, this is an important

finding: we are not aware of prior quantitative evidence demonstrating that the sources of
                                                                                                 30


concentration in venture financing is driven by segment-level differences in the level of

appropriability.

       Of course, it is possible that these results are in fact being driven by more “project-level”

factors that outweigh the impact of the segment-level variation. Table 4 therefore extends the

analysis of the determinants of REVENUE 98 by focusing on the robustness of the VC

FUNDING STOCK result to the inclusion of various project-level, firm-level, or alternative

environmental controls. In (4-1), we include the simplest “control,” the level of initial

employment at each firm. In some sense, this very simple measure should capture some degree

of the heterogeneity among firms in terms of their initial conditions in terms of generating

products associated with a given level of revenue; however, its inclusion does not impact our

main result at all. We then extend our analysis is (4-2) and (4-3) by including a number of

alternative control variables, associated with the firm’s perception of the appropriability

environment and project-level controls, respectively. At one level, the results from this analysis

are interesting in their own right: while revenues are increasing in the technological quality and

product development efficiency of the project (PATENTS, UPGRADE and TIME TO MARKET

respectively) and whether firms “cooperate” with more established firms (note this could be in

part the result of the selectivity of projects which are attractive for licensing), revenues are

relatively unrelated to the Likert measures of the appropriability environment facing individual

firms. However, the more important finding from Table 4 is that the coefficient associated with

VC FUNDING STOCK remains roughly the same magnitude and statistically significant, despite

the large number of control variables included and given the relatively small number of

observations in the sample. Indeed, in (4-4), we include all of the control measures

simultaneously with no impact on the underlying result regarding the VC FUNDING STOCK
                                                                                                                  31


variable. Once again, given the logic of Proposition 1 (and the associated caveats about the

relatively small sample size and the imperfect controls for project selection), these results

suggest variation across sectors in terms of the degree of appropriability facing small firms, and

that such differences are reflected in the ability of subsidized firms to earn returns on their

innovations in specific industrial segments.

        In Table 5, we turn back to the more general comparison between the VC FUNDING

STOCK variable and measures which more closely correspond to technological opportunity

(SCIENCE STOCK and SIC R&D EXPENDITURES). Specifically, in (5-1) and (5-2), we

regress REVENUE 98 on each of the alternative measures (SCIENCE STOCK and SIC R&D

EXPENDITURES, respectively), including all of the controls considered in Table 4.

Interestingly, with these controls in place, the magnitude of the coefficient associated with

SCIENCE STOCK increases substantially and is statistically significant (SIC R&D

EXPENDITURES remains both relatively small and statistically insignificant). However, when,

in (5-3), we include all of these variables together, the principal result associated with VC

FUNDING STOCK remains robust, as does the SCIENCE STOCK result. In other words, even

after we control simultaneously for various project-level controls as well as measures associated

with technological opportunity and aggregate R&D expenditures, the highest performing SBIR-

funded projects tend to be associated with those industrial segments with high rates of venture

capital funding.21 While such a result may be interesting in terms of SBIR evaluation per se,

perhaps we highlight the economic implication of this finding: such covariation exists when


21
  Appendix C (Tables C-1 and C-2) further establish the robustness of the VC FUNDING result. In C-1, we include
additional firm-level covariates, including measures of the financial organization of the firm, as well as additional
environmental covariates associated with the geographic location of the firm. As before, while the SCIENCE
STOCK variable is only significant in some specifications, the VC FUNDING STOCK remains significant at a
similar magnitude. Finally, in C-2, we consider alternative sample selection schemes such as mandating that we only
include projects whose 98 REVENUES are greater than the size of their SBIR grant or including the SBIR “mills” in
the analysis. As before, our main qualitative results are unchanged.
                                                                                                   32


differences across sectors are the result of differences in the level of appropriability facing small,

entrepreneurially oriented firms.

       Finally, in Table 6, we compare our results regarding REVENUE 98 to an alternative

analysis focused on the determinants of firm-level employment (EMPLOYMENT 98). In some

sense, this analysis is more directly comparable to the analysis pursued by Lerner (1997), in that

Table 6 focuses on the determinants of firm-level performance among SBIR-funded firms. The

analysis is straightforward and echoes our earlier finding: while employment growth seems to be

relatively unrelated to environmental measures associated with SCIENCE STOCK or SIC R&D

EXPENDITURES, there is a quantitatively important and statistically significant relationship

between EMPLOYMENT 98 and VC FUNDING STOCK, even after controlling for BASELINE

EMPLOYMENT (as well, this result is relatively robust to the inclusion of various controls,

similar to the earlier analysis). In conjunction with our earlier findings regarding REVENUE 98,

Table 6 provides additional evidence that there is a robust positive relationship between the

performance of SBIR-funded projects and segment-specific levels of venture activity, consistent

with the presence of differences across sectors in the appropriability environment facing small

research-oriented firms.



VI.    Conclusions

       The main conclusions of this study are the result of its core quantitative finding: SBIR

project performance is highest for those projects in industrial segments which themselves receive

the highest level of venture financing. Such a finding should be of some direct interest to

policymakers: if program administrators are given strong incentives to identify projects with the

highest performance, then there may be pressures to focus SBIR funding precisely on those
                                                                                                 33


segments for which venture financing is readily available. Or, from another perspective, the fact

that the SBIR program is run through a variety of different agencies may have the (unintended

but) beneficial effect of increasing the availability of funding to precisely those segments of the

economy where small-firm research faces the highest hurdles, either in terms of appropriability

or capital constraints.

        More generally, however, this finding allows us to begin to disentangle the relative

salience of alternative sources of the concentration of venture financing. While we view our

results as suggestive rather than definitive, to our knowledge, this is the first evidence for the

importance of variation in appropriability in helping to understand the concentration of R&D

among a small number of industrial segments. Specifically, whereas most prior analyses have

had difficulty distinguishing between the response to overall technological opportunity and the

level of appropriability, our focus on specific technologies being commercialized by smaller

firms subsidized by the U.S. government provides extremely useful controls: patterns of

aggregate spending by larger firms and the stock of scientific knowledge used by individual

projects. More generally, our results suggest that rather than simply being the result of “herding”

by venture capitalists in response to diffuse priors about technological opportunity, our evidence

suggests that the economy seems to offer small “pockets” where the appropriability regime (and

the level of technological opportunity) facing small, research-oriented start-ups is particularly

favorable. Indeed, understanding how such pockets emerge is a promising area for further study.

        As well, the specific interpretation of our results can be tied more specifically to policy.

Whereas the SBIR is focused on overcoming the “funding gap” for small, research-oriented

firms, our results suggest that there may be some benefits from also addressing the strength of

the appropriability regime facing small firms. At least in part, the low level in funding for small
                                                                                                 34


firm research in some areas may be the result of specific (and potentially remediable)

weaknesses in the appropriability regime facing small firms, such as the availability of

intellectual property or antitrust rules which limit the ability of smaller firms to access the

complementary assets required for commercialization in a competitive market.

       As we have emphasized several times, our results are provocative but not the final word.

Even beyond issues such as the sample size, our approach only allows us to estimate a “reduced-

form” parameter and so our evidence in favor of variance in appropriability comes at the expense

of simultaneously identifying the salience of capital constraints. As well, while our results

concerning appropriability are consistent even if the project selection mechanism satisfies a

“cherry-picking” regime and there are direct impacts of the program on project performance,

distinguishing among the separate effects of each of these factors seems important. Perhaps a

careful integration of the program evaluation methodologies of Wallsten and Lerner with the

within-program evaluation pursued here will allow for more nuanced examination of both the

role played by market imperfections in shaping the level and productivity of small firm

innovation and the role played by government policy in alleviating these market imperfections.

Appendix A: Sources of Capital Market Imperfections

        In Section III, we considered the effect of a capital subsidy. We argued that a capital
subsidy effectively eliminates problems caused by capital market imperfections or at least
equalizes them for grant recipients across industries. Suppose, as we will do through this
appendix, that c( F , θ ) = F + θ . We consider in more detail the reasons why θ > 0 by looking at
three alternative models based on moral hazard, adverse selection and expropriation. In each the
capital market imperfection will arise when a particular parameter, φ, is positive. We will
demonstrate that θ = 0 whenever the parameter φ is zero. Finally, in what follows, we omit the
industry subscript, i, from notation.


(a) Moral Hazard

        Suppose that the RU employs effort in innovative activity and that this can influence the
likelihood of generating a successful innovation. We assume that this effort has a contractible
and a non-contractible component. Using only contractible effort, the probability of generating a
successful innovation is pL. We normalize the cost of this effort to 0. However, by expending
non-contractible effort for a marginal cost of 1, the RU can raise this innovation probability to pH
> pL.
        We make two simplifying assumptions. First, we assume that research and capital
provision to the RU is socially desirable for some projects, i.e., pH V > F + 1 . Second, we assume
that there exists F beyond which it is never worthwhile providing capital to the RU if it is not
expected to expend a high level of effort in innovative activity, i.e., pLv (V , γ ) = F . The former
assumption raises the possibility that some socially desirable projects may go unfunded because
of a lack of appropriability. The latter assumption, however, means that the VC may not fund
some privately profitable projects. This is essentially because of a capital market imperfection
that dilutes the role of VC-equity when RU effort is non-contractible.
        Turning to the determinants of VC funding let α denote the level of equity the RU retains
in its own firm. This level of equity (and any capital forthcoming from the VC) is determined
prior to the RU engaging in any innovative activity. The minimum level of equity the RU can
have and still expend a high level of effort ex post is given by the α that just satisfies the RU’s
incentive constraint:
                                                                 1
                                pH α v − 1 ≥ p L v ⇒ α ≥                  .
                                                           v ( pH − p L )

Given the competitive nature of VC capital markets, VC capital will be forthcoming for the
project so long as it is still profitable at this minimum RU-equity level.
                                          pH (1 − α )v ≥ F
                                                                                                           49


Substituting for α, we can re-write the participation constraint for the VC as:
                                               pH v − 1 ≥ F + φ ,

where φ = pL /( pH − pL ) . Notice that, in this model, θ = φ ; meaning that the private cost of
capital exceeds the social cost of capital whenever, φ > 0.


(b) Adverse Selection

         In the previous model, the capital market imperfection arose because of the detrimental
effect of VC equity on the incentives of the RU to expend non-contractible effort in innovative
activity. Here we consider an alternative model where the probability of a successful innovation
depends on the RU’s ‘type’ that is private information to the RU. We suppose that there are two
types of RU’s. RU’s with high ability generate a successful innovation with probability pH while
for those with lower ability this probability is reduced to pL. There is no non-contractible RU
effort. It is assumed that a given RU is a high type with probability 1-φ and this is commonly
known. The potential value of the project, v, is, however, known. Finally, we maintain the
assumption of the previous sub-section that pH V > F and pLv (V , γ ) < F .
         Recall that the VC market is competitive, so RUs can demand the maximum level of
equity for a given project, v. However, as they cannot signal their type, the maximum RU equity
that either the high or low type can demand is:
                                      ( (1 − φ ) pH + φ pL ) (1 − α )v = F
                                                              F
                                      ⇒ α = 1−
                                                  ( (1 − φ ) pH + φ pL ) v
This means that the lowest value project that can be funded in an industry is determined by the v
that results in α = 0; i.e., v = (1−φ ) pFH +φ pL . Notice that this is increasing in φ implying that the
inability of VCs to distinguish good RUs from bad results in a high threshold for funding and,
consequently, a lower level of VC funding in the industry. Thus, for this model, θ = (1φ−φ( p) HpH+ +pφL )pL .
This equals 0 if φ = 0.


(c) Expropriation

        Our final model of capital market perfections is based on the potential for expropriation
of ideas by a VC. When an RU approaches a given VC for funding they must reveal their
potential idea. In some situations, an RU will provide inputs that are required for that idea to
become commercially viable. In other situations, however, the RU does not add any value in this
sense. If property rights over the idea are weak (as they may be prior to any patents or
copyright), then a VC may expropriate the idea and refuse to let the RU share in any returns.
                                                                                                                  50


This is a fundamental difficulty in any trade in ideas (Arrow, 1962; and Anton and Yao, 1994)
and it constrains RU appropriability in at every stage of innovation.
        We suppose that, provided a unit of capital is expended, the idea becomes
commercializable with probability, p, and the potential return, v, is common knowledge.
However, it is possible that the VC simply expropriate the full private return v if approached by
the RU. Anticipating this, the RU may not develop the idea of approach the RU (although here
there is no incentive for the RU not to bring the idea to a VC22). Nonetheless, a capital
constrained RU may have some alternative means of raising capital. This is certainly the case
here given our assumption of a competitive VC market. If one VC were to expropriate the idea,
the idea may be financed by another VC.
        To see this, recall that product market appropriation (γ) depends in part on the degree of
competition an innovation faces. That is, are there products that are close substitutes? If the RU
were to turn to another VC, it may be able to reduce product market appropriation to (1 − φ )γ ;
even though it would not receive any ex post rents itself in this eventuality. Fearing the RU’s
competitive threat from disclosure to others, the initial VC may not expropriate the RU; instead
giving the RU some equity in the venture.
        This means that RU-equity will be determined through a bilateral negotiation between
themselves and the first VC they approach. This equity is, therefore, not determined
competitively but through a bilateral monopoly. Essentially, both the RU and VC can use the
threat of disclosure to others or expropriation to bind themselves to reach agreement.
        Following disclosure of the idea to the VC, the two parties negotiate over the equity level
given to the RU. Assuming Nash bargaining with equal bargaining power this yields:
                             p(1 − α )v − F − ( p(1 − φ )v − F ) = pα v
                             ⇒ α = 12 φ

A project with social value, V, will be funded if and only if the VC’s participation constraints
(expecting this level of equity) are satisfied. This participation constraint is pv ≥ 2 −2φ F .
                                                                                             φ
Consequently, the private cost of capital for this model is given by θ =                    2 −φ   F and it clearly
exceeds 0 for φ ∈ (0, 2] .




22
  One could imagine that the RU has some sunk expenditures prior to bringing an idea to a VC that would be lost in
the face of expropriation. This could be added to the model here but it would not alter the basic insight below about
the high private cost of capital; it would merely complicated the cost of capital function.

                           and Professor Joshua Gans, University of Melbourne
                                      Researcher: David Hsu, MIT.

The goal of this project is to evaluate how companies commercialize innovative new technologies. We
are exploring different commercialization strategies and how success at a technical level affects firm
strategy.

Enclosed is a survey, which asks you to describe the circumstances surrounding a specific innovative
project or initiative. We would like to focus on your firm’s involvement in its main business area. Within
that frame, please choose a research and/or development project which is internally perceived as an
important source of value for your firm. We would like you to choose a project which provided direct
financial returns for the firm, through direct sales, licensing agreements, or in strengthening the
bargaining position of the firm.

Once the project is chosen, the survey is divided into two parts:

        •       General background of your company
        •       Commercialization history of the innovation

Participation in this study is entirely voluntary, and you can decline to answer any questions or decline
further participation at any time. The survey should take no more than 25 minutes to complete. Responses
will be kept both confidential and anonymous. Please return this survey and direct inquiries to:

You mentioned before that the project’s first prototype was developed around 19__. From that time onwards, your
success with this technology likely depended, at least in part, on your control of resources which were not directly
linked to the technology itself and on your ability to protect the innovation from imitation by others through
intellectual property protection. Let’s first consider how important your firm’s control over resources has been in
earning profits from this innovation. For each factor below, rate the importance over access and control of this
resource on a scale from 1 to 5. A rating of “5” would mean that control over this resource was critical for earning
profits from this innovation while a “1” would imply that control over this resource was not important at all.

                                                                LOW                                  HIGH
The capability to manufacture the product                       1        2         3          4      5
The principal distribution channels for the technology          1        2         3          4      5
The association of the technology with a well-known             1        2         3          4      5
 brand name or the development of a brand name
 for the product through marketing or advertising
Control over the sales force and servicing resources            1        2         3          4      5
 for this product or technology

Now, let’s turn to your ability to protect the innovation from imitation by others through intellectual property
protection. For each factor below, rate the effectiveness of each factor in deterring imitation of the technology on a
scale from 1 to 5. A rating of “5” would mean that this factor was very effective in deterring imitation of the
technology while a rating of “1” implies that this factor had no impact on your ability to deter imitation.

                                                                LOW                                  HIGH
Trade secrecy                                                   1        2         3          4      5
Patents & copyright protection                                  1        2         3          4      5
Active patent or copyright litigation                           1        2         3          4      5

What activities were involved in the process of commercializing this technology and deciding how to earn returns
from the innovation?
         Took an outside offer for purchasing the rights to the technology
         Shopped the technology around but was unable to sell a license to the technology
         Shopped the technology around and sold a license to the technology
         Did not shop the technology: Always had the intention of competing with the technology
