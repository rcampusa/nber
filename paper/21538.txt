                                            ABSTRACT

In this paper we compute the optimal tax and education policy transition in an economy where progressive
taxes provide social insurance against idiosyncratic wage risk, but distort the education decision of
households. Optimally chosen tertiary education subsidies mitigate these distortions. We highlight
the quantitative importance of general equilibrium feedback effects from policies to relative wages
of skilled and unskilled workers: subsidizing higher education increases the share of workers with
a college degree thereby reducing the college wage premium which has important redistributive benefits.
We also argue that a full characterization of the transition path is crucial for policy evaluation. We
find that optimal education policies are always characterized by generous tuition subsidies, but the
optimal degree of income tax progressivity depends crucially on whether transitional costs of policies
are explicitly taken into account and how strongly the college premium responds to policy changes
in general equilibrium.

1 Introduction

In the presence of uninsurable idiosyncratic earnings risk, progressive taxation pro-
vides valuable social insurance among ex ante identical households. In addition it
might enhance equity among ex ante heterogeneous households, which is beneficial
if the social welfare function used to aggregate lifetime utilities values such equity.
However, if high-earnings households face higher average tax rates than low-earnings
households, this might discourage the incentives of these households to become earnings-
rich through making conscious human capital accumulation decisions. The resulting
skill distribution in the economy worsens, and aggregate economic activity might be
depressed through this channel, which compounds the potentially adverse impact of
progressive taxes on production through the classic labor supply channel.
In this paper we compute the optimal tax and education policy transition, within a
simple parametric class, in an economy where progressive taxes provide social insur-
ance against idiosyncratic wage risk, but distort the education decision of households.
Optimally chosen tertiary education subsidies mitigate these distortions, making both
policies potentially complementary. We model two different channels through which
academic talent is transmitted across generations (persistence of innate ability vs. the
impact of parental education) and permit different forms of labor to be imperfect sub-
stitutes, thereby generating general equilibrium feedback effects from policies to rela-
tive wages of skilled and unskilled workers.
We show that subsidizing higher education has important redistributive benefits, by
shrinking the college wage premium in general equilibrium. This Stiglitz (1982) ef-
fect of fiscal policy on relative factor prices may make progressive taxes and education
subsidies potential policy substitutes for providing social insurance.1 We also argue that
a full characterization of the transition path is crucial for policy evaluation. In our
quantitative analysis we find that optimal education policies are always characterized
by generous tuition subsidies. The optimal degree of income tax progressivity how-
ever crucially depends on whether transitional costs of policies are explicitly taken
into account and how strongly the college wage premium responds to policy changes
in general equilibrium.
Our benchmark economy models skilled and unskilled labor as imperfect substitutes
in the production of final output, following the empirical literature since Katz and
Murphy (1992) or Borjas (2003), with a substitution elasticity of 1.4. When maximizing
utilitarian social welfare valuing transitional generations in this economy, we docu-
ment in section 6.2.1 that the optimal policy is characterized by a massive education

1   Heathcote, Storesletten and Violante (2014) also evaluate the quantitative importance of general equi-
    librium effects of fiscal policy on relative factor prices in their analysis of an analytically tractable dy-
    namic incomplete markets economy. Similarly, Rothschild and Scheuer (2013) stress the Stiglitz effect
    in their study of optimal redistributive fiscal policy in a Roy model where households self-select into
    different sectors, rather than different skill (education) levels, as in this work.

subsidy of θ = 150% of the college tuition cost2 and a tax system that is characterized
by only moderate tax progressivity. We model a simple parametric tax system with a
tax deduction of d times average income (such that d is one measure of tax progressiv-
ity) and a constant marginal tax rate of τl for incomes exceeding this threshold. The
optimal tax deduction d amounts to only about d = 6% of average income and the
constant marginal tax rate stands at approximately τl = 22%. This intertemporally
optimal tax reform generates welfare gains equivalent to more than 3% of permanent
consumption, relative to the status quo policy, which is calibrated to broadly approxi-
mate current U.S. policy (θ = 39%, τl = 28%, d = 27%).
In order to explain the intuition behind this result it is instructive to proceed in three
steps. Consider first an economy in which fiscal policy has no effect on the college
wage premium (because skilled and unskilled labor are perfect substitutes) and transi-
tional dynamics are ignored.3 In the appendix to this paper we construct and analyze
a simple version of this model4 with fixed (but education-specific) labor productivity
and show analytically that the lack of explicit private insurance against idiosyncratic
wage and thus income risk justifies the provision of public insurance via progressive
taxation, even though such a policy discourages college attendance. We also demon-
strate how education subsidies can partially offset this distortion and thus complement
the progressive tax policy. When we turn this simple model into a full quantitative life
cycle equilibrium economy to analyze optimal steady state policy quantitatively in sec-
tion 6.2.2, we indeed find that both policies complement each other in the steady state,
in that both the public eduction subsidy θ and the relative tax deduction d increase
from their status quo levels of (θ = 38.8%, d = 27.1%) to (θ = 170%, d = 31%). That
is, ignoring general equilibrium relative wage effects and transitional dynamics, the
optimal tax system is more progressive than the status quo U.S. system.
In addition to improved social insurance, the substantial welfare gain (in the order
of 2.6% of lifetime consumption) stem from the fact that per capita output (and thus
consumption) increases in the long run despite average hours worked falling. This is
feasible since an education boom (the share of college educated individuals increases
by 50% in the long run) improves the skill distribution in the economy. However,
building up the skill distribution takes time (as new college students constitute only a
small part of the overall workforce), and thus in a second step towards explaining our
benchmark results from section 6.2.1, we conduct an optimal policy transition analy-
sis. In section 6.2.3 we show that implementing the steady state optimal policy along the
transition drives the economy into a severe recession induced by the decline in labor

2   This implies that, effectively, the government not only provides free tertiary education, but also
    covers part of the living expenses of those going to college.
3   We first analyzed this case in our previous work, Krueger and Ludwig (2013).
4   This version of the model in turn builds on the work by Bovenberg and Jacobs (2005), but is tai-
    lored to mimic our quantitative life cycle model as closely as possible to provide intuition for our
    quantitative results.

supply and capital accumulation on account of the higher marginal tax rates required
to pay for the more generous education subsidy and higher tax deduction. Therefore
taking the transitional costs into account the steady state optimal policy actually entails
significant welfare losses relative to the status quo, in the order of 2.8% of lifetime con-
sumption. In contrast, the optimal policy reform, taking the transition path explicitly
into account, still calls for substantially higher education subsidies than the current
status quo, but now calls for less progressive taxes (both relative to the steady state opti-
mum of d = 30% as well as the status quo of d = 27.1%) in order to avoid the short-run
recession induced by higher marginal tax rates. The optimal tax deduction falls to
d = 10% of average income and optimal marginal taxes decrease from a status quo
of 27.5% to 23%. The finding that an explicit consideration of transitional dynamics
in the analysis of education finance reform in models with endogenous human capi-
tal accumulation is potentially very important for optimal tax design is the first main
quantitative conclusion of this paper.
Relative to the benchmark economy, the economies considered in steps 1 and 2 of the
analysis abstract from changes in the college wage premium induced by the policy re-
form and the economic transition it triggers. When we relax this assumption and char-
acterize optimal policy under our preferred benchmark substitution elasticity between
skilled and unskilled labor of 1.4 (that is, return to the results from section 6.2.1) our
main optimal policy conclusions from step 2 (large education subsidy, modest tax pro-
gressivity when the transition path is taken into account, substantial welfare gains in
the order of 3% of lifetime consumption) remain intact: the optimal education subsidy
rate is 150%, the optimal tax deduction now only 6% of average income and marginal
taxes are at 22%. However, there are important qualifications. First, with imperfect
substitutes the strong rationale for progressive taxes disappears even in the steady
state (the optimal steady state policy has a subsidy rate of 200% and a tax deduction
of 10% of mean income). Since the generous education subsidy induces more individ-
uals to go to college, the college wage premium falls in equilibrium which constitutes
a policy substitute for redistributive tax progressivity.5,6 That general equilibrium wage
effects can turn education subsidies and progressive taxes from policy complements to
policy substitutes is the second main quantitative conclusion of this work.
The paper is organized as follows. After relating our contribution to the literature
in the next section, in section 3 we set up our quantitative life cycle model and define
equilibrium for a given fiscal policy of the government. Section 4 describes the optimal
tax problem of the government, including its objective and the instruments available
to the government. After calibrating the economy to U.S. data (including current tax

5   The policy-induced reduction in the college wage premium in turn weakens education incentives;
    thus a larger increase in subsidies is required to achieve a given expansion in educational attainments
    and the long-run effect of the policy on educational attainment is smaller.
6   Given that the optimal tax policy is already not very progressive in the steady state, the policy differ-
    ences between the steady state and the transition are qualitatively similar to the perfect substitutes
    case, but quantitatively not very important.

and education policies) in section 5 of the paper, section 6 displays the results and
provides the interpretation of the optimal taxation analysis. Section 7 concludes. The
appendix makes explicit the analysis of the simple model. It also contains details of
the calibration and the computation of the model.



2 Relation to the Literature

Our paper aims at characterizing the optimal progressivity of the income tax code in
a life cycle economy in which the public provision of redistribution and income insur-
ance through taxation and education policies is desirable, but where progressive taxes
not only distort consumption-savings and labor-leisure choices, but also household
human capital accumulation choices. It is most closely related to the studies by Conesa
and Krueger (2006), Conesa et al. (2009) and Karabarbounis (2012). Relative to their
steady state analyses we provide a full quantitative transition analysis of the optimal
tax code in a model with endogenous education choices.7 In stressing the importance of
the sources of the intergenerational transmission of talent (for college) and the general
equilibrium wage effects of education policies for optimal policies our paper builds es-
pecially strongly on the study by Abbott, Gallipoli, Meghir and Violante (2013) whose
pioneering work models financial aid and college loan programs much more explicitly
than our paper but does not study the optimal fiscal policy and education policy mix.
In our earlier paper, Krueger and Ludwig (2013) we characterized the optimal policy
transition in a model with college choice in which the innate ability distribution of
children for college was exclusively determined by the education level of the parents,
and in which policies have no general equilibrium impact on the relative wages of
college versus non-college labor. Consequently education subsidies are a potent tool
to encourage college attendance but have no redistributive benefits through reducing
the college wage premium. Both features stacked the deck for finding large education
subsidies and policy complementarity between these policies and redistributive taxa-
tion. Relative to this work here we use micro data to discipline the relative importance
of parental education and parental innate ability in the intergenerational transmission
of skills,8 and we model general equilibrium wage effects explicitly. We show that
whereas the large education subsidies remain optimal, the optimal degree of tax pro-
gressivity declines substantially. Policy complements turn into policy substitutes.
Our paper follows a long tradition in the literature that uses quantitative overlap-
ping generations models in the spirit of Hubbard and Judd (1986) and Auerbach and
Kotlikoff (1987), but enriched by uninsurable idiosyncratic earnings risk as in Bewley

7   Bakis et al. (2014), Fehr and Kindermann (2015) and Kindermann and Krueger (2015) also compute
    optimal tax transitions, but abstract from endogenous human capital accumulation.
8   Our model-implied impact of education subsidy payments on college attendance is consistent with
    Dynarski’s (2003) empirical findings.

(1986), Huggett (1993, 1997) and Aiyagari (1994), to study the optimal structure of the
tax code in the Ramsey tradition, see Chamley (1986) and Judd (1985). The optimal
tax code in life cycle economies with a representative household in each generation
was characterized in important papers by Alvarez et al. (1992), Erosa and Gervais
(2002), Garriga (2003), Gervais (2012), Bovenberg and Jacobs (2005), Jacobs and Boven-
berg (2010), and in economies with private information in the Mirrleesian (Mirrlees
1971) tradition, by Judd and Su (2006), Fukujima (2010), Bohacek and Kapicka (2008),
Kapicka (2012), Findeisen and Sachs (2013, 2014)9 and Weinzierl (2011).10
The study of optimal redistributive tax and education policies in heterogeneous agent
models with endogenous human capital was pioneered by Benabou (2002). This paper
as well as Bovenberg and Jacobs (2005) point out that education subsidies might be
effective in mitigating the distortions of education decisions from a progressive income
tax code, making both complementary policy tools. As in their theoretical analyses that
abstract from explicit life cycle modeling and savings choices we therefore study such
subsidies explicitly as part of the optimal policy mix in our quantitative investigation.
Our focus of the impact of the tax code and education subsidies on human capital
accumulation decisions also strongly connects our work to the studies by Heckman et
al. (1998, 1999), Caucutt et al. (2006), Bohacek and Kapicka (2012), Kindermann (2012),
Abbott et al. (2013), Holter (2014), Winter (2014) and Guvenen et al. (2014), although
the characterization of the optimal tax code is not the main objective of these papers.
In our attempt to contribute to the literature on (optimal) taxation in life cycle economies
with idiosyncratic risk and human capital accumulation we explicitly model house-
hold education decisions (and government subsidies thereof) in the presence of bor-
rowing constraints and the intergenerational transmission of human capital as well as
wealth. Consequently our works builds upon the massive theoretical and empirical
literature investigating these issues, studied and surveyed in, e.g. Keane and Wolpin
(2001), Cunha et al. (2006), Holmlund et al. (2011), Lochner and Monge (2011).11

9    The focus of the last four papers on optimal income taxation in the presence of human capital accu-
     mulation make them especially relevant for our work, although they abstract from explicit life cycle
     considerations.
10   There is also a large literature on the positive effects of various taxes on allocations and prices in life
     cycle economies, see, e.g., Hubbard and Judd (1986) and Castañeda et al. (1999). The redistributive
     and insurance role of progressive taxation in models with heterogeneous households is also analyzed
     in Domeij and Heathcote (2004) and Heathcote, Storesletten and Violante (2014).
11   A comprehensive survey of this literature is well beyond the scope of this paper. We will refer-
     ence the papers on which our modeling assumptions or calibration choices are based specifically in
     sections 3 and 5.

3 The Quantitative Model

In this section we lay out the quantitative life cycle model that we will employ in our
optimal policy analysis.


3.1 Demographics

Population grows at the exogenous rate χ. We assume that parents give birth to chil-
dren at the age of j f and denote the fertility rate of households by f , assumed to be
the same across education groups.12 Notice that f is also the number of children per
household. Further, let ϕ j be the age-specific survival rate. We assume that ϕ j = 1 for
all j = 0, . . . , jr − 1 and 0 < ϕ j ≤ 1 for all j = jr , . . . , J − 1, where jr is the fixed retire-
ment age (jr − 1 is the last working age before retirement) and J denotes the maximum
age (hence ϕ J = 0). The population dynamics are then given by

                                 Nt+1,0 = f · Nt,j f
                               Nt+1,j+1 = ϕ j · Nt,j ,     for j = 0, . . . , J.

Observe that the population growth rate is given by
                                                       1
                                            χ = f j f +1 − 1.                                        (1)


3.2 Technology

We refer to workers that have completed college as skilled, the others as unskilled.
Thus the skill level s of a worker falls into the set s ∈ {n, c} where s = c denotes col-
lege educated individuals. We assume that skilled and unskilled labor are imperfectly
substitutable in production but that within skill groups labor is perfectly substitutable
across different ages. Let Lt,s denote aggregate labor of skill s, measured in efficiency
units and let Kt denote the capital stock.
Total labor efficiency units at time t, aggregated across both education groups, is then
given by
                                                    1
                                            ρ     ρ   ρ
                                    Lt = Lt,n + Lt,c

where 1−1 ρ is the elasticity of substitution between skilled and unskilled labor.13 As
long as ρ < 1, skilled and unskilled labor are imperfect substitutes in production,

12   Note that due to the endogeneity of the education decision in the model, if we were to allow dif-
     ferences in the age at which households with different education groups have children, it is hard to
     assure that the model has a stationary joint distribution over age and skills.
13   Katz and Murphy (1992) report an elasticity of substitution across education groups of σ = 1.4. This
     is also what Borjas (2003) finds, using a different methodology and dataset.

                                                    7
and the college wage premium will endogenously respond to changes in government
policy.
Aggregate labor is combined with capital to produce output Yt according to a standard
Cobb-Douglas production function
                                                                                        1  1− α

                   Yt = F(Kt , Lt ) =   Ktα L1t −α      =   Ktα        Lt,n   +   Lt,c                 (2)

where α measures the elasticity of output with respect to the input of capital services.
Perfect competition among firms and constant returns to scale in the production func-
tion implies zero profits for all firms and an indeterminate size distribution of firms.
Thus there is no need to specify the ownership structure of firms in the household
sector, and without loss of generality we can assume the existence of a single represen-
tative firm.
This representative firm rents capital and hires the two skill types of labor on competi-
tive spot markets at prices rt + δ and wt,s , where rt is the interest rate, δ the depreciation
rate of capital and wt,s is the wage rate per unit of labor of skill s. Furthermore, denote
by kt = KLtt the “capital intensity”—defined as the ratio of capital to the CES aggregate
of labor. Profit maximization of firms implies the standard conditions

                         rt = αkαt −1 − δ                                                             (3a)

3.3.1 Preferences

Households are born at age j = 0 and form independent households at age ja , standing
in for age 18 in real time. Households give birth at the age j f and children live with
adult households until they form their own households. Hence for ages j = j f , . . . , j f +
ja − 1 children are present in the parental household. Parents derive utility from per

where c j is total consumption, ℓ j is leisure and 1Js is an indicator function taking the
value one during the period when children are living in the respective household, that
is, for j ∈ Js = [ j f , j f + ja − 1], and zero otherwise. 0 ≤ ζ ≤ 1 is an adult equivalence
parameter. Expectations in the above are taken with respect to the stochastic processes
governing mortality and labor productivity risk as well as with respect to survival risk.
We model an additional form of altruism of households towards their children. At
parental age j f , when children leave the house, the children’s expected lifetime utility
enters the parental lifetime utility function with a weight υβ j f , where the parameter υ
measures the strength of parental altruism.14


3.3.2 Initial Endowments and Human Capital Accumulation Technology

At age j = ja , before any decision is made, households draw their innate ability to
go to college, e ∈ {e1 , e2 , . . . , e N } according to a distribution π (e|.) that may depend
on the characteristics of their parents, including parental education s p and parental
labor productivity to be described below.15 Innate ability also affects future wages
directly and independent of education, in a stochastic way, described below. A young
household with ability e incurs a per-period resource cost of going to college wt,c κ that
is proportional to the aggregate wage of the high-skilled, wt,c .16 In case the government
chooses to implement education subsidies, a fraction θt of the resource cost is borne by
the government. In addition, a constant fraction θ pr of the education costs is borne by
private subsidies, paid from accidental bequests described below. We think of θ pr as
a policy invariant parameter to be calibrated, and introduce it to capture the fact that,
empirically, a significant share of university funding comes from alumni donations and
support by private foundations.
Going to college also requires a fraction ξ (e) ∈ [0, 1] of time at age ja , in the period

14   Evidently the exact timing when children lifetime utility enters that of their parents is inconsequen-
     tial.
15   Ability e in our model does capture innate ability as well as all learned characteristics of the individ-
     ual at the age of the college decision. In our model one of the benefits of going to college is to be able
     to raise children that will (probabilistically) be more able to go to college.
16   In addition to a monetary cost Abbott et al. (2013) model a “psychic stress” formulation of costs
     based on Heckman, Lochner and Todd (2006). Our specification is closer to Caucutt et al. (2006)
     where the costs stand in for hiring a teacher to acquire education.




                                                                  9
in which the household attends school.17 The dependence of the time cost function ξ
on innate ability to go to college reflects the assumption that more able people require
less time to learn and thus can enjoy more leisure time or work longer hours while
attending college (the alternative uses of an individual’s time).18 A household that
completed college has skill s = c, a household that did not has skill s = n.
Households start their economic life at age ja with an initial endowment of financial
wealth b ≥ 0 received as inter-vivo transfer from their parents.19 Parents make these
transfers, assumed to be noncontingent on the child’s education decision20 , at their
age j f , after having observed their child’s ability draw e. This transfer is restricted to
be nonnegative. In addition to this one-time intentional intergenerational transfer b,
all households receive transfers from accidental bequests. We assume that assets of
households that die at age j are redistributed uniformly across all households of age
j − j f , that is, among the age cohort of their children. Let these age dependent transfers
be denoted by Trt,j


3.3.3 Labor Productivity

In each period of their lives households are endowed with one unit of productive time.
A household of age j with skill s ∈ {n, c} earns a wage

                                                wt,s ǫ j,s γη

per unit of time worked. Wages depend on a deterministic age profile ǫ j,s that dif-
fers across education groups, on the skill-specific average wage wt,s , a fixed effect
γ ∈ Γs = {γl,s , γh,s } that spreads out wages within each education group and remains
constant over the life cycle, and an idiosyncratic stochastic shock η. The probability
of drawing the high fixed effect prior to labor market entry is a function of the ability
of the household, and denoted by πs (γ|e). The stochastic shock η is mean-reverting
and follows an education-specific Markov chain with states Es = {ηs1 , . . . , ηsM } and
transitions πs (η ′ |η ) > 0. Let Πs denote the invariant distribution associated with πs .
Prior to making the education decision a household’s idiosyncratic shock η is drawn
from Πn . We defer a detailed description of the exact forms for πs (γ|e) and πs (η ′ |η )

17   In the quantitative implementation of the model a period will last four years, and thus households
     attend college for one model period.
18   With this time cost we also capture utility losses of poorer households who have to work part-time
     to finance their college education.
19   This is similar to Abbott et al. (2013). We model this as a one time payment only. The transfer
     payment captures the idea that parents finance part of the higher education of their children. Our
     simplifying assumptions of modeling these transfers are a compromise between incorporating di-
     rected inter-generational transfers of monetary wealth in the model and computational feasibility.
20   Note that parents of course understand whether, given b, children will go to college or not, and thus
     can affect this choice by giving a particular b.


                                                    10
to the calibration section.21 Thus at the beginning of every period in working life the
individual state variables of the household include ( j, γ, s, η, a), the household’s age j,
fixed effect γ, education s, stochastic labor productivity shock η and assets a.


3.4 Market Structure

We assume that financial markets are incomplete in that there is no insurance available
against idiosyncratic mortality and labor productivity shocks. Households can self-
insure against this risk by accumulating a risk-free one-period bond that pays a real
interest rate of rt . In equilibrium the total net supply of this bond equals the capital
stock Kt in the economy, plus the stock of outstanding government debt Bt .
Furthermore, we severely restrict the use of credit to self-insure against idiosyncratic
labor productivity and thus income shocks by imposing a strict credit limit. The only
borrowing we permit is to finance a college education. Households that borrow to pay
for college tuition and consumption while in college face age-dependent borrowing
limits of A j,t (whose size depends on the degree to which the government subsidizes
education) and also face the constraint that their balance of outstanding student loans
cannot increase after college completion. This assumption rules out that student loans
are used for general consumption smoothing.
The constraints A j,t are set such that student loans need to be fully repaid by age jr at
which early mortality sets in. This insures that households can never die in debt and
we do not need to consider the possibility and consequences of personal bankruptcy.
Beyond student loans we rule out borrowing altogether. This, among other things,
implies that households without a college degree can never borrow. As the calibration
of the model will make clear, we think of the constraints A j,t being determined by
public student loan programs, and thus one may interpret the borrowing limits as
government policy parameters that are being held fixed in our analysis.

21   The purpose of introducing the fixed effect γ instead of making wages directly depend on ability e
     is mainly computational (although we think it is plausible to make ability to succeed in college and
     ability in the labor market imperfectly correlated).
     In order to permit the share of households that go to college to vary smoothly with economic policy
     it is important that the set {e1 , e2 , . . . , e N } is sufficiently large. However, given the large state space
     for households of working age keeping track of the state variable e is costly; stochastically mapping
     e into the fixed effect γ after the education decision and restricting γ to take only two possible values
     (for each education group) reduces this burden significantly.




                                                         11
3.5 Government Policies

The government needs to finance an exogenous stream Gt of non-education expendi-
tures and an endogenous stream Et of education expenditures. It can do so by issuing
government debt Bt , by levying linear consumption taxes τc,t and income taxes Tt (yt )
which are not restricted to be linear. The initial stock of government debt B0 is given.
We restrict attention to a tax system that discriminates between the sources of income
(capital versus labor income), taxes capital income rt at at the constant rate τk,t , but
permits labor income taxes to be progressive or regressive. We take consumption and
capital income tax rates τc,t , τk,t as exogenously given, but optimize over labor income
tax schedules within a simple parametric class.
Specifically, the total amount of labor income taxes paid takes the following simple
linear form
                                                          
                                                         Yt
                          Tt (yt ) = max 0, τl,t yt − dt                         (6)
                                                         Nt
                                      = max{0, τl,t (yt − Zt )}
                                                       Yt
where yt is household taxable labor income,            Nt   is per capita income in the economy
             Yt
and Zt = dt N  t
                 measures the size of the labor income tax deduction. Therefore for
every period there are two policy parameters on the tax side, (τl,t , dt ). Note that the tax
system is potentially progressive (if dt > 0) or regressive (if dt < 0).
The government uses tax revenues to finance education subsidies θt and exogenous
government spending
                                  Gt = gy · Yt
                                        Gt
where the share of output gy =          Yt   commanded by the government is a parameter to
be calibrated from the data.22
In addition, the government administers a pure pay-as-you-go social security system
that collects payroll taxes τss,t and pays benefits pt,j (γ, s), which depend on the wages a
household has earned during her working years, and thus on her characteristics (γ, s)
as well as on the time period in which the household retired (which, given today’s
date t can be inferred from the current age j of the household). In the calibration sec-
tion we describe how we approximate the current U.S. system with its progressive
benefit schedule through the function pt,j (γ, s). Since we are interested in the optimal
progressivity of the income tax schedule given the current social security system it is
important to get the progressivity of the latter right, in order to not bias our conclusion
about the desired progressivity of income taxes. In addition, the introduction of social

22   Once we turn to the determination of optimal tax and subsidy policies we will treat G rather than
     gy as constant. A change in policy changes output Yt and by holding G fixed we assume that the
     government does not respond to the change in tax revenues by adjusting government spending (if
     we held gy constant it would).


                                                  12
security is helpful to obtain more realistic life cycle saving profiles and an empirically
more plausible wealth distribution.
Since the part of labor income that is paid by the employer as social security contribu-
tion is not subject to income taxes, taxable labor income equals (1 − 0.5τss,t ) per dollar
of labor income earned, that is

                                     yt = (1 − 0.5τss,t )wt,s ǫ j,s γηl.


3.6 Competitive Equilibrium

We deal with time sequentially, both in our specification of the model as well as in its
computation. For a given time path of prices and policies it is easiest to formulate the
household problem recursively, however. In order to do so for the different stages of
life we first collect the key decisions and state variables in a time line.


3.6.1 Time Line

     1. Newborn individuals are economically inactive but affect parental utility until
        they form a new household at age ja .

     2. Initial state variables when a new household forms are age j = ja , parental ed-
        ucation s p , parental productivity γ p , and own education s = n (the household
        does not have a college degree before having gone to college). Then an ability
        level e ∼ π (e|s p , γ p ) is drawn. Then parents decide on the inter-vivos transfer
        b, which are transfered within the period and thus immediately constitute the
        initial endowment of assets a for other ages. Then initial idiosyncratic labor pro-
        ductivity η is drawn according to Πn . Thus the state of a household prior to the
        college decision is z = ( ja , e, s = n, η, a = b/(1 + r (1 − τk ))).23

     3. Given state z, at age ja the educational decision is made. If a household decides to
        go to college, she immediately does so at age ja , and her education state switches
        to s = c at that age. Then households draw their labor productivity fixed effect γ
        from the education- and ability-contingent distribution π (γ|s, e).

     4. At age ja , but after the education decision has been made, the household problem
        differs between non-college and college households since the latter need to spend
        time and resources on college. A household that goes to college but works part
        time does so for non-college wages:

                                                   wt,n ǫ j,n γη

23   For all ages j > ja assets a brought into the period generate gross revenue (1 + r (1 − τk )) a. Given
     our timing assumption inter-vivo transfers b generate gross revenue of b. Thus the initial asset state
     of households of age ja is a = b/(1 + r (1 − τk )).

                                                     13
     where η is drawn as described above. Observe that γ is fixed whereas η is drawn
     from the non-college distribution. At the end of the college period ja the idiosyn-
     cratic shock η of college-bound households is re-drawn from the college distri-
     bution Πc and now evolves according to πc (η ′ |η ) for those with s = c. Further-
     more college-educated households draw their fixed effect from the distribution
     π (γ|c, e) prior to entering the labor market.

  5. Ages ja + 1, . . . , j f − 1: Between age of j f − 1 and j f the decision problem changes
     because children now enter the utility function and households maximize over
     per capita consumption c j /(1 + ζ f ).

  6. Ages ja + j f , . . . , ja + j f − 1: Between age of ja + j f − 1 and ja + j f the decision
     problem changes again since at age ja + j f children leave the household and the
     decision about the inter-vivos transfer b is made and lifetime utilities of children
     enter the continuation utility of parents.

  7. Age j f : Households make transfers b to their children conditional on observing
     the skills e of their children.

  8. Age ja + j f + 1, . . . , jr − 1: Only utility from own consumption and leisure enters
     the lifetime utility at these ages.

  9. Ages j = jr , . . . , J: Households are now in retirement and only earn income from
     capital and from social security benefits pt,j (e, s).


The key features of this time line are summarized in figure 1.

3.6.2 Recursive Problems of Households

We now spell out the dynamic household problems at the different stages in the life
cycle recursively.


Child at j = 0, . . . , ja − 1 Children live with their parents and command resources, but
do not make own economic decisions.


Education decision at ja Before households make the education decision households
draw ability e, their initial labor productivity η and receive inter-vivos transfers b. We
specify an indicator function for the education decision as 1s = 1s (e, η, b), where a value
of 1 indicates that the household goes to college. Recall that households, as initial
condition, are not educated in the first period, s = n and that age is j = ja . The
education decision solves
                              
                              

                              
                              
                              0 otherwise,

where Vt ( ja , e, s, η, b/(1 + r (1 − τk ))) is the lifetime utility at age j = ja , conditional on
having chosen (but not completed) education s ∈ {n, c}. It is formally given by

     Vt ( ja , e, s, η, b/(1 + r (1 − τk ))) =          ∑     π (γ|s, e)Vt ( ja , e, γ, s, η, b/(1 + r (1 − τk )))
                                                       γ∈Γs

where Vt ( ja , e, γ, s, η, b/(1 + r (1 − τk ))) is defined below and is the value function at
age ja after the fixed effect has been drawn from πs (γ|e).


Problem at j = ja After having made the education decision at age ja and having
drawn the fixed effect γ households choose how much to work, how much to consume
and how much to save. The dynamic programming problem of college-bound and
non-college bound households differ. Households first draw the fixed effect γ from
distribution π (γ|s, e) and then solve
                                 (                                                                                              )
Vt ( j, e, γ, s, η, a) =         max              u(c, 1 − 1s ξ (e) − l ) + βϕ j ∑ πs (η ′ |η )Vt+1 ( j + 1, γ, s, η ′ , a′ )
                           c,l ∈[0,1− 1s ξ (e)]                                     η′
                               a′ ≥− 1s A j,t

subject to the budget constraint

  (1 + τc,t )c + a′ + 1s (1 − θt − θ pr )κwt,c + Tt (yt ) =
                                                     (1 + (1 − τk,t )rt )(a + Trt,j ) + (1 − τss,t )wt,n ǫ j,n γηl

where yt = (1 − 0.5τss,t )wt,n ǫ j,n γηl.

                                                              15
Note that ability e is a redundant state variable for non-college bound households at
age ja , but not for households going to college, since the time loss for doing so still
depends on e. It does become a redundant state variable at age ja + 1 and thus does not
appear on the right hand side of the Bellman equation above.24


Problem at ja + 1, . . . , j f − 1 At these ages education is completed, thus no time and
resource cost for education is being incurred. The problem reads as
                                   (                                                )

where yt = (1 − 0.5τss,t )wt,s ǫ j,s γηl.

Problem at j f + ja This is the age of the household where children leave the home,
parents give them an inter-vivos transfer b and the children’s lifetime utility enters
that of their parents. The dynamic problem becomes

      from Πc (η ′ ) rather than πc (η ′ |η ).

where yt = (1 − 0.5τss,t )wt,s ǫ j,s γηl (e′ )
Since parents can observe the ability of their children e′ before giving the transfer, the
transfer b (and thus all other choices in that period) are contingent on e′ . Also notice
that all children in the household are identical. Since parents do not observe the initial
labor productivity of their children, parental choices cannot be made contingent on it,
and expectations over η ′ have to be taken in the Bellman equation of parents over the
lifetime utility of their children.25


Problem at j f + ja + 1, . . . , jr − 1 Now children have left the household, and the deci-
sion problem exactly mimics that in ages j ∈ { jc + 1, . . . , j f − 1}. Observe that there is
a discontinuity in the value function along the age dimension from age j f + ja to age
j f + ja + 1 because the lifetime utility of the child does no longer enter parental utility
after age j f + ja .


Problem at jr , . . . , J Finally, in retirement households have no labor income (and con-
sequently no labor income risk). Thus the maximization problem is given by

                                             
                       Vt ( j, γ, s, a) = max u(c, 1) + βϕ j Vt+1 ( j + 1, γ, s, a′ )
                                           c,a′ ≥0

subject to the budget constraint

                      (1 + τc,t )c + a′ = (1 + (1 − τk,t )rt )(a + Trt,j ) + pt,j (γ, s).

25    Note that we make parents choose transfers noncontingent on the college choice of their children.
      Mechanically it is no harder to let this choice be contingent on the college choice. Note that permit-
      ting such contingency affects choices, since making transfers contingent permits parents to implic-
      itly provide better insurance against η-risk. If the transfers also could be conditioned on η, then we
      conjecture that it does not matter whether they in addition are made contingent on the education
      decision of the children or not. Note that in any case, parents can fully think through what transfer
      induces what education decision.

        is aggregate private spending on education.

     6. Φt+1,j+1 = Ht,j Φt,j where Ht,j is the law of motion induced by the exogenous popu-
        lation dynamics, the exogenous Markov processes for labor productivity and the endoge-
        nous asset accumulation, education and transfer decisions a′t , 1s,t , bt .

The law of motion for the measures explicitly states as follows. Define the Markov
transition function at time t for age j as

     Qt,j ((γ, s, η, a), (Γ × S × E × A)) =
                                 (
                                   ∑η ′ ∈E πs (η ′ |η )          if γ ∈ Γ, s ∈ S , and a′t ( j, γ, s, η, a) ∈ A
                                        0                        else.

That is, the probability of going from state (γ, s, η, a) into a set of states (Γ × S × E × A)
tomorrow is zero if that set does not include the current education level and education
type, and A does not include the optimal asset choice.27 If it does, then the transition
probability is purely governed by the stochastic shock process for η.
The age-dependent measures are given, for all j ≥ ja , by
                                                           Z
                  Φt+1,j+1 ((Γ × S × E × A)) =                  Qt,j (., (Γ × S × E × A)) dΦt,j .

27    There is one exception: at age j = jc college-educated households redraw their income shock η and
      draw their fixed effect according to π (γ′ |c, e). For this group therefore the transition function at that
      age reads as
                                                  (
                                                      ∑γ′ ∈Γ ∑η ′ ∈E π (γ′ |c, e)Πc (η ′ ) if a′t ( j, e, c, η, a) ∈ A

The initial measure over types at age j = ja (after the college decision has been made)
is more complicated.28 Households start with assets from transfers from their parents
determined by the inter-vivos transfer function bt , draw initial mean reverting produc-
tivity according to Πn (η ′ ), determine education according to the index function 1s,t
evaluated at their draw e′ , η ′ and the optimal bequests of the parents and draw the

tax system (T ) and Φ1 = Φ0 is the initial distribution of households in the stationary
equilibrium under the status quo policy.29

28   Part of the complication is that at age ja the individual state space includes ability e which then
     becomes a redundant state variable. Thus the measures for age ja will be defined over e as well, and
     it is understood that the transition function Qt,ja from age ja to age ja + 1 (and only at this age) has
     as first argument (e, γ, s, η, a).
29   Note that future generations’ lifetime utilities are implicitly valued through the value functions of
     their parents. Of course there is nothing wrong in principle to additionally include future genera-
     tions’ lifetime utility in the social welfare function with some weight, but this adds additional free
     parameters (the social welfare weights).

4.2 Optimal Tax System

In our optimal policy analysis we hold constant the capital income and consumption
tax rate as well as the pension contribution rate (and the borrowing constraints for
student loans A j,t ) and optimize over labor income taxes and education subsidy rates.
Therefore, given initial conditions (K0 , B0 ), consumption taxes, capital income taxes,
a pension system, borrowing constraints and a cross-section of households Φ0 deter-
mined by a stationary (to be calibrated policy τl,0, θ0 , d0 , b0 = B0 /Y0 ), the optimal tax
reform is defined as the sequence T ∗ = {τl,t , θt , dt , Bt }∞
                                                              t=1 that maximizes the social
welfare function, i.e., that solves

                                 T ∗ ∈ arg max SWF(T ).
                                            T ∈Γ

Here Γ is the set of policies for which an associated competitive equilibrium exists.
Unfortunately the set Γ is too large a policy space to optimize over. Our objective here
is to characterize the optimal one-time policy reform, by restricting the sequences that
are being optimized over to

                                        τl,t = τl,1
                                         θ t = θ1
                                         d t = d1

for all t ≥ 1. Note that the associated debt to GDP ratio will of course not be constant
over time. Since all admissible policies defined by (τl,1 , θ1 , d1 ) have to lie in Γ, from
the definition of equilibrium there must be an associated sequence of { Bt } such that
the government budget constraint is satisfied in every period. This imposes further
restrictions on the set of possible triples (τl,1 , θ1 , d1 ) over which the optimization of
the social welfare function is carried out, i.e., the path of government debt has to be
consistent with initial conditions and a long-run stationary equilibrium.

5.1 Demographics

We take survival probabilities from the Social Security Administration life tables. The
total fertility rate f in the economy is assumed to be f = 1.14, reflecting the fact that
a mother on average has about 2 f = 2.28 children. This number also determines the
population growth rate, cf. equation (1). Each period in the model has a length of
four years. Children are born with age 0 and form households at biological age 18. We
discard the first two years of childhood and accordingly set ja = 184−2 = 4. Households
require 4 actual years to complete a college education and therefore exit college at
model age jc = ja + 1 = 5. They have children at biological age 30, which is model

                                             21
age j f = 7. Retirement occurs at biological age 66 (age bin 62-65 is the last working
period of life), hence jr = 16. The maximum life span is 101 years, i.e., the last period
households are alive is biological age bin 98-101 and accordingly J = 24.


5.2 Labor Productivity Process

Recall that a household of age j with education s ∈ {n, c}, fixed effect γ and idiosyn-
cratic shock η earns a wage of
                                       wt,s ǫ j,s γ
where ws is the skill-specific wage per labor efficiency unit in period t.
We estimate the deterministic, age- and education-specific component of labor produc-
tivity {ε j,s } from PSID data (cf. Ludwig, Schelkle and Vogel 2012) and normalize the
mean productivity at the age of college completion, jc = ja + 1, for s = n to ǫ jc ,n = 1.
The estimated profile ǫ jc ,c is scaled up by a fixed constant, ε, such that the average col-
lege wage premium in the model is 80%, in line with U.S. data for the later part of the
2000’s (see, e.g., Heathcote et al. 2010).
We choose the stochastic mean reverting component of wages η as a two state Markov
chain with education-specific states for log-wages {−σs , σs } and transition matrix
                                                      !
                                         πs    1 − πs
                              Π=                        .
                                       1 − πs    πs
In order to parameterize this Markov chain we first estimate the following process on
the education-specific PSID samples selected by Karahan and Ozkan (2012):
                                        log wt = α + zt
                                             zt = ̺zt−1 + ηt ,
where α is an individual-specific fixed effect that is assumed to be normally distributed
(with cross-sectional variance σα2 ). The estimation results are summarized in the left
part of table 1.30
For each education group we choose the two numbers (πs , σs ) such that the two-state
Markov chain for wages we use has exactly the same persistence and conditional vari-
ance as the AR(1) process estimated above.31 This yields parameter choices given in
the right part of table 1.
30   For the details of the sample selection we refer the reader to Karahan and Ozkan (2012) and we thank
     the authors for providing us with the estimates for the process specified in the main text. In their
     paper they estimate a richer stochastic process (which, if implemented in our framework, would
     lead to at least one additional state variable).
31   The (unconditional) persistence of the AR(1) process is given by ̺ and the conditional variance by
     ση2 whereas the corresponding statistics for the Markov chain read as 2πs − 1 and σs2 , respectively.
     For a model where a period lasts 4 years and the AR(1) process is estimated on yearly data, the
     corresponding statistics are ̺4 and (1 + ̺2 + ̺4 + ̺6 )ση2.

Note: The left part of this table summarizes the estimates of the AR(1) stochastic earn-
ings process from the PSID, separately for unskilled and skilled individuals. The right
part summarizes the corresponding discretized earnings process used in the model
economy.

After de-logging, the wage states are normalized so that the mean of the stochastic
component of wages equals 1. We observe that college educated agents face somewhat
smaller wage shocks, but that these shocks are slightly more persistent than for non-
college educated households.
This leaves us with the fixed component of wages γ ∈ {γl,s , γh,s } drawn from an
ability-dependent distribution π (γ|s, e). We calibrate the parameters governing this
wage component so that our model under the status quo policy matches selected wage
or earnings observations from the data. We assume that

                                π (γ = γh |e, s = c) = e
                                π (γ = γh |e, s = n) = ν · e

and, of course, π (γ = γl |e, s) = 1 − π (γ = γh |e, s). Here ν is a parameter. The dis-
tribution of e itself is discussed in subsection 5.7. Note that since the γ’s are education
specific and the probability of drawing the (education-specific) high γh,s is a function
of ability e, the wage benefits of going to college will be ability-specific as well. In ap-
pendix B we show that this premium is lower for the marginal college attendee (and
thus for the households drawn newly into college by an increase in the college subsidy
θ) than the average college wage premium.
The parameters {γl,n , γh,n , γl,c , γh,c , ν} are chosen jointly such that the stationary equi-
librium of the status quo economy attains the following targets:

   • Normalizations: the average γ is equal to one for each s ∈ {n, c} [2 targets].

   • The estimated variances of the fixed effect for both education groups σα2 displayed
     in the last column of table 1. Note that the variances in the model are determined,
     for each s, by the spread between γl,s and γh,s (as well as the probabilities of
     drawing them, see next bullet point) [2 targets]

   • The college earnings premium of marginal households (those close to indiffer-
     ent between attending and not attending under the benchmark policy), as em-

                                              23
      pirically measured by Findeisen and Sachs (2014). In our model this statistic is
      primarily governed by parameter ν. [1 target].


5.3 Technology

The parameters to be calibrated are (α, δ, ρ). We choose the parameter ρ = 0.285, corre-
sponding to an elasticity of substitution elasticity between unskilled and skilled labor
of 1−1 ρ = 1.4, as estimated by Katz and Murphy (1992); see also Borjas (2003). In order
to evaluate the importance of general equilibrium wage effects we also study a ver-
sion of the model in which both types of labor are perfect substitutes, ρ = 1, and thus
  1                                                                               Lc
1− ρ = ∞. In this case a change in the relative supply of college-educated labor, L n , will
                                       wc
have no impact on its relative price, w n
                                          . In appendix C.2 we show that when moving
from the imperfect to the perfect substitution case we do not have to recalibrate any of
the other parameters (apart from a TFP scaling factor in the production function) for
the model to attain the same steady state statistics.
The capital share is set to α = 1/3. Furthermore we target an investment to output
ratio of 20% and a capital-output ratio of 2.65 as in Fernandez-Villaverde and Krueger
(2011) who measure capital as the sum of private nonresidential fixed assets, private
residential structures and consumer durable goods from NIPA. Accounting for popu-
lation growth this implies a yearly depreciation rate of 7.55% and thus a yearly interest
rate of about 5.4%. The capital-output ratio (equivalently, the real interest rate) will be
attained by appropriate calibration of the preference parameters (especially the time
discount factor β), as discussed below.


5.4 Government Policy

In the initial steady state the policy parameters to be chosen are (τk , τl , τc , τp , d, b, gy).
We pick b = 0.6 and gy = 0.17 to match a government debt to GDP ratio of 60% and
government consumption (net of tertiary education expenditure) to GDP ratio of 17%.
Consumption taxes can be estimated from NIPA data as in Mendoza, Razin and Tesar
(1994) who find τc ≈ 0.05. For the capital income tax rate, we adopt Chari and Kehoe’s
(2006) estimate of τk = 28.3% for the early 2000’s.
The payroll tax τss = 12.4% is chosen to match the current social security payroll tax
(excluding Medicare). We model social security benefits pt,j (e, s) as a concave func-
tion of average wages earned during a household’s working life, in order to obtain a
reasonably accurate approximation to the current progressive US benefit formula, but
without the need to add a continuous state variable to the model. The details of the
calibration of social security benefits are contained in appendix C.1.
We calibrate the labor income tax deduction to match the sum of standard deductions
and exemptions from the US income tax code. Both median income as well as the size

                                               24
of the standard exemption and deduction varies by household size and type, but their
ratio is roughly constant at 35%. Thus we calibrate the deduction in the benchmark
economy to 35% of the (endogenous) median income in the model. That is, we choose
                                   d·Y/N
the policy parameter d such that med (ygross )
                                               = 35%, where Y/N is output per capita in
the model.32 Finally the marginal tax rate on labor income τl is chosen to balance the
government budget.33


5.5 Preferences

The bequest parameter υ is chosen so that in equilibrium total transfers—i.e., the sum
of inter-vivo transfers and accidental bequests—in the economy account for 1.7% of
wealth as in the 1986 SCF (summarized by Gale and Scholz, 1994). We specify the
period utility function as
                                               h                                      i 1− σ
                                                   c µ ( 1 − 1 s ξ ( e ) − l ) 1− µ
                                 u(c, l ) =                                                    .
                                                                  1−σ
We a priori choose σ = 4 and then determine the time discount factor β and the weight
on leisure µ in the utility function such that in the benchmark model the capital-output
ratio is 2.65 and households on average work 1/3 of their time.34,35

32   In 2009, according to the U.S. Census Bureau Statistical Abstract of the United States 2012 (table 692),
     median household money income of a household of 4 members was $73,071, relative to a sum of
     standard deduction ($11,400) and four times the exemption (4 · 3, 650) of $26,000. The corresponding
     numbers for a two person household are $53,676 and $18,700 and for a single person of $26,080 and
     10,350. The corresponding ratios are d = 35.6%, d = 34.8% and d = 35.9%.
     We approximate money income in the model as

                            ygross (0, j, γ, s, η ) = ( a + Tr ) · r + (1 − 0.5τss,1)w0,s ǫ j,s γηl

     with social security contributions by the employer not part of the measure of income to which we
     relate the size of the deduction.
33   Alternatively we could have chosen (d, τl ) such that the model matches the relative dispersion—
     measured, e.g., by the variance of logs—of pre-tax and disposable income. Using the tax function
     estimates reported in Heathcote et al. (2014) gives an empirical target of 0.72, whereas our model
     implies a value of 0.86, suggesting that our simple benchmark tax system misses progressivity at
     higher income. Matching this statistic would have required (d = 0.37, τl = 0.32) and thus a more
     progressive tax system. Note that this alternative choice of the status quo does not affect, abstracting
     from recalibration of the other parameters, the determination of the optimal tax system.
                                                                                        
34                                                                    1− µ (1− σ )    1− l
     These preferences imply a Frisch elasticity of labor supply of        σ           l     , and with an average
     labor supply of l = 1/3 one could be worried that the Frisch labor supply elasticity, which, given the
     parameter estimates will be around 1 for most households, is implausibly high. But note that this
     elasticity of labor supply of entire households, not that of white prime age males on which many
     lower empirical estimates are based. Also, the average Frisch elasticity for households in the age
     bin 24-54 in our model is at 0.6 which we view as a conservative estimate.
35   The coefficient of relative risk aversion with this formulation equals σµ + 1 − µ ≈ 2.

                                                             25
5.6 Education Costs and Subsidies

We choose the resource cost for college education κ and the share of expenses borne by
the government and private sources, θ and θ pr , in the benchmark model to match the
total average yearly cost of going to college, as a fraction of GDP per capita, κw c
                                                                                 ȳ , and
                             (1− θ − θ pr )κwc
the cost net of subsidies,        Y/N          .
To calculate the corresponding numbers from the data we turn to Ionescu and Simpson
(2014) who report an average net price (tuition, fees, room and board net of grants and
education subsidies) for a four year college (from 2003-04 to 2007-08) to be $58, 654 and
for a two year college of $20, 535. They also report that 67% of all students that finish
college completed a 4 year college and 33% a two year college. Thus the average net
cost of tuition and fees for one year of college is

                       0.67 · 58, 654/4 + 0.33 · 20, 535/2 = $13, 213.

Average GDP per capita during this time span was, in constant 2005 dollars, $42,684.
Thus
                   (1 − θ − θ pr )κwc
                                      = 13, 213/42, 684 = 0.31.
                         Y/N

Furthermore education at a glance (OECD 2012, Table B3.2b) reports that the share of
tertiary education expenditures borne by public and private subsidies is θ = 38.8%
and θ pr = 16.6%, so that
                             κwc       0.31
                                  =              = 0.694.
                            Y/N     1 − θ − θ pr
Thus the cost parameter κ is calibrated so that the equilibrium of the benchmark model
    κwc
has Y/N = 0.694.


5.7 Ability Transitions and College Time Costs

Newly formed households draw their ability from a distribution π (e|s p , γ p ) whose
mean µ(s p , γ p ) depends on the education level s p and permanent labor productivity
γ p of their parents; recall that the distribution of the latter is in turn determined by
parental ability e p . We interpret e ∈ [0, 1] as basic ability to succeed in college and in
the labor market. We assume that e follows a normal distribution with mean µ(s p , γ p )
and standard deviation σe , truncated to the unit interval, that is, for all e p ∈ [0, 1]

where ψ is the pdf of a standard normal and Ψ is the cdf of a standard normal. Note
that both the numerator as well as the denominator is dependent on µ(s p , γ p ). By

                                                   26
assuming that                             (

the distribution of ability is characterized by three parameters χ, ζ, σe where χ mea-
sures the impact of parental ability on children’s ability, whereas ζ captures the im-
portance of parental education. We choose χ to fit the intergenerational persistence of
earnings in the data, ζ > 0 to match college completion rates conditional on parental
education s = c (that is, to match intergenerational persistence in education) and σe
such that 95% of the probability mass of the e-distribution lies in the unit interval
e ∈ [0, 1].
Note that this parametrization of the intergenerational ability transmission gives both a
role to parental education and to parental ability (through their draws of γ) for shaping
children’s ability e. We then restrict e to take on a discrete set of ne = 31 values that are
evenly spaced in the unit interval.36 Based on their ability e the time requirement for
attending class and studying in college is given by the function


                                              ξ (e) = exp(−λe)
where λ > 0 is a parameter that governs the importance of ability e for the time (and
thus utility) cost of going to college. We calibrate λ to match the overall share of house-
holds completing college in the data.
To obtain college completion rates of students by parental education we turn to the
National Education Longitudinal Study (NELS:88).37 We compute the percent of indi-
viduals from this nationally representative sample who were first surveyed as eighth-
graders in the spring of 1988, that by 2000 had obtained at least a Bachelors degree, con-
ditional on the highest education level of their parents. We identify s p = c in our model
with the highest education of a parent being at least a Bachelors degree (obtained by
1992). We find that for students with parents in the s p = c category 63.3% have com-
pleted a Bachelors degree. The corresponding number for parents with s p = n is 28.8%.


5.8 Borrowing Constraints

The borrowing constraints faced by agents pursuing a college degree allow such an
agent to finance a fraction φ ∈ [0, 1] of all tuition bills with credit. We specify a constant
(minimum) payment rp such that at the age of retirement all college loans are repaid.
Formally
                               A ja ,t = φ(1 − θt − θ pr )κwt,c .

36   We do not directly target intergenerational ability persistence. Our calibration implies model inter-
     generational ability persistence of 0.22. The ability persistence appears to be somewhat lower than
     in the data, cf. Abbott, Gallipoli, Meghir and Violante (2013).

and rp is chosen such that the terminal condition A jr ,t = 0 is met.
The parameter φ to be calibrated determines how tight the borrowing constraint for
college is. Note that in contrast rp is not a calibration parameter but an endogenously
determined repayment amount that insures that households do not retire with out-
standing student loans.

households).38 Relative to GDP per capita in 2008 of $48, 000, this given maximum
debt constitutes 14% and 23.4% of GDP per capita. Compare that to the 31% of to-
tal costs computed above, this indicates that independent undergraduate students can
borrow at most approximately 75% of the cost of college, and thus we set φ = 0.75.
The justification for our choice of φ again clarifies that it should best be thought of as
an education policy parameter that is being held fixed in our optimal policy analysis.
Table 2 above summarizes the parameters used in our optimal tax computations.



6 Results

In this section we present our results. We first discuss what determines the education
decision in the initial steady state; since that steady state is identical across the per-
fect and imperfect substitutability case no distinction is needed. We then turn to the
determination of the optimal tax-subsidy policy showing that considering transitional
dynamics and general equilibrium wage effects are crucial for the normative policy
analysis. Finally we discuss the sources of the welfare gains from the optimal policy,
relative to the initial status quo.


6.1 How the Model Works: The Education Decision

Prior to presenting the optimal tax results it is instructive to discuss how households
make their key economic decisions for a given policy. Ours is a fairly standard life cycle
model with idiosyncratic wage risk, and thus the life cycle profiles of consumption,
asset and labor supply are consistent with those reported in the literature (see e.g.
Conesa et al. (2009), figure 1). Instead, here we explore how the optimal education
decision is made, as a function of the initial characteristics of the household. This
focus is further warranted by the observation that the optimal policy will have a strong
impact on this decision and will result in a significant change in the share of households
obtaining an education in the aggregate, which is in turn important for understanding
the optimality of the policy in the first place.
Recall that households, at the time of the college decision (that is, at age ja ) differ ac-
cording to (e, η, b), that is, their ability to go to college e, their wages outside college (as
determined by the idiosyncratic shock η), and their initial asset levels resulting from
parental transfers b. In figure 2 we display the share of households deciding to go to
college, under the status quo policy, as a function of e, both for households with low
and with high η realizations. All households with high abilities (e ≥ e22 ) go to college,
and non of the households with very low ability (e ≤ e10 ) do. For households in the
middle of the ability distribution, their decision depends on the attractiveness of the

38   Note that about 66% of students finishing four year colleges have debt, and conditional on having
     debt the average amount is $23, 186 and the median amount is $20, 000.

option of working in the labor market: a larger share of households with lower op-
portunity costs (low η) attends college. Finally, a share strictly between zero and one,
conditional on η, indicates that heterogeneity in wealth b among the youngest cohort
(which in turn stems from wealth and thus transfer heterogeneity of their parents) is
an important determinant of the college decision for those in the middle of the ability
distribution (e ∈ [e11 , e21 ]).
This point is further reinforced by figure 3 which displays the college decision indicator
function in dependence of initial assets b, and conditional on the non-college wage
realization η. A value of 0 on the y-axis stands for not attending college, a value of
1 represents the decision to go to college. Assets on the x-axis are normalized such
that a value of b = 1 stands for assets equal to one time average asset holdings of the
parental generation at the age intergenerational transfers are given. We display the
policy function for those with relatively low ability (e = e17 ) and those with relatively
high ability (e = e25 ).
We make several observations. First, and not surprisingly, lower-ability households go
to college for a smaller range of initial assets than do high ability households. Second,
as discussed above, a higher non-college wage reduces the incidence of attending col-
lege. Finally and perhaps most interestingly, the effects of initial wealth on the college
decision are non-monotone. For households at the low end of the wealth distribution
(and with sufficiently low e) the borrowing constraint is important. Although the gov-
ernment subsidizes college (in the status quo it covers a 38.8% share of the costs) and
although households can borrow 75% of the remaining resource costs, at zero or close
to zero wealth a household might still not be able to afford college. That is, either it

is impossible for these households to maintain positive consumption even by work-
ing full time while attending college, or the resulting very low level of consumption
and/or leisure make such a choice suboptimal. As parental transfers b increase the bor-
rowing constraint is relaxed and even the less able households decide to go to college.
Finally, sufficiently wealthy households that expect to derive a dominant share of their
lifetime income from capital income find it suboptimal to invest in college and bear
the time and resource cost in exchange for larger labor earnings after college. Note,
however, that although this last result follows from the logic of our model, it is not im-
portant quantitatively since the stationary asset transfer distribution puts essentially
no mass on initial assets b ≥ 5.


6.2 Analysis of Optimal Policy Transitions

We now document our main optimal policy results, proceeding in three steps. First, in
the next subsection, we summarize the optimal fiscal constitution for our benchmark
economy when both transitional dynamics and general equilibrium relative wage ef-
fects are taken into account in the analysis. Then, in the following two subsections, we
aim at providing intuition for the results by first analyzing the optimal steady state pol-
icy in the absence of relative wage movements (section 6.2.2), and then documenting
the quantitative importance of transitional dynamics in section 6.2.3.

6.2.1 The Optimal Policies

Table 3 displays the optimal policy combinations, both for maximizing steady state and
transitional welfare.39 In addition, the table provides summary measures of aggregate
economic activity40 and inequality statistics for the initial steady state with status quo
policy (column 2), and the final state of the optimal policy induced transition (column
3). Column 4 shows the change in these variables between the initial and the final
steady state.41 Finally, columns 5 and 6 do the same, but for the optimal steady state
policy that ignores transitional dynamics and hence transitional welfare.42
The first five rows of table 3 display the fiscal constitution in the economy, both in the
initial steady state as well as in the social optimum. Recall that τl is the marginal labor
                                                     Y
income tax rate, θ the public subsidy rate, Z = d N     is the size of the labor income tax
deduction and d measures the size of the deduction relative to income per capita. They
show that (see columns 3 and 4 of the table43 ), starting from the status quo, the opti-
mal policy transition is obtained by a significantly larger education subsidy of 150%
and a significantly less progressive tax system. The deduction d falls from 27% to 6%
of average income, and thus the optimal tax system, when combined with a generous
education subsidy, is not far away from a proportional labor income tax system. The
welfare gains from the optimal policy transition, relative to the status quo are substan-
tial, in the order of 3.5% of lifetime consumption.
In order to start understanding where these welfare gains emerge from we turn to the
remaining rows of table 3 and figure 4, which collects the transitional dynamics of key
macroeconomic aggregates induced by the optimal policy reform.
The upper left panel of figure 4 displays both the share of the youngest cohort going
to college as well as the overall fraction of the population. It shows that the increase
in the college subsidy and the reduction in marginal (and average) tax rates for high
income earners induces a college boom on impact. The share of the youngest cohort
completing college rises from 44% in the initial steady state to about 67% in the first

39   In order to meaningfully compare the optimal steady state policies and the optimal transition poli-
     cies we adopt the same type of welfare criterion when maximizing steady state welfare as when
     maximizing transitional welfare: the integral of lifetime utilities, weighted by the cross-sectional
     distribution of state variables in the intitial steady state. In contrast to maximizing expected utility
     of a newborn household (as often done in the literature, see e.g. Conesa et al., 2009), this welfare
     measure places positive weight on older households even in the steady state.
40   All variables are denoted in per capita terms.
41   For variables that are already in % units we report the percentage point changes. For the Gini coeffi-
     cients we simply report the point changes.
42   When characterizing optimal steady state policies we hold constant the government debt to GDP
     ratio at its initial steady state level.
43   We will return to the optimal steady state results in columns 5 and 6 below.

The second observation we make from the upper left panel is that the share of college
bound youngsters is falling over time. The reason for this reduction is displayed in

44   We also observe a further discrete upward jump in the share of the newborn cohort attending college
     30 years after the initial policy reform. The distribution of ability of children is partially determined
     by the persistence of innate ability, but also impacted by parental education. The boost of college
     attendance on impact generates more highly educated parents thirty years later, and thus a more
     favorable college ability distribution which in turn makes a higher share of children attend college
     themselves. Further, but smaller, echo effects are observed for later generations.

time. The elasticity of substitution between unskilled and skilled labor is 1.4 (ρ =
0.285)

figure 5 which shows wages of college and non-college households relative to their
initial steady state levels. From the figure it is clear that the college wage premium
decreases substantially over time.45 Consequently the college boom lessens over time,
although the share of young cohorts going to college remains about 23% (or about
10.5% points) above its initial steady state level. As a consequence, as we will show in
sections 6.2.2 and 6.2.3, the skill distribution improves much less pronouncedly in the
economy with general equilibrium relative wage effects, compared to the economy in
which this effect is absent.
Third, whereas the share of the youngest cohort going to college increases immediately
by close to 60% on policy impact, it takes approximately two generations (roughly 60
years) until the overall skill distribution has reached a level close to its new steady state
value. It is this sluggish dynamics of the skill and thus labor productivity distribution
that a restriction to a long-run steady state policy analysis would miss completely.

45   Also note that, at least in the long-run, the overall wage level per efficiency unit of labor increases
     moderately, see table 3. In consequence, absolute wages of the unskilled increase and this increases
     is stronger than the fall of wages of the skilled.

Note: this figure plots the transition paths of (average) wages for college-educated and
unskilled workers aginst time. The elasticity of substitution between unskilled and
skilled labor is 1.4 (ρ = 0.285)

The trends in educational attainment and thus average labor productivity are reflected
in aggregate output and consumption, as figure 4 and table 3 show. First, focusing
on the long run steady state, the optimal policy reform has a strong long-run positive
effect on output and consumption per capita (8% and 10.3% in table 3), despite the fact
that hours worked only move moderately (by 1.3% points) in response to the lower
marginal labor income taxes. Nevertheless labor efficiency units per person NL increase
drastically (by 7.7%) in the new, relative to the old steady state, on account of a more
skilled workforce.
However, as discussed above, the skill distribution evolves slowly. The upper right
and the lower left panel of figure 6 show the corollary of this result: as the skill dis-
tribution improves only slowly and more and more on average more skilled cohorts
enter the labor force over time, effective labor units supplied and output per capita
(upper right panel) increase slowly along the transition as well. The lower right panel
documents the same for consumption, and also shows that average hours worked in-
crease on impact by about 3% (1.3% points) because of the decline in the marginal tax
rate τl . This is true despite the fact that a larger share of the youngest age cohort now
goes to college and thus withdraws temporarily from the labor force.46
Finally, the lower right panel of figure 6 displays the evolution of government debt
per capita and the debt-to-output ratio. Given the tax and education policy and the

46   College students can and do work while studying, but the hours they supply are quantitatively
     minor.


                                                         35
initial debt level the sequence of government debt is determined from the sequence of
period government budget constraints. The government finds it optimal (through the
setting of τl , θ, d), to smooth the transitional costs of building up a higher human capital
stock (i.e., high education policy costs and relatively lax revenues due to low—relative
to the final steady state—economic activity) by borrowing along the transition. As a
consequence the debt to output ratio increases from 60% to 80% (an increase of about
20% percentage points, or 33%) along the transition. Debt per capita is increasing more
strongly than that since GDP is also increasing along the transition, although not at the
same speed as debt itself, which explains the increase in the debt to GDP ratio.
On the distributional side, consumption and wealth inequality fall despite the reduc-
tion in the labor income tax progressivity. This is mainly due to the fact that in the final
steady state there are significantly less consumption- and wealth poor unskilled house-
holds. Furthermore, the college wage premium shrinks significantly in response to the
policy reform, further aiding the decline in consumption inequality. Overall, and to
summarize, the policy reform increases educational attainments, raise output and con-
sumption per capita significantly both in the short and in the long run on account of a
more productive workforce and at the same time reduces consumption inequality on
account of a narrowing college wage premium, despite the fact that the tax system has
become less redistributive.47 In the next subsections we document the importance of
the general equilibrium wage effects as well as an explicit consideration of the transi-
tional dynamics for this finding.


6.2.2 The Importance of General Equilibrium Relative Wage Effects

In table 4 we summarize the optimal policy reforms and associated aggregate and dis-
tributional consequences in an economy where skilled and unskilled labor are perfect
substitutes but all other model parameters remain unchanged.48
Comparing first the optimal steady state policies (column 5 and 6 in both tables 3 and
4) between the benchmark economy and the perfect substitutes case reveals the im-
portance of the general equilibrium wage effects for optimal policy design. Whereas
the optimal education subsidy is similarly large in both cases (and substantially larger
than in the initial status quo) the degree of tax progressivity differs fundamentally. In
the benchmark economy where redistribution across different ability e types and thus
across eduction groups can be achieved through the general equilibrium wage effects
induced by the education subsidies, a strongly progressive tax system is not desirable
even in the steady state: d = 10% is optimal, relative to the benchmark of d = 27%.

47   Hours worked increase slightly and hours (and thus leisure) inequality rises somewhat, but both
     effects are quantitatively rather modest.
48   Recall that appendix C.2 demonstrates that by simply scaling the aggregate TFP parameter we can
     insure that this version of the model attains the same aggregates in the initial steady state as the
     benchmark economy


                                                   36
If education policies stimulating college attendance do not affect the college wage pre-
mium as in the perfect substitutes case, instead a strongly progressive tax system with
a deduction worth 31% of average income (and thus more progressive than the status
quo) is optimal when the government is maximizing steady state welfare.

Note: This table summarizes optimal policies and the long-run change in macroeco-
nomic aggregates, distributions and welfare for ρ = 1 (in which case unskilled and
skilled labor are perfect substitutes in production).

From table 4) we observe that the steady state optimal policy change reduces hours
worked in the steady state substantially (by 2.75% points, or 8.4%). However, absent
the reduction in the college wage premium the education boom is so massive that labor
input as well as output and consumption per capita rise substantially. The reduction
in consumption inequality and the welfare gains are similar between the steady states
in the imperfect substitutes case and the perfect substitutes case, but they are achieved

                                            37
with different tools: in the latter case, since relative wages don’t move by construction,
redistribution has to be achieved via the income tax code, as a deduction of d = 31%
(relative to d = 10% in the benchmark) shows. This in turn has severe consequences
for the importance of the transitional dynamics in optimal policy design, as the next
subsection will demonstrate.

Note: this figure plots the transition paths of key macroeconomic aggregates aginst
time. Unskilled and skilled labor are prefect substitutes (ρ = 1)

As already discussed in the benchmark case, it takes time (and resources) to build up a
more skilled workforce, suggesting that an explicit consideration of the transition path
is important. Comparing the optimal policy transition and the steady state optimal
policy (columns 3 and 5 of table 4) strongly reinforces this point. Explicitly taking into
account the transitional costs, the optimal tax code should become less, not more pro-
gressive. This raises two questions, a) why is there such a divergence between steady
state optimal and dynamically optimal policies? and b) why doesn’t this divergence
show up in the benchmark version of the model (compare columns 3 and 5 of table 3)?
The answer to the first question is contained in figures 6, displaying the evolution

                                                          38
of macroeconomic aggregates in the perfect substitution case under the transition-
optimal policy and showing monotonically increasing aggregate consumption, and
figure 7 which shows the transition path for consumption for different policy com-
binations. We see in figure 7 how the economy goes through a recession if the decrease
of taxes and the reduction of the tax deduction would not have taken place when the
education subsidy is increased (d = 0.27, θ = 1.2). As households are drawn from
the labor market into college, the economy experiences a transitional decline in out-
put and per capita consumption. The figure also shows the outcome along the transi-
tion if the government would implement the optimal steady state policy combination
(d = 0.31, θ = 1.7). In this case the recession is even more severe because the subsidy
is substantially higher and so are marginal labor income taxes and the tax deduction.49

Note: this figure plots the transition paths of per capita consumption under different
policy configurations. The elasticity of substitution between unskilled and skilled labor
is 1.4 (ρ = 0.285).

Table 5 summarizes the associated welfare consequences from the policy reform. With
the increase of the tax subsidy alone, there are still welfare gains, but they are much
smaller than in the optimum. An implementation of the optimal steady state policy in-
stead leads to substantial welfare losses along the transition. These findings represent
our first main result perhaps most clearly: an explicit consideration of the transition
path when conducting a normative welfare analysis of education and tax policies can
change even the qualitative prescriptions for optimal fiscal policy dramatically.

49   Interestingly, the long-run increase of per capita consumption is smaller than in the steady state
     comparison. Taking the transition into account when implementing the optimal steady state policy
     leads to a long-run increase of per capita consumption by only about 2% whereas the last column of
     table 4 shows an increase of about 5%.

Note: This table displays the welfare gains, relative to the status quo, from transitions
induced by different policy configurations in the perfect substitution case.

This finding raises the second question: why doesn’t the same logic apply also to the
benchmark economy, where, as columns 3 and 5 of table 3) show, there is no strong
divergence between steady state and transition-optimal policies. In the next section we
argue that the answer lies in the fact that the general equilibrium wage effects allow the
government to achieve effective redistribution through education subsidies. Therefore
a high degree of tax progressivity (as embedded in a high deduction d) is not required
to achieve a less dispersed consumption distribution even in the steady state.


6.2.4 Progressive Income Taxation and Education Subsidies: Complements or Sub-
      stitutes?

In this subsection we stress the importance of the general equilibrium wage response
to fiscal policy and explore its role further. As one summary measure, recall that the
welfare gain of switching to the optimal policy (d = 0.06, θ = 1.5) in the benchmark
economy was 3.5% (see column 4, last row in table 3). In comparison, the welfare gain
of this same policy reform in the economy with perfect substitutes (and thus absent
general equilibrium wage effects) is only 1.61%, close to the gain of 1.66% from the
optimal reform in this economy (see column 4, last row in table 4). Thus the general
equilibrium response, especially the reduction of the college wage premium, is very
important for the welfare assessment of the optimal policy.
In the simple model in the appendix we demonstrate how progressive taxes and edu-
cation subsidies can be complementary second best policies in a world where private
insurance is imperfect, and thus public insurance is potentially beneficial but distorts
human capital accumulation decisions, with education subsidies mitigating this distor-
tions. This model (and indeed the quantitative model with perfect substitutability of
labor) abstracted from the general equilibrium relative wage effects induced by these
policies which curbs the effectiveness of education subsidies for encouraging college
attendance. With the two types of labor being imperfect substitutes, the education pol-
icy now has indirect beneficial redistributive effects, by reducing the average wage gap
between skilled and unskilled workers, and thus might potentially be a substitute for
redistributive tax policies in general equilibrium.
To explore this theme further we compute optimal policies along one policy dimension,
holding the other dimension constant. We restrict ourselves to steady states to make

                                            40
our points most clearly. Table 6 presents results for the perfect substitutes economy
in the left part which is easiest to interpret. The first column restates findings already
familiar from table 4. The next two columns document results for constrained-optimal
policies when one instrument (either the education subsidy θ or the size of the deduc-
tion d is held constant. The univariate optimization over d delivers the same optimal
degree of tax progressivity according to this measure (d = 0.31). However, compar-
ing the alternative measures for the progressivity of the income tax code, Z as well
as τl · Z, for the full optimum (column 2) with the constrained optimum (column 4)
where we hold θ constant, we observe the complementarity of policy instruments also
documented in the simple model in the Appendix in table 8 and stressed by Bovenberg
and Jacobs (2005). When θ is fixed at its status quo value of θ = 38.8%, which is lower
than the full steady state optimum of θ = 170%, the constrained optimal effective tax
deduction (as measured either by Z or τl Z) is lower as well.

Note: This table displays the steady state welfare gains for different policy configura-
tions.

Table 6 also shows that most of the (steady state) welfare gains stem from an adjust-
ment of the education subsidy: the best steady state policy reform brings welfare gains
of 2.6% of lifetime consumption, and only adjusting the education subsidy generates
almost the same welfare gains of 2.5% (since the optimal tax progressivity is close to
the status quo), whereas adjusting the progressivity of the labor income tax code alone
yields only gains of 0.17% (since the optimal education subsidy is much larger than the
status quo). Of course, absent general equilibrium wage effects the education policy
is very effective in stimulating college attendance and thus labor productivity in the
long run; along the transition this policy is not nearly as beneficial, which also explains
why the transitional welfare gains are lower than the long-run benefits, compare the
last row of columns 4 and 6 of table 4.
The right part of Table 6 repeats the same decomposition exercise for the imperfect sub-
stitutes case with general equilibrium wage effects. Interestingly, we observe that the
univariate optima favor a higher degree of tax progressivity and education subsidies,

                                             41
just as for the case with perfect substitutes. However, once both policy instruments are
in operation, the two instruments become substitutes: in the unconstrained optimum,
the degree of education subsidies is higher than in the univariate optimum and tax
progressivity decreases. Now the additional effect of a decrease of the college wage
premium allows the government to achieve a more equal consumption distribution
(at least across college- vs. non-college households) either through college education
subsidies or progressive income taxes. Also, in this case transitional welfare gains are
larger than long-run welfare gains since the GE wage reactions only play out in the
long-run and reduce college attendance.
We conclude this section by summarizing our second main finding: whether the two
policies complement each other or become substitutes in providing redistribution cru-
cially depends on the importance of general equilibrium effects. Since we find the em-
pirical evidence for imperfect substitutability of skilled and unskilled labor compelling
we conclude that the case for education subsidies and progressive labor income taxes
being substitutable policies is strong.


6.3 Sensitivity Analysis

6.3.1 Restrictions on the Policy Space

In order to render our analysis computationally feasible we studied simple policy in-
struments and restricted them to be constant along the transition path. In this subsec-
tion we explore the question whether our results are driven by these restrictions.
Quantitatively, the most prominent finding is the optimality of large education sub-
sidies. These subsidies transfer resources to young households for going to college.
Here we briefly ask whether this policy is welfare improving simply because it pro-
vides intergenerational redistribution towards young, potentially credit-constrained
households. If this were the case, then unconditional transfers that are not contingent
on college attendance should lead to similar or even larger welfare gains. Restricting
ourselves to steady-state optimal policies50 we find an optimal policy combination of
d = 10% and θ = 160%, with welfare gains of 1% instead of 2.76%. That is, substantial
lump-sum transfers to the young remain optimal, but they are less effective in improv-
ing social welfare since they are not targeted at college attendees which stimulates less
college attendance.51 The share of college youngsters increases to 49% only instead
of 58.6%. This reduces the college wage premium by less (it falls only by 14.4% in-
stead of 28.1%) which is the key source of the welfare gain according to our baseline

50   Which in any case do not deviate much from the transition-optimal policies in the benchmark econ-
     omy with imperfect substitutability of labor.
51   The optimal education-contingent policy makes borrowing constraints irrelevant for the education
     allocation, as the share of college attendants is invariant to the tightness φ of the borrowing constraint
     if education subsidies are set to θ = 150%


                                                      42
results. We conclude that making transfers to the young less education-targeted is not
beneficial.52
Second, we study whether the government forgoes important welfare gains by not
phasing in the policy reforms more slowly, permitting time-varying fiscal and educa-
tion policies. To do so we now consider transitional policies of the form

                             τl,t = e−ω (t−1) τl,0 + (1 − e−ω (t−1) )τl,T
                              θ t = e − ω ( t − 1) θ0 + (1 − e − ω ( t − 1) ) θ T
                              d t = e − ω ( t − 1) d 0 + (1 − e − ω ( t − 1) ) d T

where (τl,0 , θ0 , d0 ) is the calibrated policy in the initial steady state and (τl,T , θT , d T ) is
an arbitrary time constant new policy, and ω ∈ [0, ∞) is a parameter that governs the
speed of adjustment. If ω = ∞ then adjustment is immediate; this is the assumption
we make in the paper. The smaller is ω, the more gradual the new policy is being
introduced. Using this structure we ask two related questions:

     1. Is it optimal to more gradually introduce the policy we found to be optimal along
        the transition? To answer this question we take (τl,T , θT , d T ) = (τl∗ , θ ∗ , d∗ ) and
        maximize social welfare with respect to ω. The answer we found is, to a very
        good approximation (ω = 4), there is no benefit from introducing the optimal
        policy more gradually. In this (limited) sense results are robust towards permit-
        ting time variation in the policy instruments.

     2. Is the suboptimality of the policy that maximizes steady state welfare along the
        transition due to the fact that it is introduced too rapidly? We now take the
        steady-state optimal policy (τl,T , θT , d T ) = (τlSS , θ SS , dSS ) and again maximize
        social welfare with respect to ω. Now the answer is, yes, the steady state optimal
        policy leads to larger welfare gains along the transition if it is introduced more
        slowly and phased in over a time interval of about 16 years.53


6.3.2 Alternative Parameterizations

Our model contains many parameters that determine the quantitative magnitudes of
the optimal policies. We have documented the importance of the degree of substi-
tutability of skilled and unskilled labor for the results. Our choice of substitution
elasticity for the case with imperfect substitutes was 1.4, based on the conventional

52   On the other hand we need to acknowledge that policies that make education subsidies parental
     income- or wealth specific or condition them (if feasible) directly on student ability are likely to
     do even better, since our policy subsidizes even students that would have gone to college in any
     case. Findeisen and Sachs (2015), for example, find that the Pareto optimal policy in their model is
     characterized by income-contingent student loans.
53   Of course, the transition-optimal policy still dominates the slowly introduced steady state policy

                                                       43
estimates by Katz and Murphy (1992) or Borjas (2003). According to Card (2009) an
alternative reasonable estimate is 3.33, i.e., a value of ρ of 0.7. We recompute the opti-
mum with such an alternative calibration for the steady state comparison with imper-
fect substitutes. We find that the optimal education subsidy θ falls from 200% to 190%,
and tax progressivity as measured by d goes up from 10% to 16%. The optimal labor in-
come tax rate is 28.8% instead of 26%. Results are thus in between the benchmark and
perfect substitutes case, but quantitatively (and qualitatively) closer to the benchmark.
One key endogenous decision is the education decision, which is shaped by public ed-
ucation policies and private intergenerational transfers. The size of the latter is in turn
determined by υ, the weight of children’s lifetime utility in parental welfare. We cali-
brated υ so that the magnitude of intergenerational transfers in the model is consistent
with SCF data in the 1980’s. We now investigate whether the optimal large size of pub-
lic transfers tied to education that we found is sensitive to the magnitude of private
transfers induced by a larger υ. We increase υ from 0.48 to 0.6 (and recalibrate all other
parameters), inducing inter-vivos transfers to rise by roughly one-third (from 1.1% to
1.6% of GDP) in the benchmark economy. Likewise total intergenerational transfers,
including accidental bequests, increase from 1.7% to 2.1% of GDP. Focusing on steady
state optima with imperfect substitutes the new optimum now features a lower degree
of tax progressivity (d = 8% instead of d = 10%) and a higher degree of education
subsidies (θ = 220% instead of θ = 200%) as well as a slightly lower optimal labor
income tax rate (τ l = 25.9% instead of τ l = 26%). Welfare gains increase to 3.62% (up
from 2.76%).54



7 Conclusions

In this paper we characterized the optimal mix of progressive income taxes and educa-
tion subsidies and argued that a large education subsidy and a moderately progressive
labor income tax and constitute part of the optimal fiscal constitution once household
college attendance decisions are endogenous and transitional dynamics are modeled
explicitly. The latter aspect (transitional dynamics) can have a crucial impact on the
optimal policy design, as the case of perfect substitutes indicates. Given the important
differences between steady state optimal and transition-optimal policy it is conceiv-
able, in fact likely, that policies that are time-varying over the transition provide further
welfare gains.55
In our thought experiment we also took the tax on capital income as exogenously

54   Evaluating welfare with the calibrated value of υ of 0.48 gives welfare gains of 3.0%, hence a large
     part of the increase in welfare is due to the change in the social welfare function caused by recali-
     brating υ.
55   Because of the high dimensionality of the policy space these fully time-varying might be hard to
     characterize numerically for the near future, however.


                                                    44
given. Future work will need to determine whether our policy conclusions, especially
the high subsidy rates for human capital, remain robust once the government chooses
not only the progressivity of the labor income tax, but also the optimal mix between
capital and labor income taxes.
Finally we determined the optimal tax policy as one which maximizes Utilitarian so-
cial welfare among households currently alive.56 We also documented that both policy
instruments are potentially effective in generating more equally distributed consump-
tion and lifetime welfare. We leave for future work a detailed analysis which elements
of our optimal fiscal constitution remains intact if social preferences for insurance and
redistribution deviate from the Utilitarian benchmark we have analyzed here.




56   Although Utilitarian social welfare is commonly used in the literature, it is of course but one choice
     for the social welfare function. For alternative criteria and their merits, see, e.g., Weinzierl (2012) or
     Saez and Stantcheva (2013).

A Online Theoretical Appendix: The Simple Model

Here we present the simple model57 that allows us to make precise the intuition from
the introduction that with incomplete financial markets progressive labor income taxes
might be part of optimal fiscal policy because it implements a more equitable consump-
tion distribution than the laissez faire competitive equilibrium, but that it distorts both
the labor supply and the education decision. The latter distortion can be partially offset
by an education subsidy which then becomes part of an optimal policy mix as well.
Relative to the quantitative model used in the main part of the paper, the model an-
alyzed here abstracts from general equilibrium feedbacks and the two key sources of
dynamics in that model, endogenous capital accumulation and the intergenerational
transmission of talent and wealth.


A.1 The Environment

The economy lasts for one period and is populated by a continuum of measure one of
households that differ by ability e. The population distribution of e is uniform on the
unit interval, e ∼ U [0, 1]. Households value consumption and dislike labor according
to the utility function
                                                    !
                                               1+ 1

                                             1 + ψ1
These Greenwood, Hercowitz and Huffman (1988) preferences rule out wealth effects
on labor supply (which greatly enhances the analytical tractability of the model), but
at the same time make utility strictly concave in consumption, which induces a redis-
tribution/insurance motive for a utilitarian social planner or government.
A household can either go to college or not. A household with ability e that has gone
to college produces (1 + pe)w units of consumption per unit of labor, whereas a house-
hold without a college degree has labor productivity w. Here w > 0 and p > 0 (the
college premium for the most able type) are fixed positive parameters. Going to col-
lege requires κw resources (but no time) where κ > 0 is a parameter.


A.2 Social Planner Problem

Prior to analyzing the competitive equilibrium without and with fiscal policy we es-
tablish, as a benchmark, how a social planner with utilitarian social welfare function
would allocate consumption and labor across the population. The social planner prob-
lem chooses consumption and labor supply c(e), l (e) for each type e ∈ [0, 1] as well as

57   The model builds on the analysis in Bovenberg and Jacobs (2005) and Jacobs and Bovenberg (2010),
     but is tailored towards being a special case of the quantitative model studied in the main text.

                                                        p

Thus the larger is p, w and the smaller is κ, µ, the smaller is the education threshold and thus
the more households are sent to college.

                                                                    52
Proof 5 The threshold property of set I follows from the fact that the cost of college is indepen-
dent of e and the productivity benefits pe of being college-educated are strictly increasing in e.
The other results are directly implied by the first order conditions (which in the case of the ed-
ucation threshold eSP involves applying Leibnitz’ rule to the resource constraint, after having
substituted in the optimal labor allocations). Assumption 3 assures that eSP ∈ (0, 1). Note
that this assumption is purely in terms of the structural parameters of the model and requires
that the college productivity premium p is sufficiently large, relative to the college cost κ, for
the ablest households indeed be sent to college. Note that if ψ = 0 and thus labor supply is
inelastic, then assumption 3 simplifies to p > κ, insuring that the ablest person goes to college
since the wage premium more than compensates for the resource cost for tuition.


Equation (19) has an intuitive interpretation. The social planner chooses the optimal
education threshold such that the cost κw of education for the marginal type eSP equals
the net additional resources this marginal type generates with a college education, rel-
ative to producing without having obtained a college education. The term on the right
hand side of (19) takes into account that college educated households work longer
hours (this explains the exponent 1 + ψ) and the fact that college-educated house-
holds are compensated for their longer hours with extra consumption which explains
the factor µψ (11+ψ) . This latter property of optimal allocations follows from the non-
separability of consumption and labor in preferences (16).
For future comparison with equilibrium consumption allocations we state:


Corollary 6 The optimal consumption allocation satisfies cn < cc (eSP ) and cc (e) is strictly
increasing in e for all e > eSP .


We depict the optimal consumption allocation in figure 8, together with two equilib-
rium allocations discussed in the next subsection.58


A.3 Competitive Equilibrium

Now we study the competitive equilibrium of this economy. To do so we first have to
specify the market structure and the government policies. Households participate in
two competitive markets, the goods market where they purchase consumption goods,
and the labor market where they earn a wage per unit of labor supplied that equals
their marginal product. In addition to choosing consumption and labor households
decide whether to incur the cost κw of going to college. The benefit of doing so is a
wage premium epw > 0. We denote by I (e) ∈ {0, 1} the college choice of household
type e, with I (e) = 1 if the household goes to college.

58   The specific parameter values that underly this figure are discussed below as well.

Note: this figure plots the efficient and equilibrium consumption allocations in the
simple model against household ability e.

Financial markets, however, are assumed to be incomplete. Although there is no scope
for intertemporal trade, in principle households would like to trade insurance con-
tracts against the risk of being born as a low ability e type, prior to the realization
of that risk. It is the insurance against this idiosyncratic wage risk that we rule out
by assumption, and this fundamental market failure will induce a motive of insur-
ance/redistribution for the benevolent, utilitarian government in this economy.59
We assume that the benevolent, utilitarian government (which from now on we will
frequently refer to as the Ramsey government) has access to three fiscal policy instru-
ment, a flat labor income tax with tax rate τ, a lump sum transfer/tax d · w and a
proportional education subsidy with rate θ. Note that by permitting d < 0 we allow
the government to levy lump sum taxes; on the other hand it can also implement a
progressive labor income tax schedule by setting d, τ > 0. What we do not permit
are policies that make taxes or subsidies type-specific by conditioning τ, d, θ on type e.
Given these restrictions on the tax code we would not expect the government to be able
to implement the solution to the social planner problem as a competitive equilibrium
with fiscal policies.

59   What is insurance ex ante (prior to the realization) of the e draws, is redistribution among different e
     types ex post.

Now consider the problem of a generic household e ∈ [0, 1]. Given a fiscal policy the
household’s problem reads as
                                                                                           !

We can completely characterize the competitive equilibrium, for a given fiscal policy.
We summarize the results in the following


Proposition 8 Given a policy (τ, d, θ ), the optimal labor supply of households not going to
college is given by

                                                  µ
whereas the optimal labor supply of households with a college education is given by
                                                                            ψ

                                  lc (e; τ ) =                                    .                                 (24)

The threshold eCE is strictly decreasing (the share of households going to college is strictly
increasing) in θ, strictly increasing in τ and independent of d.

Proof 9 The equilibrium labor allocations follow directly from the first order conditions of the
household problem. The equilibrium consumption allocations are then implied by plugging
equilibrium labor supply into the household budget constraint (22). Thus lifetime utility con-
ditional on not going to college is given by

                                                                     !
                                                                1+ 1

which is strictly increasing in e. The threshold result for the education decision thus follows,
and the threshold itself is determined by the indifference between attending and not attending
college at the threshold.


A.3.2 Optimality of Equilibrium without Government Intervention?

In this subsection we show that the unregulated competitive equilibrium displays an
optimal (in the sense of solving the social planner problem) labor and education allo-
cation and thus optimal production. However, the consumption distribution is sub-
optimally highly dispersed in the competitive equilibrium without government poli-
cies. The first result (a simple corollary to proposition 8) states that the competitive
equilibrium without government intervention has an optimal labor and education al-
location. It follows directly from comparing equations (17),(18) and (20) in the social
planner problem to equations (23)-(27) in the competitive equilibrium, evaluated at
τ = d = θ = 0.
60   This result assumes that eCE ≤ 1. An assumption similar to assumption 3 is required to assure this,
     and we assume (and ex-post check) such an assumption to hold for the range of policies considered
     below.

                                                               56

is at the optimal level as well: LCE (τ = 0, θ = 0) = LSP . Note that aggregate output
in the competitive equilibrium is strictly decreasing in the tax rate τ, strictly increas-
ing in the college subsidy θ (since θ raises the share of households going to college
and college-educated households are more productive and work longer hours), and
independent of the lump-sum tax/subsidy d.
However, the next proposition shows that the consumption distribution in the com-
petitive equilibrium is suboptimally dispersed since non-college households consume
too little in the competitive equilibrium, so do non-productive college graduates. Fur-
thermore, the dependence of consumption on individual ability e is suboptimally high
in the competitive equilibrium without government intervention:

Proposition 11 In the competitive equilibrium for policy τ = d = θ = 0 (and thus eCE =
eSP ) we have

                                                        cCE

Proof 12 Recall that eCE (τ = θ = 0) = eSP and thus aggregate output net of education
costs coincide in the unregulated equilibrium and the solution to the social planner problem.
Consequently aggregate consumption is identical as well:

    CCE (τ = 0, θ = 0) = L(τ = 0, θ = 0) − κw(1 − eCE (τ = θ = 0)) =
                                                                                         LSP − κw(1 − eSP ) = CSP .

In the social optimum the utilitarian social planner equalizes lifetime utility across all household
types (this follows directly from the first order conditions of the planning problem) and therefore
                                                                       1+ ψ1                1+ ψ1

Thus as long as ψ < ∞ we have c∂e > c∂e for all e ≥ eCE (τ = θ = 0) = eSP . But
since CCE (τ = 0, θ = 0) = CSP it then follows from (29) that
                                                  cCE

                                            c ( e ) < c c ( e ).

Otherwise we would have cCE (e) > cSP (e) for all e, which violates the resource constraint.

The equilibrium consumption allocation in the absence of government policy is de-
picted in figure 8 and shows the excess consumption inequality proved in proposition
11. The social planner, relative to the competitive equilibrium without policies, pro-
vides additional consumption insurance, both between education groups, and within
the high education group. As discussed in the beginning of this section, the fundamen-
tal market failure that leads to the suboptimality of the competitive equilibrium is the
absence of insurance markets against e-risk.61
Also note that the socially optimal allocation cannot be implemented as a competitive
equilibrium with the policies (τ, d, θ ) unless policies can be made e-type specific. This
                                                                                               ∂cCE

can be seen from recognizing that, under the restricted policies, insuring                        ∂e     =
∂cSP
  c (e)
     ∂e   requires a positive labor income tax τ > 0 that satisfies
                                              1

                                             1+       ψ
but such a tax distorts the labor supply decisions of households, a distortion that can-
not be corrected with the existing set of instruments (see equations (23) and (24)).
61   Of course there exist nonutilitarian welfare weights µ(e) 6= 1 under which the socially optimal allo-
     cation arises as a competitive equilibrium without government intervention.

A.4 Towards Optimal Policy

A.4.1 Macroeconomic Effects of Progressive Taxation and Education Subsidies

The previous section has shown that in the competitive equilibrium without policy
consumption of households without college is suboptimally low and consumption of
college educated depends suboptimally strongly on their ability e. Investigating the
household budget constraint (22) we observe that these two concerns can both be mit-
igated by implementing a lump-sum transfer d > 0 financed by a proportional labor
income tax, τ > 0. It thus might be part of the optimal policy mix. We now study the
consequences of such a policy. In order to do so we note that the government budget
constraint reads as (from now on suppressing the CE label whenever unnecessary):


                             d + θκ (1 − eCE (τ, θ )) = τLCE (τ, θ )/w                              (31)
Recall that neither the education threshold nor aggregate output is a function of the
lump-sum tax/subsidy d. This observation immediately results in the following:


Proposition 13 An increase in lump-sum transfers d, financed by a raise in the income tax
rate τ (that is, an increase in the progressivity of the tax code) leads to


   1. A decline in the fraction eCE of households attending college.

   2. A reduction in individual and aggregate labor supply and thus output LCE .


Proof 14 Follows directly from the fact that lnCE (τ ), lcCE (e; τ ), eCE (τ, θ ) and LCE (τ, θ ) are all
strictly decreasing in τ and are independent of d.


Thus a τ-financed increase in lump-sum transfers d > 0 improves the consumption dis-
tribution by redistributing towards n-households (and low e college educated house-
holds), but it reduces aggregate output through reducing labor supply of all house-
holds and lowering the share 1 − eCE of households that become more productive
through a college education. The latter concern can be offset through education subsi-
dies, as the next proposition shows.


Proposition 15 An increase in college subsidies θ financed by a reduction in the transfers d
leads to


   1. An increase in the fraction of households attending college (eCE decreases)

   2. An increase in aggregate labor supply and thus output LCE .



                                                   59
Proof 16 Follows directly from the fact that eCE is strictly decreasing in θ and LCE (τ, θ ) is
strictly decreasing in eCE (output increases with more households going to college) and is inde-
pendent of d.

Note that positive education subsidies, when financed by labor income taxes, not only
increase aggregate output, but also redistribute from high e-types to low e-college
types, but redistribute away from the very low e-types that do not go to college, hence
do not enjoy the subsidy but still bear part of the income tax burden. To summa-
rize, in light of an inefficiently dispersed consumption distribution in the unregulated
equilibrium (relative to the one chosen by the utilitarian social planner) the imple-
mentation of a progressive tax system improves on the consumption distribution, but
lowers average consumption by creating disincentives to work and go to college. The
latter distortion can be offset by an appropriate education subsidy. It therefore is to
be expected that the optimal fiscal policy in this model may feature progressive in-
come taxes (τ, d > 0) and a positive education subsidy, θ > 0. The next subsection
will demonstrate that this is indeed the case, at least for a non-empty subset of the
parameter space.


A.4.2 The Optimal Policy Mix

Given the full characterization of a competitive equilibrium for a given fiscal policy
(τ, d, θ ) in proposition , we can now state the optimal fiscal policy problem of the Ram-
sey government as


          (                                               !

Unfortunately a full analytical characterization of the solution to the Ramsey problem
is infeasible even in the simple model. We therefore here present a simple quantitative
example, employing the parameter values summarized in table 7.

                                                                     60

Note: This table summarizes the parameter values for the simple model used in the
illustrative calculations in the text.

Table 2 displays characteristics of the socially optimal and equilibrium allocations, the
latter for three policy configurations. The second row displays equilibrium outcomes
without government intervention, the third row for a restricted optimal policy where
the education subsidy θ is constrained to equal zero. Finally, the last row summarizes
the equilibrium under the optimal fiscal policy. Figure 9 below plots social welfare
over the relevant range of fiscal policies, with τ and θ on the axes, and d adjusted to
balance the government budget.

Note: This table summarizes the optimal (equilibrium) allocations in simple model, for
various restrictions on the policy space.

From table 8 we observe that the optimal policy indeed calls for progressive taxes and
education subsidies. Comparing rows 1 and 2 shows, as proved above that the com-
petitive equilibrium without government intervention has optimal labor supply, edu-
cation and production allocations, but a consumption distribution in which low e types
consume too little. Introducing a progressive income tax in row 3 leads to an improve-
ment in that distribution, but at the expense of reduced output and a smaller fraction
of households attending college. A positive (but quantitatively small) education sub-
sidy raises this share, but requires extra government revenue and thus an even higher
labor income tax rate τ. The resulting consumption distribution implied by the optimal
fiscal policy is plotted in figure 8, alongside the socially optimal and the laissez faire
allocation.

Note: this figure plots social welfare in the competitive equilibrium against the two
policy instruments, the labor income tax rate τ and the college education subsidy rate
θ.

A.5 Summary

To conclude this appendix, we have developed a simple model with risk-averse house-
holds that make endogenous labor supply and education decisions and used it to argue
that progressive income taxes and positive education subsidies are part of an optimal
second best policy mix, in the presence of incomplete insurance markets against in-
come risk. However, we have abstracted from two key features that are present in our
quantitative analysis.
First, wages and thus the college wage premium where exogenously given and thus
invariant to fiscal policy. If wages respond, in general equilibrium, to the change in
the share of college-educated workers (as in the version of the model with imperfect
substitutability of skilled and unskilled labor), then education policies are less potent
in stimulating college attendance, but might have beneficial redistributive side effects.
Second, the simple model ignores dynamics, and thus the insight that changing the
skill distribution of the workforce takes time, with increased schooling costs material-
izing immediately but benefits accruing only later.
Our quantitative analysis with general equilibrium wage effects and transitional dy-
namics in the main text quantifies the extent to which these missing model elements
shape the optimal degree of income tax progressivity and magnitude of optimal edu-
cation subsidies.

B College Premium for Average and Marginal Attendees

Suppose households with e ≥ e∗ go to college and households with e < e∗ don’t. Also
suppose the γ-process is
                              π (γ = γh,s |e, s) = νs e
with νc = 1 and νn = ν < 1. Then the average college wage premium is proportional
to62
                          E(γ| s = c )    γ + (γh,c − γl,c ) ēc
                    wp =                = l,c
                          E (γ | s = n)  γl,n + (γh,n − γl,n ) νēn
where ēn , ēc are the average abilities of non-college and college households, respec-
tively. Note that because of the threshold property we have ēn < e∗ < ēc . The premium
for the marginal type is given by

                                                             γl,c + (γh,c − γl,c ) e∗
                                            wp (e∗ ) =
                                                            γl,n + (γh,n − γl,n ) νe∗

Assume that γh,c > γl,c as well as γh,n > γl,n (which will turn out to be the case in our
calibration). Then
                                     wp (e∗ ) < wp
since
          γl,c + (γh,c − γl,c ) e∗     γ + (γh,c − γl,c ) ēc      γ + (γh,c − γl,c ) ēc
                                   ∗
                                     < l,c                     ∗
                                                                 < l,c                       .

Thus as long as the education decision has the alleged threshold property such that
low e households don’t do go to college whereas high e households do, the wage pre-
mium for the marginal type e∗ of going to college is smaller than the average college
premium. Ceteris paribus (that is, keeping ēn , ēc , e∗ and all other parameters constant,

                                                                 63

so this can take either sign, even if (γh,c − γl,c ) > (γh,n − γl,n ) , but is positive (again
ceteris paribus) as long as ν is sufficiently small.

C Calibration Appendix

C.1 Details of the Calibration of Social Security Benefits

The U.S. system is characterized by an indexation to “average indexed monthly earn-
ings” (AIME). This sum the 35 years of working life with the highest individual earn-
ings relative to average earnings. Social security benefits are then calculated as a con-
cave function of AIME.
We approximate this system as follows. First, we define AIME of a type (ê, ŝ) house-
hold that retires in year tr as
                                                   j −1
                                                   r
                                                ∑ j= jc wt−( jr −1− j),ŝ ǫ j,ŝ γŝ (ê )
                            ȳtr (ê, ŝ) =          jr −1
                                                                                                                  (32)
                                              ∑e,s ∑ j= jc wt−( jr −1− j),s ǫ j,s γs (e)

as the sum of yearly wages, averaged across all η, for the cohort entering into retire-
ment in year tr , normalized such that ∑ ȳtr (e, s, k) = 1. For simplicity, we start the
sum in (32) after college completion and thereby do not account for the lower wages
of college attendees while in college.
The primary insurance amount (PIA) of the cohort entering into retirement in pe-
riod tr , piatr (e, s), is then computed as

Pensions for all pensioners of age j ≥ jr in period t are then given by

C.2 Calibration of Model with Imperfect Substitutes

We calibrate the economy to the model variant with perfect substitutes in production.
For the model variant with imperfect substitutes, we make some adjustments of the
model that enable us to avoid recalibration.
First, we adjust equation (2) by a technology scaling parameter Υ0 to the effect that
output writes as
                                                                                                             1  1− α
                                                                                             ρ          ρ       ρ
            Yt = F(Kt , Υ0 Lt ) =     Ktα (Υ0 Lt )1−α         =          Ktα       Υ0       Lt,n   +   Lt,c                .

This implies that the first-order conditions in (3a) rewrite as
                                                                           1− ρ

                                                                  Lt,n

                                                                  Lt,c

where ωt = (1 − α)kαt is the marginal product of the CES aggregate of labor, Lt . Ob-
serve that the average wage level in the economy is given by

                                      Lt,n                 Lt,c
                         w̄t =                · wt,n +             · wt,c                                                            (34)
                                  Lt,n + Lt,c          Lt,n + Lt,c
                                                                           ps                                    ps            ps   ps
In the economy with perfect substitutes, where Υ0 = 1, we have wt,n = wt,c = w̄t =
 ps                                                                                                              ips
ωt . In the economy with imperfect substitutes, we determine Υ0 such that both
economies feature the same average wage level in the calibration period 0. This re-
                         ips    ips
quirement implies that ω0 = w̄0 . Setting (34) equal to ωt and using (33) in the
resulting equation gives
                                                     1− ρ                                               1− ρ ! − 1

             Υ0     =               ·                          +

Next, recall from Section 3.3.3 that the deterministic component of a household’s life-
cycle wage profile is determined by

                                 wt,s ǫ j,s          for                 s ∈ {n, c}

and that the average college wage premium in the perfect substitutes economy is cali-
brated by appropriate choice of the productivity shifting parameter
                                                             ps
                                                           ǫ jc ,c
                                                 ε≡          ps      .
                                                           ǫ jc ,n



                                                       66
In the economy with imperfect substitutes we next normalize the age profiles in the
initial steady state such that
                                         ips                                               ips
                           ips          w̄0                                  ips          w̄0
                          ǫ jc ,n   =    ips
                                                      and                   ǫ jc ,c   =    ips
                                                                                                 ε
                                        w0,n                                              w0,c

to the effect that
                                                ips        ips
                                               ǫ jc ,c w0,c
                                                ips        ips
                                                                     = ε.
                                               ǫ jc ,n w0,n


Finally, we define college costs in the economy with imperfect substitutes to be given
by
                                                       ips
                                                     ǫ jc ,c     ips
                                                 κ             wt,c
                                                       ε
so that, in the initial steady state, college costs are equal to
                                                               ips
                                                      κ w̄0

as in the model with perfect substitutes.
With these adjustments, households are given the same wages, interest rates, etc. and
calibration parameters across the two model variants so that the same fixed point (and
the same moments for calibration) will be reached in equilibrium.

D     Computational Appendix

D.1 Aggregate Problem

An important element to understand the solution of the aggregate problem is the gov-
ernment budget constraint. Along the transition it is given by
                                         Z
                                                                              !
    B t + 1 = ( 1 + r t ) B t + Gt + E t −   ∑ Nt,j       Tt (yt )dΦt,j + τk,t rt (Kt + Bt ) + τc,t Ct
                                                 j

          = ( 1 + r t ) B t + Gt + E t − T t ,       B0 given,                                           (35)

where Tt denotes total tax revenue. The steady state version is given by

                                        tt − ( e t + g t )
                                 bt =                      for t ∈ {0, T }                               (36)
                                            rt − n
             Bt
where bt = Y  t
                , tt = TYtt , et = EYtt and gt = G t
                                                 Yt are the government debt, tax revenue,
educational expenditures and government consumption to GDP ratios, respectively.
In the transition these two equations—together with the initial condition that B0 is de-
termined from the initial steady state of the model—impose restrictions on the system
of equations characterizing the transitional dynamics. This implies that the govern-
ment looses two degrees of freedom in setting its policy along the transition. This
insight drives the computational implementation of our model. Specifically, out of the
policy parameters, we treat d and θ as the two free policy instruments of the govern-
ment whereas τ as well as { Bt }tT=1 are pinned down by equations (35) and (36).
We then implement separate nested procedures to solve the initial and the final steady
states as well as the transitional dynamics of our model. In each case, we take gov-
ernment expenditures to GDP, bt for t = 0, . . . , T as “given”, either as a calibration
target in the initial steady state, i.e., for t = 0, or as a separate variable to loop over
when we compute the final steady state and the transitional dynamics, i.e., for peri-
ods t = 1, . . . , T. Observe from (35) and (36) that the final steady state depends on
the transition. Accordingly, our following description of the algorithm first treats the
solution of the initial steady state followed by the final steady state together with the
transition.


D.1.1 Initial Steady State

In the (initial) steady state solutions in period 0, we have three nested fixed point prob-
lems. First, as in any aggregative model, we have to solve for market clearing prices.
Second, we have to compute a fixed point in measures because initial measures at
age ja , Φ0,ja , depend on parental measures at age j f + ja , Φ0,j f + ja . Third, we have to
compute a fixed point in value functions because the inter-vivo transfer decision of

                                                     68
parents depends on the utility of children which itself has to be consistent with the
value function of parents.63
We approach this with the following nesting of loops:

     1. Outer loop: Loop over initial measures Φ0,ja

     2. Inner loop: Solution for market clearing prices

     3. Interior loop: Solution of household problem, including fixed point in value func-
        tions.

As to the inner loop of step 2 we iterate on the 6 × 1 steady state vector of aggregate
           Pss = [ p1 , . . . , p6 ]′ . p1 is the capital intensity, k0 = KL00 , p2 is the labor share,
variables, ~
      L0                                                                  Lc
l0 = N 0
         , p3 is the share of households with a college degree, L00 which is a relevant vari-
able only in the model variant with imperfect substitutes, p4 are accidental bequests (as
a fraction of GDP) tr0 = Tr    0 64
                              Y0 , p5 is the debt to GDP ratio, b0 , and p6 is the net pension
benefit level, ̟0 . Observe that all these elements of ~ Pss are defined such that they are
constant in the steady state.
The iteration is then as follows:


     1. Guess the initial distribution of children, Φ10,ja , an initial vector of outer loop vari-
        ables, ~ 1 , and an initial value function of children V 1 .
               Pss                                                     0,ja
                                                              m , loop as follows:
     2. In measure iteration m, for distribution of children Φ0,j a

                                            q
         (a) In iteration q for guess ~
                                      Pss , loop as follows:
                i. Compute all variables that households need to solve their problem. These
                   are the interest rate, r0 , the relative supply of college and non-college
                   workers which are needed to compute college and non-college wages,
                   w0,s , s ∈ {n, c}, transfers from accidental bequests, the tax deduction,
                                 Y0
                   τ0l Z0 = dτ0l N0
                                    and pension payments.
               ii. Given these variables solve the household problem. This requires find-
                   ing the fixed point in value functions. We implement a Howard-type
                   improvement algorithm and accordingly proceed as follows:
                   A. In iteration k for the “outer loop” value function V0 ( ja , ·)k solve for
                      decision functions.
63   Observe that the fixed point problems in measures and value functions are specific to the steady state
     solutions. In the transition, we iterate backward in time to compute value functions and decision
     rules. When updating measures in each time period t, we iterate forward in time and backward in
     age. Consequently, the distribution of parents and their inter-vivo transfer decisions in any period t
     are known when solving the problem of children in t.
64   We also update the distribution of bequests in the population but leave out the details here.

                                                    69

                    B. Hold decision functions constant and denote by V i 0 ( ja , ·) = V0k ( ja , ·)
                       the “inner loop” value function. In “inner loop” iteration l on the
                       value function, loop backward on the value functions from j = j f +
                                                                                    l +1
                       ja to ja to update the inner loop value function V i 0 ( ja , ·). Continue
                       until convergence of “inner loop” value functions with criterion k
                          l               l +1

                   C. Denote by V0k+1 ( ja , 0) = V i 0 ( ja , ·) the update of the “outer loop”
                      value function. If k V0k ( ja , ·) − V0k+1 ( ja , ·) k< ǫ STOP, ELSE continue
                      with step 2(a)iiA.
              iii. Aggregate across all households and compute updates of all aggregate
                   variables. Specifically, use (36) to compute an update of the steady state
                   debt to GDP ratio. Collect the updated variables in ~      P˜ss . Notice that
                   ~P˜ss = H (~Pss ), where H is a vector-valued non-linear function.
         (b) Define the root-finding problem G (~ Pss ) = ~

D.1.2 Final Steady State and Transition

For the transition to the finale steady state we start by guessing a sequence of a 7 · (T −
                                                                  ′
1) × 1 vector of equilibrium prices, ~  P = [~p1′ , . . . , ~p7′ ] , where pi , i = 1, . . . , 7 are vectors
of length (T − 1) × 1. The time series are (i) capital labor ratio, (ii) labor share, (iii) the
fraction of workers with a college degree, (iv) accidental bequests, (v) the debt to GDP
ratio, (vi) the pension benefit level, and (vii) labor taxes.
Our steps are as follows:


     1. Start with an initial guess for the price vector ~
                                                         P0 .

     2. In iteration q for guess ~
                                 Pq solve the final steady state of the model. Relative to
        the previous description for the initial steady state, do so by artificially holding
        constant the debt to GDP at the initial guess, i.e., do not include bT in the set of
        outer loop variables.

65   In our application, we further improve stability of the problem by using an additional outer loop via
     the price vector, ~Pss, and initial measures. We accordingly apply a nested fixed point iteration over
     both objects. The reason is the circular relationship in that prices are functions of initial measures
     and initial measures are functions of prices.



                                                       70
3. Scale all entries in ~
                        Pq (except debt to GDP and taxes) such that the time paths are
                                                                         q
   consistent with the final steady state. Denote the scaled vector by ~
                                                                       Ps

4. Solve the household problem. We do so by iterating backwards in time for t =
   T − 1, . . . , 1 to get the decision rules and forward for t = 1, . . . , T − 1 (and back-
   ward in age in each t) for aggregation.

                                                                         P˜s = H ( P
                                                                                   ~q ) the
                                                                           q
5. Update variables as in the steady state solutions. Denote by ~                   s
   7 · (T − 1) × 1 vector of updated variables. The non-trivial updating of the debt
   to GDP ratio, Bt /Yt for all t = 1, . . . , T is based on an inner loop iteration. We
   search for labor income taxes τtl = τ1l for t = 1, . . . , T such that the time path of
   the debt to GDP ratio is consistent with initial conditions and a final steady state
   constant bT . Observe that the initial debt level in period 1 is implied by the initial
   steady state solution because of the recursive nature of debt, cf. equation (35).

    (a) Start by defining Ȳt = Tt /τtl , for t = 1, . . . , T as some measure of average
        income. We use this in the debt iteration to compute an update of the deficit
        to GDP ratio. Denote current GDP by Yt and the current deficit by Dt for
        all t = 1, . . . , T.

             dition, cf. equation (36).
          v. Iterate backward (=back-shooting) on the government budget constraint,
                                                                        g

             Brent’s method to form updates of τTl .

6. Define the root-finding problem as G (~
                                            q
                                           Ps ) = ~
                                                     q       ~q ). Observe that we take

                                                ~ q
   the distance in terms of the scaled vector Ps . Since T is large, this problem is
   substantially larger than in the steady state iterations. We use the Gauss-Seidel-
   Quasi-Newton algorithm suggested in Ludwig (2006) to update ~        Pq and proceed
   with step 2 with each update.

D.2 The Household Problem

D.2.1 Recursive Problems of Households: Reformulation

We apply the endogenous grid method of Carroll (2005) and therefore re-formulate
the recursive problem of households by introducing “cash-on-hand” as the relevant
state variable. For practical reasons, our definition of cash-on-hand differs slightly
from Deaton (1990). As we solve the model backwards, we also start here with the
retirement period and continue backwards from there.
We work with an exogenous grid for savings, a′ , denoted by G a . Precisely, we work
with age and time dependent grids but, for sake of simplicity, we leave out a detailed
description on how these are constructed.66


Problem at J, J − 1, . . . , jr . Denote cash-on-hand by:
                              x = (1 + rt (1 − τtk ))(a + Trt,j ) + pt,j .                      (37)
Recall that Trt,j are transfers from accidental bequests and pt,j is pension income.
Given that there is no labor income risk we do not have to take expectations of contin-
uation values and the problem reads as:
                                       
                Wt ( j, γ, s, x ) = max u(c, 1) + βϕ j Wt+1 ( j + 1, γ, s, x ′ )   (38)
                                     c,x ′ ≥0

subject to the constraints
                          x ′ = (1 + rt+1 (1 − τtk+1 ))(a′ + Trt+1 ) + pt+1
                          a′ = x − c(t + τ c ) ≥ 0.

First-order and envelope conditions:
                    uc
                           − βϕ j Wt+1 x′ (·)(1 + rt+1 (1 − τtk+1 )) − µa = 0                   (39)
                  1 + τc
                  Wt x (·) = βϕ j Wt+1 x′ (·)(1 + rt+1 (1 − τtk+1 ) + µa                        (40)
µa is the multiplier associated with the liquidity constraint. Observe that the above
equations imply the standard Euler equation.
Solution of this problem gives c. To compute x, a and tax payments we then proceed
as follows. Given c, a′ , compute x, a and income tax payments as
                                     x = a ′ + c (1 + τ c )
                                              x − pt
                                     a=                     − Trt
                                         1 + rt (1 − τtk )
                                    Tt = rt τtk a

66   Our construction of age dependent grids insures that we never end outside the bounds of grids in
     the computation of policy and value functions so that no extrapolation methods are needed.

                                                    72
Problem at jr − 1, . . . , j f + ja + 1. Now let

                               x = (1 + rt (1 − τtk ))(a + Trt,j ) + wt,j,s (1 − τss )

be the maximal cash on hand where

                                                     wt,j,s = ǫ j,s γs (e)η.

This is cash-on-hand before labor income taxes are being paid and with maximum
labor income possible.
Notice that the constraint 1 − l ≥ 0 will always be non-binding by the lower Inada
condition. Then
                                 (                                          )
        Wt ( j, γ, s, η, x ) =       max             u(c, l ) + βϕ j ∑ πs (η ′ |η )Wt+1 ( j + 1, γ, s, η ′ , x ′ )

                                                                   
                           x ′ = (1 + rt+1 (1 − τtk+1 )) a′ + Trt+1 + wt+1,j+1,s (1 − τss )
                 where a′ = x − wt,j,s τtl (1 − 0.5τss ) + τtl Zt
                                     − c(1 + τ c ) − wt,j,s (1 − τss − τtl (1 − 0.5τss ))(1 − l )



Problem at j f + ja We now define by ā′ savings including the transfer payments, hence
savings net of transfer payments is a′ (e′ ) = ā′ − b(e′ ) f . As we work with the endoge-
nous grid method, ā′ is exogenous and not contingent on e′ . All other variables (deci-
sions) are. We further have, as before, cash on hand as:

                       x (e′ ) = (1 + rt (1 − τtk+1 ))(a(e′ ) + Trt,j ) + wt,j,s (1 − τss )

The problem then is:
                                                                                    

                                                                                                                

                      η′

where x (b(e′ )) is cash-on-hand of children, to be defined below.

67    Observe that at age jr − 1 there is no need to evaluate the expectation over idiosyncratic income
      states because η becomes a redundant state variable and the continuation value is Wt+1 ( jr , γ, s, x ′ ).


                                                               73

                1 − l (e ′ ) ≤ 1

By the max operator in the above, the problem is non-convex along the b-dimension.
Conditional on the choice of b(e′ ), the first-order conditions for c(e′ ), l (e′ ) and the
envelope condition for x ′ (e′ ) are as previously.
We then search over a grid of b to bracket the maximum and subsequently determine
the optimal b by a one-dimensional bracketing method (golden search). For each b we
compute optimal consumption and labor using standard first-order conditions. Notice
that the inequality constraint endogenously fixes a maximum b and that the solution
for ā′ = 0 is b = 0.

D.2.2 Computational Implementation

We now provide a more detailed description of the solution of the household problem.


Solving for policy functions. We loop backwards in age using standard methods for
finite horizon models. To describe solution at one particular age j, we focus on the
case with endogenous labor supply, hence j < jr . We look at an arbitrary age and use
indicator variables to denote whether children are living in the household (during age
bin j = j f + ja − 1, . . . , j f ) or whether households attend college (age ja , s = c).

68    As in the main text, we slightly abuse notation in that for college-bound households η ′ at age ja is
      drawn from Πc (η ′ ) rather than πc (η ′ | η ).



                                                                  75
We have two regions, with two subregions each, depending on constraints. The first
region is for sufficiently asset rich households who work little and hence do not pay
labor taxes. Here we have the (weak inequality) constraint l ≥ 0.
The second region is less asset rich households who work more and hence pay labor
taxes. Here we have the (weak inequality) constraint l ≥ w (1Z−t 0.5τ ) (because oth-
                                                                                     t,j,s     ss
erwise total labor income taxes, taxes net of deduction, would be negative). There is
some threshold cash-on-hand level x̄, separating the two regions.

where µl denotes the multiplier on the constraint 1 − 1s ξ (e) − l¯ − (1 − 1s ξ (e) − l ) ≥ 0.
µa denotes the multiplier on the borrowing constraint.
We first look at the case where µa = 0.69 We solve this problem in four steps:


     1. Assume l = 0, τtl = 0, hence a′ = x − wt,j,s (1 − τss ) (1 − 1s ξ (e)) − c(1 + τ c ). Solve
        for c using (44a). Compute µl from (44b). If µl > 0 then

                                x = a′ + wt,j,s (1 − τss ) (1 − 1s ξ (e)) + c(1 + τ c )

69   Recall from Carroll’s description of the endogenous grid method that borrowing constraints are easy
     to deal with, see below.

     1s ξ (e) − l ). Compute c from (44a). Compute µl from (44b). In so doing set wnt,j,s =
     wt,j,s (1 − τss − τtl (1 − 0.5τss )) because the net tax is what is relevant at the margin.
     If µl > 0 then

                      − c(1 + τ c ) − wt,j,s (1 − τss − τtl (1 − 0.5τss ))(1 − 1s ξ (e) − l )

     Solution gives c, 1 − l and

            Tt = rt τtk a + τtl (1 − 0.5τss )wt,j,s l − τtl Zt .


This description makes clear that, in order to solve the first-order conditions, we ba-
sically have to deal with two cases. One is with interior solution for l, either with

to l¯ = w (1Z−t0.5τ ) .

     Therefore:

     and 1 − 1s ξ (e) − l follows from (45).

Next, look at the case with binding borrowing constraints (hence µa > 0). In this
case a′ = ā′ ≤ 0 is given. Key object is the intra-temporal Euler equation: First-order

payments):
                                                                   uc

                                                                  1+τ
which we combine with the resource constraint to characterize the solution, adopting
the same steps described above. Solutions again come as closed form expressions for
our nested CD-CRRA preferences.

  1. Assume l = 0, τtl = 0, hence total resources used for expenditures on con-
     sumption and leisure are ress = x − a′ . Recall that a′ = x − wt,j,s (1 − τss ) (1 −
                                                                         ress− w   (1− τss )(1− 1s ξ (e))
     1s ξ (e)) − c(1 + τ c ). Accordingly, we get c =      t,j,s
                                                                 1+ τ c . Compute µl
     from (44b). If µl positive, stop, else proceed to next case.
                                    i
  2. Assume l ∈ 0, w (1Z−t 0.5τ ) , hence τtl = 0 and a′ = x − c(1 + τ c ) − wt,j,s (1 −
                               t,j,s          ss
     τss )(1 − 1s ξ (e) − l ). Resources to be used for consumption and leisure are again ress =
     x − a′ . From the intra-temporal Euler equation (45) we get

                                                   1 − 1s ξ (e ) − l   1 − φ (1 + τ c )
                                       lcr =                         =                  .
                                                          c              φ     wnt,j,s

     From the budget constraint it then follows that
                                                                 ress
                                                       c=                     .
                                                            1 + wnt,j,s + τ c

     and 1 − 1s ξ (e) − l = lcr · c. Compute labor tax payments. If labor income taxes
     are positive, proceed to next case.
                              Zt
  3. Assume l =                         , τ l = 0. Then ress
                     wt,j,s (1−0.5τss ) t
                                                                          = x − a′ . If ress > wt,j,s (1 − τss )
                ress− wt,j,s (1− τss )(1− 1s ξ (e)− l )
     then c =                  1+ τ c                   , else go to      next case. Compute µl from (44b)
            n                                   l
     using wt,j,s = wt,j,s (1 − τss − τt (1 − 0.5τss )). If               µl positive, stop, else proceed with
     next case.
                                Zt
  4. We have l >       wt,j,s (1−0.5τss )
                                          ,   hence τtl > 0. Recall that

               a′ = x − wt,j,s (1 − 1s ξ (e))τtl (1 − 0.5τss ) + τtl Zt
                         − c(1 + τ c ) − wt,j,s (1 − τss − τtl (1 − 0.5τss ))(1 − 1s ξ (e) − l )

     Resources to be used for consumption and leisure are therefore ress = x − a′ −
     wt,j,s τtl (1 − 0.5τss )(1 − 1s ξ (e)) + τtl Zt .
     From the intra-temporal Euler equation (45) we get

                                             1 − 1s ξ (e ) − l   1 − φ (1 + τ c )
                                       lcr =                   =                  .
                                                    c              φ     wnt,j,s

                                                             79
From the budget constraint it then follows that

                                       1 + wnt,j,s + τ c

and 1 − 1s ξ (e) − l = lcr · c.
