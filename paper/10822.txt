Assessing the Impacts of the Prescription Drug User Fee Acts (PDUFA) on the
FDA Approval Process

                                           ABSTRACT

Congress enacted and renewed the Prescription Drug User Fee Acts (PDUFA) in 1992, and renewed
it in 1997 and 2002, mandating FDA performance goals in reviewing and acting on drug applications
within specified time periods. In turn, the FDA was permitted to levy user fees on drug sponsors
submitting applications to the FDA. While PDUFA mandated action or review times, its ultimate
impacts on actual final drug approval times are unknown. We model and quantify the impact of
PDUFA-I and II on drug approval times, since these approval dates are the ones most directly related
to new medicines becoming available to benefit patients.

In assessing the impacts of PDUFA on drug approval times, it is noteworthy that approval times were
trending downwards at 1.7% percent per year prior to implementation of PDUFA. Assuming
continuation of that time trend, approval times post-PDUFA would have fallen even in the absence
of PDUFA. Our principal finding is that PDUFA accelerated this downward trend so that instead of
a counterfactual 6% reduction in approval times from 24.2 to 20.4 months in absence of these acts
between 1991 and 2002, there was an observed decline of about 42%, from 24.2 to 14.2 months,
following implementation of PDUFA. Thus, of the total observed decline in approval times between
1991 and 2002, approximately two-thirds can be attributed to PDUFA. However, much of this
impact occurred in the initial years between 1992 and 1997 (PDUFA-I) rather than during the
subsequent 1997-2002 time frame (PDUFA-II). We discuss implications of these findings and how
future research might quantify the social value of the observed acceleration in the FDA drug
approvals.

I.      INTRODUCTION

        In virtually all developed countries, regulatory authorities provide public oversight of the

safety and efficacy of prescription drugs, prior to their being approved for marketing. In the

U.S., such oversight is directed by the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”). The FDA’s

mission statement declares that:

                “The FDA is responsible for protecting the public health by assuring the safety,

                efficacy and security of human and veterinary drugs, biological products, medical

                devices…The FDA is also responsible for advancing the public health by helping

                to speed innovations that make medicines and foods more effective, safer, and

                more affordable; and helping the public get the accurate, science-based

                information they need to use medicines and food to protect their health”.1

        A central tradeoff facing the FDA involves balancing its two goals – protecting public

health by assuring the safety and efficacy of drugs, and advancing the public health by helping to

secure and speed access to new innovations. Although little quantitative evidence has been

produced on this central tradeoff, some observers have argued that the FDA is not taking enough

time evaluating new drugs and biologics, while others have argued that the agency is taking too

long in doing so.2 Little empirical evidence has been put forward to make the case that the FDA

is too slow or too fast in its drug approval process, partly due to significant difficulties in

measuring the costs and benefits of greater speed.

       In this paper, we report initial results of a multi-stage research project attempting to

evaluate empirically and quantitatively the impacts associated with a particular piece of

legislation affecting this tradeoff; namely, the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”)

passed by Congress in 1992, later continued as PDUFA-II in 1997 and PUDFA-III in 2002. The

paper assesses the degree to which these legislative acts affected drug approval times. The paper

is part of a larger project focused on quantifying as best as possible the societal costs and

benefits of PDUFA in particular, and of policies affecting the speed of new medicine approvals

in general.3

       PDUFA specified performance goals for the FDA in the form of reduced review times,

while levying user fees on the industry in terms of payments required for consideration of new

drug applications (“NDAs”), new biologic license applications (“BLAs”), and supplemental

applications, as well as annual fees for existing manufacturing establishments and products.

Between fiscal years 1993 and 2002, net annual collections from PDUFA to the FDA grew more

than five-fold, from $28.5 million to $149.1 million. These user fee revenues represent a

substantial portion of the FDA’s total revenues obligated to processing human drug applications.

For example, in 2002, of the $347.6 million total in human drug application processing costs,

$161.8 million (47%) were covered by user fee revenues, while the remaining $185.8 million

(53%) came from Congressional appropriations.4

       We employ data on 662 drug approvals prior to and following enactment of PDUFA

(from years 1979 through 2004). Using multivariate regression analysis, we attempt to isolate

empirically the incremental impact of PDUFA-I and PDUFA-II on affecting NDA/BLA approval

times, over and above that which was trending downwards already prior to the enactment of

PDUFA. For each of the 662 drug approvals, we then simulate a counterfactual world and
Assessing Impacts of PDUFA on FDA Drug Approval Times                                       5


predict what approval times would have been in the absence of PDUFA. Our major finding is

that PDUFA reduced approval times by about 7.6 % per year during PDUFA-I and about 3.6% a

year during PDUFA-II. Since drug approval times were trending downward at about 1.7%

percent per year even before PDUFA, assuming continuation of this time trend, they would have

been lowered even in the absence of PDUFA. PDUFA therefore accelerated this trend; between

1992 and 2002, instead of a counterfactual 6% reduction in approval times from 24.2 to 20.4

months in the absence of these acts, there was an observed decline of about 42%, from 24.2 to

14.2 months, with PDUFA. Thus of the total observed decline in approval times, approximately

two-thirds can be attributed to PDUFA. However, much of this impact occurred in the initial

years between 1992 and 1997 (PDUFA-I) rather than during the subsequent 1997-2002 time

frame (PDUFA-II).

       It is important to note that our results concern approval times, as opposed to the

performance goals of PDUFA which focused on action or review times of the agency in handling

applications. The former is what matters for consumer welfare, but the latter is what the agency

can control. For example, PDUFA stipulated a goal that the 90th percentile of the review time of

standard applications was to be 12 months, while the 90th percentile of the approval time in our

data was 42 and 36 months for PDUFA-I and PDUFA-II respectively. It therefore appears that

while FDA review times of the agency may have been fully met under PDUFA, the approval

times are lagging considerably behind PDUFA goals on review times.

       The remainder of this paper proceeds as follows. In Section II we provide a brief

introduction and overview of PDUFA-I and PDUFA-II. In Section III we discuss the difference

in observed review and approval times pre- and post-PDUFA. Then in Section IV we consider

various specifications relating FDA approval times to a number of explanatory variables,
Assessing Impacts of PDUFA on FDA Drug Approval Times                                       6


including PDUFA and other covariates. In Section V we present empirical results. Finally, in

Section VI we summarize our findings, note limitations of our research, and suggest directions

for further research.

II.    THE PRESCRIPTION DRUG USER FEE ACTS (PDUFA)

       The concept of payment of user fees by individuals or firms being provided services by a

government regulatory body has ample precedent, e.g., application submission fees to the U.S.

Patent and Trademark Office. The development of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act permitted

the FDA to collect fees from sponsors submitting an NDA or BLA for review. The passage of

PDUFA-I in 1992 was, however, somewhat controversial in that the amount of fees collected for

each sponsor application was very substantial, unlike that for patent applications. In the initial

fiscal year 1993 user fee schedule, applications with clinical data were assessed a one-time fee of

$100,000; each supplemental application with clinical data, and applications with no clinical

data, $50,000; annual manufacturing establishment fees were $36,080, and annual product fees

were $6,000. With effective renewals of PDUFA-I in 1997 under the Food and Drug

Modernization Act of 1997 (“PDUFA-II”) and the Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act

of 2002 (“PDUFA-III”), fees have escalated sharply. In fiscal year 2004, for example,

applications with clinical data are assessed a one-time fee of $573,500; each supplemental

application with clinical data, and applications with no clinical data, are assessed a user fee of

$286,750; annual manufacturing establishment fees are $226,800, and annual product fees are

$6,000. Waivers and exemptions are granted to small firms, and to sponsors submitting an

application under the Orphan Drug Act of 1983.5
Assessing Impacts of PDUFA on FDA Drug Approval Times                                           7


       In exchange for the collected user fees, the FDA is legally obliged to “review and act on”

NBA/BLA submissions. However, reviewing and acting on is not the same as reaching a final

approve/do not approve decision. According to the PDUFA-III legislation, for example:

               “’review and act on’ is understood to mean the issuance of a complete

               action letter after the complete review of a filed complete application. The action

               letter, if it is not an approval, will set forth in detail the specific deficiencies and,

               where appropriate, the actions necessary to place the application in condition for

               approval.”6

In essence, therefore, PDUFA mandates responses and action letters from the FDA, but not

necessarily final approvals or denials.

       NDA/BLA submissions are assigned either a “standard” or “priority” status, depending in

part on the novelty of the therapeutic and the existence of unmet needs. In the case of PDUFA-I,

II and III, the FDA is required to deliver a “complete review” on 90% of priority applications

within six months. For standard applications, the FDA was expected to review 90% of

applications in twelve months under PDUFA-I; currently, the FDA is expected to review 90% of

standard applications in ten months.

       On the action date mandated by PDUFA, the FDA issues one of three actions. The first

action is a non-approvable letter indicating that the NDA/BLA has not satisfied the FDA’s

standards for safety and/or efficacy. The second type of action is an “approvable” letter that

indicates the NDA/BLA can be approved if certain deficiencies and questions are appropriately

acted upon by the sponsor. The third type of action is the ultimate approval letter that gives the

sponsor company the right to market the drug to the public.
Assessing Impacts of PDUFA on FDA Drug Approval Times                                        8


       Researchers such as Peltzman [1974], Olson [1997,1998,2004] and Carpenter [2002]

have long argued that personnel at the FDA are considerably more worried about committing

Type 1 errors (approving a drug that is unsafe and/or lacks efficacy) than Type 2 errors (not

approving a safe and effective drug).7 Given the costs and punishments that can be meted out by

Congress for Type 1 errors, it is not surprising that many observers believe that Type 1 errors

have received disproportionate attention. While the costs of delaying life-saving and quality of

life-improving medications are real and impose pain and suffering on patients seeking new

medicines, these costs from Type 2 errors are not nearly as visible as the Type 1 errors. Rather

than mandate specific remedies that would attempt to deal more directly with Type II errors,

Congress has attempted to provide incentives for improved efficiencies at the FDA; PDUFA may

be viewed as an example of such incentives.

III.   REVIEW vs. APPROVAL TIMES UNDER PDUFA

       Although PDUFA action date mandates have generally been met by the FDA, these

action dates are not the same as approval dates, the latter being the time at which a drug is

approved for marketing in the US. There is a strong analogy between this process and the

academic publishing process; action dates correspond to reject or revise-and-resubmit dates and

approval dates correspond with ultimate acceptance/rejection dates. The approval dates are what

ultimately affects consumer welfare as it is only after marketing approval is granted that

consumption can take place.8 The question then arises to what degree the increased performance

in review times and action dates has translated into better performance for approval times.

       Because the mandates of PDUFA proposed upper bounds on the percentiles of action

times, it is instructive to display drug approval data employing survival curves that plot the

proportion of approvals not yet approved within a fixed time period. More precisely, Figures 1
Assessing Impacts of PDUFA on FDA Drug Approval Times                                         9


and 2 survival curves plot the percent approvals remaining over time in months, during different

time periods. As the time scale increases along the horizontal axis in Figures 1 and 2, more

NDAs/BLAs are approved, and thus the proportion of approvals remaining declines.

       Figure 1 displays the patterns for standard drugs, while Figure 2 provides analogous

information for applications granted priority review status; recall that different PDUFA goals

applied to these two categories. In each of the two figures, separate survival curves are plotted

for the 1979-86, 1987-92, PDUFA-I and PDUFA-II time periods. Survival curves from more

recent time periods are clearly separate from and ever closer to the origin than are those from

earlier eras. The horizontal line indicates the 90 percent level of survival (10 percent of

approvals remaining), since that was the relevant level for several PDUFA-mandated

performance goals. The more rapid decline in survival curves during PDUFA-I and II relative to

the pre-PDUFA time period indicates faster approvals. In contrast to the PDUFA goals, only

14% percent of standard drugs were approved at 12 months and 22% percent of priority drugs

were approved at six months under PDUFA-I. The corresponding percentages for PDUFA-II

were 20% and 23.5%. Consequently, although FDA actual review times met the PDUFA goals,

the time elapsed until drug applications were granted final approving for marketing was

significantly greater than the action/review performance goals.

IV.    SPECIFICATIONS TO ASSESS THE IMPACT OF PDUFA ON APPROVAL TIMES

       Drug approval data provided us by the FDA indicate that approval times have been

falling for quite some time, at least since 1979, and appear to have accelerated, particularly

during PDUFA-I. As seen in Figure 3, mean approval time during 1979-86 was 33.57 months,

28.19 months in 1987-92, 18.61 months during PDUFA-I, and 16.09 months in PDUFA-II.

Since the approval time data is skewed to the right, the corresponding median approval times are
Assessing Impacts of PDUFA on FDA Drug Approval Times                                     10


all smaller, but they too fall over time: 27.07 (1979-86), 23.83 (1987-92), 15.18 (PDUFA-I), and

12.27 (PDUFA-II).

       Although there is general agreement that PDUFA has lowered approval review times,

given the presence of confounding factors, the quantitative magnitude by which it has done so

has not been established.9 In estimating the magnitude attributable to PDUFA, as was noted

above, it is important to note that approval times were already trending downwards prior to

PDUFA-I, so that simply calculating pre- and post-PDUFA approval times would overstate the

magnitude of the impact of PDUFA. Moreover, in response to patient advocacy groups

highlighting the need for more rapid approval of drugs that treat certain life-threatening illnesses

such as AIDS, the FDA has assigned these NDAs a disproportionately high priority status. To

isolate the impact of PDUFA on FDA approval times, it is imperative that changes over time in

the composition among therapeutic classes of the NDAs be taken into account, as well as other

changes over time that could have affected approval times.

       We specify a multivariate linear regression model with the logarithm of the time between

NDA/BLA filing and NDA/BLA approval in months (LNAPP) as the dependent variable. We

hypothesize that LNAPP is related to a number of explanatory variables, including the following.

We construct a TIME TREND variable as a time counter equal to 1 during fiscal year 1980

(10/01/1979 to 9/30/1980), equal to 2 during fiscal year 1981 (10/01/1980 to 9/30/1981), and so

forth, up to 23 in fiscal year 2002 (10/01/2001 to 9/30/2002); each observation is assigned a

TIME TREND value given the date the NDA/BLA was filed with the FDA (not the date it was

approved). We expect the coefficient on TIME TREND to be negative, reflecting shorter

review/approval times in more recent years.
Assessing Impacts of PDUFA on FDA Drug Approval Times                                     11


         In order to assess whether the decline in approval times has been accelerating or

decelerating in the last decade, we also construct two interaction variables. First, in addition to

the TIME TREND variable, we construct a variable TIME that counts years during the PDUFA

eras: TIME equals 1 if the NDA/BLA was filed in the first year (actually, 13 months) during

PDUFA-I (9/1/92 through 9/30/93), 2 if it was filed between 10/1/93 and 9/30/94, and so on, up

to 10 if the NDA/BLA was filed between 10/1/2001 and 9/30/2002 (the last year of PDUFA-II).

PDUFA-I*TIME is then constructed as the product of TIME and a 0-1 indicator variable

PDUFA-I that takes on the value one if the NDA/BLA was filed during PDUFA-I (9/1/1992

through 9/30/1997), else PDUFA-I is zero. The interaction variable PDUFA-II*TIME is

constructed analogously.

         With these variables of primary interest, and denoting other covariates by Xi, we specify

a regression equation for the ith observation as follows:

             LNAPPi =      0   +   1*TIMETRENDi +   2*PDUFA-I*TIMEi


                       +   3*PDUFA-II*TIMEi +      Xi +   i ,   i = 1,…,I,   (Eqn. 1)

where    i   is an independently and identically normally distributed random disturbance term, and

the ’s are parameters to be estimated. Note that in this specification, parameter estimates on the

interaction variables represent any differential annual impact of the passage of time on LNAPP

during the PDUFA eras, relative to that existing over the entire 1979-2002 time period.

Negative (positive) parameter estimates on these interaction variables are interpreted as an

acceleration (deceleration) of the decline in approval times during the PDUFA years. If approval

times were not significantly different during the PDUFA eras relative to pre-PDUFA, then       2   =

 3   = 0. If the annual differential impact of the passage of time on LNAPP was the same during

PDUFA-I and PDUFA-II, then            2   =   3.
Assessing Impacts of PDUFA on FDA Drug Approval Times                                       12


       A number of potentially confounding covariates are also included among the regressors

in X.10 Three 0-1 indicator variables include: ORPHAN (1 if the application was filed citing

eligibility under the 1983 Orphan Drug Act, else 0); PRIORITY (1 if the application was

assigned priority status by the FDA after 1991, or an A or B rating prior to 1991, else 0); and

DOMESTIC (if the application sponsor was headquartered inside the US, else 0). We expect the

coefficient on PRIORITY to be negative. Although it is reasonable to expect the coefficient on

ORPHAN to be negative as well, since about 60% of the ORPHAN drug applications were

assigned PRIORITY status, multicollinearity between these two variables may confound the

expected association. Finally, to the extent DOMESTIC applicants have greater familiarity and

cumulative experience with the FDA, we might expect the sign of the coefficient on DOMESTIC

to be negative.

       It is plausible that review times vary across therapeutic classes, due to inherent

differences across diseases and therapies. To accommodate this possibility, we construct 0-1

indicator variables assigning each observed NDA/BLA approval to one and only one of the

following 13 therapeutic classes: AIDS, ANTI-INFEC (anti-infective), ANTI-INFLAM (anti-

inflammatory), BIOLOGIC (involving a Biologic License Application, rather than an NDA),

CARDIO (cardiovascular or renal), CNS (central nervous system), DERM-OPTHAL

(dermatologic or ophthalmologic), GI (gastrointestinal), METABOL-ENDO (metabolic or

endocrine), NEOPLASTIC (oncologic), RADIO-DIAG (radiopharmaceutical or diagnostic),

RESPIRATORY, and a miscellaneous OTHER category. Roughly speaking, this classification

corresponds with the various division review structures at the Center for Drug Evaluation

Research and the Center for Biologic Evaluation Research at the FDA existing up through 2002.
Assessing Impacts of PDUFA on FDA Drug Approval Times                                      13


In the regression results reported below, the BIOLOGICS class variable is omitted, and thus this

serves as the reference class.

       It is possible that in addition to variations across therapeutic classes, the complexity of

certain sponsor development efforts affected review times at the FDA. For 621 of the 662

NDA/BLA approvals in the data base, we have also obtained information on the date at which

the initial IND for that therapeutic was filed with the FDA. We construct the variable

LNINDNDA as the logarithm of the time in months between the filing of the IND and the filing

of the NDA/BLA. A priori, the sign of the coefficient on LNINDNDA is ambiguous. If a more

thorough drug development process prior to the filing of the NDA/BLA provides the FDA with

additional useful information, facilitating a more expeditious subsequent FDA review, then the

coefficient LNINDNDA would be negative. On the other hand, if the longer development time

in between the IND and the NDA/BLA filing reflects inherent difficulties and complexities of

the clinical development process for that drug, it may also take longer for the FDA to diligently

review the application; in such a case, the coefficient on LNINDNDA would be positive.

       There are instances in which a sponsor has never filed an IND with the FDA (this phase

may have been carried out overseas), and in other cases the IND date data are simply missing;

altogether, 41 of the 662 observations have missing IND date data. To allow for the possibility

that these 41 observations missing IND dates are non-random or non-representative, we

construct and include as a regressor a 0-1 indicator variable IND MISS that equals 1 if the

observation has a missing IND value, else it is zero.

       A rather different factor potentially affecting NDA/BLA approval times involves the

presence or absence of top leadership at the FDA.11 To address the issue of whether the presence

or absence of a Congressionally-confirmed FDA Commissioner has impacted the speed of
Assessing Impacts of PDUFA on FDA Drug Approval Times                                   14


NDA/BLA approval times, we consider several alternative specifications that in different ways

attempt to quantify the absence of a confirmed Commissioner.

       Historically, between 1979 and 2002, six Commissioner vacancy periods occurred: June

30, 1979 to October 21, 1979 (113 days); January 20, 1981 to April 13, 1981 (83 days);

September 11, 1983 to July 15, 1984 (308 days); December 17, 1989 to November 7, 1990 (325

days); February 28, 1997 to November 30, 1998 (640 days); and January 19, 2001 to November

14, 2002 (664 days). Note that the first two vacancy periods lasted less than four months, the

second two between 10 and 11 months, and the last two more than 20 months. Thus, the longest

Commissioner vacancies occurred during PDUFA-II, even as the FDA was implementing

measures to reduce approval times.12 This suggests that it may be difficult to disentangle the

effects of PDUFA from those possibly due to the absence of a confirmed Commissioner.

       In terms of quantification of vacancy prevalence, for each NDA/BLA, we first calculate

the overlap in time period of the vacancy of a Commissioner with the time period during which

the application was being reviewed at the FDA. The variable NOCOM% is then computed as

the ratio of Commissioner absent days to days that particular NDA/BLA was under review

before approval. We consider several alternative specifications to the “base case” in Eqn. (1)

above. In Model I NOCOM% appears as an additional regressor relative to the base case

specification. In Model II, the logarithm of NOCOM%, denoted LNNOCOM, is added instead

as a regressor. In those instances in which NOCOM% is zero, we arbitrarily overrule it and

instead assigned LNNOCOM a value of LOG(0.001). In Model III, a simple and coarse 0-1

indicator variable EVERNOCOM is added instead, taking on the value 1 if NOCOM% > 0, else

EVERNOCOM = 0. In this specification, the mere occurrence anytime during the approval

process of a non-confirmed Commissioner is hypothesized to affect approval time. Finally, in
Assessing Impacts of PDUFA on FDA Drug Approval Times                                   15


Model IV a 0-1 indicator variable NOABSENCE is first defined as being equal to 1 if

NOCOM% = 0, else NOABSENCE equals zero. Then another variable, called LNNOCOMX, is

constructed as being equal to LNNOCOM whenever NOCOM% >0, else LNNOCOMX = 0. In

Model IV both NOABSENCE and LNNOCOMX are included as regressors.

       If the absence of a confirmed Commissioner increased regulatory delays and approval

times at the FDA, other things equal, then one would expect the coefficient estimates on

NOCOM%, LNNOCOM and EVERNOCOM to be positive in Models I, II and III, respectively.

In the case of Model IV, while the parameter on NOABSENCE would be expected to be

negative, that on LNNOCOMX would be positive. Of course, expected coefficient signs would

be reversed if it were hypothesized that the absence of a confirmed Commissioner reduced FDA

approval times, other things equal.

       Finally, for purposes of comparison with time at the FDA prior to NDA/BLA approval,

we also consider a specification in which we examine factors affecting the clinical development

time between the sponsor’s filing of the IND and the submission of the NDA/BLA. As has been

noted by a number of observers, this time interval is typically two to four times larger than FDA

review time prior to approval.13 For this pre-NDA/BLA clinical development time analysis, we

specify the same set of regressors as in the LNAPP regression, except now of course

LNINDNDA becomes the dependent variable, and those 41 observations for which IND MISS =

1 must be deleted. We hypothesize that in this pre-NDA/BLA clinical development time

regression, the TIME TREND coefficient is non-negative (either zero or positive), as is that on

the PDUFA-I*TIME and PDUFA-II*TIME interaction variables.

V.      DATA SOURCES AND EMPIRICAL RESULTS

        We now report on data sources, and on results obtained from the multivariate regression

analyses. We begin with data sources.

     A. Data Sources

        Data on new molecular entities filed at the FDA between 1965 and 2003 were provided

us by Ed Hass, Office of Policy and Planning, US Food and Drug Administration. Data fields

included NME name (along with any withdrawal information), descriptive characteristics of the

drug (whether NDA or BLA, vaccine, diagnostic, radiopharmaceutical, orphan drug, and nuclear

related therapeutic); the developing company; developing country; FDA approval date;

therapeutic significance rating (A,B,C prior to 1991; priority or standard thereafter); year of first

world marketing; country of first world marketing; US trade name at time of approval; IND

submission date; NDA/BLA clock date; IND number; elapsed approval time in months; years in

the IND phase; total development years; NDA/BLA number; name of the sponsoring company;

US/foreign developer code; orphan drug code; and US first marketing date. Additional data

include 7-digit and 3-digit therapeutic class codes for each NME. FDA officials believe that

these data series are error free and complete from the period of 1975 forward in regards to

NDA/BLA approval length.

        For purposes of our analysis, we considered all NDA/BLA filed at the FDA beginning

with fiscal year 1980 (October 1, 1979 through September 30, 1980) up through fiscal year 2002

(October 1, 2001 through September 30, 2002). This yielded 649 observations, 321 of them

being from the pre-PDUFA era up through August 31, 1992, and 328 of them in PDUFA-I or

PDUFA-II. Of these, 123 were missing data on therapeutic class codes. A research assistant

entered class code data for these products, using information from the 2003 Physicians’ Desk
Assessing Impacts of PDUFA on FDA Drug Approval Times                                     17


Reference. To mitigate problems of right-censoring for submissions filed but not yet approved

by April 2003 (when the FDA data set was last updated), in May 2004 we augmented the FDA

data by adding 13 additional FDA approvals from April 2003 up through May 1, 2004. This

yielded a total of 662 observations, 321 pre-PDUFA, and 341 post- PDUFA. Of these, 42.7%

had domestic sponsors, 18% were orphan drug applications, and 30% were granted priority

review status.

   B. Multivariate Regression Empirical Estimates

       The principal empirical estimates from our regression analyses are presented in Table 1.

Parameter estimates with p-values less than 0.05 are highlighted in bold. Here we restrict our

discussion to general findings. Results concerning therapeutic class-specific impacts are

discussed in a separate paper.14

       Before discussing PDUFA-related findings, we first comment on the impacts of various

covariates. The coefficient estimate on LNINDNDA is virtually zero and statistically

insignificant, implying that apparently there is no spillover between the time spent in clinical

development by the sponsor and the approval time at the FDA. The coefficient estimate on IND

MISS is also insignificant, suggesting that the observations missing the IND date are unlikely to

be unrepresentative of the larger sample. NDAs/BLAs assigned PRIORITY status, other things

equal, have a review time only 61% (exponentiation of -0.4902) as long as those applications

assigned STANDARD review status. This difference is statistically significant. By contrast,

drugs having an ORPHAN status and those sponsored by a DOMESTIC applicant have no

significant impact on approval time. Recall that the majority of ORPHAN drugs also were

assigned PRIORITY status; while the Orphan Drug Act provided incentives to develop drugs

targeted at very small populations, the enabling legislation did not accord these drugs any special
Assessing Impacts of PDUFA on FDA Drug Approval Times                                    18


accelerated review status. Having an ORPHAN drug designation in addition to PRIORITY

status, therefore, does not appear to have affected approval times significantly.

       We now turn to a discussion of PDUFA-related impacts on approval times. As seen near

the top of Table 1, the coefficient estimate on TIME TREND is -0.017, indicating that approval

times were declining about 1.7% annually, ceteris paribus, even in the absence of PDUFA; this

estimate is statistically significant (p-value 0.038). Declines in approval time accelerated

significantly, however, during the PDUFA-I years, with a differential decline from the overall

trend of about -7.6% annually. Hence, during the PDUFA-I era, approval times declined more

than 9% annually (1.7% + 7.6% = 9.3%), significantly greater than the -1.7% during the pre-

PDUFA-I era.

       While declines in approval time continued during PDUFA-II, the declines were smaller

than during PDUFA-I. As seen in Table 1, relative to the pre-PDUFA time period, approval

times for NDAs/BLAs submitted during PDUFA-II declined about 3.6% more rapidly, not as

dramatic a differential as during PDUFA-I, but still significant and meaningful, especially when

cumulated over time. This pattern of greater acceleration in shortened approval times during

PDUFA-I than during PDUFA-II is consistent with the notion that during PDUFA-I “low

hanging fruit” procedures were implemented initially, which had a very significant impact on

reducing approval times. While subsequent efforts by the FDA continued to result in reductions

in approval times during PDUFA-II, these efforts yielded smaller annual increments, in part

reflecting the fact that significant improvements had already been achieved.

       One way of envisioning the implications of these PDUFA-related findings is to create a

counterfactual situation in which there is no PDUFA, i.e., one in which the PDUFA-I*TIME and

PDUFA-II*TIME variables are set to zero, only the TIME TREND variable changes over time,
Assessing Impacts of PDUFA on FDA Drug Approval Times                                          19


and all other regressors are evaluated at their overall sample means.15 The time trend of

predicted approval times from this base case regression equation, with and without the PDUFA

variables, is plotted in Figure 4.

           As seen in Figure 4, had PDUFA-I and PDUFA-II not been implemented, between 1991

and 2002 average approval times would have fallen about 16% from 24.2 to 20.4 months.

Instead, because of PDUFA-I and PDUFA-II, between 1991 and 2002 approval times declined

about 42% to 14.2 months. Of the total 10.1 month decline, therefore, approximately 62% is due

to PDUFA-I and II. Most of this reduction occurred during PDUFA-I. Without PDUFA-I, mean

reductions in approval time would have declined from 24.2 in 1991 to 22.3 months in 1997 (a 1.9

month or 8% reduction), but with PDUFA-I the reduction was much larger to 14.9 months (a 9.3

month or 38% reduction). Hence, declines in mean approval times between 1991 and 1997 were

80% due to PDUFA-I, and 20% to pre-existing trends. However, during PDUFA-II, initially the

mean approval time increased from 14.8 in 1997 to 17.6 months in 1998, but after that approval

times steadily declined, and by 2002 they had fallen a total of 0.7 months to 14.2 months.

Proportionally, the PDUFA-II reduction was smaller at 5%.

           As a further assessment of estimated coefficients on the PDUFA-related variables, we

tested two hypotheses. The first is that the annual differential reductions in approval times

during PDUFA-I were the same as those in PDUFA-II; this corresponds to the null hypothesis

that   2   =   3.   Using an F-test analysis of variance procedure, we reject this hypothesis decisively

(F1,641 = 8.325, p-value 0.004). Not surprisingly, then, we also reject the null hypothesis that

both these parameters simultaneously equal zero, i.e., that there is no differential impact of the

passage of time on average approval times during PDUFA-I and PDUFA-II (F2,641 = 5.678, p-

value 0.004).
Assessing Impacts of PDUFA on FDA Drug Approval Times                                          20


       The estimated regression equation in Table 1 is based on a number of assumptions.

Although the null hypothesis of homoskedasticity of the disturbance terms is rejected (White test

procedure, p-value 0.005), heteroskedasticity-consistent standard errors for the coefficients on

the TIME TREND, PDUFA-I*TIME and PDUFA-II*TIME variables are virtually identical to

those in Table 1 – 0.008, 0.023 and 0.015, respectively.16 Another assumption is that the

coefficients on the variables other than the 0-1 therapeutic class indicator variables are equal

across the various therapeutic classes. Using a modified Chow test procedure, we are unable to

reject the null hypothesis that these coefficients are equal across classes (F96,545 = 1.2157, p-value

0.0948).17

       As noted earlier, for purposes of comparison we have also estimated an auxiliary

regression specification in which LNINDNDA – the logarithm of the time in months between the

IND and the NDA/BLA filing – is the dependent variable. Results from this pre-NDA/BLA

clinical development time regression appear in the final three columns of Table 1. In terms of

the impact of PDUFA-related variables on clinical development time, the coefficient on the

overall TIME TREND variable is positive and significant, increasing about 2.6% annually (p-

value 0.015). While the estimated coefficients on PDUFA-I*TIME and PDUFA-II*TIME are

negative and of similar magnitude (-0.0445 and -0.0423, respectively), only the latter is

statistically significant (p-value 0.039). Since the impact of the passage of time during the

PDUFA years is the sum of the estimated coefficients on TIME TREND and PDUFA-II*TIME

(e.g., 0.0271 – 0.0423 = -0.0152), the total impact is quite small, and likely statistically

insignificant. We conclude that while PDUFA has had a significant impact on reducing drug

approval times, it has not had any appreciable impact on clinical development times.
Assessing Impacts of PDUFA on FDA Drug Approval Times                                     21


       Our final line of empirical analysis involves an exploratory examination of the impact of

the absence of a Congressionally-confirmed FDA Commissioner on approval times, controlling

for other confounding variables. Our results are provocative but fragile, and clearly call for more

detailed examination. Parameter estimates on the various Commissioner-absence measures in

Models I through IV, as well as those on the TIME TREND and PDUFA interaction variables,

along with parameters from the “base case” specification in Table 1, are given in Table 2.

       In a specification with NOCOM% (Model I) as an additional regressor, the coefficient

estimates is 0.0321, but with a p-value of 0.710, it is clearly not significant. Parameter estimates

on the TIME TREND and PDUFA interaction variables are not much affected, relative to the

base case. It is worth noting that because approval time is in the denominator of NOCOM% and

also appears in log-transformed form as the dependent variable in this specification, one would

expect the coefficient estimate on NOCOM% to reflect a spurious negative correlation, and thus

be downward biased.

       In Model II, where LNNOCOM is instead the additional regressor (and observations for

which NOCOM% = 0 are arbitrarily assigned a value of log[0.001]), the coefficient estimate is

0.0591, with a p-value of <0.001. In this specification, the elasticity of approval time with

respect to NOCOM% is positive, but small. Because the log of approval time appears on both

the left and right-hand side of the regression specification, again one might expect the coefficient

estimate on LNNOCOM to be downward biased. Notice also that in this specification, the TIME

TREND coefficient estimate becomes positive and significant, and both PDUFA-related

coefficient estimates become much more negative. Recall that the extent of Commissioner

absence was much greater during PDUFA-I and especially PDUFA-II than it was earlier -- 61%

of all Commissioner absence days occurred during PDUFA-I and II, while only 39% took place
Assessing Impacts of PDUFA on FDA Drug Approval Times                                      22


prior to PDUFA. Because in Model II the increased prevalence of Commissioner absences

lengthens approval times, the impact of PDUFA on reducing approval times is estimated as

being even greater than in the base case.

       In Model III, however, where the 0-1 EVERNOCOM indicator variable takes on the

value of 1 whenever NOCOM% > 0, the positive coefficient estimate becomes much larger at

0.3928, with a p-value of <0.001. In this specification, the mere existence of any absence of the

Commissioner while the NDA/BLA is being reviewed increases approval times by about 48%,

other things equal. We view this result as rather implausible. Note also that again the estimated

coefficients on the TIME TREND and PDUFA interaction variables change considerably from

the base case specification, with the PDUFA-related coefficient estimates becoming much larger

in absolute value.

       Finally, in Model IV, the most complex specification, both NOABSENCE and

LNNOCOMX appear as regressors. Here the estimated coefficient on NOABSENCE is negative

at -0.2445 (p-value <0.001), while that on LNNOCOMX is -0.1183 (p-value <0.001). Although

the negative estimate on NOABSENCE is consistent with the hypothesis that Commissioner

absence increases approval times, other things equal, the negative estimate on LNNOCOMX is

inconsistent with that hypothesis. As in Models II and III, the estimated annual differential

impacts of passage of time during the PDUFA-I and PDUFA-II eras are much larger (in absolute

value) than in the base case.

       Although these various specifications point to the possibility that the extent of

Commissioner absence increases drug approval times, other things equal, the magnitude of the

estimated impacts are clearly fragile. Informal conversations we have had with officials at the

FDA and with industry regulatory affairs personnel reflect considerable skepticism that the
Assessing Impacts of PDUFA on FDA Drug Approval Times                                       23


presence or absence of a confirmed Commissioner would have any substantial impact on day-to-

day application review procedures and other daily review operations, and thus on average

approval times. Rather, industry officials suggest that while the Commissioner may become

involved in particularly controversial situations, these are likely to be relatively infrequent.18 We

conclude here that to the extent further analysis of this issue is warranted, there is a clear need to

develop more defensible and independent measures of the impact of a confirmed Commissioner

on day-to-day operations.

VI.    CONCLUDING REMARKS AND FUTURE RESEARCH

       In this paper we have modeled and quantified the impact of PDUFA-I and II on drug

approval times at the FDA, in part by constructing a counterfactual hypothetical situation in

which PDUFA did not exist. We find that PDUFA-I resulted in an acceleration of the decline in

NDA/BLA approval times at the FDA. Of the 10 month decline from about 24 months in 1991

to 14 months in 2002, about 60% is attributable to the enactment and implementation of PDUFA.

Declines in approval time decelerated significantly, however, between PDUFA-I and PDUFA-II,

with annual differential declines about half as large during PDUFA-II.

       A limitation of our study is that we have not undertaken a separate analysis of “fast track”

provisions that involve rolling submissions to the FDA. We believe the impact of this omission

is likely to be relatively minor, for not only is the number of NDAs/BLAs granted fast track

study in our sample up through 2002 likely to be small, but preliminary analyses by several FDA

observers suggests that the differential impact of fast track from priority status on approval times

is small, and in some cases fast track may even lengthen approval times.19 Research results

reported by DiMasi [1997] suggest that fast track approval status had a positive but statistically

insignificant impact on drug approval times between 1987 and 1995.
Assessing Impacts of PDUFA on FDA Drug Approval Times                                      24


       Our analysis point to a large set of research questions that address a variety of

implications from the findings reported here, some of which we are currently investigating and

plan to report on in the near future. For example, it will be useful to disaggregate the results on

reductions in drug approval times reported here into separate therapeutic classes, to determine in

which therapeutic areas reductions were largest.

       A second very important set of issues concerns the implied net social benefit of the

reduced approval times induced by PDUFA. Although there is debate about the appropriate

speed of the FDA approval process, to the best of our knowledge no framework has been put

forward to quantitatively assess the costs and benefits of faster approval. This is an important

topic for future research. The primary costs in the case of PDUFA would be the additional FDA

review resources paid for by PDUFA user fees, and any excess burden imposed through distorted

R&D behavior by those taxes. The principal benefits would consist of the additional present

value to consumers who benefit from earlier consumption of the newly approved drugs.

Developers would also benefit from being able to plan with greater certainty when their product

would need to be manufactured and marketed. Evaluation of the net benefits of PDUFA would

not only be useful in the aggregate, but also over the various therapeutic classes.

       In evaluating costs and benefits of more rapid drug approvals by the FDA, it would also

be necessary to include in the cost calculations the possibility that while PDUFA may have

accelerated the approval process, it may also have altered the set of drugs to be approved,

lowering the quality of approved drugs. Indeed, some have argued that the FDA, although not

mandated to do so by Congress, serves as a principal source of evidence-based medicine and that

any legislation that led to compromising the FDA’s ability to assess the safety of new

medications would entail large social costs.
Assessing Impacts of PDUFA on FDA Drug Approval Times                                     25


       To date, there is only limited evidence on whether PDUFA affected the quality of drugs

approved by the FDA. A study published by the U.S. Government Accounting Office in 2002 at

the time PDUFA-III renewal was being considered reported that from 1985 to 1992, 3.10% (6 of

193) of drugs approved by the FDA were subsequently withdrawn for safety-related reasons,

whereas during PDUFA-II between 1993 and 2000 a slightly higher percentage, 3.47% (9 of

259) were withdrawn for safety reasons. The GAO did not report whether this difference was

statistically significant.20 In response, the FDA noted not only issues of possible lack of

statistical significance given that withdrawals were relatively rare events, but also that the GAO

had excluded the increasing number of biologics from their analysis. Moreover, in some cases

post-PDUFA FDA approvals were attributed to the PDUFA time frame, when in fact NDAs for

those NMEs had been submitted prior to PDUFA-I. According to the FDA’s analysis, the

withdrawal percentage from 1979 to 1992 was close to 2.5%, while for NDAs/BLAs approved

during PDUFA-I and PDUFA-II until 1999, the withdrawal rate was virtually identical at 2.6%.21

       A related set of costs would consider whether the proportion of NDAs/BLAs that failed

or were withdrawn changed during the PDUFA era. Due to confidentiality obligations to

sponsor companies, the FDA was unable to provide detailed or aggregate information on

NDAs/BLAs that were rejected or withdrawn. It is possible that failure rates of NDAs/BLAs did

not change from the pre-PDUFA time period to the PDUFA era (or that trends in rates did not

change). However, if failure rates increased during PDUFA, this added cost would need to be

taken into consideration; similarly, a reduction in failure or withdrawal rates would increase the

benefits delivered by PDUFA. While lack of data availability precludes a robust analysis of this

issue, by itself this issue does not negate the benefits realized from more rapid approvals that

actually occurred under PDUFA.
Assessing Impacts of PDUFA on FDA Drug Approval Times                                26


       A third set of issues worthy of further research is an assessment of how PDUFA altered

the present values of revenues and costs to developers of the more rapidly approved drugs. More

generally, a decomposition of the social surplus resulting from PDUFA into its consumers’

surplus and producers’ surplus components would be most useful and informative.

 An exception to this is the rare case in which the FDA grants “compassionate use” approval to a drug not yet
approved for marketing.

in the United States”, Nature Reviews: Drug Discovery, Vol. 2, September, 695-702, and the references cited
therein. For an analysis of drug approval times up to 1995, see Joseph A. DiMasi [1996], “A New Look at United

  Although we would have preferred to include as a regressor the set of FDA-sponsor conference measures
developed by DiMasi [1997] for 166 drugs approved between 1987 and 1995, such data were not available for the
full set of 662 drugs considered in this study.

   Since LNAPP is the dependent variable and since we have assumed a normally distributed random disturbance
term, to create a predicted value in natural (non-logarithmically transformed) units, we exponentiate (predicted
value of LNAPP plus 0.5s2), where s2 is the mean squared error from the estimated regression equation.
16
  None of the standard errors in Table 2 increase by more than 15% when adjusted for heteroskedasticity; but that
on the OTHER variable falls about 25% to 0.114.

  More detailed disaggregation by therapeutic class and further discussions are presented in the MIT Master’s
theses by Gottschalk and Strobeck. See Adrian H. G. Gottschalk [2004], “Improving the Efficiency of the Later
