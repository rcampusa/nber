                                         ABSTRACT

Recent studies show that texting-based interventions can produce educational benefits in children
across a range of ages. We study effects of a text-based program for parents of kindergarten
children, distinguishing a general program from one adding differentiation and personalization
based on each child’s developmental level. Children in the differentiated and personalized
program were 63 percent more likely to read at a higher level (p<0.001) compared to the general
group; and their parents reported engaging more in literacy activities. Effects were driven by
children further from average levels of baseline development indicating that the effects likely
stemmed from text content.

1. Introduction:

       Educational interventions based on behavioral economics principles have shown promise

for combatting some of the persistent disparities in education outcomes. Some of these

interventions focus on helping participants hold their attention to tasks that need to be completed

repeatedly over long periods of time (Bergman 2016). Others provide small bits of information

regularly with easily operationalized tasks in order to overcome both information asymmetries and

the cognitive load required for behavior change (York, Loeb, and Doss 2017). This information

and support encourages parents and students to behave in ways that are more consistent with

positive educational outcomes. Researchers have fielded successful interventions at all levels of

education ranging from prekindergarten (York, Loeb, and Doss 2017), to K-12 (Kraft and Rogers

2015; Bergman 2016), to the transition to college (Hoxby and Turner 2013; Castleman and Page

2015). Such programs, due to their low cost and ease of implementation, provide researchers with

opportunities not only to directly support students and parents but also to test the mechanisms

underlying the effects of these programs.

       This study aims to identify the importance of personalization and differentiation within a

text-messaging program for parents of young children. Personalization conveys a combination of

child-specific information and a potential increased sense of familiarity. It may provide parents

with better information about their child and encourage a sense of connection that could lead to

greater incentives for behavior change. Differentiation provides activities for parents that are

targeted to their child’s level of development and thus is potentially more effective for generating

learning gains than a generic program. Differentiation may, in turn, encourage parents to engage

more with the program if their children more successfully complete the developmentally

appropriate activities. On the other hand, if program-inspired behavior change comes solely or


                                                                                    Page 1 of 52
primarily from holding attention through regular reminders (“nudges”), we would not expect either

differentiation or personalization to affect program effectiveness.

        We field a randomized control trial to explicitly test the additional benefits of

differentiating and personalizing information in a program for kindergarten parents modeled after

the original READY4K! program for prekindergarten parents. The READY4K! program has been

shown to increase the number of reported academic activities done at home and in turn to increase

pre-literacy skills of children (York, Loeb, and Doss 2017). This study follows the first cohort of

participants from the original experiment into their kindergarten year, recruits additional

kindergarten families, and randomizes families to receive a small number of control text messages

unrelated to literacy, general literacy texts, or literacy texts that are differentiated and personalized.

        We employ a “light touch” differentiation and personalization that leverages extant data to

adjust text messages. We personalize the texts by informing parents how well their child knew a

particular skill based on the child’s performance on formative assessments. We then differentiate

the texts by aligning the activity more closely to the child’s skill level. Through this experimental

design we are able to test whether the differentiated and personalized information provision

generates a greater parental response and greater academic gains in reading when compared to a

general provision of information. Thus, we are able to identify the causal effect of differentiation

and personalization separate from the effect of information provision alone.

        We find that differentiation and personalization increases parental take up of the program

as measured by parental survey responses and increases the reading ability of students as measured

by district assessments. Specifically, differentiation and personalization caused students to be 63

percent more likely to move up a reading level than their peers in the general program (p<0.001),

with the academic effects particularly pronounced for students in the bottom and top quartiles of




                                                                                         Page 2 of 52
the baseline skill distribution. The differentiated and personalized texts also positively affected

parents’ reports of the ease of building reading skills by 32 percent of a standard deviation (p<0.05)

when compared to the general texting program, while increasing parental engagement in literacy

activities with their child by 26 percent of a standard deviation (p<0.05) when compared to the

control group. There is some suggestive evidence that the differentiation caused parents to use the

texts more, indicating that a closer match of the text to the children’s skill level led parents to

engage in the activities to a greater extent. The greater amount of information in the texts, however,

may have caused parents to visit their children’s school less often.

2. Background

       Recent experiments in education have demonstrated that parent texting interventions based

on behavioral economics principals are effective in improving students’ educational outcomes.

The precursor to this study, the READY4K! experiment conducted in the prekindergarten context,

applied several of these principals. Families in the treatment group received three literacy texts per

week for eight months. The program provided a parenting curriculum that was designed to remedy

information asymmetries and limited attention, breakdown the cognitively complex task of

engaging in academic tasks with small, easy-to-achieve activities, provide encouragement, and

reframe distal rewards to be more proximal. Though the evidence of information asymmetries is

mixed (Avery and Kane 2004; Grodsky and Jones 2007; Hastings and Weinstein 2008; Valant and

Loeb 2014), suboptimal behavior due to limited attention (Karlan et al. 2016), the cognitive

complexity of tasks (Mullainathan and Thaler 2000), and time inconsistent preferences

(DellaVigna 2009) is well established. Addressing these behavioral barriers with the READY4K!

program yielded substantial literacy benefits. The program, implemented in the San Francisco

Unified School District (SFUSD), increased take up of home literacy activities and parental




                                                                                      Page 3 of 52
involvement in schools by approximately 20 percent of a standard deviation and increased some

pre-literacy test scores by approximately 10 percent of a standard deviation (York, Loeb and Doss

2017).

         Addressing behavioral barriers through texting has been applied to a range of levels of

education. These interventions often include child-specific information to address information

asymmetries and limited attention. On the K-12 level, Bergman (2016) used email, text messages,

and phone calls to inform parents of their child’s missing assignments. The information given was

student-specific and detailed, often containing specific class assignments and page numbers, and

clearly personalized for specific parents and students. The intervention led to a 21 percent of a

standard deviation increase in student GPA, a 25 percent increase in assignment completion, and

a 28 percent decrease in classes missed. Kraft and Rogers (2015) used the same three mediums to

establish weekly teacher-parent communication in the summer school context. In one treatment

arm teachers conveyed positive messages regarding their child’s behavior and academic

performance. In another treatment arm, teachers highlighted areas where the child could improve.

The authors found that this intervention increased the probability of passing the summer school

class by 6.5 percentage points – a 41 percent reduction in failing the class. The results were driven

mostly by the child-specific suggestions parents received on where the child could improve.

Receiving positive information regarding child-specific successes produced positive, though

imprecise, point estimates.

         At the post-secondary level. Castleman and Page (2015) fielded an intervention to help

ease the transition to college for new high school graduates. A text messaging arm of the treatment

sent differentiated and personalized reminders during the summer regarding deadlines for filling

out the required paperwork to matriculate into college. The information in the messages was




                                                                                     Page 4 of 52
specific to the requirements of the college in which the student was accepted and planned to

matriculate. Students received reminders to access important paperwork, register for orientation,

register for placement tests, complete housing forms, and complete health insurance forms. A

second treatment arm used in-person peer mentors that reached out to students directly to offer

help in completing the required tasks. Both treatments increased college enrollment among

students who had less access to college counseling during the academic year.

       Though this line of literature is compelling, it is unclear which elements of the programs

are driving the results. The current study seeks to test whether these texting programs are effective

because they address limited attention through reminders (a “nudge”) or through the other

behavioral barriers that require a greater interaction with the content, which is often personalized

and differentiated to program participants. In this vein, we test whether differentiating and

personalizing the READY4K! intervention increases (or decreases) program effectiveness. We

personalize the text messages by providing information to parents about their child’s skill level, as

measured by formative assessments already administered by the district. We differentiate the text

messages by providing parents a literacy activity tailored roughly to their child’s skill level. A

significant, differential effect of the personalized and differentiated version of the text messages

will provide evidence that parents are actively engaged with the program content. The program

can reduce the cognitive load inherent in parenting, provide novel information to parents, and

address time-inconsistent preferences only if parents absorb the content of the messages. If they

do not, then the positive effects of the texting programs are likely driven simply by nudges that

hold attention.

       Interaction with the content opens the door to the possibility that personalization and

differentiation uniquely affects parent behavior. There are many different channels through which




                                                                                     Page 5 of 52
this effect can occur. The mere knowledge that the texts are tailored to a child may induce parents

to engage with the texting program more regularly. To our knowledge, no study has tested to see

whether personalization of interventions engenders more trust and fidelity to treatment from

participants. However, behavioral economics has produced a robust line of literature that shows

that how information is presented to people affects subsequent behavior. For example, the social

norms literature shows that presenting someone with information on their peers’ behavior can lead

to lower energy use (Allcott 2011) and increased savings (Kast et al. 2012), charitable giving (Frey

and Meier 2004), and voter turnout (Gerber and Rogers 2009). The text messages in this

experiment do not provide information about the behavior of the parents’ peers, but do provide

information about the parents’ children. The close relationship between parents and children may

amply the effects seen in the larger social norms literature.

       The information conveyed about parents’ children’s performance on formative

assessments may also update inaccurate beliefs regarding their children’s ability. For example,

parents may not realize their children are weak or strong on certain literacy skills and therefore fail

to invest in their children’s development efficiently. In Malawi, Dizon-Ross (2017) illustrates that

parents inefficiently invest in their child’s academic success due to inaccuracies in their

perceptions of their child’s ability. The gap between perceived and actual ability is as large as one

standard deviation. After receiving information specific to their children, parents began to invest

in their children more efficiently. Their willingness to pay for remedial materials decreased as a

function of their children’s revealed performance and they more accurately picked textbooks that

matched to their children’s ability. One year later the higher forming children were more likely to

transfer to better schools and were less likely to drop out, though lower performing siblings were

hurt academically in the process.




                                                                                      Page 6 of 52
       Finally, the closer alignment of the difficulty of the task to the child’s skill may lead to a

greater probability of success in carrying out the activities. This success may in turn produce a

recursive feedback mechanism that encourages parents to continue with the program. Lower

performing children who previously received tips that were too advanced may have failed at the

activities, causing parents to disengage from the program. Advanced children who, in the

counterfactual, receive activities that are too easy, may have gained little from the experience,

causing parents to disengage from the program. Again, no study has specifically probed this

mechanism.

       Apart from inducing behavioral changes in parents, aligning the difficulty of the activity

to the ability of the child may also produce differential academic gains. Education theorists posit

that students advance in knowledge when taught concepts that are slightly beyond, but still close

to, the student’s ability, a concept called the “Zone of Proximal Development” (ZPD) (Vygotsky

1978a, 1978b). Traditionally, practitioners have used formative assessments to provide

information on where a child’s ZPD lies and have grouped students by ability to tailor instruction

and activities to students whose ZPD lie in approximately the same place. Many studies have

shown that the use of formative assessments and data can improve the educational outcomes of

children. In a meta-analysis of studies conducted between 1988 and 1998, Black and William

(1998a, 1998b) find that the use of formative assessments can increase student performance by 40

to 70 percent of a standard deviation, with effects prominent for low-performing children. In

kindergarten, benefits of using formative assessments have been seen in reading, math, and science

outcomes (Bergen and Sladeczek 1991). Ability grouping in the classroom context has also

generally led to positive academic results for children by as much as a quarter of a standard

deviation (Kulik and Kulik 1992, 1982; Robinson 2009). The effects, however, are not uniformly




                                                                                     Page 7 of 52
positive, with some evidence that lower performing children can be hurt through ability grouping

(Lou et al. 1996).

       With the rise of artificial intelligence, technology has been used to more efficiently identify

a child’s ZPD so that instruction can be tailored to the child. As the software gathers information

on the child’s ability it tailors the program and activities to be more aligned to the child’s skill. As

the child’s skill changes and grows, the software adapts the educational outputs accordingly. This

process also provides teachers information that can be used to differentiate instruction. The

evidence on these types of software is mixed. Van Klaveren and colleagues (2017) compare test

score outcomes of Dutch children randomly assigned to either a static or adaptive practice

technology and find no overall benefits to the adaptive technology and negative effects of about 8

percent of a standard deviation on higher performing children. Pane and colleges (2014) analyze

the efficacy of the Cognitive Tutor Algebra I program that provides a curriculum designed around

an adaptive technology software. They found mixed results when comparing children in schools

randomly assigned to the curriculum to children in traditional Algebra I classrooms. Positive

results appear for high schoolers in the second year of the experiment. These two studies were

included in a recent review of educational technologies by Escueta et al. (2017). Across 29 studies,

she finds a similar mix of results, with some interventions providing large benefits to children, and

others producing null results.

       To the extent that the differentiation and personalization of text messages produce

differences in outcomes, we will be unable to disentangle the effect of differentiation from

personalization. We will also be unable specifically test for the behavioral mechanisms through

which differentiation and personalization can act. However, indirect evidence on this latter point

can be culled by analyzing responses on parent survey items. We also assess whether the




                                                                                       Page 8 of 52
intervention was more successful for students of average baseline ability or for students who

started at the tails of the baseline ability where differentiation was greatest, potentially

distinguishing the effects of personalization engendering a feeling of familiarity from the other

potential mechanisms.

3. The Intervention

       This study is an extension of the READY4K! intervention run in conjunction with the San

Francisco Unified School District (SFUSD) starting in the 2013-2014 school year. In the original

program, treatment families received three texts per week. The “FACT” text was sent on Mondays

and informed families of the skill of the week and the importance of that skill for the academic

growth of their child. On Wednesdays families received a “TIP” message that suggested an home

literacy activity based on that skill. These literacy activities were meant to fit as seamlessly as

possible into the parents’ day and to capitalize on items and materials found in their home and

neighborhood. These “TIP” texts aimed to provide an easy choice to parents and thus reduce the

cognitive load inherent in parenting that stems from making multiple and ambiguous choices.

Finally, on Fridays, families received a “GROWTH” text that contained a more advanced activity

that was meant to extend the learning opportunity presented earlier in the week as well as

encouragement aimed to provide some immediate gratification. Control families received one text

every two weeks that contained general district information and did not promote parent-child

interactions. The eight-month long program touched on a variety of pre-literacy skills such as letter

recognition, letter sounds, rhyming, and early literacy behaviors. Participants could choose to

receive the texts in English, Spanish, or Chinese (York, Loeb, and Doss 2017). For this study, we

built on the original READY4K! format of FACT/TIP/GROWTH but created new texts to match




                                                                                     Page 9 of 52
the skills covered in kindergarten. We created both a generic version and a differentiated and

personalized version targeted to students’ developmental level.

       To field the study, we followed the first cohort from the original experiment into their

kindergarten year and recruited more of their kindergarten peers. The original participants in the

control condition remained in the control condition in the second year. The original participants in

the treatment condition were re-randomized to either continue receiving general literacy texts or

to receive differentiated and personalized literacy texts. Newly recruited participants were

randomized to receive either general texts, differentiated and personalized texts, or control texts.

To keep the proportion of families treated the same in each cohort, half the new participants were

randomized to receive control texts, and half were randomized into the two treatment arms.

       To recruit new participants in the study, we worked with parent liaisons in each elementary

school. In August 2014, we provided a brief training to liaisons to explain the study, its purpose,

and provide materials with which to recruit families. Through their regular course of business,

liaisons recruited families to participate in the study.4 Families that consented to participate

completed a baseline survey to elucidate their home literacy habits and the skill level of their

children on a variety of literacy skills. We used some of the same questions from the baseline

survey in the original year so that we could pool answers between cohorts and use the responses

as covariates in an effort to increase the precision of our estimates. As an incentive, liaisons were

paid $10 for every family they recruited into the study. Participants in both the treatment and

  The job of a parent liaison to facilitate communication between families and the school. One
responsibility of parent liaisons is to coordinate school services to students and parents and refer
families to school resources. It is during this process that parent liaisons recruited parents for the
study. If a parent liaison talked to a parent in the context of coordinating or referring services, they
informed the parent of the program. If the parent consented they then completed the consent form
and baseline survey.


                                                                                      Page 10 of 52
control conditions were paid $10 a month as long as they remained in the program, with the aim

of covering texting costs for parents without unlimited texting plans.

       We began texting at the end of October 2014 and continued for ten months. We used fall

first grade literacy assessments as the primary outcome of interest. Details regarding the three

randomized conditions are as follows:

       (1) Differentiated and Personalized Text Treatment: Treatment followed the same general

design as the first year of the experiment. Families received three texts a week: a “FACT” text on

Mondays, a “TIP” text on Wednesdays, and a “GROWTH” text on Fridays. Only the TIP and

GROWTH texts were differentiated and personalized using child level formative assessment data

on skills that corresponded to the week’s topic. The literacy texts reviewed skills from

prekindergarten such as letters, letter sounds, and rhyming. Then they eased parents into asking

their child to read and helped parents teach their children to read with greater accuracy and

comprehension. Figure 1 presents the differentiated and personalized versions of the texts (see

Figure A1 in the online appendix for additional examples).

       We insert two pieces of information in the TIP texts. First, we personalize the texts by

giving parents an indication as to where their child falls in the distribution of skills. As seen on

Figure 1 we indicate that the child is “beginning” to learn the skill, “growing” in their knowledge

of the skill, has a “solid” understanding, or has a “strong” knowledge of the skill. We positively

framed each text so that parents of children on the lower end of the distribution would not become

frustrated. This framing is akin to an “injuctive norm” in the behavioral economics literature.

Additionally, the texts are differentiated such that parents receive one of four different activities

based on their child’s prior academic information. At first we used parental responses from the

baseline surveys, and once available, we switched to data from the fall, winter, and spring




                                                                                   Page 11 of 52
administrations of the Fountas and Pinnell Benchmark Assessment System (BAS) administered

by the child’s kindergarten teacher. We identified the relevant skill for each week as measured by

the BAS and divided the skill’s scale into four equal intervals. Students scoring in each interval

received different TIP and GROWTH texts. Those on the lower end of the distribution received

easier versions of the TIP and GROWTH, while those at the upper end of the distribution received

more advanced versions. A child was not necessarily in the same category each week because a

child may be weaker on one skill, but stronger in another.5 The information in the TIP text often

would not fit into one text. In those cases, families received two texts on Wednesday, one right

after the other. As a result, families in this condition received one extra text message per week,

though the timing and spacing of texts was very similar across treatment groups.6

        (2) General Text Treatment: The families randomized into the general text treatment also

received FACT, TIP, and GROWTH texts each week. The FACT texts were identical to those

received in the differentiated and personalized text condition. The TIP and GROWTH texts,

however, did not include the strength of their children on the particular skill, and every family in

this condition received the same activity. The activity was most often similar to, if not identical to,




5
  While we explicitly informed parents that the tip was based on their child’s formative assessment
performance, we did not explicitly indicate to parents that “beginning,” “growing,” “solid,” and
“advanced” were terms that indicated a child’s performance along a continuum of skill levels.
Parents could have deduced the implied meaning of these words if their child fell in different
groups over time, across skills. This was the case for almost all parents. Only 1 child was
consistently in a group throughout the experiment.
6
  There may be an effect of receiving one extra text per week, in addition to the personalization
and differentiation. In other work, we are explicitly testing the effect of receiving more TIPS
during the week. In one treatment arm recipients received a FACT/TIP/GROWTH program akin
to the general program in this study. In another treatment arm recipients received a
FACT/TIP/TIP/TIP/GROWTH program. Preliminary results show no differences in outcomes but
survey responses were slightly less positive for the group that received five texts. These results
indicate that the extra text received in this outcome likely did not affect academic outcomes and
may have slightly attenuated survey results (Cortes et al 2017). Results available on request.


                                                                                     Page 12 of 52
the activity given to families in one of the middle two groups in the differentiated and personalized

text treatment. This treatment condition is directly analogous to the original texting experiment.

Figures 1 and A1 (in the online appendix) give examples of the general texts.

        (3) Control Text Condition: Families in the control condition received one text, every other

week, with information about the school district. The two examples presented in Figure 1 provide

information on emergency preparedness and on how the food in SFUSD is prepared.

For all conditions, parents could choose to receive the texts in English, Spanish, or Chinese.

4. Data and Empirical Strategy

4a. Data and Sample

       The initial sample included 504 children and families from the original experiment and 290

newly recruited children and families. These 794 students were randomized into one of the three

conditions and received texts from October 2014 through August 2015. We collected three primary

sources of outcome data on these children. In May 2015, we surveyed the kindergarten teachers of

all the children in the study. We asked questions regarding how well the teacher knew the parents

of the children, how often parents talked to the teacher, how often parents asked questions

regarding specific academic skills, and how well the child performed on specific academic skills.

Teachers were not informed of the treatment status of individual children so as not to bias the

results. Each teacher received $50 for completing the survey.

       In September 2015, after texting was complete, we sent parents enrolled in the program a

post-survey. We asked questions regarding their attitudes towards building literacy skills in their

children, how often they engaged in specific learning activities with their children, how often they

interacted with their children’s teacher, and how they viewed the texts they received. We also

compensated parents $50 for completing the survey.




                                                                                    Page 13 of 52
       Finally, we use the fall first grade administration of the Fountas and Pinnell Benmark

Assessment System (BAS) as a measure of children’s academic skills. The BAS is a formative

assessment tool that has been shown to be a valid assessment of literacy development in children

(Fountas and Pinnell 2012). Teachers first assess the ability of children to recognize upper-case

and lower-case letters, letter sounds, initial word sounds, 25 high frequency words, rhyme, blend

sounds into words, and demonstrate early literacy behaviors. After mastering six of the eight

foundational skills children are asked to read books of increasing difficulty. The teacher begins

with the easiest books, level A. After the child reads with sufficient accuracy and comprehension,

they move on to harder books (levels B-Z). A teacher stops after reaching a book that the child

cannot read with sufficient accuracy and comprehension. In kindergarten, most children are still

mastering foundational skills, while in first grade the vast majority of children are reading books

of varying difficulty. The texts are therefore primarily differentiated based on a child’s

performance on the eight foundational skills listed above. The outcome of interest is whether

children are reading more complex books in the fall of first grade and whether they reach

development benchmarks set forth by Fountas and Pinnell.

       Of the 794 participating families, teachers provided information on 442 (56% response

rate) students, 519 families responded to the survey (65% response rate), and 641 students

completed the fall first grade BAS (81% assessment rate). The 153 students who do not have

assessment data left the district. This level of mobility in the early grades is not uncommon. Only

28 children that we recruited in the beginning of the year left during the year or in transition to

first grade. The remaining 125 children are from the original cohort recruited during SFUSD’s

prekindergarten enrollment process. These students left the district between enrolling for

prekindergarten and transitioning to first grade. To obtain the final analytical sample we restrict




                                                                                  Page 14 of 52
the sample to those parents who answered enough baseline survey questions to construct three

measures of their pre-treatment characteristics. The baseline survey was designed to measure three

constructs: baseline child skills, baseline frequency of literacy activities in the home, and

background characteristics of the parent. To get a measure of each construct, we estimated a graded

response model separately on each subsection of the survey. Graded response models (GRMs) are

used frequently in survey analysis with Likert-type items, and provide an estimate for all

respondents of where they fall along the construct of interest, termed their “ability” estimate. We

selected GRMs over factor analysis due to their ability to produce estimates in the presence missing

data, avoiding imputation (Samejima 1997). We use these ability estimates, rather than the

individual questions, as control variables in our analyses.

       In the end, we have three analytic samples. The final parent survey sample consists of 475

families, the teacher survey sample consists of 409 children, and the BAS sample consists of 578

children. We check to ensure that attrition and pre-treatment covariates remain balanced in all

samples. Finally, we merge this data to district administrative data on student background

characteristics such gender, ethnicity, and date of birth.

       Table 1 presents the descriptive statistics on each analytic sample. Though there are slight

differences among samples, the demographics are largely similar. Panel A presents the

characteristics of children in the sample. Looking at the academic outcome sample, 51% of the

children are male. The two largest ethnicities are Hispanic (35%) and Asian (33%), with fewer

white children (7%) and children from other ethnicities (19%). The average age in the sample is

5.4 years old. At baseline parents rated their children 3 out of 4 in letter knowledge and a 3 out of

5 in letter sounds and rhyming, on average. In comparison, the broader SFUSD kindergarten cohort

has more white students (14 percent) and fewer Hispanic and Asian students (27 percent and 23




                                                                                   Page 15 of 52
percent, respectively). Both samples, however, have approximately the same proportion of males,

students from other ethnicities, and students of approximately the same age.

       Panel B presents descriptive statistics on the parents. Most have less than a bachelor’s

degree (65%) and are on average 34 years old. Over half (53%) chose to receive the text messages

in English, with fewer choosing to receive them in Spanish (26%) and Chinese (22%). A little less

than half the sample (42%) is new to the program this year. On average parents rated themselves

between 2.8 and 3 out of 4 when asked how frequently they engage in literacy activities with the

child. The texting program primarily served non-white and lower-income families.

4b. Empirical Strategy

       We use the following model to estimate the effect of the texting program on student and

family outcomes:

   (1) !"# = β' + β) *+,+-./0+12"# + β3 4+-56,./78+90+12"# + :"# β; + α# + ε"#

In Equation 1 we regress an outcome Yis for student, i, in school, s, on GeneralTextis, an indicator

for receiving the general literacy texts, PersonalizedTextis, an indicator for receiving differentiated

and personalized texts, Xis, a vector of baseline characteristics, and as, a school fixed effect. eis is

a stochastic error term. Xis contains an indicator for receiving the texts in English, Spanish, or

Chinese, the child’s gender, ethnicity, age in years, and factors of baseline survey questions on

literacy skills and rates of home literacy activities. Randomization occurred within school site, and

the school fixed effect, as, is the school site where randomization took place. For children in their

second year of the experiment this is their prekindergarten school site and for children in their first

year of the experiment this is their kindergarten school site. First or second year status does not

vary within randomization school sites. We therefore do not include an indicator for being new to

the experiment in Xis. The coefficients of interest are b1 and b2, which provide estimates of the



                                                                                      Page 16 of 52
effect of receiving general and personalized and differentiated texts, respectively, on the outcome

of interest. The omitted group in this case is the control group. We cluster all standard errors at the

randomization site level.

         In supplementary analyses, we replace the indicator for receiving general texts with an

indicator for receiving any literacy text, AnyLiteracyTextis, which is equal to one for students in

either the general text treatment or the differentiated and personalized text treatment. All other

elements of the equation remain the same. In this specification, b2 provides an estimate of the

effect of the personalization and differentiation, relative to the effect of receiving general text

messages. In an effort to be parsimonious, we do not present the results of this model. Its main

advantage is that it indicates whether the difference in effects between the general text messages

and the personalized and differentiated text messages are statistically significant. We reference the

significance in the body of the paper when relevant.7

         The outcomes, Yis, are the individual teacher and parent survey questions and the reading

level of the child as measured by the BAS. To reduce the number of outcomes from the surveys

we use exploratory factor analysis to determine which questions measure the same underlying

construct. The questions in the parent survey load onto four separate factors: (1) a parent belief

factor regarding the ease of building literacy skills including the support they feel in building those

skills, (2) a literacy activity factor capturing the frequency with which the parents engage in

literacy activities with their child, (3) a teacher factor regarding the frequency with which parents

interact with their child’s teacher, and (4) a text factor regarding parental attitudes to the texting

program. In creating the final factors, we used principal components analysis and rotated the

loading matrix to create orthogonal factors. For the teacher survey, we took the analogous



7
    Results are available upon request


                                                                                     Page 17 of 52
questions from the parent survey and created a teacher version of that factor, so that the two are

directly comparable. Table A1 in the online appendix presents each question contained in each of

these factors and the weighting of the elements variables for each of these factors.

4c. Randomization Checks

        The covariates are largely balanced between treatment and control for each analytic

sample. Table A2 in the online appendix presents these results for 14 covariates tested in each of

the three samples, for a total of 42 tests. No variable in the parent survey sample was significantly

unbalanced. In the teacher survey sample, one variable was unbalanced at the 10 percent level

(male) and one variable was unbalanced at the 5 percent level (white). In the academic sample,

one variable was unbalanced at the 1 percent level (white). The rate of imbalance is about what

one would expect to occur by chance in the parent survey and academic samples, but is a little

higher in the teacher survey sample. All our main specifications include covariates and we present

all results with and without covariates. For all outcomes, addition of the covariates does little to

change the point estimates, and ultimately does not change our inferences, providing an indication

that imbalance is not a concern in this study.

        We also test whether students differentially left the analytic samples. Table 2 shows that,

overall, we do not find evidence that students differentially attrited from the parent survey sample

or the academic sample. Attrition is marginally significant for the personalization and

differentiation treatment arm in the teacher sample (-7.5 percentage points). We further check to

see whether measurably different children left the sample. Appendix Table A3 in the online

appendix shows no imbalance in the academic and parent survey samples, but older students are

marginally less likely to attrit from the general texting group in teacher survey sample. Because

the point estimates on the overall attrition is larger (and marginally significant) and the attrition by




                                                                                      Page 18 of 52
age is marginally imbalanced in the teacher sample, we implement Lee (2009) style bounds on the

teacher survey sample as a robustness check.

5. Main Results

        Tables 3 through 5 present the main results of the intervention and show that the

differentiated and personalized texts had positive effects. Table 3 presents the results on the fall

first grade Fountas and Pinnell BAS. Panel A shows the effects of the program on the reading level

of children, with level A being the easiest book and level Z being hardest book. A small minority

of children (8%) were not yet reading. We analyze the results in three ways. First,

we capitalize on the ordinal nature of the reading scale and use ordinal logit models. To aid the

interpretability of the results we create a standardized, linear scale from the reading levels and

present results as effect sizes. We also present the results of linear probability models that show

the effect on the probability of reading at level A, C, E, or G and above. Level A indicates that the

child is first able to read, and levels C, E, and G represent the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles of the

reading distribution. Panel B presents the effects of the program on the probability of meeting

district benchmarks. These benchmarks track the Fountas and Pinnell recommended benchmarks.

Levels C, D, and E are the cutoffs for approaches, meets, and exceeds expectations.             The

academic results indicate that differentiated and personalized text messages had a significant effect

on the reading ability of children while the general texts did not. Children whose parents received

the differentiated and personalized texts messages were 63 percent more likely than the control

group to move up a reading level (p<0.001). This estimate translates to an 18 percent of standard

deviation increase in reading level (p<0.05). These children were also 8.84 percentage points

(p<0.05) more likely to read at level E or above, were 12.05 percentage points (p<0.001) more




                                                                                       Page 19 of 52
likely to exceed expectations, and 9.00 percentage points (p<0.01) more likely to meet or exceed

expectations.

        Tables 4 and 5 present the survey results which give clues to the mechanisms underlying

the academic results. We present the results of the factors of survey questions in Panel A, as well

as the results of individual questions in Panels B and C. Table A1 in the online appendix gives all

questions that compose each factor. Table 4 shows that overall the texting program had limited

effects on parent beliefs towards activities and building academic skills in their children. The

program had the greatest effects on parent ratings of how easy it is to build literacy skills in their

children. The general texting treatment caused a marginally significant, 27 percent of a standard

deviation reduction in parent ratings on the extent to which they feel building literacy skills is

easy. The differentiated and personalized intervention significantly mitigated these negative

effects. Parents in the personalized treatment group responded 32 percent of a standard deviation

(p<0.05) more positively than parents in the general treatment group. These results are consistent

with the notion that knowledge of a child’s skill level, with an appropriately differentiated activity,

can positively affect parent beliefs. If general text messages were unaligned a child’s skill level

and too hard for parents, they could cause parents to believe that building literacy skills is difficult.

        The program had a stronger effect on the frequency with which parents engaged in home

literacy activities. Panel C of Table 4 shows that the greatest effects are in reading words with

children, taking books when leaving the house, reviewing parts of a book, reviewing the direction

of reading, correcting mistakes while reading, and practicing rhyming, with effect sizes ranging

from 24 to 37 percent of a standard deviation. Differentiation and personalization drove

some of these results. When combining all activities questions into a factor, Panel A of Table 4

shows that that general texts had a positive, but insignificant point estimate of 14 percent of a




                                                                                       Page 20 of 52
standard deviation and that personalized texts had a significant 26 percent of a standard deviation

(p<0.05) effect on home activities compared to the control group. We do not have the power to

separate a differentiation and personalization effect from a base texting effect for this composite

variable.

       Table 5 presents the results of the intervention on parent involvement at school both from

the parent perspective (Panel B) and the teacher perspective (Panel C). From the parent

perspective, the largest effect is seen on how well they know their child’s teacher and how often

they inquire about how their child is getting along with other children. Columns 3 and 4 indicate

that, compared to the control group, the general texts increased each of those two dimensions by

26 percent of a standard deviation (p<0.05) but the personalized texts did not have a significant

effect. The differentiated and personalization aspect of the treatment marginally significantly

decreased the positive effect on knowing the teacher generated by the general texts by 21 percent

of a standard deviation when compared to the general text message group. The remainder of the

estimates shows that the general texts increased specific questions parents asked teachers by about

10 to 20 percent of a standard deviation. The frequency with which parents talk to teachers about

their child’s interests and literacy skills reach marginal significance. The point estimates on the

personalized and differentiated treatment in Table 5 are generally of equal magnitude or smaller

compared to the general texts. Only one question, the frequency with which parents ask how well

their child is doing in school reaches marginal significance with a point estimate of 17 percent of

a standard deviation. When combining these measures into one factor in Panel A the pattern

remains. General texts have a larger effect on teacher interactions of 23 percent of standard

deviation (p<0.10), while personalized texts had a smaller, insignificant effect of 11 percent of a

standard deviation.




                                                                                  Page 21 of 52
       The results are fairly consistent when analyzing the same questions from the teacher

perspective. Column 3 of Panel C in Table 5 shows that the general text treatment had positive

effects on parents talking to their child’s teacher about their child’s interest literacy skills, and

home activities with effect sizes of 23 percent of a standard deviation (p<0.10), 25 percent of a

standard deviation (p<0.10) and 28 percent of a standard deviation (p<0.05) respectively. The

remainder of the point estimates are generally positive, but not significant. Column 4 however

shows that the point estimates on the personalized texts are negative, with the effect on teachers

knowing the parents reaching a marginally significant -26 percent of standard deviation. The

differentiation and personalization texts lead to an estimated 32 to 43 percent of a standard

deviation less positive effect for many questions when compared to the general text messages. This

negative effect is also seen in the composite of the teacher reports in Panel A. The point estimates

indicate that the personalization of the texts may have induced parents to talk to teachers less when

compared with the general text messages and mute any gains in teacher interactions generated by

the general text messages. These results, as well as the results from the parent questions, are

plausible if the greater amount of information regarding the child skill level, in combination with

greater success in implementing the differentiated literacy activity, produced less of an incentive

to talk to the teacher regarding how their child is progressing in school.8




8
   The more positive reports of teacher interactions from parents of the personalized and
differentiated group when compared to the teacher reports on the same questions may indicate that
social desirability bias is greater for personalized and differentiated text recipients. While this is a
possibility, this phenomenon would further support the assertion that parents are interacting with
the content of the texts. In addition, the larger effects of the personalized and differentiated texts
on academic outcomes indicate that larger survey point estimates are not completely driven by
social desirability bias and parents are, in fact, engaging in activities to a greater extent compared
to the general texting group.


                                                                                      Page 22 of 52
        Despite the potential decreases in interaction with the school, the greater extent to which

parents engaged in activities in the personalization and differentiation group likely led to the

academic advantages seen in Table 3. Unclear, however, is whether the knowledge that the texts

were personalized engendered a greater fidelity to the program, whether updating parent beliefs

about the child’s skill caused a more efficient allocation of resources to the child, or whether a

closer match between the difficulty of the texts and the skill level of the child led to greater success

in carrying out the tips and established a positive, recursive feedback mechanism that encouraged

parents to continue to engage in the texts. Parents in both groups may have interacted with the

activities in similar ways and the closer alignment of the differentiated text to the child itself may

have been the sole cause of the increased academic skills.

        Though we cannot definitively identify which mechanisms are at play, responses to

questions that elicited parental attitudes towards the text messages can provide some clues. Table

6 provides these results. We asked parents the extent to which they thought the texts were made

for them and their children. Interestingly, there is little difference in response between the two

groups that received the treatment texts. Both sets of parents reported the texts were made for their

children to a much higher degree than the control group, with effect sizes around 40 percent of a

standard deviation (p<0.001). Personalized and differentiated texts message did not elicit a greater

response on this dimension. These results indicate that parents in the personalization and

differentiation group did not see the text messages as more tailored to their child. Without this

realization, personalization likely did not induce parents to adhere to the program more faithfully,




                                                                                      Page 23 of 52
nor were they likely to more efficiently allocate resources to their children after receiving

information on their child’s skill level. 9

        We see greater differences in point estimates when we asked parents to what extent they

used the texts, thought the texts were helpful, and would recommend the texts. In the case of using

and recommending texts, the personalized and differentiated texts had a 29 and 23 percent of a

standard deviation effect, respectively (p<0.05), while the general text messages had positive, but

insignificant effect. In the case of the texts being helpful, both groups reported a significant effect

compared to the control group. For each of those three questions the personalized and

differentiated group effects were about 15 percent of a standard deviation higher than the general

texting group, though we do not have the power to determine if this difference is significant.

Though we must be extremely cautious in interpreting insignificant differences, these results do

not eliminate the possibility that a greater success the personalized and differentiated text messages

caused parents to engage with the program more faithfully.

6. Heterogeneity of Results

        Prior research on social information experiments indicates that the effects of such

interventions can vary significantly by baseline characteristics. Allcott (2011) demonstrates that

providing families with information on their neighbor’s energy usage will, on average, decrease

their own energy use. Perhaps predictably, the effects are concentrated on the highest pre-

intervention energy users, with no effects seen on the lowest pre-intervention energy users. Gerber

and Rogers (2009) illustrate that presenting voters with a script that frames an upcoming election

as a “high turnout” election will, on average, induce people to vote more compared to a script that




9
 There is no effect of the program on the rate with which the texts were read, indicating that all
parents received the texts and even the control group read the texts.


                                                                                     Page 24 of 52
frames the election as a “low turnout” election. They present evidence that the intervention was

more effective for participants who voted less frequently in prior elections. Beshears et al. (2015)

present a more nuanced result and show that the same intervention can have opposite effects

depending on where participants fell in the baseline distribution. Their intervention provided social

behavior regarding 401(k) savings and found that the intervention encouraged those who were

previously contributing at high rates to save more, but discouraged those who were not previously

saving much from contributing to their plans.

        We analyze heterogeneity by the baseline skill distribution.10,11 Specifically we estimate

the effects of the intervention separately on students who fall in the middle two quartiles of the

baseline skill distribution and on students who fall in the tails of the distribution. To do this analysis

we must restrict the sample to those families who are new to the program. York, Loeb and Doss

(2017) showed that texting in the first year positively affected pre-literacy skills. Because we are

retaining the control group in this analysis, there will be a positive correlation between fall

kindergarten test scores and texting treatment status for those families in the second year of the

program.




10
   We also have analyzed the results by texting language. Splitting the sample into three languages
greatly reduces the power to detect effects. Generally, the children of the parents receiving texts
in Chinese saw the greatest academic gains. Results available upon request.
11
   We find little heterogeneity in academic outcomes by year of participation in the program. Both
sets of families benefited to about the same extent, with differentiation and personalization driving
the results. Effects are slightly higher for first year families, but are not significantly different than
effects on returning families. If the first-year participants saw larger effects, this could be a result
of texting fatigue in second-year participants. If this program was rolled out to a new, comparable,
population of recipients we might expect to see slightly larger effects. However, because the
inferences remain stable between years, we would expect personalization and differentiation to
provides benefits regardless of whether participants received texts in the previous year. Academic
results by length of time in the program are shown in Table A4 in the online appendix.


                                                                                        Page 25 of 52
        Previous results provide some evidence that the differentiation of the texts is driving the

results. If this were the case, one would expect the effects to be concentrated on the tails of the

distribution where differentiation is greatest. General texts most often corresponded to texts sent

to either the second or third quartile. It is also possible that parents at the tails of the distribution

respond to the personalization more strongly. In this case, the effects are unclear ex ante. On one

hand the personalization may have greater effects on the tails of the distribution if parents are

particularly motivated by signals that their child is doing relatively well or poorly. Similarly, the

intervention could have smaller, or negative, effects at tails of the distribution if parents on the low

end of the distribution are discouraged by the knowledge that their child is doing relatively poorly,

or if parents at the top of the distribution feel less compelled to engage in the activities after

learning their child is already advanced.

        Table 7 shows the results of the heterogeneity analysis on the academic outcomes.12,13

Panel A presents effects on the middle two quartiles and Panel B presents the effects on the first

and fourth quartiles. Column 3 of Panel A in Table 7 shows that there is a marginally statistically

significant effect of the general texts on the probability of meeting or exceeding expectations of

17.13 percentage points (p<0.10). Differentiation and personalization, however, produce no

differential effect with a quantitatively similar coefficient in Column 4. Meanwhile neither

treatment texting intervention had a detectable effect on the probability of approaching

expectations or exceeding expectations. The ordinal logit model is imprecisely estimated. The

results are quite different in Panel B, which presents results for families whose children are in the

   Sample sizes are too small to draw conclusions from the parent and teacher survey samples.

    Table A5 in the online appendix presents descriptive statistics on the sample by quartile.
Families of children in the lower quartiles were more likely to be Hispanic and less likely to be
Asian and white. Parents rated their children lower on baseline skills and reported engaging in
literacy activities less frequently in the home. They were also less educated.


                                                                                       Page 26 of 52
first and fourth quartiles of baseline academic skills. Column 3 and 4 indicate that the general texts

had no effect on the academic skills of the children, but differentiation and personalization had a

large effect on the probability of exceeding expectations and on the ordinal logit. Differentiation

and personalization caused students to be 2.5 more likely to move up a reading level and increased

the probability of exceeding expectations by 21.5 percentage points (p<0.05).

        These results support the previously presented evidence that differentiation is a driver of

the results. Any positive feedback mechanism caused by a greater probability of success with the

texts is more likely to occur in the tails where differentiation is the greatest. Also possible,

however, is the fact that personalization may have been differentially effective for families in the

tails of the baseline skill distribution. If parents did not previously realize their child was

performing relatively poorly, the new information may have spurred them to more faithfully

adhere to the program. Similarly, receiving positive feedback on their child’s performance may

have encouraged parents at the top of the distribution to build on that success by engaging in the

texts to a greater extent.

7. Comparisons with the First Year of the Program

        Though there is ample evidence that the personalization and differentiation of the texts

provided academic benefits above the general texting curriculum and the control group, the general

text messaging curriculum produced no discernable benefits. Table A4 in the online appendix

indicates this is the case for both cohorts of participants in the program. At first, this may seem

inconsistent with the results from the prekindergarten experiment which estimated that a general

texting curriculum can increase preliteracy skills by 10 percent of a standard deviation (York,

Loeb, and Doss 2017). A deeper look at the results shows that the first cohort of students in the

prekindergarten experiment, which subsequently participated in this follow-up experiment, saw no




                                                                                    Page 27 of 52
significant effect of the general program on preliteracy skills. The general effects on the full

population are driven by the second cohort of students that received a combination program.14

However, both cohorts of the prekindergarten experiment saw large gains for students below the

baseline prekindergarten skills distribution. In both years, those children experienced a 30 percent

of a standard deviation increase in preliteracy skills. This result provides evidence that general

texting programs may be most effective for weaker students.

       To probe this question with a direct comparison, we take the students that we followed

from the prekindergarten experiment and look at the fall first grade outcomes by baseline of the

prekindergarten skills distribution. Sample sizes limit any firm conclusions but the pattern of point

estimates indicates that the general texting program may have been more effective for students

below the median of skills. Panel A of Table 8 shows that point estimates for the general text

condition are large and equal in magnitude to the personalized and differentiated condition. Panel

B shows that for students above the median, the point estimates are for the general texting

condition are zero or even negative. Again, one must be very cautious in interpreting insignificant

point estimates, but the pattern is consistent with the notion that general text messaging curricula

benefit weaker students at baseline. Table 7 shows that for students at the tails of the distribution,

the effect of personalization and differentiation is largest for the probability of exceeding

expectations. This finding further suggests that general texts may be too easy for advanced

students, and the differentiation ameliorated this mismatch. This evidence, however, is purely

suggestive and we cannot preclude the possibility that elements of the prekindergarten program



14
  We hypothesize that the combined program may impart greater benefits because switching
between domains may be more effective at maintaining parents’ attention, there may be spillover
benefits to literacy by working on math and socio-emotional skills, and success in one domain may
encourage parents to continue when they experience difficulties in another domain.


                                                                                    Page 28 of 52
did not replicate. To that end we support replication of the results by providing the text messages

used in the prekindergarten experiment and this follow-up study.

8. Robustness Checks

       One threat to internal validity of a randomized control trial is differential attrition between

treatment and control groups. If different types of people are attriting from each condition our

results could be biased. Table 2 presented the overall probability of attrition in each of our models.

The probability of attrition is not significantly different in the academic and parent survey samples

and marginally significant in the teacher survey sample. We further assessed if there was

differential attrition status by covariate and found some imbalance in the teacher survey sample

(Table A3 in the online appendix). Because the teacher survey has the greatest amount of attrition,

we engage in a Lee (2009) style bounding exercise for that sample of students. Point estimates

indicate that fewer people attrited from the two treatment groups. We therefore calculate a

trimming proportion, p, for each treatment arm, compared to the control group. We then trim each

treatment arm at their respective pth and 1-pth quantile. Re-running our models on these trimmed

samples will provide our upper and lower bounds, respectively.

       Table 9 presents the results of this bounding exercise. Column 1 and 2 (bolded) present the

original estimates from Columns 3 and 4 of Panel C of Table 5. Comparing the original and upper

bound estimates, little changed. The effects on the base text treatment remain positive, become

slightly larger in magnitude, and become more significant. Coefficients on the differentiated and

personalized text messages generally become slightly more positive (or less negative) but their

lack of significance remains. In our lower bound estimates, all point estimates become predictably

more negative. Point estimates from the general text messaging arm become insignificant and near




                                                                                    Page 29 of 52
zero or slightly negative. Estimates for the differentiated and personalized arm become more

negative, and in some cases, significant.

       Recall our general conclusion was that there was evidence that the general texting treatment

increased parental-teacher contact, but that the differentiation and personalization treatment arm

mitigated that effect. The upper bound estimates provide more robust evidence for this inference,

while the lower bound estimates indicate that, at worst, the general texts did not affect parent-

teacher interaction, and the differentiated and personalized text messages may have significantly

decreased interactions. Importantly, the effect of differentiation and personalization relative to the

general texting program remains the same in all three estimates. Our overall conclusion therefore

remains the same: relative to the general texting program, differentiation and personalization

resulted in less parent-teacher contact. This substitution may be due to the greater amount of

information contained in the differentiated and personalized texts. The general texts most likely

had positive effect on these interactions, though in our most extreme robustness checks they could

have had null results.

9. Discussion and Conclusions

       In this study, we demonstrate that a low-cost personalized literacy texting intervention can

substantially affect student academic outcomes above and beyond a general texting program.

Specifically, the differentiation and personalization of the messages caused children to be 63

percent more likely to move up a reading level. Tailoring instruction based on formative

assessments has previously been associated with increased student learning in K-12 classrooms

(Kulik and Kulik 1984, 1992; Bergen and Sladeczek 1991; Black and William 1998a, 1998b), but

this is the first study to show that this approach can also improve parent-child academic

interactions. Further, this study provides evidence that text messaging interventions can do more




                                                                                    Page 30 of 52
than merely maintain parents’ attention or “nudge” behaviors via reminders. The significant effects

of personalization on parent and student outcomes indicate that parents interact with, and absorb

the content of the messages as well. This finding supports our hypothesis that the original

READY4K! program was effective because it took the complex task of parenting and broke it

down into small and easy tasks that were meant to fit into daily life and capitalize on everyday

objects.

       There are several mechanisms through which the additional gains seen in this study could

have been realized. We hypothesized that personalization aspect of the texts could have

engendered more trust with the program which would lead to a greater uptake in the activities and

thus greater gains in literacy outcomes. Also possible is that information on child performance

embedded in the texts updated parental perception of their children’s ability and allowed them to

more efficiently allocate resources. Meanwhile, the differentiation of the messages helped to better

align the difficulty of the task with the child’s developmental ability, thus increasing the chance

that a parent could successfully engage in the activity with their child. This success may also

encourage parents to persist in the program. Finally, the behavior of the parent could have stayed

constant and the greater match between text difficulty and student ability could have led to the

achievement gains.

       Though we cannot definitively pinpoint which mechanisms are at play, survey results

indicated that parents in the two treatment text groups saw the texts as equally tailored to their

children. This result may indicate that they did not overtly recognize the personalization aspect of

the texts, precluding the possibility that personalization engendered more fidelity to the program

or that the parents updated their perceptions of their child skill level. More likely, the




                                                                                   Page 31 of 52
differentiation itself led to better outcomes and parents may have had more success in enacting the

differentiated activities, leading to a positive feedback loop.

        This hypothesis is further supported by our heterogeneity analysis, which indicates that the

effects of the differentiation and personalization were particularly concentrated at the tails of the

baseline skills distribution where differentiation of the texts was the greatest. There is some

evidence that this differentiation was particularly helpful for the higher performing children, as the

strongest effects were seen in the probability of exceeding expectations. One may be concerned

that the program may increase disparities if the those who were higher at baseline benefit the most

from this program. Children in the higher quartiles come from more advantaged families.

However, the initial study provided evidence that a general text messaging, with perhaps easier

activities, is more effective for children with weaker skills at baseline and the differentiation

ameliorated any mismatch between the difficulty of the texts and the skills of the more advanced

children. York, Loeb, and Doss (2017) show that the general preliteracy text messaging program

had stronger effects for children below the median of the skills distribution. We find suggestive

evidence that this occurred in this follow-up experiment as well. The personalization and

differentiation may merely improve an intervention that was not previously serving the more

academically advanced children in the sample.

        The parent and teacher surveys provide additional clues as to how the program changed

parent behavior. Parent survey results indicate that recipients of the general text messages thought

it was harder to build literacy skills in their children. If the program successfully caused parents to

engage in literacy based activities with their child, it is possible that parents realize how hard it is

to build academic skills in their children, particularly if the activity and the child’s skill level are

mismatched. The differentiated and personalized texts successfully mitigated this negative effect,




                                                                                      Page 32 of 52
indicating that the differentiating of the texts may have indeed aligned the child’s skill to the

activity. The one unanticipated result, however, is that parents in the differentiated and

personalized group appear to have substituted away from engaging with teachers.

       These results highlight that programs that break down complex tasks, such as building

skills in children, can be effective and produce positive outcomes, but that a mismatch between

the difficulty of the task and the ability of the parent and child to carry out that task can attenuate

any potential gains. Differentiation and personalization of these programs can extract larger gains

by minimizing these mismatches, and we demonstrate that even “light-touch” differentiation and

personalization based on extant data can generate these gains. The ease and ubiquity of text

messaging make it a nimble medium through which educational stakeholders can deliver this

differentiated and personalized interventions that minimize frictions caused by mismatch.

       Scaling the intervention can be particularly cost effective. The only additional costs over a

base texting program are the costs of organizing students into groups according to formative

assessment results, the costs of differentiating the activities, and the cost of one sending one extra

text message. With the use of current technology we can automate the assignment of students to

groups, such that the per-family cost of differentiating the tip tends towards zero as more families

are added to the program. The only cost that grows with membership is the texting cost, which is

very small compared to other interventions. Overall, differentiating and personalizing text-

message interventions based on formative assessment has the promise to produce additional

education gains with relatively little additional costs.

Note: Parents rated the letter knowledge of their child in one of four categories: 1=The child knows no letters, 2=Some,
3=Most, 4=All. Parents rated how well their child can produce letter sounds and rhyme in one of five categories: 1=Not
at all, 2=Not very well, 3=Somewhat well, 4=Well, 5=Very Well. Answer options for weekly parental activities and how
often the child asks to be read to include: 1=Not at all, 2=Once or twice per week, 3=Three to six times, 4=Every day.
Missing values set at the sample average. For families in first year of experiment the baseline survey questions were given
in September 2014. For families in the second year of the experiment the baseline survey questions were given in
September 2013. All child demographics are from San Francisco Unified School District administration files.

Note: Each pair of cells represents the results of a separate regression of the treatment effect on the relevant
academic outcome. Column headers indicate the model components. Row headers indicate the academic
outcome. A Graded Response Model was used to create the factors of baseline survey responses. Factors were
made from parent reports of parent age and education, parent reports of the child's knowledge of letters, letter
sounds, and rhyming, parents reports of the frequency with which the parent read to, told stories to, and sang to
their child, and parent reports of how often the child asks questions. N = 578 for all regressions. Source data are
district test files of the Fountas and Pinnell Benchmark Assessment System in fall of first grade. Standard errors

Note: Each pair of cells represents the results of a separate regression of the treatment effect on the relevant outcome. Row headers indicate the outcome. Column headers
indicate model components. All outcomes are standardized. Factor analysis was used to create the outcome factors. Upper and lower bound estimates were calculated by the
procedure recommended by Lee (2009). All models include randomization site fixed effects, controls for texting language, factors of baseline survey responses, and
administrative covariates. Covariates are detailed in Table 3. Source data in Panels A and C are the responses to teacher surveys fielded in May of 2015. Standard errors are
clustered at the randomization site level. +indicates p<0.10, *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001.

Note: Each pair of cells represents the results of a separate regression of the treatment effect on the relevant covariate. Column headers indicate the sample
and model components. The reference category is the control group. Row headers indicate the covariate tested. A Graded Response Model was used to
create the covariate factors. The literary skills factor was made from the parent ratings of the child's letter knowledge, letter sounds, and rhyming. The
home activities factor was made from parent reports of how often they read, told stories, and sang with their child, and how often the child asked to be
read to. The parent background factor was made with parent age and education. All regressions include randomization site fixed effects. Standard errors
are clustered at the randomization site level. Source data in Panels A and C are the responses to parent surveys fielded in August of 2015. Source data in
Panel B are San Francisco Unified School District Administrative Files. +indicates p<0.10, *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001
