       We model the invention of new technologies and their diffusion across countries. Our

model predicts that, eventually, all countries will grow at the same rate, with each country's

productivity ranking determined by how rapidly it adopts inventions. The common growth rate

depends on research efforts in all countries, while research effort is determined by how much

inventions earn at home and abroad. Patents affect the return to invention. We relate the

decision to patent an invention internationally to the cost of patenting in a country and to the

expected value of patent protection in that country. We can thus infer the direction and
magnitude of the international diffusion of technology from data on international patenting,

productivity, and research. We fit the model to data from the five leading research economies.

The parameters indicate how much tech logy flows between these countries and how much each

country earns from its inventions domestically and elsewhere. Our results imply that foreign

countries are important sources of technology even though countries earn most of their return to

innovation at home. For example, about half of U.S. productivity growth derives from foreign

technology yet U.S. investors earn 98 per cent of the revenue from their inventions domestically.

1 Introduction
A basic question is the role of technology in explaining productivity differences across countries.

One hypothesis is that technology is highly mobile across borders while capital is not. The
implication is that capital investment rather than technology explains differences in per capita

income. Another hypothesis is that capital is highly mobile internationally while countries are
slow to adopt foreign technology. In this case income differences derive from differences in the

rate at which different countries innovate and adopt inventions from elsewhere.2 To assess the

plausibility and quantitative implications of this second hypothesis we develop and implement
empirically a model of how and where inventions occur, how they diffuse domestically and
internationally, and how they give rise to increases in productivity.
    While economists have devoted substantial attention to measuring the degree of capital
mobility internationally, less is known about the international mobility of technology. The
problem is observing the creation of knowledge and its diffusion over time and across space.3

In this paper we exploit data on international patenting and research effort to infer the sources
   'Barro and Xala-I-Martin (1992) and Mankiw, Romer, end Weil (1992) pursue the empirical implications
of this hypothesis. Several puzzles are that: (1) the implied values of capitals share and of interestrate
differentials are implausibly large; (ii) levels of income per capita converge at rates that are too slow given

r.asonahle parameter values; (iii) the growth rates of total factor productivity, which take capital accumulation
into account, continue to exhibit convergence (Downick and Nguyen (1989) and HelliweU and Chung (1991));
(iv) technology appears to diffuse more rapidly domestically than acrce borders (Lichtenherg(1992)).
   2Gerschenkron (1962) interprets the comparative experiences of different European countries and Japan

during their industrial revolutions in terms of the diffusion of technology. Nelson and Phelps (1966), KrugTnan
                                                                                                    aix!
(1979), Connulka (1990), Groesmen and Helpinan (1991), Segeratrom (1991), Young (1993), and Parents
Prescott (1994), among others, provide alternative formalizations of international diffusion. Groarnsn and
Helpman (1994), Fagerbeng (1994), and Dinopoulos (1994) survey the literature.
   3Neverthelees, Pavitt and Soete (1982), Fagerberg (1987), Benhabib and Spiegel (1992), Coe and Help-
man (1993), and Evenson and Englander (1994) estimate international technology diffusion using alternative
approaches. We depart from these other studies in embedding technological diffusion, endogenous research
activity, and the patenting decision into an intertemporal general equilibrium framework.

and the spread of technological progress. Data on employment of R&D scientists and engineers

provide a measure of the inputs used to invent while data on international pnting indicate
where inventions occur and where their inventors think they might be adopted. However,

patenting measures technology diffusion only imperfectly and indirectly: Many inventions are
not patented at all, or at least not patented everywhere they are used, while many ideas that
are patented never constitute significant innovations. Moreover, the costs of patenting and the

benefit of protection vary across countries, both because of differences in patent laws and the

strength of protection, and because of differences in market size.4

     To address these problems we incorporate the inventor's decision to patent in different
countries into a model of research and technology diffusion. The model identifies features of
an invention and characteristics of national economies and patent systems that determine the
return to patenting. We can thus isolate the role of technology diffusion in the patenting
decision.

    In our model, production in each country, as in Grossman and Helpman (1991), uses a fixed

continuum of inputs to make a homogeneous output. Researchers in each country search for

inputs of higher quality that potentially can be used anywhere in the world. We follow Kortum

(1994) in assuming that researchers draw from a given distribution of ideas of different quality.

Variation in the quality of ideas explains why inventors seek patent protection for some ideas

in many countries while others are protected in only one country or not at all.5
    Ideas are adopted in different countries with a lag that can vary according both to where
the idea originates and to where it is used.6 Since the processes of invention and of production

are intimately linked, the diffusion of ideas domestically may be much more rapid than their

their degree of "technological congruence".

diffusion across borders, but our model does not impose this ordering a priori.
   An idea constitutes an innovation i.n a country if it surpasses the state of the art there. As

the distribution of technology in a country advances, a smaller fraction of ideas are innovations.

An implication is that a less inventive country will eventually grow at the same rate as more
inventive ones since it is able to draw more innovations from the "technology gap" between
itself and others. The technology gaps between countries that sustain a common growth rate
determine long-run relative productivity levels.
   We incorporate the patenting decision into our model of invention and diffusion as follows:

We assume that if an idea constitutes an innovation in a country then the inventor appropriates

the rent it earns there as long as (1) no better invention has rendered it obsolete and (2) it
has not been successfully imitated. Patent protection reduces the hazard of imitation. It need
not provide perfect protection from imitation, nor is imitation necessarily immediate if the
inventor fails to patent.
   The rate at which an idea diffuses to a country is unaffected by the inventor's decision to
patent there. At the same time, more rapid diffusion into a country increases the incentive to
patent there since the rewards will be achieved sooner. Patent protection nevertheless does
have real effects in that it influences the return to R&D.
   At the time of invention, the inventor knows the absolute quality of the idea but not how
much, if any, it advances the state of the art in different countries. Hence the inventor must
decide whether or not to apply for a patent in a country without knowing how much the idea
will ever earn there. Inventors will patent some ideas widely and others in few places, or
nowhere at all. Some unpatented ideas may someday significantly advance the state of the
art, while some widely-patented ideas will turn out to be duds. An inventor will seek wider
protection for a high-quality idea, since it is more likely to be an innovation.

   Our model identifies market size, the cost of patenting, the strength of intellectual property

protection, the average level of productivity, and, most critical for our analysis, the speed at

                                                3
which the country can absorb ideas into its technology as characteristics of a country relevant

to the patent decision.7
    We fit the steady state of our model to data on growth, relative productivities, research
scientists and engineers, and international patenting from the five major research economies:
France, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States. We decompose growth
in output per worker in each of the five countries into what is contributed by innovations
from each of the five. We also decompose earnings from innovations in each country into
what emanates from each of the five. We find that foreign countries are important sources of
technology even though countries earn most of their return to innovation domestically. For

example, nearly half of U.S. productivity growth derives from foreign technology. Nevertheless,
U.S. inventors earn 98 per cent of the revenues from their inventions at home, We conclude
with several simulation experiments. Eliminating diffusion between the United States and the
rest of the world, for example, would lower world growth by almost half a percentage point
and leave the United States far behind the other four. At the other extreme, if diffusion were

as rapid between countries as within them then world growth would be 2.3 percentage points

higher than the base case level. We find that patent protection has only a modest impact on

growth.
    We proceed as follows: In section 2 below we present the model and then, in section 3,
characterize its steady state. In section 4 we parameterize the steady state with data from
the five leading research economies. In section 5 we decompose the sources of growth and the

returns to innovation among these countries, and offer the results of the simulation of several
alternative scenarios that allow for different rates of international technology diffusion and

poor country, however. A country is likely to be poor precisely because it adopts innovations slowly, reducing
the return to patenting there.

different levels of intellectual property protection. Section 6 offers some concluding remarks.



2 The Model
Since our model is intricate, we review its components before describing each in detaiL Pro-

duction of output, described in section 2.1, combines a continuum of inputs of varying quality,
which are themselves produced by labor. An alternative activity for workers is doing research

to come up with ideas for better inputs. Section 2.2 describes how ideas are produced and
how they disseminate. A key variable describing a country at any moment is the stock of
ideas that have reached it up to that point. Our assumptions about production and diffusion
imply a relationship between this stock of knowledge and the distribution of technologies in
the country. Section 2.3 derives this distribution and its dynamics. In 2.4 we show how labor
productivity relates to the stock of ideas through the implied distribution of technologies.
   We make assumptions about market structure, with implications for pricing and firm profit,
which we discuss in 2.5. These assumptions also have implications, which we turn to in 2.6,
about the value of having an innovation adopted in a country, depending on whether or not
it is patented. We can thus infer the return to patenting in a country, and relate the decision
to patent an idea to the quality of the idea, the speed of diffusion, the cost of patenting, and
market size. This we do in 2.7. Putting these things together we then calculate, in 2.8, the
the expected value of an idea, incorporating the optimal patenting decision in each country.
   The value of ideas determines the return to doing R&D while labor productivity determines
the opportunity cost of this activity. In 2.9 and 2.10 we relate the two to solve for the
equilibrium amount of R&D effort and the wage.




                                               5
2.1 Production
We consider a world consisting of n = 1,. . . , N countries. Output in country n (Y) is pro-

duced by combining intermediate inputs subject to a constant-returns-to-scale Cobb-Douglas

production function,
                               ln(Yt/J) =
                                              J_1jhi[zntu)x(i)]di,
where X(j)    is the quantity of input j produced at time tin country n and Z(j) is the quality
of that input. (See the Appendix for a list of symbols.) The range of inputs is fixed over time
and the same across countries. Output is homogeneous and tradable across countries, while
inputs are nontraded.8 We choose units so that to produce any input at rate x requires local
labor services at rate x. Productivity differences across countries result from differences in the

quality of inputs.
    Within a country, the quality of inputs improves over time. These improvements derive
from research performed both domestically and abroad.


2.2 Ideas
An idea is our basic unit of research output. While we assume that all workers in each country

are equally productive producing goods, we allow workers to differ in their productivities as

researchers. In particular, we assume that in country n with a total labor force of L, if
workers are ranked according to their productivity as researchers, a worker of rank j produces

ideas at a stochastic rate antfi(t)'. The parameter                    reflects the overall productivity
of researchers in country n at time t while          reflects the rate at which research productivity
declines as less talented workers become researchers. We assume that workers are compensated
   •By assuming & single, homogeneous tradable output we prevent inventions from having any efft on the
terms of trade between countries. While it would be interesting to consider the implications of invention. for
the terms of trade, we pru1ude the possibility here in order to foct purely on the implications of innovation
for productivity.



                                                     6
in proportion to their productivity in either production or research. Hence the workers who
are the most productive at doing research will become researchers. Thus if R,, workers in
country n at time t are doing research, they will create ideas at a rate atL'R.
    There are several dimensions to an idea: its quality, its sector of use, and the time until it
diffuses to each country. An idea's quality is a random variable Q drawn from the cumulative

distribution function, F(q) = Pr[Q <q]. The quality of an idea is common to all countries to
which it diffuses. We assume a Pareto distribution of qualities, F(q) = 1 —                   qB
    An idea applies to only one out of the continuum of inputs. The input j to which the idea
applies is drawn from the uniform distribution on [0, f].10

    Ideas, even good ideas, do not diffuse immediately. Let r be the random diffusion lag. If
an idea is discovered at time t in country i then it diffuses to country n at time t + r,,, for
n = 1,2,... ,N. We assume that the marginal distribution of the diffusion lag from country i
to country n is exponential with parameter e,,,              i.e.   Pr[r x] =      1 —            Thus       is the
speed of diffusion from country i to country n and e' is the mean diffusion lag.
    We distinguish between the concepts of diffusion and adoption. While every idea will

eventually diffuse to every other country (if the ,,j's are strictly positive) many ideas will
never be adopted because they are not useful. Some ideas are not useful even when they are

invented while other ideas are no longer useful by the time they have diffused.
   9Bental and Peled (1992) and Kortuni (1994) 1o use the Pareto distribution to characterize the pool
of undiscovered techniques from which researchers draw. The Pareto distribution has the convenient feature
that, if we truncate the distribution at some level z, then the random variable Q/z ( 1) inherits the Pareto
distribution. Thus, if a new idea is better than current beet practice (say z) then the distribution of the inventive
step (Q/z) does not depend on the level of the best practice that is surpassed
  10We ignore the possibility that research could be aimed at improving the quality of a specific input.




                                                         7
2.3 The Technological Frontier
In equilibrium, only the best available idea for each input in each country is actually adopted.

Thus for each country n, Z(j) represents the highest quality idea yet adopted in country ri
in sector j by time t, so that {ZfltLj)}j[oj1 is the technological frontier in country n at time
t. Consider an idea of quality q in sector j discovered somewhere at time t.   If the idea diffuses
to country n with a lag of r then it will constitute an innovation if and only if q> Z+r(j).
In this case the idea is adopted so that the technological frontier at j jumps discontinuously
from Z+(j) to q.
   To derive the dynamics of the technological frontier in a given country, we need to know the

rate at which ideas were discovered in all countries over all of history. Researchers in country
n produce new ideas at a nonstochastic rate                  Let      be   the stochastic rate at
which ideas of a given sector diffuse to country n from all the research that has been done
throughout the world. (The corresponding stock is           fJi,,ds.) An idea may be the
result of domestic research or may arrive from some other country It may be the outcome of

research performed recently or years before. Integrating over the appropriately weighted past
research done in country i the stock of ideas flowing into country n's technolo' is, summing

across countriçs,
                            =   r'       J etcr,LR,ds.                                         (1)

   Let z denote the level of the technological frontier in a particular sector of country ri.




                                              8
Letting H(zIt) Pr[Z,j(j) z], the distribution of this frontier is:11

                                             H(zIt)                                                        (2)

Note that the distribution of the technological frontier depends only on the total stock of ideas

       at that time, regardless of when these ideas were adopted for production or where they
came from. This feature of the distribution simplifies the analysis drastically.


2.4 Productivity
Output is maximized when production workers are evenly divided among production of the
individual inputs. In this case labor productivity is the geometric mean of t technological
frontier. Thus, we use           defined by,

                                        1nA, =     J/    Jo

as    an index of productivity in country n.12 Using our result on the distribution of the techno-

logical frontier, we have,
                                         lnA, =
                                                    f°°lnzhn(zlt)dz

among inputs, since the mark-up differs acroes sectors. Productivity is proportional to this index, however, as
can be seen from equation (10) and (11) below.

  '4As we discussed in our introduction, our model implies that an idea is more likely to be adopted in a country
with a relatively low level of productivity. The probability that an idea of quality q will prove useful is simply
H.,(qlt). Integrating this probability over the Pareto density of Q, and noting that Iit becomes arbitrarily
large over time, we get

                       f Hn(q)F'(q)dq =                                 =      =

Consider two countries, m and n, with levels of productivity A,,, and A,, respectively. The probability that
an idea will be adopted in country m relative to the probability that it will be adopted in country n is simply,
(A,,./A,,4'. Thus if A, <A,, country vn will obtain more true innovations than will country n from the
same number of ideas. In this sense the low productivity country draws innovations from the "technology gap".

2.5 Market Structure
We assume that the right to use an invention in country n passes to a local, monopolistic
imitator with a hazard that depends on whether or not the inventor has a patent in that
country. We denote the hazard of imitation if the invention was patented as t and if it was

not patented as           For a patent to. have any value requires, of course, that r° < Ot• Jf

patents provide perfect protection then              = 0, while if trade secrets are impossible to keep
then    ot =   15
    Whether the rights to the invention are owned by the original inventor or by an imitator,
the owner competes against the state of the art for that input in that country at the time of
invention. We assume that competition is Bertrand. Hence the owner of the invention charges

the highest price at which production using the previous state of the art is tiprofitable)6
  15We do not allow the Inventor to wait until the invention is adopted in a country to apply for a patent
there. This aesumption reflects the requirement of most patent systems that patents be taken out in additional
countries within one year of the first, or priority, application. We assume that inventors do not delay seeking a

priority application.
  16Grossman and Helpman (1991) make similar assumptions. The production technology implies a unit elastic
demand for an individual input given the prices of all other inputs. Hence to maximize profit the owner of the
invention charges the highest price at which it remains the only seller of that input. We assume that the owner
of the right to use the invention, when the invention is adopted in a country, competes with the state of the art
at the time of invention. The owner of an invention thus blocks protection of any Interim improvement over the
initial state of the art that is dominated by that invention. This assumption is consistent with the requirement
of most patent systems that only ideas that are "state of the art," can receive protection, where "state of
the art" is interpreted to mean the most advanced idea regardless of whether or not it has been adopted for
production This assumption is easier to justify when the original inventor holds a patent than when a domestic
imitator owns the right to the invention. The alternative assumptions that an imitator competes against the
next-best adopted technology, or that imitation is perfectly competitive, both Imply lower mark-ups over direct
production costs for unpatented Inventions. While this implication may be realistic, the consequent asymmetry
in mark-ups between patented and imitated inputs substantially complicates the analysis. Moreover, it implies
that the patent system itself has real effects on productivity conditional on the level of research. To focus

2.6 The Value of an Invention
Our assumptions about price competition imply that a firm producing an input of quality q in
a country where the state of the art for that input at the time of discovery was z will charge

p = (q/z)w, where w is the wage in the country at the time. We use the price of final output
as numeraire. Total purchases of the new input are . Given the pricing equilibrium, the
profit to the owner of the right to use a technolo' of quality q improving on an existing input

of quality z is ,r(z, q) =   (1
                                  —      if q> z and zero otherwise.
    The owner can earn a profit only after the invention has been adopted and only before it

has been surpassed by a more advanced technolor. Consider, then, the expected prcfit in
country n at time a from an invention of quality q at time t < a in country i. The probability
of its having been adopted for production by time a is (1 —         '"()). The probability of its
not having become obsolete by then is e'', while the probability J its not having
been copied by then is e_(3_t), where k E {pat, not} depending upon whether or not the
invention was patented. At the time t that an invention of quality q occurs in country i, the
expected discounted value of the right to use it in country n, given the existing state of the
art z in the relevant sector, is therefore:

                        q) =          lrnt÷,(z, q)e._(r+L)s(1 —


if q z. Otherwise the value is zero. Here again k = pat if the idea was patented and k = riot
otherwise, and r is the discount rate, which we treat as constant over time.


2.7 The Decision to Patent
A patent gives the inventor the incremental benefit of a lower hazard of imitation, so is worth

V,(z, q) — V,(z, q). We assume that, at the time of invention, the researcher knows the
on other implications of the international patent system more critical to the analysis here we preclude this

quality of the invention but not the state of the art in the sector to which it will apply in
each country. Integrating over the distribution of the states of the art in country n, given by
equation (2), the expected value of an idea of quality q from country i in country n is:

                V,(q) = T(,1q9, 9)                                  —

where,   k = pat, not depending upon whether or not the idea is patented and T(b, 0)                      1—

it costs an inventor in country I C,t to patent in country n then the inventor will seek patent
protection in that country if Vt(q) — V,j(q) exceeds c, and not otherwise. The return to
patenting rises with the quality of the invention q. Hence the condition:

                                         ,pat,q/ '—   noteqj\—
                                                             —
                                                                 Cnjt                                       4



determines a threshold quality level jt such that inventions of higher qualtv are patented
while those of lower quality are not.17 We assume that if an invention constitutes an innovation

in a country then a patent is automatically granted.
    Since researchers in country i produce ideas at rate                      the number of patents they

apply for in country n, Pt is:
                                          Pt =                                                             (5)

Since the fraction of ideas seeking protection is               while the fraction that are potentially

useful is       the ratio of the number of patented to potentially useful ideas is:

                                                                                                           (6)

As we show below, in steady state this ratio is constant.
  17A poseibility, of course, is that the ct of patenting would exceed the benefit for any invention regardlese
of its quality, in which case patenting would be zero, and i, infinite. At the other extreme, if c =0 then
    = 1, ao that any idea would be patented.


                                                      13
2.8 The Return to R&D
The value of an invention of quality q from country i in country n is the maximum of V,t(q) —

C,ut   and V,(q). The expected value of an idea in that country before its quality is known is
therefore the expectation of this amount across all possible values of q, which is:

                  V,t =       V,(q)F'(q)dq + 100 V,t(q)FF(q)dq —                           (7)
                          1



where,    as before, F'(q) = Oq_(1) is the Pareto density. The expected return to an idea of
unknown quality in country i at time t is therefore the sum of its expected returns across
countries, or
                                                 N
                                         Vt=>JVrt.                                         (8)

This amount represents the expected return to a unit of R&D effort.


2.9 Equilibrium R&D
The marginal researcher in country i, ranked Rj, can expect to earn                     doing
research. Equilibrium in the labor market thus implies that the number of researchers l? in
country i will solve:

                                    ctf3Va
                                             'R

                                             \J'itl
where wit is what a marginal researcher would earn producing output.


2.10 Technology, Wages, and Income

The wage in the production sector of country i is proportional to the level of productivity
in that country. Bertrand competition implies that the mark-up over this wage, MU)
p(j)/w, is low in sectors where the currently adopted input is only marginally better than the
input it replaced while M(j) is large in those sectors where the current input is a substantial
improvement over its predecessor. Since expenditure on each input is the same, more labor


                                                 14
is allocated to the production of inputs with low mark-ups. Consequently, the wage, as well
as productivity, is lower than would be the case if production workers were equally allocated
among sectors. As we show in the appendix, the mark-up M is a random variable with a
time-invariant distribution with density:

                                  0m1 I                8m0
                                                               him—i
                            g(m;O)m• —i                   —1

Given this density and the level of productivity, the wage is:

                                           wst =                                         (10)


where,

                                 c1(9) [°him(m;6)dm.
   The value of total output equa's wage costs plus profits. Again, taking into account the
distribution of the mark-up, the value of output in country i, given the wage and the labor
force in production there, is:
                                               Wjt
                                                      (L1 — R)                           (11)

The appendix provides the derivation of the expressions for g(m; 0), the wage, and the value

of output.


    We have now fully specified our modeL To summarize, equation (1) relates R&D effort to

subsequent growth of technology in different countries. Equation (4) determines what ideas
are patented given the value of output. Equations (7), (8), and (9) determine the division of
the labor force in a country between production and research and development as a function

of the wage in that country and output levels around the world. Finally, equation (10) relates


                                                     15
the wage in a country to its level of technology while equation (11) relates a countrys output
to its level of technology and the size of its labor force engaged in production.
    We treat the total labor force in each country as exogenous. The state of the economy
at any moment can be described in terms of the N technology parameters p, which evolve
according to (1). The economy is in equilibrium when, taking as given the current and future
state of the economy, patenting and labor allocation decisions are individually optimal, as

implied by (4) and (9).


3 The Steady State
The economy is in steady state when the state variables p grow at a constant common rate,
which we denote g, and patenting is constant. In order to obtain a steady-state outcome we

make the following assumptions about exogenous variables:
(i) Total labor forces in each country are constant. Hence                 =   L V t.
(ii) The productivity of researchers is proportional to the current level of technology where
they work, so that the number of new ideas generated by a given research effort is proportional

to the stock of existing ideas.18 Specifically, we assume that kjt = apit.

(iii) Patenting costs are a constant proportion of output, that is                 =
        equivalent assumption is made in many other models of endogenous growth, as, for example, in Krugrnan
(1979) and in Grossman and Helprnan (1901). With constant labor forces this assumption is needed for the
economy to grow in steady state. Technologies and ideas would also grow if labor forces grew at a constant
positive rate n and research productivity were given by a, =   a7y      [0,1). Ideas and technology would then

grow at rate n/(1 —.y). Kortum (1994) develops a model with tle features (with 7=0) for a dosed economy.
  '5This assumption is equivalent to assuming that examining a patent requires a constant labor input whose
cost is passed on to the applicant. If productivity growth were reflected in lower patenting costs, eventually all
nsw ideas, no matter how bad, would be patented. Since we observe a rate of domestic patenting that is not
growing over time (with the exception of Japan), we find it reasonable to assume that patenting costs have not
been falling relative to market size.




                                                       16
   Two features of a steady state are: (1) a constant number R, of workers in each country
engaged as researchers; and (ii) patenting thresholds that are proportional to the destination

country's productivity, Le., constant values of           as defined by equation (6).
   From equation (1), given the constant number of researchers R1 and labor force L in each

country, the steady-state growth rate of technology and the steady-state relative technology
levels solve the system of N equations:

                                              pg =                                           (12)

As is the case with ,        v depends on the adoption lag, the strength of intellectual property

As technology advances researchers become more productive, so more ideas are produced. But

as technology advances a smaller percentage of these new ideas constitute improvements in the

state of the art, so are worth patenting. In steady state these two effects cancel out, yielding
a constant rate of patenting.


4 Calibration
We assume that the steady state of our model describes, in 1988, world proc. activity growth,

relative levels of productivity, numbers of researchers, and foreign and domestic patenting
  21Since v,,,, is independent of technologr levels, an implication of this exprion is that the elastkity of R&D
with respect to the level of technology has the sign of 1-9. Researchers in countries with more advaneed

technologies, as measured by , are proportionately more productive as researchers, but their opportunity cost
of doing research is also greater in proportion to    The net effect is more research in advanced countries if 9

exceeds one and lese otherwise.

    We assume that all patent systems are the same, but allow them to provide different degrees
of protection to nationals than to foreigners. Hence we define £0t as the imitation rate when an

invention is patented domestically and t as the imitation rate when an invention is patented
abroad. The hazard of imitation of unpatented inventions "° is the same everywhere.
    We assume that the rate of diffusion of inventions from country I to country n is the
product of a parameter governing the speed at which county n adopts new inventions, a
parameter governing the speed at which inventions from country i are ready for adoption,
and a parameter governing the percentage increase in adoption speed for domestic inventions.

Formally,      =             where we normalize            = I and D = 1 if ,i      i. This we require ten
parameters to account for the 25 diffusion rates between and within our five countries.
  22We ha choei the five countrie. because of their size and research intensity together they employ over
80 percent of the world'. research scientists and engineers. Furthermore, each of these five countries obtain.
between 70% and 80% of its foreign patent applications from one of the other four. About 60% of the world's
Cross Domestic Product (CDP) is produced in these countries (Summers and Heston (1991)). Hence our five
countries account for most of the world's inventive activity and a majority of the market for inventions.

are shown in table 1. The workforce in each country L is taken from Summers and Heston
(1991). The patenting costs are based on country specific filing fees, agents fees, and translation

costs taken from Helfgott (1993). To obtain the c we divide the application costs by the
adjusted GDP of the country charging the application fee.24 We fix the interest rate at 7%
based on historical real returns on the U.S. stock market.

    There are 35 endogenous variables in the model,

                 y    [A/A, Ait/At, . . . , At/At, R1,. .. , R, Pa,. . . , Pr,.              ,P551"


as shown in table 2.
  23Th costs were adjusted for Japanese domestic applications. The Japanese applyfor over 300,000 patents
domestically each year. Okads (1992) finds that Japanese patents gra.nt.ed to foreigners contain on average 4.9
times as many inventive claims as those granted to Japanese inventors. Thus we translate 4.9 Japanese domestic
patent applications into the equivalent of 1 application elsewhere. This adjustment is reflected in table 2. We
also scale up the cost of an application for a Japanese inventor in Japan by this same factor of 4.9. We ignore
the more complicated fee atn.cture applying to patents through the European Patent Office and complications
introduced by patent renewal fees.
  24Helfgott collected the cost of application data from a survey in 1992 and converted all the figures into $tY.S.
using the exchange rate in effect unear the end of 1992". We took 1992 GDP in local currencies from iMP
(1994). We then converted GDP into $U.S. using 1992 fourth quarter exchange rates from IMP (1994) and we
subtracted from GDP the share o(GDP spent on R&D, from OECD (1991). Since we ignore patent renewal foes
and the pible cost of disclosure of information in taking out a patent, our measure of the cost of patenting
is a lower bound on the true costs. To check the aenitivity of results to substantially higher application costs
we experimented with increasing all foreign patenting costs by $10,000. There were no substantially different

implications for diffusion.


                                                         21
      Our measure of productivity A is manufacturing output per hour takr from van Ark
 and Punt (1993). We calculate productivity growth by averaging over our five countries from
 1979-1989. We use manufacturing productivity to represent a country's overall technological
 capability since productivity may be poorly measured in other sectors.
     To measure research effort 1? we use research and development scientists and engineers

 employed by the business sector in each country in 1988. To eliminate the effect of defense

 related research we multiply these employment numbers by the fraction of business sector
 R&D financed by either the business sector or from abroad. All data on research are from
 OECD (1991).

     Patent applications by country of application and resident of inventor in 1988 (Pm) are
 from WIPO (1990). As mentioned in the footnote above, patent applications in Japan by
 Japanese inventors have been scaled down by a factor of 4.9. Since patent law requires that
 an inventor apply for a patent in any other country within a year of the first (or priority)
application, patent applications rather than grants capture better the inventor's patenting
decision in our modeL Moreover, applications rather than grants are much more comparable
across countries.

    In order to evaluate the plausibility of a given parameter vector O,                   we   need to thmpare
the predictions of the model,           = C(O, z), with the actual value of the endogenous variable,
y. We have written a computer algorithm to do this.25
  We solve the model using GAUSS. The program begins with a parameter vector and a guess for the the
growth rate of technology, g. Then, (1) it finds the set of b, that solve equation (13); (ii) it iterates between
equations (12) and (14) until it finds technology levels and research employments that are '3sistent with each
other; (lii) it uses (12) to obtain a new value for the growth of technology; (iv) with the flew value of git returns
to the beginning of step (i). These steps are repeated until the growth of technology stops changing. FInally,
equations (3) and (15) are used to infer productivity and patenting. The entire procse takes about 1 minute
on a Pentium PC.

 4.2 Baseline Parameters

 We choose baseline parameters to match the steady-state values of the variables implied by the
 model as closely as possible to our measures of the endogenous variables. Hence we minimize
 the distance function, EI .                 where   ö is the weight placed on variable j. Our thirty-
 five endogenous variables consist of five productivity variables (four relative productivities and

 productivity growth), research scientists and engineers in the five countries, and twenty-five
patent levels between countries. In order to give each type of variable equal weight we choose

 5,= lforj= 1,...,lOandô3=1/5forj= 11,...,35.26
    The parameters that fit best are shown in table 3. Our estimate of 0 is somewhat aboveone,

implying that, other things equal, the return to research relative to production is greater in
more advanced countries. We obtain a very small value for the parameter fi of the distribution

of research talent. This result suggests that research output is roughly proportional to the
workforce in each country with only a small effect from the fraction of the workforce engaged
in research. While we find that domestic patents virtually preclude imitation, foreign patents

provide very little protection. This reflects the fact that the home country is always the most
popular country in which to seek protection (by at least a factor of 2, see table 2). Our
imitation rates are lower than those reported by Levin et. al. (1987), although their concept
of imitation seems to encompass our notion of obsolescence as well.

    Thrning to diffusion rates, we find them to be considerably more rapid within than between
countries. For example, the rate of domestic diffusion in the United States is 0.03, while from
the United States to Japan it is 0.003. For inventions from Japan, the rate of domestic
diffusion is 0.17 while the rate of diffusion to the United States is 0.02. Though the implied

mean diffusion lags are large, they are consistent with the results of micro ' nomc studies

 summarized in Jovanovic and Lach (l993).

      Table 4 shows how the model performs at fitting the vector of endogenous variables. The

 model is highly successful at fitting overall productivity growth, relative productivity levels,
 and levels of research employment in each country. Patterns of international patenting are less

 successfully captured though the overall level of patenting is about right.


 5 Decompositions and Counterfactuals
 Our estimates allow us to decompose the sources of growth in each country into what originates

from domestic research and what originates from research in each of the other four countries.
We also decompose the return to invention in each country into what is earned from the home
market and from each of the other four. We then examine the implications of different amounts

of international diffusion, and of different levels of intellectual property protection.


5.1     The Sources of Growth

Through the process of international technology diffusion, research done in one country leads to

productivity growth elsewhere. Table 5 quantifies these links between countries. The European

countries derive most of their growth from abroad while the United States and Japan obtain

slightly more from domestic research. Japan, Germany, and the United States make the largest
contributions to growth. A surprising result is that Germany and Japan each contributemore
than the United States. Though the United States produces many more inventions, we find
that these inventions diffuse quite slowly.

potentiaL Our concept Ii the hazard rate until a product is adoptnd.

5.2 The Rewards to Research

While the growth decomposition in table 5 looks at foreign countries as sources of new technol-.

ogy, table 6 looks at foreign countries as markets for new technology. We calculate the fraction

of the average value of an invention arising from markets in each of the 5 courtries. Inventions
obtain almost all their value domestically, even for the smaller European economies.


5.3 Alternative Patterns of Diffusion

Another way to quantify the role of international technology diffusion is to ask how the steady
state of the model would differ if technological links between countries were reduce<i The
results of several such experiments are shown in table 7. For comparison, we repeat the
predictions of the model from table 4 under the column "Baseline." Our first experiment,
"Technological isolation", reduces to 0.0001 the rate of diffusion between the United States
and the block of four other countries. Since the block of four other countries grows faster on
its own than does the United States, the U.S. level of productivity must fall relative to the
other countries (by a factor of more than 10) before the resulting technology gap supports the
new steady state growth rate. The new growth rate is about 90 per cent of the baseline
value. Our second experiment, "Borderless diffusion" eliminates the effect of country borders
on diffusion rates. In particular, we set D = 9.77 even if n                   i. Since ideas now spread
more rapidly and evenly across countries, the world growth rate rises and productivity levels
becomes more tightly clustered around the U.S. level Research employment is stimulated,
particularly in the smaller countries (Germany, France, and the U.K.) which now have a much
larger effective market for their inventions.
  21Thua, in the now steady state the United State. Is not unnpietely isolated since it obtatna many innovations
from abroad, aibeit years later.

 5.4 The Strength of Patent Protection

 We conclude with some counterfactual experiments on the strength of patent protection. In the
 first experiment we eliminate all forms of patent protection by setting              and       equal to t"°,
 i.e.,   the hazard of imitation of patented ideas is as great as unpatented ones. With i3 nearly
zero, it is predictable that world productivity growth would not change drastically, although
research employment falls considerably. The drop in research employment is particularly
pronounced in Japan and the United States, which have large domestic markets. In the
second experiment, we make patent protection perfect by settingpat     pat
                                                                D and LF   equal to zero,
so that there is no hazard of imitation if an invention is patented. World productivity growth

is higher by a modest factor of 1.003, although research employment more than doubles.29


6 Conclusion
We have developed a model of the invention and the international diffusion of technology that

allows us to identify the sources of growth and the sources of rewards to innovation in the world

economy. While our model is complex, it nevertheless embodies several crucial simplifications.

     First, we have ignored capital accumulation. We implicitly assume that capital is perfectly

mobile among the countries we consider. An implication is that, while capital deepening and

productivity growth are correlated, capital deepening is not the force driving growth. Capital
moves endogenously to take advantage of technological improvement.
  Tbese results should not be Interpreted to mean that intellectual property protection is undesirable. Present
value calculations indicate that very small changes in growth rates have large effects on permanent income. At
the same time, since the number of research adentlats and engineers is small relative to the total labor force,
large percentage changes in research employment imply very small percentage changes in current output. For
example, our calculations indicate that the magnitude of the steady-state income gain due to higher growth
from perfect patent protection is roughly comparable to the amount of steady-state income Icet from diverting
production workers to research.




                                                     26
    Second, we have ignored the terms of trade by treatin.g intermediate inputs as nontraded.
 Changes in the terms of trade may be an important means by which the benefits of productivity

 growth diffuse internationally.

    Finally, we have not examined the out-of-steady-state implications of our modeL An
 outstanding question is whether convergence to the steady state of our model can explain the
convergence of productivity levels exhibited by the countries in our sample riuring the post
World War II period. A puzzle posed by Jones (1993) is that the growth in research scientists

and engineers during this period was accompanied by a falling rate of productivitygrowth.
While there are many explanations for this finding, one that is consistent with our framework

is that the research effort that accompanied World War II left the world with a pool of many
good ideas. The subsequent absorption of these ideas into productive technology would then
explain the exceptionally high growth rate in the two decades after the Second World War.
We leave the examination of this hypothesis for future research.

   We view our current work as only a first step in the empirical general equilibrium modeling

of technology creation and diffusion in the world economy. While suggestive, our estimates

should be interpreted with caution since we fit our model to a small amount of data from a
small number of countries. Firm conclusions can only follow experimentation with alternative

methodologies and richer data. Nonetheless, our analysis provides insights that are likely to
survive further scrutiny. One broad conclusion is that technology among the major research
economies diffuses much more slowly between countries than within them, yet even large
countries derive a substantial share of their growth from abroad.

B Mathematical Appendix
We derive the time invariant probability density for the mark-up of input price over marginal
cost (the wage) across sectors. This density shows up in our equation for the wage conditional
on productivity (10) and our equation for the value of output conditional on the wage and the

workforce in production (11). We begin by deriving those equations.
     To derive the wage equation, start with the result that the quantity purchased of input j

But, if we know the density g of M we have,

                             J' JoI lnM(j)dj= JiI.oo lnmg(rn;O)dm.
To derive the value of output equation, note that total profit across all sectors is,

                              —                Y[1 —
                                  M(j)_1)dj            f°m_19(m;9)dm].

Therefore, since wages plus profits equal the value of output,

                                  Yjm19(m;0)dm = w(L - R).
     Deriving the functional form of g(m; 9) requires several steps. As we have defined it, the

mark-up for input j at a given time is equal to the quality of that input relative to the quality
of the input that it surpassed. We begin by deriving the joint density for new innovations
of the mark-up and the state of the art surpassed, denoted l(m, zit). We then integrate over
all past cohorts of innovations to obtain the distribution of the mark-up for those innovations

that are still in use.

                                               34
   First consider the distribution of the state of the art surpassed by innovations adopted at

time t. This will not be the same as the distribution of the qualities of all inputs currently in
use, equation (2), since low quality inputs are more likely to be surpassed than high quality

inputs. Formally, we have,

      Pr[Z zQ Z,il = Pr[Z z,Q ZIt]/Pr[Q Zt] =

where F(z)     1 —x9 is the distribution from which the quality of ideas is drawn and H'(xlt) =
                is the density of the state of the art, the derivative of equation (2). Integrating

out the denominator under the assumption that pj becomes arbitrarily large, we find that the
density of the state of the art that is surpassed by innovations adopted at time t is,




Without regard to the state of the art surpassed, the mark-up of an innovation adopted at time
t is drawn from the Pareto distribution. To see this, let z be the state of the art surpassed,

               r1—   —   m1   —   Zj —
                                         Pr[z Q zm]
                                           Pr[Q   z]
                                                        —
                                                        —   F(zm) — F(z)
                                                               1 — F(z)
                                                                           — 1—   m   -
Therefore, multiplying the density of the state of the art surpassed by the density of the
mark-up conditional on the state of the art surpassed,

                              l(m, nt) = O2pm_0_1z_0+1)e_.

    The derivation above tells us about the distribution of the mark-up for new innovations.
To calculate the distribution of the mark-up for all inputs currently in use we need to keep
track of the mark-up for innovations adopted years earlier that are still in use. This is made

possible by the fact that the hazard rate faced by these earlier innovations depends on their
quality, i.e. the product of their mark-up and the state of the art they surpassed. It is for this

reason that we derived the joint density. The other ingredient is the rate at which innovations

were being adopted in earlier periods. This is simply the rate at which ideas were diffusing

                                                   35
at time a multiplied by the fraction of those ideas that were useful at that time, i.e. z,/t,.
Combining these results, the distribution of the mark-up is,

                  G(m'Ii) =
                              j-ooJ,1
                                    j.m J0O i(,n,
                                            1
                                                  zl3)e_t_)m)dzdmds.

Changing the variable of integration from z to

                        x=          +           —
                                                           z9(m, a,

and, noting that (m, a, t) becomes arbitrarily large over time, the inner-most integral is
         a, t)2m(9'). Thus, changing the order of integration,

                     G(m'It)   = f'' OmO+ Lt                   a, t2dsdrrz.

Changing the variable of integration from a to /.z,,

                                        o   —(9+1)
                      G(m't) =                           + Olnm — l)dm.
                                  iT    (1— m9)2(m

After some rearranging, we see that the argument of this integral is exactly g(rn; 9), the density

of the mark-up.

In "Baseline" we repeat the predictions of the model from
table 4.
In "Technological isolation" we set the diffusion rates
between the U.S. and the other 4 countries equal to 0.0001.
Since these diffusion rates are not zero, the U.S. still grows
at the same rate as the other 4 countries in steady state.
In "l3orderless diffusion" we set ED = 9.77 even
for n i.

In "No patent protection" we set all imitation rates equal to      = .226.
In "Perfect patent protection" we set all imitation rates, conditional
on patenting, equal to 0.
