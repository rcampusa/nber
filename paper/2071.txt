                                   ABSTRACT




        In the past fifteen years key exchange rates have moved in larger
and more persistent ways than advocates of flexible rates in the late 1960s
would have left anyone free to imagine. Certainly there was no expectation
of constancy for nominal exchange rates. But real exchange rate movements of
30 or forty percent were definitely not suggested as a realistic
possibility. Moreover where these large movements did occur they did not
obviously appear to be connected with fundamentals, and hence seemed
difficult to explain in terms of the exchange rate theories at hand. The
persistence of rate movements was as surprising as the rapid unwinding of
apparent misalignments when they did ultimately occur.
        The past fifteen years provide a natural dividing line between the
Keynesian and monetary approaches of the 1960s, and the more recent analysis
that takes into account exchange rate expectations and portfolio issues,
which took off in the early 1970s as well as the brand—new approaches that
concentrate on (partial equilibrium) uticroeconomicS. To review these ideas
the paper starts with a brief look at the U.S. experience with flexible
exchange rates. From there it proceeds to the Mundell—Fleming model as a
comprehensive framework of analysis. The following sections deal with
persistent effects of policy disturbances, links between exchange rates and
prices, the political economy of exchange rate movements and the question of
policies toward excess capital mobility.

        In the past fifteen years key exchange rates have moved in larger

and more persistent ways than advocates of flexible rates in the late 1960;

would have left anyone free to imagine. Certainly there was no expectation

of constancy for nominal exchange rates. But real exchange rate movements of

30 or forty percent were certainly not suggested as a realistic possibility.

Moreover where these large movements did occur they did not obviously appear

to be connected with fundamentals, and hence seemed difficult to explain in

terms of the exchange rate theories at hand. The persistence of rate

movements was as surprising as the rapid unwinding of apparent misalignment;

when they did ultimately occur. Research on exchange rate economics has

grown tired searching for risk premia determinants or for new macroeconomic

models. With a shift of interest toward the microeconomic effects of

exchange rate movements research is now turning in a fresh direction. It is

therefore a good time to take stock of what is known of exchange rate

economics, what has been learnt since the early 1970s and where more

research needs to be done.

        The past fifteen years provide a natural dividing line between the

Keynesian and monetary approaches of the 1960s, and the more recent analysis

that takes into account exchange rate expectations and portfolio issues,

which took off in the early 1970s as well as the brand—new approaches that

concentrate on (partial equilibrium) microeconomics. To review these ideas

the paper starts with a brief look at the U.S. experience with flexible

exchange rates. From there we proceed to use the Mundell—Fleming model as a
                                        2




     comprehensive framework of analysis. The following section draws attention

     to persistent effects of policy disturbances. The next three topics deal

     with the link between exchange rates and prices, the political economy of

     exchange rate movements and the question of policies toward excess capital

    mobility.



-   I.   The U.S. Experience With Floating Rates

             The most striking result of the flexible rate experience is the

    recognition that the "law of one price" is a poor description of the facts.

    Figure 1 shows the real exchange rate of the U.S. dollar over the past ten

    years.   In the transition from fixed rates to floating in the early 1970s

    (not shown) the dollar depreciated by nearly 40 percent. An index o4

    competitiveness in manufacturing (using the IMF series shown in Figure 1.)

    stood at 155 in 1968—70 and fell to 112 by 1973—75 which is also about the

    average for the period 1975—86. Over the next ten years the dollar

    depreciated sharply until 1980. Then appreciation ensued, raising the dollar

    well above the level of the 1970s. Since 1985 the dollar has been on a

    slide, taking it back by late 1986 to the average of the 1970s.

             Table 1 shows some recent facts for the international sector of the

    U.S. economy to highlight the large—scale shifts that have taken place. Net

    exports have moved to a large deficit, import penetration has increased

    dramatically in just a few years and the net investment position now shows

    the U.S. as a net debtor. There is some question about the quality of the

          The recognition that real exchange rate changes have taken place on

a massive scale, and that they have major and potentially persistent

macroeconomic effects, points to several important directions for research:


        Why do exchange rate move so much and so persistenly?

        Does the fact that real exchange rates remain misaligned so
        persistently imply that they must therefore ultimately overshoot
        to remedy the accumulated consequences of over— or undervaluation?
                                    4




        Does a review of available theories and evidence suggest that exchange
        exchange rate movements are based on irrational speculation rather
        than fundamentals?

    • What are linkages between movements in the exchange rate and
      changes in relative prices?

    • Do the large and persistent movements lead to the inevitable
      conclusion that exchange rate management offers a chance for better
      macroeconomic performance? If so, what is the externality, and thus
      what is the appropriate policy instrument, exchange rate oriented
      monetary policy or a reduced scope for capital movements?


          We are certainly not at a point to answer these questions in a

satisfactory manner. But it is worthwhile seeing where the literature has

gone and what suggestions are available. We start by asking whether the

standard models of exchange rate determination can give a satisfactory

account of rate movements in the past decade.



1. Why Do Exchange Rates Move?

         There are two standard models of exchange rate determination. One

focuses on an expectations—augmented, open economy IS—LM model in the

tradition of Meade, Fleming, and Mundell. The other highlights the role of

portfolio diversification and relative asset supplies. In choosing between

these models an important question is to decide how relevant portfolio

diversification effects are as part of an explanation for exchange rate

movements. In other words, are monetary and fiscal policy most of the story

or do relative supplies of debts and other claims also play an important

role?
                                                   5




The Extended Mundell—Fleming Model:

                The textbook model today is an open economy IS—UI model with perfect

capital mobility, sluggish price adjustment, rapid asset market or interest

rate adjustment, and rational expectations in asset markets.

                A streamlined version is written in log—linear form and takes output

as given. Complications stemming from output adjustments can easily be

introduced but do not actually change the basic dynamics. In the same way we

do not explicitly focus on wage—price interaction.1



    in—p =      hi                                           (1)

                                         c(i—p)]             (3)




Here in     and p are the nominal money stock and prices, i and e are the nominal

interest rate and the exchange rate respectively, and g is a variable

representing fiscal policy. l1 variables other than interest rates are in

logs.

Dornbusch (1986).

         Equation (1) represents monetary equilibrium or the UI schedule.

 Equation (2) states that with an adjustment for anticipated depreciation,

 assets are perfect substitutes. Perfect foresight is imposed by equating

 actual and anticipated depreciation. Equation (3) specifies that price

adjustment is linked to the excess demand for goods which in turn depends on

the real exchange rate, fiscal policy and the real interest rate.

        This model exhibits the familiar overshooting property: A one time

monetary expansion leads to an immediate depreciation of the exchange rate.

The exchange rate overshoots its new long run level——which is proportional

to the increase in money. In the transition period, following the initial

overshooting the exchange rate appreciates while prices are rising. The

process continues until the initial real equilibrium is re—established.

        Wilson (1979) has shown that this model also lends itself to the

investigation of currently anticipated disturbances or of transitory

disturbances. This exercise highlights the flexibility of asset prices which

move ahead of the realisation of disturbances. Exchange rates move

immediately, driven entirely by anticipations, and bring about alterations

of prices and interest rates before any monetary or fiscal changes are

actually implemented.

        The strong feature of the model is the contrast between instantly

flexible assets prices which are set in a forward looking manner, and the

sluggish adjustment of prices. The linkage of the domestic asset market to

foreign rates of interest produces exchange rate dynamics which yield the
                                   7




required rate of return on home assets. Any Hnewsu will make the exchange

rate jump instantly to that level such where the expected capital gains or

losses precisely offset the nominal interest differential. In this sense the

structure is extraordinarily rigid, just as was the original Mundell—Fleming

model.

         Of course, there is room for some flexibility: output adjustment can

be brought into the model, import prices can appear in the real money

balances deflator or a 3—curve can be introduced to allow a more gradual

response of demand to the real exchange rate. But these are niceties that do

not add much to the basic flavor of the results.



Fiscal Policy

         A major insight comes from a different application: fiscal policy. A

fiscal expansion in this model brings about currency appreciation. Fiscal

expansion creates an excess demand for goods, leading to an expansion in

output or prices and hence, with a given nominal money stock, to upward

pressure on the interest rate. Incipient capital inflows bring about an

exchange rate appreciation and full crowding out. This is, of course,

exactly the property captured by the Mundell—Fleming model. Fiscal policy

works in the way they described even when price adjustments and expectations

are introduced.
                                       8




            An interesting extension is to consider a transitory fiscal

expansion. This corresponds, for example, to the U.S. experience of the

l980s. Suppose that fiscal policy follows an adjustment process such as:



        g         v(g— ')                                                  (4)


where       is the long run level of government spending. According to (4) a

fiscal expansion is being phased out over time at the rate .

            Now   suppose that at time T a fiscal expansion to level g0 takes

place and that from there on fiscal policy will follow the rule of (4). It

is possible to solve for the path of the real exchange rate to establish the

following results: There will be an immediate real appreciation. Then, under

the impact of excess demand, prices will keep rising so that further real

appreciation occurs. Over time the exchange rate overvaluation builds up

even as the fiscal policy is being wound down. A recession develops which

now forces deflation and hence gradually a return to the initial level of

the real exchange rate.

            If a future transitory fiscal expansion is anticipated or is

gradually phased in, the adjustment process is somewhat more complicated.

The adjustment path is shown in Figure 2. Upon the news of the fiscal

program there will be an initial nominal and real appreciation shown as a

jump from A to B. Then the overvaluation exerts a deflationary pressure. As

prices decline and real balances rise the nominal interest rate falls. To

match the lower interest rate the exchange rate will be appreciating. That

process continues until the fiscal expansion actually gets underway, and

leads to excess demand and inflation. Only when real balances and hence

interest rates have been pushed up beyond their initial level, does the

corrective depreciation start. The depreciation then continues, along with

the phasing out of the fiscal expansion, until the initial equilibrium is

restored.

        Fiscal policy thus appears in addition to monetary policy as an

important driving force for the exchange rate. Sustained shifts in

government spending or taxes will bring persistent movements of the real

exchange rate. Feldstein (1986) and Hutchinson and Throop (1985) have

documented that shifts in the full employment budget, along with real

interest rates, can in fact explain the large shifts in real exchange rates

that have occurred. Interestingly the empirical tests hold up not only for

the very recent experience in the United States. They work equally well when

applied to multilateral exchange rates for the entire floating rate period.

        Fiscal policy, including the expectations of correction associated

with Grame—Rudman, provides one interpretation of the dollar movements in

the 1980s. The alternative is to argue the case or at least partial

irrationality as has been done by Frenkel (1985), Frankel and Froot (1986)

and Krugman (1986).

 11. Persistence Effects

         Three feature5 of the extended Muundell—Fleming model account for

 its strong and unambiguous predictions. First, the absence of any effects,

dynamic or otherwise, associated with the current account. Second, that

home and foreign assets are perfect substitutes. Third, that there are only

two classes of assets, money and bonds, and no real assets. We consider now

what alternative models might look like and what they imply for exchange

rate economics.



Current Account Effects

        A period of fiscal expansion leading to appreciation will also

involve cumulative current account imbalances. The case of the United States

stands out, as now more than 2 percent of GNP is borrowed from the rest of

the world in financing the persistent deficit, adding in each year to come

to a seemingly ever growing external indebtedness (See Figure 3). Sometime

in 1985 the U.S. passed from net creditor to net debtor status.

        The accumulated net external indebtedness will, of course, show up

in the current account in the form of reduced income from net foreign

assets. The reduction in net external assets means that following a period

of deficits the current account cannot be balanced simply by returning to

the initial real exchange rate. Now there will be a deficit stemming from

the increased debt service. Therefore, to restore current account balance,

an overdepreciation is required.
                                         11




               The current account can be represented in the following manner. Let

d be the net external assets and i* the rate of return on net foreign

assets. The term d denotes the current account surplus or accumulation of

net foreign assets:



           d      f(e—p,g) +   i*d                               (5)




The real exchange rate that yields current account balance will therefore

depend on the rate of return on assets and on the cumulated history of

fiscal policy and other shocks to the current account. A transitory fiscal

binge requires a subsequent permanent real depreciation to yield the

improvement in the non—interest current account that is necessary to service

the debt.

               Such a permanent response to transitory deficits is clearly not part

of the standard model. The question is whether it represents a realistic,

quantitatively important effect. This is the case addressed in trade theory

under the heading of the 1transfer problemu. it depends in large part on the

impact on demand for domestic goods of an international redistribution of

wealth and spending, and on the production response to changes in relative

pri ces.

                The discussion of the transfer problem is not complete without a

consideration of how the budget will be balanced. The fiscal expansion gives

rise to a budget deficit which is financed by issuing debt. The debt in turn
                                   12




will have to be serviced at some point by increased taxes. The question

then is whether the taxation yields an equal current account improvement at

constant relative prices.   If so then there is no need for terms of trade

adjustments. At the going levels of output disposable income and absorption

by domestic residents decline but part of reduced spending fails on domestic

goods rather than imports. To achieve the transfer at full employment

ordinarily requires a real depreciation. The real depreciation will shift

demand toward domestic goods.

        This discussion of fiscal policy effects on real exchange rates

clearly provides scope for an application of the Barro—Ricardo equivalence

ideas to the open economy. A particularly complete rendition is offered in

Frenkel and Razin (1986).



Portfolio Effects:

        A separate persistence effect can arise via the impact of a fiscal

and current account imbalances on the relative supply of assets. Suppose

that, contrary to (2), assets are not perfect substitutes so that there is a

risk premium:2



2The formula for the risk prem2um here omits wealth terms. It also

focusses on debt rather than all nominal outside assets. For a more

complete treatment see Dornbusch (1982).

where b and b* are the supplies of domestic and foreign debt in national

currencies.

            If current account imbalances are financed by an increase in the

relative supply of domestic debt, then the cumulative imbalance would

require an increase in the relative yield on domestic securities or a change

in the relative valuation via exchange rate changes. A depreciation would be

a means of correcting on increase in the relative supply of domestic

securities by reducing their value in foreign currency, thus restoring

portfolio balance at an unchanged yield differential. Other thingsequal we

would therefore expect a period of debt accumulation to have a permanent



In a model with a risk premium there is a serious difficulty in

linking goods and assets markets. There is certainly no excuse for

using the interest rate on bonds in home currency as 'the' domestic

interest rate used as a determinant of domestic spending. The ad hoc

model becomes a liability.The correct treatment, drawing on an

optimisation model would use the marginal cost of capital which is

based on the marginal financing pattern which in turn is derived by

solving the firm's and household's complete intertemporal optimisation

probi em.

effect on exchange rates, so as to bring interest differentials in line with

the changed relative supply of assets.

        The responsiveness of exchange rates to relative asset supplies has

been addressed in a number of important papers by Frankel.4 He concludes

that relative asset supplies in fact do not provide a satisfactory account

of relative yields, at least in the context of a capital asset pricing

model. The impact of relative asset supplies is practically negligible. That

is an uncomfortable conclusion for a whole strand of research which places

major emphasis on the imperfect substitutability of assets as a major

feature of open economy macroeconomics.

        Work by Sachs and Wyplosz (1984), Dornbusch and Fischer (1980) and

Giovannini (1982) raises the following problem: if as a result of debt

accumulation, via the transfer problem or via risk premia, an ultimate

depreciation is required, why should we expect an initial appreciation? Is

it not likely that for certain parameters and paths of subsequent budget

correction there should be an immediate path of sustained real depreciation.

It turns out that all the parameters in the model——trade elasticities,

wealth elasticities, risk premium responses, etc.——matter for this question.

Even in very highly simplified models no firm conclusions emerge about the

path of the exchange rate.

Real Assets:

         The standard model remains oversimplified even when long—term issues

of   current   account balancing and a risk premium are taken into account. The

simplification lies in the omission of real capital from portfolios, and in

disregarding the effect over time of investment on the capital stock and

thus the supply side of the economy.

         Concurrently with the imbalance in the current account and the

resulting shift in net foreign assets, capital accumulation takes place.

Portfolio adjustments in response to the changing relative asset supplies

bring about changes in the value of real assets and in relative yields. The

flow of investment and the changes in the value of real capital potentially

dominate the effects of current account imbalances. A good week on the stock

market produces a change in wealth that is several times the magnitude of

an entire year's deficit in the current account. While it is true that the

current account is important because persistent imbalances cumulate, exactly

the same argument must be made for investment.

         Work by Gavin (1986) shows that the inclusion of the stock market in

the standard model offers important additional channels for exchange rate

dynamics. Unfortunately the inclusion of    the stock market   removes at the

same time the simplicity of the standard model. Now virtually anything is

possible. nd that result is arrived at by looking only at the portfolio

implications of a money—debt—capital model and the ensuing yield and wealth
                                     16




effects, without even taking into account the accumulation of physical

capital. Among the sources of ambiguity are two different effects: an

expansion in demand will bring about both an increase in output and an

increase in interest rates. The net effect on the valuation of the stock

market is therefore uncertain. Thus wealth may rise or fall, and this is

important in judging the induced effects on money demand and spending. The

second important consideration is the relative substitutability of money and

debt, and debt and capital. This is relevant for the extent of yield changes

and hence for the direction and magnitude of exchange rate changes.

        The money—debt—capital model is also important in highlighting that

current accounts are not necessarily financed by sales of domestic bonds or

foreign bonds. There need not be any link between cumulative current account

imbalances and yield differentials between home and foreign nominal bonds.

There would be a significant distinction, for example, between fiscal

deficits and investment deficits. The difference is also relevant from the

point of view of the transfer problem. Deficits that arise as a result of

increased investment have different implications from deficits that have

their source in fiscal imbalances.



Hysteresis Effects:

        A final channel for persistence effects is introduced by an

industrial organization approach to the consequences of extended rate

misaligneents. When an industry is exposed to foreign competition and entry
                                     17




by a persistent overvaluation it may close down and perhaps even reopen in

the low wage country. Firms already producing in the low wage country may

make the necessary investment to enter the market where home firms are

handicapped by overvalued labor. A period of overvaluation or undervaluation

thus changes the ndustria1 landscape in a relatively permanent fashion.

These considerations are at the center of a new literature that seeks to

interpret the U.S. experience following the five year overvaluation. The

upshot of the literature is, of course, that overvaluation leads ultimately

to the need for overdepreciation to remedy the accumulation of adverse trade

effects.

           Overvaluation, for example due to monetary contraction or fiscal

expansion brings in foreign firms and displaces domestic firms. When the

overvaluation is ultimately undone the foreign firms are still there and the

domestic firms may exist no longer. Worse yet, they now may even be

producing abroad. A period of sustained undervaluation is required to bring

forth the required investment. The possibility of entry and the choice of

labor market from which to supply a particular market, thus opens an

important dynamic theory of adjustment to the exchange rate. Expectations

about the persistence of changes in relative labor costs become important

for the determination of relative prices. Now pricing between firms not only

 1986).
                                    18




involves current strategic interaction, which we consider below, but also

the impact of pricing strategies on entry, location and investment.

         There is some offset to these considerations from the side of factor

prices. To the extent that an industry has a captive factor supply we would

expect that wages come down with the exchange rate, thus maintaining a firm

in existence. Conversely, in expanding countries wages might rise and thus

offset some of the gain in profitability arsing from depreciation.



III. Exchange Rates and Pricing

        The monetary approach to the balance of payments used purchasing

power parity (PPP) as an essential ingredient in explanations of exchange

rate determination. Today PPP is certainly no longer a cornerstone. for

modelling. Attention has shifted to modelling changes in equilibrium

relative prices. The simple Keynesian model assumes that wages and prices in

the national currencies are given, so that exchange rate movements change

relative prices one—for—one. A newer approach recognizes the sluggishness of

wages, but builds on that a theory of equilibrium price determination along

industrial organization lines.'

Flood(1986)

Relative Prices:

          An interesting setting for exchange rate—wage—price relationships is

a world of imperfect competition. Here firms are price setters. They may or

or may not interact strategically, but they certainly face the problem of

how their pricing decision should react to a change in the exchange rate.

Consider the simple case of an oligopoly.7

          The typical setting would be the following. We look at the home

market where n home firms and n* foreign firms compete. The profits of the

typical home and foreign firms, with constant unit labor costs in their

respective currencies given by w and w*, are:



    J =   (p1—w)D(p,p)                                     (6)




                                                           (7)




          These profits are maximized subject to the strategic assumptions

about the determinants of the demand facing each firm and the responses of

other firms in the market. It is clear that there is no general solution to

the problem. The impact of an exchange rate change on equilibrium prices

will depend on a number of factors. Specifically these include:



7This analysis draws on Dixit (1956) and Seade (1923).
                                   20




      .whether goods are perfect substitutes or differentiated products

       .the market organisation——oligopoly, imperfect competition, etc.

      .the relative number of domestic and foreign firms

      .the functional form of the market demand curve

        Even though there is no presumption about the effects of exchange

rates on the changes in equilibrium prices, it is immediately clear that

there is an important link between open economy macroeconomics and

industrial organisation. There is no presumption that an exchange rate

movement affects all markets equally. Some markets may involve a homogeneous

good and, for example, a duopoly. Other markets may involve differentiated

products and Chamberlinian competition. Yet other markets may be close to

perfect competition. But whichever is the case, once the exchange rate

changes, given wages, there will be an adjustment in the equilibrium price.

Of course this pricing issue, depending on market organisation, may be

repeated at different levels from import to retail. The same pricing issue

arises on the export side..

        For the case of differentiated products an appreciation tends to

bring about a rise in the relative price of domestic goods. Imported

variants decline in price both absolutely and relatively. For homogeneous

products the industry price declines, with the decline being larger the less

monoplized the market and the larger the relative number of foreign firms.
                                      21




          An interesting, and perhaps surprising, result appears here:currency

appreciation, in certain cases, may lead to a more than proportionate

decline in market price. This result occurs because the favorable cost shock

for foreign firms makes expansion overly profitable and overcomes the

tendency to preserve profits by restricting output. But these results are

very specific to market structure and functional form. In public finance, as

Seade (1983) has shown, a similar result occurs: a tax on an oligopolistic

industry may raise profits.

          To show how specific the results are to the details of the market,

consider a simple duopoly market with a domestic and a foreign firm. Let the

inverse market demand function be:



    P=P(Q) ;    P'(Q)<O,    QE q+q*                   (8)




where 0 denotes total quantity demanded and q and q* are the supplies by the

home and foreign firm. Let the elasticity of the slope of the inverse

demand function be denoted by c:



    c =   —(P"/P')Q                                     (9)



which may be zero, as in the linear case, positive or negative.
                                     22




         Suppose that each of the two firms assumes that the other maintains

a given level of output. The equilibrium then is the Cournot—Nash solution

for industry output and price. The elasticities of output, and of the

industry price in response to an exchange rate change, are:


                                     A                          A
(9)     Q =New*/P) (P/P'Q)/(3 —   c)]e    ;   P =((ew*/P)/(3—c)]e



where a hat denotes a percentage change.

         Consider now three cases. First, with a linear market demand

function the term c=O. Accordingly, the pass—through of depreciation to the

prices is one third of marginal cost—price ratio for the foreign country.

Because we are in a situation of oligopoly the marginal cost—price ratio is

less than unity. The elasticity of industry price with re5pect to the

exchange rate is thus definitely a fraction and perhaps much less than a

half.

         Next we look at a constant semi—elasticity demand curve, QAexp(—

aP). For this case the elasticity c=1, and the price elasticity is already

increased to a half of the marginal cost—price ratio. Going further to a

constant elasticity demand curve QAPa yields a value of c 1+1/a. Let a1

so that spending on the good is constant. In that case the elasticity of

price is equal to the marginal cost—price ratio.
                                    23




         The examples show that the impact of exchange rate movements on

prices is far from straightforward. Market structure, conjectural variations

and functional form all come into play. Even though this application of

 industrial organization ideas to the effects of exchange rate movements does

not emerge with firm results, it is quite apparent that it offers a major

avenue for theoretical research and for applied studies. Exchange rate

changes affect differentially home and foreign firms, to an extent which

varies between industries. Focusing on the adjustment to major exchange

rate movements may therefore help identify market structures and thus enrich

industrial organization research.



Commodity Prices:

        One of the more interesting price effects of real exchange rate

movements between major industrial countries occurs in the area of

commodities. It is readily established that a real dollar exchange rate

depreciation in terms of value added deflators for manufactured goods)

will lead to a rise in the dollar price of commodities, and a rise in their

real price to U.S. users. Conversely, abroad the real price declines as does

the absolute price in foreign currencies.

        This result can be seen by looking at the commodity market

equilibrium condition where J is the excess demand for any particular

commodity, say cotton:
                                   24




                                                          (10)




where p and p* are the national currency commodity prices and P and P* are

the deflators. Excess demand is a declining function of the real prices in

the two regions. In Figure 4 the market equilibrium schedule is shown as

downward sloping. Points above and to the right correspond to an excess

supply. Let R=P/eP* be the real exchange in terms of manufacturing

deflators rate, and which is shown as the ray OR through the origin. Using

the law of one price for commodities, p=ep*, and the definition of the real

exchange rate in (10) we obtain:



     J(p/PRp/P,..)=O                                       (11)




or




      p/P   h(R,...), h'<0                                 (ha)



A real appreciation of the dollar corresponds to a rise in R rotating

downward the OR ray. The model predicts a decline in real commodity prices

in the U.S. as a result of dollar appreciation. Equation (ha) shows that a

real appreciation of the dollar will lead to a decline in the real price of

commodities to U.S. users, and a real price increase abroad. Given the U.S.

deflator,P, the nominal commodity price quoted in dollars will decline. In

this perspective the large dollar appreciation of 1980—85 helps explain the

sharp decline of dollar commodity prices in world trade.     In fact though the

dollar appreciation and worldcyclical movements are not enough to explain

fully the decline in these prices.



Exchange Rates and inflation:

        The impact of exchange rates on inflation is well—established for

any Banana Republic and, indeed, for any industrial country. The experience

of the l9BOs makes it clear that it even applies to the United States.

There are several channels through which exchange rates affect inflation.

The least controversial effect of exchange rates on inflation concerns the

prices of homogeneous commodities traded in world markets.

        Changes in commodity prices influence directly the rate of inflation

for food and hence influence wages. They also affect industrial materials

costs in manufacturing. But exchange rates influence inflation also via

several other channels. Their influence is important because they are rapid

and quite pervasive.

        One channel working in addition to commodity prices involves the

prices of traded goods and the prices of those goods directly competing with

traded goods. The industrial organization analysis considered above applies

to determine the magnitude and speed of response for prices. The less

monopolistic a market, and the lower entry costs, the more pervasive the

price effects.
                                  26




        There are also inflation effects via wages. These can arise because

wages respond to the competitive pressure of an appreciation or depreciation

in affected industries. They also come about as wages respond to changes in

the cost of living.

        Adding together these various channels yields a pervasive   pattern of
cost and price effects that are directly or indirectly associated with

exchange rate movements. It is interesting to note that in the U.S. the

magnitude of these effects is still under discussion. Estimates of the

impact of a 10 percent dollar appreciation on the price level range between

one and two percentage points. The reason it is so difficult to establish

the size of the impact is apparent. There have been only three recent

episodes involving a major change in inflation. Each coincided with an oil

price change, a large change in unemployment, and a major change in the

dollar. As a result it is nearly impossible to extract a precise estimate

for the size of each of these three elements in the inflation process.8



IV. The Political Economy of Overvaluation

        The literature on political business cycles has drawn attention to

the systematic pursuit of macroeconomic goals on a timetable dictated by

political elections. The exchange rate fits very well into that scheme. It



8See Dornbusch and Fischer (19B4) Sachs (1985) and Woo (1984) on the

exchange rate effects on U.S. inflation.
                                  27




does so via its effects on output and inflation, but also as a highly

visible indicator of confidence in policy.

        The political business cycle implication of exchange rate movements

is strongly enhanced by the relative timing of output and inflation results.

A real appreciation quickly raises real wages in terms of tradeables and

quickly reduces inflation. The impact on activity is much more gradual. The

implication of these timing relationships is that a policy of real

appreciation, conducted at the right time, can make an administration look

particularly successful at controlling inflation, while at the same time

delivering increases in real disposable income.

        Diaz Alejandro (1966) was the first to draw attention to the fact

that devaluation in the short term may reduce activity, in addition to

having inflationary effects. Only in the long term do output and employment

expand. The reason is that in the short run a devaluation cuts real wages in

terms of tradeables thereby reducing purchasing power and the demand for

home goods. These income effects dominate in the short run. The neoclassical

substitution effects take time to build up. The short term effects are

sufficiently powerful to be highly relevant for political decision making.

        The reverse side of this coin is overvaluation. In the short term it

involves less inflation and an increase in real income and hence it wins

popularity contests. Only over time, as substitution effects become

important and output declines due to the loss of competitiveness, do the

costs emerge. No wonder that overvaluation is a very popular policy, It
                                     28




created broad shortterm political support in Chile for Pinochet, in

Argentina for the policies of Martinez de Hoz, for the Thatcher government

in the U.K., and in the U.S. for Reaganomics.

        Whether the policy mix was deliberate or not, there is little doubt

that for a while the real appreciation was celebrated as a mark of

achievement, rather than being seen as a highly destructive misalignment.

Only as the deindustrialization effects became visible, and politically

alarming did the policy makers back track and start viewing overvaluation

with concern. In the meantime it had bought a strong disinflation.

        In the U.S. case the oil price decline of 1986 came just in time to

offset the cut in real income and the inflationary impact implied by dollar

depreciation. The timing of appreciation and depreciation thus looked like a

masterpiece of political economy. The only cloud remains the very serious

blow to industry, the eects of which do appear to persist even after an

already significant depreciation. Of course, in addition, there is the cost

of servicing the accumulated debt.

        These episodes of overvaluation raise the interesting issue of why

an electorate would favor exchange rate misalignment. Given the welfare

costs associated with uneven tax structures over time, and the costs

resulting from de— and reindustrialization, one would expect voters to favor

steady policies, rather than large fluctuations in the real exchange rate

and the standard of living. Yet the evidence runs counter to this

observation, overvaluation being one of the best tricks in the bag.
                                    29




        There is an international dimension to the issue of inflation

stabilization via overvaluation. Under flexible exchange rates a tightening

of monetary policy exerts immediate disinflationary effects via currency

appreciation. When used by a large country, such a policy amounts to

exporting inflation. investigation of policy coordination and üf the

gametheoretic implications of these effects has been an important part of

international economics research.

        A recent study by Edison and Tryon (1986) makes an important point

in this connection. The authors find that in simulations with the Federal

Reserve MCII model an asymmetry is apparent. For the U.S.—— the large

country—— foreign repercussions and the particulars of foreign policy

responses are relatively unimportant in their impact on inflation and

growth. For foreign countries, by contrast, the details of U.S. policy have

a major impact. This asymmetry should be expected to influence the nature of

Europe's policy responses to U.S. actions.



V. Excess Capital Mobility and Policy Responses

and Sachs (1984).

          In this concluding section we consider policy issues that follow

from the the fact that macroeconomic disturbances exert significant excess

effects on real exchange rates, trade flows, and on the standard of living.

There are broadly two approaches: one is to accept the fact of international

effects   of disturbances. The other is to interfere with capital flows in

order to pursue more freely macroeconomic objectives.



Target Zones and Exchange Rate Oriented Monetary Policy:

          A strong case for some form of managed exchange rates is returning

in the aftermath of the extreme exchange rate fluctuations. In particular,

among those arguing for more fixed exchange rates are Williamson (i983) and

McKinnon (t984}.

          The McKinnon position for a fixed exchange rate has at its center

the assumption that international portfolio shifts are behind exchange rate

movements. In an initial version of this argument shifts between M in one

country and another were the source of disturbance. Monetary authorities,

being committed to national monetary targets would not accommodate these

money demand shifts, and exchange rate volatility was seen as the inevitable

consequence. More recent versions of the hypothesis recognize that

international portfolio shifts are more likely to take the form of shifts in

the demand for interest bearing assets denominated in different currencies,

But the recommendation remains to fix exchange rates, using exchange rate
                                   31




oriented monetary policy to hold rates and accommodate money demand shifts.

 In other words unsterilized intervention is to be used.

        This policy recommendation prescribes exactly the wrong kind of

intervention. To offset the exchange rate impact of shifts in the demand for

bonds the currency denomination of the world bond portfolio should be

allowed to change. That means sterilized intervention is the correct answer.

In response to exchange rate appreciation the authorities should intervene,

leaving money supplies unchanged but increasing the supply of home bonds and

reducing the supply of foreign currency bonds. That, of course, is

sterilized intervention. The case for sterilized intervention is well—

established, and has been a basic principle of asset market management ever

since Pooles authoritative analysis of the choice between interest rate and

monetary targets. The remaining problem, of course, is to determine whether

it is portfolio shifts or shifts in fundamentals that are moving rates.

        The case for fixing exchange rates whatever the source of

disturbance is advanced by those favoring target zones. Their position is

that exchange rates do not necessarily reflect fundamentals but rather

irrationality, band wagons, and eccentricity. The large movements in

exchange rates interfere with macroeconomic stability, but they can and

should be avoided by a firm commitment to exchange rate targets. Qn the

surface it is difficult to see any difficulty with this prescription, but on

further inspection two serious difficulties emerge. First, it is certainly

not an established fact that exchange rates move irrationally and without
                                       32




links   to fundamentals. Nor, if they do move in this way, is it clear that

they do so more than stock prices or longterm bond prices. Why single out

one price for fixing if it may mean that the other prices have to move even

further away from their fundamental equilibrium levels?

           The second objection   concerns a lack of   instrument;. Governments are

unlikely    to agree on coordinating their fiscal policies. But if real
exchange rates are to remain fixed in the face of uncoordinated fiscal

policy changes then monetary accommodation is required. In the context of

the dollar appreciation of 1980—5, for example, that would have meant a more

agressively expansionary monetary policy in the U.S. and hence no

disinflation. It is questionable whether the objective of fixed rates is

sufficiently important to warrant bad monetary policy.Lo

Policies Toward Excess Capital Mobility:

         But there is an alternative, extreme answer to international

exchange rate instability which is more attractive. The stickiness of wages

relative to exchange rates creates a macroeconomic externality which

possibly justifies closing or restricting some markets. Tobin (1982) has

made the case for throwing more sand into the international financial

system, so as to reduce the overwhelming influence of capital flows over

productive   activity   and trade. The proposal, known as the "Tobin tax",

involves a uniform ta on all foreign exchange transactions, to be levied in



10For a further discussion see Fischer (19B6).
                                  33




all countries of the world. The consequence of the tax is to make short term

hot money roundtrips unprofitable. Under this system capital flows would

therefore be more nearly geared to considerations of the long term

profitability of investment rather than the overnight speculation which now

dominates.

        It might be argued that it is too late for stopping the flow of

international capital flows, that throwing sand in the wheels is no longer

sufficient. But why stop there and not use rocks? An operational way of

doing this is to use a managed rate for current account transactions so as

to achieve stability of inflation and of real activity and at the same time

employing a separate or dual exchange rate for capital account transactions.

If capital markets are irrational and primarily speculative it might be as

well to detach them altogether from an influence on real activity. Rather

than use scarce macro policy tools to adapt the real sector to the

idiosyncracy of financial markets, a separate exchange rate would detach the

capital account and deprive it from distorting influences on trade and

inflation.




11For a discussion of a dual rate system and extensive references to

the literature see Dornbusch (1986c).
