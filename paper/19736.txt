By 2015, global oil consumption will reach 90 million barrels per day. In part, this high level of consumption
reflects the fact that many countries provide subsidies for gasoline and diesel. This paper examines
global fuel subsidies using the latest available data from the World Bank, finding that road-sector subsidies
for gasoline and diesel totaled $110 billion in 2012. Pricing fuels below cost is inefficient because
it leads to overconsumption. Under baseline assumptions about supply and demand elasticities, the
total annual deadweight loss worldwide is $44 billion. Incorporating external costs increases the economic
costs substantially.

    By 2015, global oil consumption will reach 90 million barrels per day.1
In part, this high level of consumption reflects the fact that many countries
provide subsidies for gasoline and diesel. This paper examines global fuel
subsidies using the latest available data from the World Bank, finding that
road-sector subsidies for gasoline and diesel totaled $110 billion in 2012.
Pricing fuels below cost is inefficient because it leads to overconsumption.
Under baseline assumptions about supply and demand elasticities, the total
annual deadweight loss worldwide is $44 billion. Incorporating external costs
increases the economic costs substantially.


1        Fuel Prices
Figure 1 plots road-sector gasoline consumption per capita and gasoline
prices for 128 countries. A plot of diesel consumption and prices is available
in the online appendix. Prices are domestic consumer prices including taxes
and come from a survey administered November 2012. The size of the circles
is proportional to country population.
        The figure reveals an enormous amount of variation in gasoline prices.
Gasoline prices average $5.26 per gallon, but range from $.09 per gallon in
Venezuela to above $9.00 in Turkey and Norway. Diesel prices tend to be a
bit lower, averaging $4.12 per gallon, with a range from $.04 to above $7.00.

                                                  Figure 1: Gasoline Consumption and Prices Worldwide



This wide variation in prices is somewhat surprising because crude oil and
refined products are widely traded internationally, so the opportunity cost of
fuels is similar everywhere. Although there are differences in transportation,
refining, and distribution costs, they can explain only a small part of the
observed variation in prices.
   Instead, the more important explanation for the wide variation in fuel
prices is that taxes and subsidies differ widely. Among OECD countries,
gasoline taxes per gallon range from an average of $0.49 in the United States,
to above $4.00 in Germany and the Netherlands (Knittel, 2012). Outside
the OECD the range is even larger, and there are dozens of countries that
subsidize gasoline and diesel, selling it for below its price in international
markets. Many of these countries are in the Middle East, though Asia
(Malaysia, Indonesia), Africa (Egypt, Nigeria, Algeria) and South America
(Venezuela, Ecuador, Bolivia) are also represented.
   Gasoline consumption tends to be high in countries where gasoline is


                                                                                                          2
subsidized. Saudi Arabia, for example, has experienced a nine-fold increase
in fuels consumption since 1971 and is now the sixth largest oil consumer in
the world (Gately et al., 2012). Venezuela is another particularly illustrative
example. Gasoline consumption per capita in Venezuela is 40% higher than
in any other country in Latin America, and more than three times the
regional average.
    Figure 2 shows the countries with the largest fuel subsidies. The im-
plied subsidy per gallon was calculated as the difference between domestic
consumer prices and international spot prices. Transport, distribution, and
retailing costs were incorporated following IMF (2013). The implied sub-
sidy per gallon was then multiplied by road-sector consumption of each fuel
to calculate the total dollar value. By this measure, there are 24 countries
that subsidize gasoline, and 35 countries that subsidize diesel. The United
States, by this measure, does not subsidize gasoline or diesel.2
    Total subsidies worldwide in 2012 were $110 billion, with about $55
billion each for gasoline and diesel. The top ten countries represent 90% of
total global subsidies. Many of these countries are major oil producers. Fuel
subsidies have long been viewed in many oil-producing countries as a way
to share the resource wealth with a nation’s citizens. This is not the view
in all major oil-producing countries, however. Prices are at or above market
in Iraq ($2.95 per gallon for gasoline), Mexico ($3.26), Russia ($3.74), and
Canada ($5.00).
    The following section calculates the deadweight loss from these fuel sub-
sidies. This focus on countries with low fuel prices is somewhat arbitrary.
Just as there is deadweight loss from prices that are too low, there is also
deadweight loss from prices that are too high. The United Kingdom ($8.21
per gallon), Italy ($8.63), Netherlands ($8.82), and Turkey ($9.61), for ex-
ample, would all seem to be possible candidates. While it is true that traffic
congestion and other external costs vary substantially across locations, these
   2
     This measure of fuel subsidies captures consumption subsidies but not production
subsidies. Aldy (2013) reports that U.S. oil, gas, and coal producers receive $4 billion
annually in tax deductions, favorable depreciation schedules, and other production subsi-
dies. Because there is a world oil market, production subsidies have almost no impact on
consumer prices.

countries have prices that are high enough that it becomes difficult to jus-
tify on the basis of externalities (Parry and Small, 2005). Governments
with both low and high prices are presumably pursuing some objective (e.g.
redistribution, revenue collection, etc.) but these goals must be weighed
against the distortions that are imposed.


2    Deadweight Loss
Subsidies create deadweight loss by enabling transactions for which the
buyer’s willingness-to-pay is below the opportunity cost. The total amount
of deadweight loss depends on the elasticities of demand and supply. The
more elastic are demand and supply, the larger the deadweight loss from
pricing below cost. In the short-run, demand and supply for crude oil are
both inelastic (Hamilton, 2009). However, the economic cost of subsidies
depends on the long-run elasticities. Estimates in the literature for the


                                     4
long-run elasticity of demand for transportation fuels tend to range from
-0.6 to -0.8 (Brons et al., 2008). The analysis which follows adopts -0.6.
Total global deadweight loss is 18% higher when -0.8 is used instead.
   Demand is described using a constant elasticity demand function with
a scale parameter that varies across countries and fuels. As described in
the online appendix, current prices and consumption levels are first used to
calculate the complete set of scale parameters. These demand functions are
then used to predict consumption at market prices and to calculate dead-
weight loss. Preliminary calculations suggest that estimates of deadweight
loss would be similar with a linear demand curve, but it would be useful in
future analyses to more fully explore alternative functional forms.
   Supply is assumed to be perfectly elastic. The infrastructure for trans-
portation, refining, and distribution can be scaled up at near constant
marginal cost, so what matters is the long-run supply elasticity for crude
oil. This elasticity is extremely difficult to measure empirically, but in the
long-run there clearly is a great deal of scope for global oil producers to
respond to crude oil prices. This is particularly true with improved shale oil
techniques and other emerging technologies that have opened up vast new
production areas. Incorporating less than perfectly elastic supply would
decrease the estimated global deadweight loss only modestly because fuel
consumption in most countries is small relative to the world oil market.
   Under these assumptions, the total global deadweight loss from fuel sub-
sidies in 2012 is $44 billion. This is split roughly evenly between gasoline
($20 billion) and diesel ($24 billion). Figure 3 reports deadweight loss by
country. Saudi Arabia takes the top spot with $12 billion in deadweight
loss. Venezuela is number two with $10 billion.
   In 2012, Venezuela had the cheapest fuels on the planet so even though
the total dollar value of subsidies is higher in Iran and Indonesia, the subsi-
dies in Venezuela impose more economic cost because the subsidy per gallon
is so high. Deadweight loss increases approximately with the square of the
subsidy amount so it is extremely concentrated among countries with the
very largest subsidies. The big two, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela, repre-
sent 50% of total global deadweight loss, while only representing 34% of the

dollar value of subsidies.
    When expressed per capita the pattern of deadweight loss is similar.
Saudi Arabia remains in the top spot, with $450 in annual deadweight loss
per capita. Indonesia, Egypt, and Ecuador fall out of the top ten and are
replaced with Bahrain, Brunei, and Oman. See the online appendix for
details.


3    Incorporating External Costs
Fuel subsidies are different from subsidies in most other markets because of
the substantial external costs. Parry et al. (2007) goes through the complete
list, finding that marginal external damages are $1.11 per gallon. Carbon
dioxide emissions are an important component, but this also includes emis-
sions of local pollutants, traffic congestion, and accidents. The $1.11 per
gallon also reflects that many externalities scale by miles traveled, rather


                                      6
than by gallons consumed, and so marginal external damages depend on the
fraction of the demand elasticity that comes from reduced mileage.
    Eliminating subsidies for gasoline and diesel would, with a -0.6 demand
elasticity, decrease global fuel consumption by 29 billion gallons per year.
At $1.11 per gallon this excess consumption imposes external costs worth
$32 billion annually. Combined with the estimated deadweight loss ($44
billion), the total economic cost of fuel subsidies is $76 billion annually. The
global market for gasoline and diesel was $1.7 trillion in 2012, so this is 4%
of the market.
    This is the economic cost of pricing fuels below private cost. An alter-
native calculation would be to measure the deadweight loss relative to the
full social cost of fuels consumption. This would include the deadweight
loss ($44 billion) and external cost ($32 billion) from pricing below private
cost, but also the additional welfare loss from units transacted for which
willingness-to-pay is above private cost but below social cost. Deadweight
loss under this counterfactual is $92 billion.
    Much of the increased deadweight loss in this alternative calculation
comes from the United States, where gasoline and diesel prices are above
private cost but below social cost. When ranked by country, the United
States appears in spot number four, behind only Saudi Arabia, Venezuela,
and Iran.


4    Conclusion
Previous studies have calculated the dollar value of global fuel subsidies
(IEA (2012); IMF (2013)), but this paper goes one step further and cal-
culates the economic cost. While undoubtedly these calculations could be
refined substantially, the analysis makes it clear that fuel subsidies are not
just benign transfers from sellers to buyers. Under reasonable assumptions
about supply and demand elasticities, the economic cost of overconsumption
is very large.
    Fuel subsidies also have a large impact on government budgets, requir-
ing taxes to be higher than they would otherwise, and inhibiting the ability

                                       7
of government to address other fiscal objectives. Expenditures on energy
subsidies in many of these countries exceed public expenditures on health,
education, and other key components of government spending. Understand-
ing these fiscal impacts is an important priority for future work.
   It will also be important to continue to study the distributional conse-
quences of fuel subsidies. A recent set of international case studies finds
that fuel subsidies are not particularly effective at redistribution (Sterner,
ed, 2012), but more work is needed.
   Finally, in future work it will be important to expand the analysis to
include other energy markets. Fuel subsidies are only one part of a larger
set of energy subsidies. Coal, natural gas, and electricity, for example, are all
widely subsidized. Recent analyses of the broader energy sector find that the
total dollar value of global energy subsidies is almost $500 billion annually
(IEA (2012); IMF (2013)) and much more can be done to understand and
quantify the economic costs of these policies.

  Not For Publication Appendix: Calculating Deadweight Loss

  Demand for gasoline and diesel are described using a constant elasticity
demand function, q = Ap with a scale parameter A that varies across
countries and fuels, price p, and elasticity . This demand function is used
to predict consumption under market prices and to calculate deadweight loss.
Let p0 and p1 denote the subsidized price and market price, respectively and
let q0 and q1 denote consumption levels corresponding to those prices.
    For an assumed demand elasticity, e.g., −0.6, and observed consumption
level at the subsidized price q0 it is straightforward to calculate the scale
parameter for a given country and fuel. The demand function can then be
used to predict consumption at the market price.
    Deadweight loss can be calculated as the shaded area in Figure A2. Start
with the rectangle (p1 − p0 )q0 , and then substract off the area to the left
of the demand curve between the subsidized price p0 and market price p1 .
This can be described with the following equation,
                                            Z p1
                     DW L = (p1 − p0 )q0 −       Ap dp.
                                                  p0

   Evaluating the integral yields,
                                          A      (1+)    (1+)
               DW L = (p1 − p0 )q0 −          [p       − p0     ].        (1)
                                       (1 + ) 1


   Another, equivalent approach for calculating the same area is to start
with the inverse demand function,

                               p = (A−1 Q)1/

and calculate the area below the demand curve between q0 and q1 , and then
substract this from the rectangle (q1 − q0 )p1 ,
                                            Z q0
                                                    1 1
                   DW L = (q0 − q1 )p1 −         A−  q  dq.
                                             q1

   Evaluating the integral yields,
                                            1 1
                   DW L = (q0 − q1 )p1 − A−  [q0η − q1η ].               (2)
                                              η

where η =      + 1.

    It is helpful to go through an example. In Saudi Arabia the price of
gasoline (p0 ) in 2012 was $0.61, and consumption (q0 ) was 5,637 million
gallons. Rearranging the demand function to solve for A yields,

                       A = q0 p0 − = 5637 ∗ 0.610.6 = 4190.

    So at the market price $2.82 the demand equation implies that consump-
tion would be equal to,

                       q1 = Ap1  = 4190 ∗ 2.82−0.6 = 2241.

    Thus this demand function implies that, in the long run, gasoline con-
sumption would fall from 5,637 million gallons to 2,241 million gallons were
prices to increase to $2.82.

   Using equation (1), deadweight loss is equal to,
                                        4190
  DW L = ($2.82 − $0.61) ∗ 5637 −             [$2.82(0.4) − $0.61(0.4) ] = $5195.
                                        (0.4)

Or, $5.2 billion in deadweight loss in the gasoline market for 2012.

   Using equation (2), deadweight loss is equal to,
                                        −1    1
DW L = (5637−2249)∗$2.82−4190 −0.6                [5637−2/3 −2241−2/3 ] = $5195.
                                             −2/3

Or $5.2 billion. As expected, both approaches yield the same measure for
deadweight loss.
