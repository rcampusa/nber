                      Productivity in American Whaling:
               The New Bedford Fleet in the Nineteenth Century



                                   ABSTRACT


     From the end of the War of 1812 until the Civil War the New Bedford
whaling fleet grew spectacularly; thereafter it declined, equally
spectacularly. By the end of the century New Bedford's day was over. During
the 88 years of this period, the technical configuration of the fleet, the
hunting grounds visited, and the types of whales pursued all changed
dramatically, and more than once.

     The literature on whaling suggests that the collapse of the industry was
due, in part, to declining productivity, occasioned by the disappearance of
the whales (because of over—hunting) and the deterioration of the quality of
labor. The shifts in the composition of the fleet are viewed, chiefly, as the
result of efforts by whalemen to overcome their problems.

     In this paper, productivity data (superlative indexes), by voyage, are
employed in multiple regression analysis to trace the relationships between
the changes in the composition of the fleet and productivity. The propositions
that declining labor quality and whale stocks had important consequences for
productivity are subjected to test, while the impacts of technical changes on
productivity are measured.

(1) Introduction

     In economics, productivity change is often associated with technical

change, an inward movement of a production frontier. Looking at the matter

from the level of the firm, where, after all, the principal relevant

decisions are made, it is customary to focus on the choice of an

appropriate technology, with attention devoted to the role of factor prices

in determining exactly where on the frontier the firm will locate its

production activities.'

     Life in the firm, however, is likely to be more complex than this

model suggests. Frequently there are many productive operations, and each

could be affected by a variety of alternative techniques. Each technique,

in turn, may employ a range of types of labor and forms of capital. Over

time, techniques, factor prices, and output prices all can change. New

opportunities crop up and new problems appear. The defensive actions of

the firm faced by a new problem may be as important (by preventing the

deterioration of productivity) as the firm's decision to exploit a new

opportunity. Finally, the level of productivity may be importantly

influenced by decisions that are only peripherally (if at all) related to

matters of production technique in the usual sense of the phrase. The

decision to open a new source of a raw material or to exploit a new market

are two obvious examples.

     This paper examines productivity in the context of the complete web of

entrepreneurial decisions influencing production. We are interested in the

reactions of entrepreneurs to shifting opportunities and problems, the ways

in which decisions about technique are related to other business decisions,

and the relative weights of the factors influencing productivity.

     Whaling was competitive - -   the   industry was made up of many,

relatively small, firms. Major decisions were in the hands of the whaling
                                      2

agent who hired the crew, rigged and provisioned the vessel, laid plans for

the voyage, provided the captain with access to overseas credit and with

information and guidance before and during the voyage.2 We are interested

in the choices the agents made, the influence of exogenous developments on

these choices, and the impact of the agent's decisions on the productivity

of the venture. The unit of analysis is the individual whaling voyage, for

the voyage was the focus of all of these decisions.

     Part (2) provides a brief historical and economic background. Part

(3) describes the data set, and Part (4), the system for measuring

productivity. Part (5) lays out the opportunities and problems facing

agents and the choices they were obliged to make. It also develops the

variables that figure in the empirical analysis. Part (6) contains the

empirical analysis, and Part (7) is a summary of conclusions.



(2) Historical Economic Background

     In July of 1842 seaman Herman Melville deserted the whaler Acushnet in

the Marquesas, where he spent a month with the natives of the Taipi Valley.

He subsequently treated this experience in his novel Typee. Before he

finally reached home he had material for three more books, Omoo, Mardi, and

Moby-Dick. The first two were based on visits to Tahiti and Eimo,

occasioned by a second desertion (this time from an Australian whaler), the

last, on Melville's life aboard the Acushnet and later the Nantucket whaler

Charles and Henry, on which he served as boatsteerer. The dates of

Melville's sailing from Fairhaven aboard the Acushnet, January 1841, and of

his publication of Moby-Dick, October 1851 (in London, under the title ]

Whale), nicely delineate the apogee of American whaling.
    Although the peak of American whaling occurred in 1841-1851, the
                                      3

history of the industry spanned centuries. It began with the first

colonial settlements along the east coast of North America and persisted,

albeit weakly, until 1974 when whaling was finally outlawed.3 Long before

whaling became illegal, the mode of whaling celebrated by Melville had

disappeared and had been replaced by modern methods pioneered by the

Norwegians. The Americans never adopted the new techniques on a large

scale and were effectively out of whaling by the beginning of World War I.

The industry has changed in other ways as well. Modern whalers seek whale

meat and cooking oils, rather than the illuminants, lubricants, and

structural materials brought back by Melville's whalemen. Modern whaling

is therefore an entirely new industry, prosecuted by new techniques in

pursuit of new ends.

     By the outbreak of the Revolution, the American whaling industry had

evolved from a land-based operation into a deep-sea industry. In its

earliest stages whalemen stuck close to shore, Whales were sighted from

the beach and hunted down from small boats. The process of rendering the

blubber into oil took place on land. Gradually, however, whalemen left the

shore, and instead of waiting for whales to swim close to land, went

looking for the whales. Technological change and geographical expansion

occurred rapidly. By the 1770's the process of rendering blubber had been

moved aboard the vessel, and Yankee whalemen were routinely cruising the

Atlantic from Newfoundland to the Falkland Islands.4

     Favorable market conditions helped to foster these developments.

Blessed with a growing export market in Great Britain, the colonial whale

fishery expanded until 1774 when, in the words of Alexander Starbuck, the

Revolutionary War caught the industry in its "full tide of success."5 For

the next forty years it suffered a series of major economic reversals, and
                                      4

at no time were conditions stable long enough to allow it to experience any

period of sustained growth.6

     Although our subject is the American whaling industry, most of the

material used in this paper refers to vessels that sailed from New Bedford,

Massachusetts. Nantucket had been the principal American whaling port at

the beginning of the nineteenth century, and San Francisco assumed that

position at the end. In the years between 1825 and 1890, however, New

Bedford dominated the industry. Subject to some year-to-year variation,

over those sixty-five years, the port's vessels, on average, represented

more than fifty percent of the nation's whaling tonnage (see Table 1).

Moreover, while vessels from other ports tended to specialize in certain

whaling grounds and in either sperm or baleen whales, the New Bedford

whalers ranged over all the world's hunting grounds and sought both species

of whales. Thus the New Bedford whalers not only constitute a

representative sample of the American industry, but they also present a

microcosmic picture of the behavior of the firms that made up the industry.

     Our study encompasses more than half of the American industry; the

Americans, in turn, operated about eight-tenths of the world's whaling

fleet over the last eight decades of the 19th century. There had been some

British competition before the 1840's; the Australians hunted whales

throughout the period; and, after the mid 1890's, the Norwegians dominated

the industry; but between 1820 and 1890 the industry was virtually an

American monopoly.

    Marine biologists inform us that there are two types of proper whales:

the baleen (suborder Mysticeti) and the catchelot (suborder Odonoceti). In

the 19th century the Americans hunted one variety of catchelot (the sperm

whale) and four varieties of baleen: the right, the gray, the bowhead, and
                                      5


the humpback.

     The five varieties do not all inhabit the same parts of the ocean.

Sperm whales are found in the tropical and subtropical regions of the

Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian oceans. The rights prefer cooler waters.

They travel in the North Atlantic from Bermuda to Greenland, in the North

Pacific from Japan to the Pacific Northwest and as far north as the Arctic

circle, and in the South Atlantic from Brazil, and in South Pacific from

Chile, to the Antarctic ocean. The whalers looked for bowheads in the

Arctic ocean, the Okhotsk Sea, the Bering Straits, and the North Pacific

above the 54th parallel; however, since those animals had discovered the

Northwest Passage centuries before Martin Frobisher began his fruitless

search, they also appeared in Hudson's Bay and in Davis Strait. Like the

sperms and rights, the humpbacks and grays inhabit the more temperate

climes.

     During the first few decades of the nineteenth century, sperm oil and

spermacete were used primarily as illuminants. Spermacete, a solid, made

the highest quality candles; sperm oil was burned in lighthouses and public

buildings where high intensity illumination was required. In the second

and particularly in the third quarter of the century, sperm oil came to be

used increasingly as a lubricant to ease the movements of light, rapidly

moving machines (the spindles of cotton and woolen mills, for example). In

fact, the expansion of sperm oil production after 1830 matches very closely

the rise of the cotton textile industry.

     Whale oil, obtained from the blubber of baleen whales, was the

illuminant chosen by the average consumer. Technically inferior to sperm

oil both as an illuminant and as a lubricant, its relatively low price made

it one of the most popular lamp fuels in the 1820's, '30's, and early
                                      6

'40's.7 By the latter dates whale oil began to face ever stiffening

competition from new illuminants (coal oil, coal gas, and, in the 1850's,

kerosene), but total sales held up fairly well as manufacturers began to

use it to lubricate their heavy machinery.8

     Whalebone, or baleen, is not really whale bone but the bone-like

screen that the whale uses as a filter to separate its food (kriil) from

sea water. In the nineteenth century, whalebone was used in the

manufacture of stays, corsets, hoops, whips, umbrellas, carriage shades,

and almost any other product that required a strong flexible material - -

needs now met by plastics and specialty steels.

     The quantity of sperm oil that the fleet brought home increased

rapidly from 1820 until the late 1830's. Then growth ceased, although

output remained fairly constant until the middle of the next decade. By

the late 1840's, however, the catch had begun to decline. The fall

continued, although with some significant pauses, until the end of the

century (see Table 2). The real price of sperm oil doubled between 1820

and 1850 but then began to fall; by the end of the century the price was no

higher than it had been in 1820.

     The quantity of whale oil that the captains brought back to New

Bedford increased until the early 1850's, stabilized until the Civil War,

and then began an almost continuous decline. In no post-helium year did

output come close to matching its pre-war peak. Over the nine decades the

real price of whale oil displayed a profile that was similar to that of

sperm oil except that the decline in the second half of the century was

more gentle. Over most of the period the ratio of the price of sperm oil

to the price of whale oil averaged about 2:1; by 1900, however, the ratio

had fallen to 3:2.
                                          7

     At the beginning of the nineteenth century whalebone was in such small

demand that captains often refused to surrender the valuable storage space

needed to bring it back. Gradually, as demand increased, returning cargoes

contained more and more of the strong, flexible material. By the Civil

War, high prices --   prices   inflated by the fashions of the day - - made

whalebone a very desirable addition to a whaler's catch. Indeed, the case

can be made that it was the growing demand for whalebone that kept the

fishery profitable and encouraged the pursuit of the Arctic bowhead. Like

whale oil, the quantity of whalebone brought back increased yearly until

the mid 1850's, peaked at that time, and then began to decline. Output

recovered some ground in the 1880's, but even at that time it did not reach

the levels attained before the War. Because of the rapid rise in price,

however, the value of the bone brought back continued to rise.10 The real

price, in fact, rose from $.lO a pound in 1820 to more than $5.00 a pound

in 1905. Exports of baleen (primarily to England, France, and Germany)

commanded a significant proportion of total output over the entire

nineteenth century.11

     Given the similarity in the production paths of all three of the

industry's major products, it should not come as a surprise that the

fortunes of the industry improved steadily from the end of the War of 1812

until some time in the mid 1850's and then gradually declined. The

industry had, in fact, all but disappeared by the time of the Archduke's

assassination in the streets of Sarajevo. The real value of the industry's

total output was about $1.2 million in 1820, it had reached $12 million by

mid-century, but it had fallen to less than $1.2 million fifty years later.

     The geographic dispersion of the stock of whales meant that New

Bedford whalers could be found all over the world. The chronicler of the
                                      8

port's fleet lists no fewer than fifty-one whaling grounds, but for our

analysis the fifty-one have been grouped into four: (1) the Atlantic Ocean,

Hudson's Bay and Davis Strait, (2) the Indian Ocean, (3) the Pacific Ocean,

and (4) the Western Arctic.

     If interest centers on their relative contribution to New Bedford's

prosperity over the entire ninety-year period, the list, in order of

importance, would be the Pacific, the Atlantic, the Indian, and finally,

the Arctic; however, within those nine decades the contribution of

individual grounds ebbed and flowed (see Table 3). There were, for

example, no voyages to any of the western grounds in the last decade of the

period. The Indian Ocean drew a significant fraction of the city's fleet

only in the middle decades, a period that saw almost no vessels hunting in

the Atlantic. Finally, although the Arctic drew whaling captains from New

Bedford in only four of the nine decades, during those four decades it was

by far the most profitable.

     It is a long way from New Bedford to the Arctic Ocean. The vessels

employed in the trade depended on the wind for power, and once on station

it was still necessary to find the whales. As a result, voyages were long,

averaging almost three years (see Table 4). Over time, the length of a

typical voyage increased. Although the increase was due in part to the

opening of grounds further and further removed from the New England coast,

it was also due to a non-trivial increase in the length of stay in each

ground. A trip to the Atlantic averaged less than two years while a

typical voyage to the Arctic or Pacific, which might have taken only two

years when the ground first opened, took almost four in the 1870's.

    As the whaling fleets of New England began to hunt more extensively in

the Pacific, captains found it efficient to restock and refit during a
                                       9

voyage. In response to these needs the ports of Honolulu and Lahaina

emerged as rendezvous points. There whalers could pick up fresh

provisions, recruit new seamen, and repair their vessels. Beginning about

1840 the Hawaiian ports and Panama also became important centers for

transshipnients of oil and bone.12 Captains wishing to continue whaling

were able to ship their catch on whalers or merchant ships returning to New

England.

     Despite the widespread innovation of iron ships and steam power in the

passenger and carrying trades, the New Bedford whalers that undertook those

three- and four-year voyages were virtually all sailing vessels. Ships,

barks, brigs, sloops, and schooners all found employment in whaling, but

most of the fleet was made up of ships and barks. Taken together the

brigs, sloops, and schooners made up less than five percent of the number

of vessels in the New Bedford total, and they represented only two percent

of the city's total whaling tonnage.

     Ships accounted for fifty-six percent of the number of vessels that

sailed from New Bedford. They were relatively large vessels, averaging

about 350 tons, but they were set apart from the barks, brigs, sloops, and

schooners not so much by their relatively greater size as by their rigging.

They had three square-rigged masts (i.e., sails were set on yard arms

attached at the center to the masts). The barks that made up thirty-nine

percent of the vessels operating out of New Bedford were on average, at 285

tons, smaller than the ships. More importantly, they were square-rigged on

the fore and main masts and fore-and-aft rigged on the mizzen (i.e., on the

rear mast sails were set vertically and were attached directly to the mast

and to the stern of the vessel). The average size of both classes of

vessel rose over the first four decades. For the increase was about twenty
                                      10

percent, for barks, about twice that. Thus by the 1860's when a typical

ship had attained a size of about 380 tons an average bark was 320.

     Ships were the rigging of choice when the industry emerged from the

wartime doldrums and they retained that position through most of the period

of expansion (see Table 5). Gradually, however, the number of barks

increased in absolute and, even more impressively, as the fleet began to

contract, in relative terms. In 1845 there had been one bark for every 5.3

ships; by 1875 the ratio had been reversed, and there was one bark for

every .53 ships.

     The post-bellum increase in the proportion of barks underscores two

characteristics of the whaling fleet. First, the capital stock was very

malleable. Even as vessels shifted from whaling to the merchant marine and

the whaling fleet contracted, new barks were constructed and ships were

rerigged as barks. Second, as the demand for whalebone rose, the bowheads

of the Arctic became an ever more favored target; the rise in the

importance of that northern ground, with its ice bergs and ice pack, put an

increased premium on maneuverability - -   an   important feature of the bark-

rigged vessel.

     Although barks were better able to escape the winter freeze, losses at

sea of all types of vessels were very high. Of the approximately seven

hundred and fifty vessels that sailed at least once from New Bedford in

search of whales, no fewer than two hundred and thirty-one were lost. The

crude loss rate per voyage averaged almost nine percent; the loss rate per

year at sea was 3.2 percent (2.6 for ships, 3.5 for barks, and an

astounding 8.6 percent for the brigs, schooners, and sloops that made up

the remainder of the fleet -- see Table 6).

    No summary of the industry could be complete without some mention of
                                     11

the men who manned the whalers. On average, twenty-seven men (including

three or four officers) were needed to sail and hunt a ship. Because a

bark was, on average, smaller, it required only about twenty-three (see

Table 7). However, although the bark used a smaller crew, it actually

represented a more labor-intensive technology; the trade-off faced by the

agent who planned the voyage was between greater maneuverability and higher

labor costs. Over time, average crew size increased for both classes of

vessel. In the case of ships, for example, the figure rose from twenty-one

to thirty-three. Although average vessel size was increasing, the size of

the crew was rising even more rapidly; between 1820 and 1905 the

labor/capital ratio rose by about fifteen percent.

     Whaling was a risky enterprise. A sailor risked life and limb. The

owner risked the loss of his vessel, and, depending upon the luck of the

hunt, he also faced financial feast or famine. In an attempt to spread the

risk, the owners and seamen adopted a system of labor payments that made

remuneration depend on the success of the voyage.

     Every member of the crew was entitled to a fraction (a lay) of the net

receipts of the voyage. On average, the total labor share amounted to

slightly more than one-third of the receipts from the sale of the catch.

Although there are examples of total lays as low as twenty-six percent and

as high as thirty-seven percent, the average was about thirty-four.

Individual crewmen were compensated on the basis of the position held and

their level of skill and experience. Thus a captain's share was typically

about one-sixteenth, but there were voyages where the captain received as

much as one-eight and others where his pay fell as low as one-twentieth.

Progressively smaller shares were allocated to the other officers, the

cooper, the boatsteerers, seamen, other artisans (blacksmiths, carpenters,
                                     12

sailmakers, etc.), ordinary seamen, greenhands, and boys. The latter, the

youngest and least skilled crewmen, typically received a share of about

one-two hundred and fiftieth.

     The industry expanded and then contracted, and that pattern is

reflected in the catch and profit figures. In the case of sperm oil, there

is evidence of some decrease in the catch as new vessels entered, but, as

exit reduced competition, it appears to have rebounded strongly (see Table

8). For whale oil, however, the pattern is one of fairly continuous

decline. Finally, while the pattern for whalebone is somewhat mixed, it

appears that the "catch" increased to about 1850, remained at those levels

until the mid 1880's, and then fell as the New Bedford fleet, faced with

competition from vessels based on the West Coast, began to withdraw from

the Arctic grounds.

     The trends in catch correlate closely with the movements in profits

(see Table 9). Profits appear to have declined through the mid 1850's -- a

decline most likely associated with increased competition -- and then, as

competition lessened, they increased once again. The post-bellum increase

was sufficient to return industry profits to the levels that had prevailed

in the earlier years.

     Of perhaps even greater interest, however, is the average level of the

industry's profits. Although subject to a great deal of year-to-year (and

voyage-to-voyage) variation, the average appears to have been about forty-

five percent per year (with allowance for vessels lost at sea). That

figure is consistent with contemporary observations; it provides some

insight into the level of "normal" profits in a risky, but competitive,

industry. Certainly it does suggest the motivation that induced ship

owners to continue to send their vessels out in search of whales even when
                                     13

there was one chance in ten that the vessel would not return. As late as

1900, although ships appear to have proved no longer profitable, the owners

of the fifteen or so barks, brigs, sloops and schooners that remained in

the fleet were earning nearly seventy percent per year on their investment.



(3) Sources of Data

     At the heart of the analysis presented in this paper is a set of

measurements of productivity computed at the level of the individual

voyage. Most, but not all, of the whaling voyages that ended at New

Bedford in the years 1820-1906 are represented in the data set. The

productivity estimates enter as dependent variables in a regression

analysis designed to explain the variations of productivity across voyages.

     The principal source of data is a Baker Library manuscript produced by

Joseph Dias, probably a whaling captain himself, and certainly the son and

grandson of whaling captains.13 Dias apparently took his data from ships

logs, newspapers, and port records, as did those better- known students of

whaling, Alexander Starbuck and Reginald B. Hegarty.14 The Dias manuscript

covers a longer period of time than do the works of Starbuck or Hegarty,

and it is organized by vessel. Both the Starbuck and Hegarty volumes are

organized by voyage, a much less convenient system. The Starbuck and

Hegarty volumes, together with Whaling Masters, were used to check Dias and

to fill out his record, but Dias is the primary source of the analyses in

this paper.15

     Dias recorded the following information for each New Bedford

whaling vessel:

     (1) the dates of each of its voyages (sailing and return),

     (2) the names of the captain and agent at each voyage,
                                          14

     (3) the vessel type (ship, bark, brig, sioop, schooner)

     (4) the date and place of construction (usually),

     (5) incidents of rerigging (ships were sometimes rerigged as barks),

     (6) the mode of exit from the fleet (condemnation, transfer to

another port, loss by sinking, running aground, fire, etc.),

     (7) the product of each voyage, in physical units (sperm oil, whale

oil, whalebone, occasionally other products),

     (8) hunting grounds visited (Dias identified 51, which we combined

into four: (a) the Atlantic Ocean, Davis Strait, and Hudson's Bay; (b) the

Indian Ocean; (c) the Pacific Ocean; (d) the Arctic Sea north of the

Pacific, Bering Strait, and Okhotsk Sea),

     (9) the tonnage of the vessel (a measure of capacity),16

     (10) quite rich notes on events of the voyage, particularly touching

the loss of men to disease, accidents aboard, desertion, and the attacks of

whales, mutineers, islanders of the northern and southern seas.

     The mode of entry into the fleet - -      construction   or transfer in from

another port or the merchant marine -- can be inferred from the

construction and voyage data.

     While the Dias data set contains a good deal of information on

capital, output, and firm organization, as well as various vessel traits

and activities that might have affected productivity, it does not report

output prices, factor shares in income, or labor and land (i.e., the stock

of whales) inputs -   - information   necessary to estimate productivity and

interpret the estimates. Price data are readily available, notably in

Starbuck and Tower. Officers and crewmen were paid subsistence and a share

of the product, each man's share being referred to as a "lay." Lays

commonly ranged from ten to twenty percent for captains to .2 to .4 of a
                                     15

percent for green boys, and summed to about one-third of the value of

output; we assumed a total lay of thirty-four percent for all voyages.

Subsistence has been estimated to have been about $35-60 per man per year,

in prices of 1844.17 As between these two values the choice does not

appear important. The productivity results obtained are virtually

identical, regardless of which is used.

     There are three important sources of labor data; none is perfect; the

two that appear most comprehensive were used.18 Two caveats: First, while

the labor data cover all of the years under consideration they are more

nearly complete for the periods 1820-1834 and 1840-1880. Second, the data

refer chiefly to crewmen recruited before vessels left New Bedford. Extra

crewmen were sometimes added in the Canaries or Hawaii; more often, crewmen

who died or deserted were replaced at a port of call. The data provide,

therefore, no more than a rough index of the average number of men aboard

during a voyage, but there is no reason to believe that errors in the labor

data bias our results.



(4) Productivity. Indexes19

     The measure of productivity chosen is a translog multilateral

productivity index, a so-called ttsuperlative index."20 The index has

characteristics that are very well suited to the industry and the problems

under analysis. It is designed to handle multi-product firms and

industries, of the type represented by nineteenth-century American whaling.

The underlying model assumes optimizing behavior and is, therefore, clearly

suited to competitive activities of the likes of American whaling. The

measure was developed to permit multilateral comparisons and as a result it

is not subject to base reversal problems, a very important characteristic
                                      16

since the voyage productivity estimates were to be used in a regression

analysis. Moreover, it is readily computed and economical of data,

requiring no more evidence than is available.

     There are, however, few examples of absolute perfection, and the

index, while superlative, is not one of them. It poses one minor and

readily handled computational problem. Two other difficulties arise out of

the application of the index to whaling and to individual whaling voyages.

     As to the computational problem, whalers typically returned with whale

oil, sperm oil, and whalebone, but not infrequently, they returned with

only two, say whale oil and bone, or one, say sperm oil. Occasionally they

even came back ttclean,tt that is, with no marketable catch. Since the

superlative index cannot handle zeroes, these cases posed problems. The

first two might have been solved by distinguishing three separate whaling

industries, one specializing in baleen whales, one in sperm whales, and the

third a generalist baleen-sperm industry.21 Such an approach, however,

would distort the reality of nineteenth-century New Bedford whaling.

Whalers did not regularly specialize to the exclusion of one type of whale.

It is true that a vessel setting out for the Arctic was after bowheads

(baleens), but between New Bedford and the Arctic it passed through waters

inhabited by sperm whales and was prepared to take them, as opportunity

afforded. Once the western Arctic was opened, a common pattern was to hunt

bowheads and then, in the off season, move to California to take gray

whales, or to the coasts of New Zealand and Australia for humpbacks and

sperm whales. Moreover, as prices and opportunities shifted, vessels

emphasized one type of activity over another. Thus it appears that New

Bedford whaling should be regarded as one industry, not three.

    A better solution to the computational problem is to substitute small
                                         17

positive values for the zeros. If values much less than e (the base of

natural logs) are selected, large negative weights are assigned to the

shares accorded the missing products, and the results that emerge are

counter-intuitive. For example, with a value of .001, a relatively

unsuccessful voyage that resulted, nonetheless, in three types of output

might register a higher level of productivity than a successful voyage with

only two. These anomalies disappear with values in excess of e. Three and

ten, both very small values when compared with typical whaling output

levels, were tried. The results of the two sets of calculations were

similar, suggesting that the index is not very sensitive to the specific

value selected as long as it is small but greater than e.22

     A second and more serious problem emerges because there is no obvious

way to introduce land --   that   is, the stocks of whales --   directly   into the

productivity calculations. Thus, the indexes do not measure total factor

productivity, but only the productivity of labor and capital. In an

attempt to work around this problem, whale stocks were introduced on the

right-hand side of the regression, as independent variables helping to

explain the level of productivity of labor and capital.

     Finally, and most seriously, the calculations do not include the

effects of truly disastrous voyages - -   voyages from which vessels failed to
return. The indexes refer only to vessels that came back to New Bedford.

The omission is unlikely to have affected the long-term drift of our

productivity measurement for the industry as a whole, since, over time,

loss rates do not seem to have changed dramatically, on average. (See

Table 6.) Of course, the level and the year-to-year variations are

affected, but the former is unimportant and the latter are not the chief

concern of this paper.
                                                            18

        Of more importance, however, is the effect of the exclusion of

disastrous voyages from the regressions. Whaling was a risky

business in which luck and the skill of the agent and captain --                   neither
figuring directly in our regression analysis - -                 played   important roles.

One therefore has to expect a substantial amount of unexplained variance.

If the disastrous voyages were introduced into the analysis, the

unexplained variance would, no doubt, increase. Moreover, since older

vessels had higher loss rates than younger ones, and since loss rates

varied among hunting grounds, the age and hunting ground variables would

also be affected but, happily, in predictable ways.23

        The form of the productivity index is as follows:




ln?lk
            =   1/2        + R.)(lnY1          -
                                                   lnY.)
        -
            1/2       (Wk +   W   )(lnXk   -       ln X),


where:            the R's are the shares of total revenue produced by the three

                  individual outputs;

                the Y's are quantities of individual outputs;

                the W's are factor shares of income;

                the X's are quantities of factor inputs;

                the R's, Y's, W's, and X's are average values across all

                observations.



Three outputs -- sperm oil, whale oil, and baleen -- and two inputs - -

labor    and capital (man months and ton months) --               are distinguished.24
        The sources of the evidence and our estimating decisions have been

discussed in Section (3), above.

(5) Influences on Productivity

     The productivity index for the whole New Bedford industry declines

from 1820 -- when the industry was still very small --   to   the mid 1830's,

when the industry was quite large. During the period of its maturity (1835

onward), New Bedford whaling exhibited less pronounced changes in

productivity. Plotted, the productivity index describes a profile like

that of a dinner plate:   it declines, gradually flattens out, and finally

rises again (see the chart). Although a trend line fitted to the index in

the years of maturity exhibits little movement, the industry was by no

means quiescent in the period. It changed dramatically in size, in the

composition of its capital stock, in the structure of its output, in the

relative importance of the hunting grounds it visited, in the sources of

its labor supply, in the ways in which production was organized, in its

techniques of production, and, no doubt, in other ways as well. The

changes reflected responses to shifts in the environment in which the New

Bedford whalers operated, and represented the efforts of whaling men to

cope with new problems and to exploit new opportunities. The central

concern of this paper is with the estimation of the direction in which, and

the strength with which, each of these influences pressed productivity. We

want to understand the forces affecting the industry and the ways in which

its entrepreneurs and managers responded to them. The following

subsections consider the factors that influenced productivity and attempt

to capture them in a series of variables that can be used in the regression

analysis.

                                      20

(a)   Whale Stocks
      The drift of the industry productivity index across time, the

persistent search for new hunting grounds, contemporary complaints, and

even the structure of output, all suggest that, as the industry expanded,

there were pressures on the stock of whales. The evidence on stocks before

large-scale hunting began, on the procreative capacities of the whales, and

on the amount of hunting conducted in the nineteenth century suggests that

there was no global problem, no general ecological disaster resulting from

American whaling in the 19th century.25 Depletion of some hunting grounds,

and possibly some species of whales, however, might have required whalers

to seek out new grounds, the search raising costs and reducing the

productivity of capital and labor.

      To test this proposition we developed annual indexes of hunting

pressures on the whale populations of the four hunting grounds. Pressure

index numbers reflecting hunting dates and destinations were attached to

each voyage. Thus a vessel that hunted in the Pacific had assigned to it

sperm and baleen pressure index numbers relevant to the Pacific and to the

dates of the voyage. If excessive hunting was reducing the productivity of

whaling capital and labor, the regression coefficients of these indexes

should have negative signs. (Details are contained in Appendix 1.)



(b) Vessel Competition

      There is a second possible effect of hunting on measured productivity.

Even if whale stocks were not being depleted, increased hunting might lead

to lower productivity simply because of greater competition among vessels.

One vessel coming upon a pod of sperm whales might be able to take all the

largest whales by itself; however, if it approached the pod in company with
                                     21

other vessels, it would be less likely to come away with as many barrels of

oil. The one case slides over into the other, of course. One vessel alone

would be unable completely to destroy a pod, but three or four vessels

might do so. Still, it appears useful to distinguish analytically between

the two cases. To that end a second index reflecting whaling competition

in each year and in each hunting ground was constructed. The index number

for any given ground and year is a ratio: the numerator is the number of

vessel tons leaving for the hunting ground two years previously, divided by

300 (to convert the tons to "standardized vessels"). The denominator is

the number of whales (all species combined) in the ground before intensive

hunting began, per 100 square miles in the hunting ground. Thus the index

can be interpreted as the number of standard sized vessels per whale per

100 square miles per hunting ground. Since the index is designed to

measure competition in the ground, it could be expected to carry a negative

coefficient in the regression, if competition affected productivity

unfavorably. (Appendix 1 provides more details of the construction of the

index.)



(c) Specialization

     The degree to which whalers specialized in a particular type of whale

varied from vessel to vessel and voyage to voyage. In an effort to see how

far specialization mattered we included dununy variables indicative of the

degree and type of specialization. Specifically, we divided voyages into

three groups (of roughly equal size): those in which sperm oil contributed

at least ninety percent of the value of output, those in which whale oil

and baleen contributed at least ninety percent of the value of output, and

all others. This device also helps to deal with a technical problem. All
                                      22

productivity indexes have trouble dealing effectively with output mixes far

removed from the mean mix and the superlative index is no exception. The

specialization dunimies segregate voyages in which the degree of

specialization was pronounced and permit the regression to standardize for

them (the issue is discussed further below).



(d) Hunting Grounds

     The search for whales carried New Bedford whalers from the Atlantic to

the Indian and Pacific oceans, and finally to that bonanza ground, the

western Arctic. One would expect to find productivity varying initially

from ground to ground, the differences disappearing as the fleet adjusted

its hunting activities. In the case of the Arctic, however, equilibrium

was probably not achieved before the New Bedford whalers began abandoning

their home port for the west coast port of San Francisco. Furthermore, the

Arctic was by far the most dangerous ground, exhibiting much higher rates

of vessel loss than the other grounds. Thus, even if whalemen, owners, and

agents were risk neutral, it should have taken higher rates of gain, gross,

to attract whalers to the Arctic. Therefore, since the analysis excludes

vessels that were lost while whaling, one would expect that vessels hunting

in the Arctic would appear to be more productive than vessels that avoided

that ground. As among other grounds, differences might be slight, with the

new grounds of the Indian and Pacific oceans perhaps displaying modestly

higher average productivities than the Atlantic.

     One word of warning: Although acknowledged mixed voyages (i.e.,

voyages reported to have been to the Pacific and Arctic, for example) are

excluded from the regression data set, to some extent all voyages to any

ground but the Atlantic were mixed. That is, even if the vessel was sent
                                         23

to hunt in the Arctic, Indian, or Pacific Ocean, it was forced to pass

through other grounds, and captains seldom passed up a chance to catch a

whale. Moreover, if weather or catch proved discouraging captains

frequently steered to adjacent grounds for short periods of time. Thus the

assignment of ground should not be thought to have precluded the

possibility that the vessel hunted at least a little in other grounds.



(e) Rig Types

     As time passed hunting grounds shifted, and so did the way vessels

were rigged. There had never been more than one or two of the smaller

vessels --   brigs,   sloops, and schooners --   in   the Pacific and Indian

oceans, and there was none at all in the western Arctic, but by the middle

of the period they had all but disappeared from the Atlantic as well. Over

the first half of the period barks gradually eroded the dominant position

previously held by ships in all grounds, but they really came into their

own in the western Arctic, where the relative ease of handling and of

launching the two stern boats were matters of great importance.

     In the regression, barks, brigs, sloops, and schooners are grouped

together. It should be kept in mind however that the three smaller classes

represented only a tiny fraction of the total. Thus the comparison is

really between ships and barks (excluding all but barks does not affect any

result).

     The performance of this somewhat heterogeneous group was compared with

the performance of ships. The expectation as to sign is somewhat

ambiguous. Ships dominated in the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific grounds in

most years, but barks were more important in the Arctic and ultimately

pushed their competitors from the other grounds as well. On net for all
                                      24

grounds and all years the coefficient on the ship dummy was thought likely

to be positive.



(f) Vessel Size

     The shift toward ships and toward more distant grounds was associated

with an increase in the size of whalers, but vessel size also rose

independently of these developments. That is, standardizing for rig and

hunting ground, vessel size increased. The shift seems not to have been a

pure scale phenomenon.26 Tonnage was entered (squared, since tonnage also

appears in the formula used to estimate productivity) as an independent

variable. Given the shift toward larger vessels, we expected a positive

sign on the coefficient of this variable.



(g) Mode of Entry into the Fleet

     Some vessels were built for whaling, others transferred into the fleet

froni the merchant marine, and still others, vessels that had originally

entered by one of these two routes, were rerigged (ships were often

rerigged as barks, particularly to hunt the Arctic). Ceteris paribus, one

would expect vessels built for the fleet to be most productive. Whether

one should expect this result to emerge from the statistical analysis,

however, is not so clear. In the flush times of New Bedford whaling,

particularly when the Arctic was opened, many vessels were quickly

transferred into the whaling fleet and many ships were rerigged as barks to

fit them for Arctic hunting. It took longer to design and build vessels to

exploit this rich ground, and, by the time these entrants were in service,

some of the "first arrival" gains had almost certainly evaporated.

Transferred and rerigged vessels may, then, exhibit unusually high
                                     25

productivity levels, for market as opposed to technical reasons.



(h) Age of Vessel

     The age of the vessel (entered as age and age squared) also captures

the effects of more than a single set of forces. Elements of wear and tear

that influenced productivity, a technical characteristic that one might

hope to capture in the age variable, are confounded with the consequences

of qualitative differences among vessels. Effective vessels were

presumably survivors; ineffective vessels were transferred by their owners

to other activities, were condemned at an early age, or were destroyed in

service. The regression should pick up this influence as well as capital

consumption. Thus one could expect to find a positive sign on the

coefficient for age, as poor vessels were screened out with advancing age,

and a negative sign on the coefficient for age squared, as wear and tear

reduced even an efficient vessel's effectiveness.

     As a second device for uncovering the influence of the deterioration

of a vessel's productive capacity, the last voyage of each vessel was

identified. If poor productivity performances eventually led to

condemnation or to transfer to other activities, the variable should have a

negative sign.



(i) Innovations

     Although they were not equally important, three types of technical

innovations were widely adopted in the whaling fleet between the 1820's and

the 1880's. The first reflected improvements in maritime technology in

general; the other two were associated with improvements in whaling

narrowly defined. Although the years between 1820 and 1845 have been
                                              26

viewed by some specialists as technologically unprogressive, the period

was, in fact, marked by substantial technical progress. There was a series

of advances that were first tested in the merchant fleet and then borrowed

by the builders of whaling vessels. These advances included, in addition

to the substantial gains realized by improvements in the techniques of ship

construction, "patented rigging, deck machinery, and fittings. Such things

as geared capstans and windlasses, iron strapped blocks, geared

steering, .   . .geared winches, new mast and spar ironwork. . .rod rigging and
turnbuckles, screw- or lever-operated, were [also] introduced."27 In

addition the number of sails was increased (the top sail, for example, was

divided into an upper and a lower half) for ease in handling.28

     The second set of innovations was in vessel design: barks were

specifically designed for whaling. These new vessels were first built in

the vicinity of New Bedford in the mid-l850's. They were constructed with

raking stems and with sharper lines than the usual whalers. "The hull

design of these vessels had much in common with that of the clippers.

Their sailing qualities were disguised by the heavy appearance of the hull,

above water, which was emphasized by the deck houses and the whale boats

carried on strong davits [another innovation] or on skids above the deck.

These American whalers were built of wood, copper sheathed below the

waterline.    .   .   ." 29              .
                              They were, in fact, medium clippers, "sharp floored

and easy bilged to make them roll down when 'cutting out' a whale."3°

     The third group of innovations was in "whalecraft," the implements

employed to capture and kill the whale -- harpoons, lances, whale guns of

various types.31 According to Scammon (see Appendix 2) in a period of

twenty years these innovations had as revolutionary an impact on whaling as

had all the vessel design changes that took place between the 17th and the
                                     27

late 19th centuries. The successful inventions were made in the relatively

short period, 1848-1865, and were widely diffused by the mid-1870's. The

most significant of the group, the darting gun, was invented last (1865),

and did not begin to diffuse rapidly until the early 1870's.

(See Appendix 2.)

     Unfortunately, the Dias data do not indicate the equipment carried on

the various whaling voyages. The period during which the innovations

diffused is clear, however, as well as the fact that they diffused very

widely. In the regression, therefore, a dummy was entered to distinguish

voyages sailing before January 1, 1870, by which date the chief design and

whalecraft innovations had been made and most had been widely diffused. If

these new techniques had affected productivity favorably, the coefficient

on the variable would be positive.



(j) Competition for Labor

     A frequently told story attributes the collapse of the American

whaling fleet to the qualitative deterioration of the vessel crews as the

best labor was bid away by improving onshore opportunities. Real wage

rates ashore certainly were rising through a substantial part of this

period and our preliminary analysis of whaling lays suggests that the

return to whalemen may not have been keeping pace. The pool of seamen

available to man the whalers may very well have deteriorated, with

unfavorable consequences for whaling productivity. With measures of labor

quality this proposition could be tested directly, and we hope to be able

to do so in future. At present, however, we must settle for an indirect

test, employing wage rate data, alone. We first entered wage indexes of

common and skilled labor on shore as independent variables.32 Since the
                                     28

two proved to be collinear, we re-ran the regression, using only one wage

series at a time. The choice between the two mattered little: The results

are virtually identical, whether the common or the skilled index is

employed. The coefficient should be negative if the New Bedford whaling

industry really did have a labor problem.



(k) Time at Sea

     As the fleet moved into more distant waters, the organization of

hunting was revised to cope with the problems raised by the greater

distances. Resupply and transshipment points were developed; by using

these bases, a vessel could hunt for longer periods and catch more than it

could bring home itself. Organized resupply and transshipment were

important institutional innovations. To capture their influence on

productivity, the interval at sea (actually, the square of the interval)

was entered as an independent variable in the regression equation.

Unfortunately, the variable also picks up other influences, including, for

example, the bad luck (or poor performance) that kept a vessel long at sea

before an adequate cargo was obtained. If the first influence - -      the
innovation of the transshipment point -- predominated, the coefficient on

this variable should have a positive sign; otherwise, it should have a

negative sign.



(1) Measurement Errors

     The "tonnage" for most vessels in the data set refers to old

admeasurement tonnage; in a few cases, however, it   refers   to new

adnieasurement tonnage (see footnote 16). A dummy was introduced to deal

with the problem. The coefficient of this dummy should have a negative
                                        29

sign.



(m) Time

        Finally, time was entered as an independent variable. As will be

evident, the technology variable - -   which   is a time dunmy - -   leaves
something to be desired and might pick up any of a variety of time-

dependent processes other than technical change. While the

comprehensiveness of the model, both theoretically and empirically reduces

the chances of such an eventuality, we decided to reduce them further by

entering time as a device for detrending (the issue is taken up further

below). The analysis is limited to voyages leaving New Bedford in 1820 or

later. The time variable is, therefore, the year the vessel sailed from

New Bedford minus 1820.



(6) Statistical Results

(a) General Considerations

        The general New Bedford data set contains evidence on over 4100

whaling voyages in the period 1790-1906, but this paper is concerned with

only some of them. First, since the industry was unduly affected by

political and military events during the early period, the years before

1820 have been excluded (reducing the universe to fewer than 3,900

voyages). Second, a number of incomplete observations were dropped. As a

result, the regression analysis is based on fewer than 2400 observations,

confined to the period 1820-1896. The sample is a very large one, but is

it representative? If it is representative, of what is it representative?

of New Bedford voyages? of east coast voyages? Unlike many other

Northeastern ports, New Bedford engaged in diversified whaling. It sent
                                     30

vessels to every hunting ground, and the port was regarded as

representative of the east coast ports taken together. The sample,

however, was certainly not randomly drawn from all of the east coast

voyages. Indeed, it was not even randomly drawn from the list of New

Bedford voyages.

     To test the extent to which the sample resembles the universe of New

Bedford voyages, 1820-1896, we compared average sample and universe values

for each of the outputs, the data on crew numbers, vessel tonnage, and

average voyage time, by hunting ground. On the whole, we found that the

sample over-represents successful voyages.

     To test whether this feature of the sample made the regression results

unrepresentative of the behavior of the entire New Bedford fleet, we re-ran

the regression analysis on the relatively unsuccessful voyages alone, i.e.,

on the 1000 voyages with the lowest levels of productivity. In all but

five cases (intercepts and independent variables), the coefficient signs

were the same for the full sample and for the sample of unsuccessful

voyages. In three of the remaining five cases, the interpretation of the

variable was left essentially unchanged, despite the sign change (e.g., low

significance levels; very small coefficients). We concluded, therefore,

that although some features of the full sample may make it imperfectly

representative for some purposes, nonetheless the regression results do

adequately describe New Bedford whaling. Although we cannot demonstrate

the matter rigorously, we also believe that the regressions capture the

nature of east coast whaling as a whole.

(b) The Model

      The results of the first regression (#1) appear in Table 10. The

equation explains almost half of the productivity variance, a level of

explanatory power that is excellent for a pooled cross section-time series

data set, particularly given the nature of this industry. It is well known

that the variation between the performances of one vessel and another could

be extremely wide and that whalemen attributed such variations in some

considerable measure to luck. The Dias data also show that certain vessels

--   and probably certain agents and captains --   typically   performed above

standard, and others, typically below. Even in these cases, however,

performance varied from one voyage to the next. No attempt has yet been

made to sort these matters out and to see how far the quality of the

vessels, agents, and captains differed one from the other (although these

are feasible projects). The regression equation leaves luck out of account

and deals only indirectly with the quality of captain and crew. Not all of

the variables conform precisely to the theoretical requirements. With

these matters in mind the degree of explanatory success attained by the

equation seems very high.33



(b-i) Strong Priors

       We had strong expectations as to the signs on the coefficients of six

of the variables in the equation. Specifically, we expected positive signs

on the vessel size variable, on the Arctic dummy, and on the technological

date dummy, while we expected negative signs on the wage series and on the

tonnage measurement and last voyage dummies. In every case the signs are

as expected, while the coefficients are large and, in all cases but one,

significantly different from zero at the one percent level.34
                                         32

(b-2) Weak Priors

     We had expected productivity in the Indian and Pacific oceans to

exceed productivity in the Atlantic, and the regression confirms our

expectations. The Pacific, the ocean to which most voyages were made,

proves to have been, on average, a more productive hunting ground than the

Indian Ocean, but not by a wide margin. Per our expectations, ships were

more productive, on average, than other vessels.



(b-3) Tests of Hypotheses in the Literature

     Contemporary comment and the subsequent literature on whaling suggest

that productivity may have been adversely affected by over-hunting, on the

one hand, and heavy competition among whalers, on the other. Our study of

data on whale stocks, the procreative capacities of whales, and the level

of hunting in the nineteenth century led us to doubt that over-hunting was

a major problem;35 the possibility that competition may have reduced

productivity seemed more likely to us, a priori.

     In the cases of the hunting pressure indexes, our guesses are shown to

have been correct. Both indexes carry small coefficients of the wrong

sign, one not significantly different from zero at conventional levels of

significance. The coefficient of the competition variable has the sign

that a reading of the literature would lead one to expect, but it is very

small, as is the t   value   associated with it.36



(b-4) Complex Variables

     Three sets of variables capture the effects of more than one

influence, which made the signs and values of the coefficients of the

variables difficult to predict. The favorable influence of the
                                      33

transshipment innovation was apparently overborne by the unfavorable

influence of long, unsuccessful hunts (the coefficient on voyage length is

negative). The large catches associated with the opening of the Arctic

appear to have formed the measured effect of mode of entry on productivity.

The regression shows no significant productivity difference between

transfers and vessels built for the fleet. Rerigged vessels, however,

exhibit a modest but significant advantage, an advantage that presumably

reflects as much the date of their entry to the fleet as any underlying

technical superiority.

     Finally, the age variables no doubt reflect the experience of

successful survivors, but it is clear that the unfavorable effects of aging

also figure in the results. The measured level of productivity turns down

at about the age of fifty, if the coefficients on age and age squared are

to be believed. That figure would probably not have surprised whaling men

of the nineteenth century, who were accustomed to vessels that lasted much

longer than this in the whaling trade.37 It may be that, properly

refitted, an old vessel was, indeed, only very modestly inferior to what it

had been when new. Certainly there is some suggestion of this idea in the

literature, and these results appear to add additional support.



(b-5) No Priors

     Time was entered as a detrending variable, while the specialization

indexes were incorporated in our effort to cope with an undesirable feature

of the productivity index. The coefficient on time is very small - -     even
allowing for the nuniber of years covered by the equation --   and   is not

significantly different from zero (the t value is very small). There is

the suggestion here that the equation is comprehensive, leaving no role for
                                      34

time, but we return to this point below.

     Both of the specialization dummies carry negative coefficients, the

one for sperm whalers a very large one. Since there is no good reason to

believe that sperm whalers were, indeed, at so dramatic a disadvantage, the

strong suggestion is that the productivity index, even with missing values

supplied (see above), understates the productivity of specialist vessels.

The specialist variables correct for this feature of the index, however, so

that the regression results should not be unduly influenced by the problem.



(c) Interaction Terms

     In two respects it appeared before the fact that the model could be

improved by introducing interaction terms. Specifically, the advantages of

the bark were said to be pronounced only in the Arctic, while ships were

believed to have important advantages in the Indian and Pacific oceans.

The matter could be explored by interacting the vessel type and hunting

ground dummy variables. Furthermore, the institutional advantage of the

refitting and transshipment port were exploited only by vessels sailing to

the Indian, Pacific, and Arctic Oceans. Interacting voyage length and

hunting ground might, then, reveal the favorable consequences of this

institutional innovation, consequences that are not exhibited in the

coefficient of the voyage duration variable of the first equation.

     In fact, these procedures throw no new light on the problem of whaling

productivity. The signs on the voyage duration -   hunting   ground

interactions are all negative. We are unable to separate out the favorable

effects of the institutional innovations. The vessel type-hunting ground

interactions have the correct signs, but the differences among them are not

large. Little additional is learned from them.
                                        35

(d) Technical Changes and Labor Quality: Some Further Thoughts

    While   the   regression analysis unfolds reasonably and seems to reveal

important aspects of forces at work on U.S. whaling productivity, some of

the variables are less than perfect and pose interpretive problems. Two

sets of these variables -- measuring technical changes and labor quality - -

deserve further attention.
    New technology did diffuse very rapidly, so that the use of a time

dummy to proxy technical changes is certainly reasonable. (See Appendix

2.) The fact remains, however, that the dummy is only an indirect

indicator of technical change, and could be picking up the effects of some

other time-dependent process. It would be helpful to have direct evidence

of the tools and methods employed by the whalers in our sample.

     Most whalers had an outfitting book that listed the gear aboard the

vessel at the beginning of each voyage. One part of the book was devoted

to ttwhalecraft,tt the implements used to capture the whale. As we have

indicated, among the three sets of technical changes those that appear to

have had the greatest impacts on productivity were innovations in

whalecraft. Whales were frequently lost because a harpoon failed to hold

or because the whale smashed the attacking boat before the boatheader was

able to dispatch it. Innovations were devised to make the harpoon more

secure and the lance, more deadly. The two-flued harpoon was partly

replaced by the more secure one-flued harpoon, and that device was, in

turn, replaced by the toggle iron. Boatheaders shifted from common lances,

to steel lances, to bomb lances shot from guns, to the deadly darting gun.

(See Appendix 2.)

     Some outfitting lists have survived and we have managed to assemble

seventy-five that can be used to establish the gear that was actually
                                      36

aboard the vessels in the sample. Unfortunately, however, the range of

experience depicted in these lists is very narrow: there is, for example,

little usable evidence on the darting gun. Thus the comparisons that can

be drawn depend on very little hard evidence:


                                                      Average
                                                 Productivity Index

vessels with toggle irons        69                   .655
vessels w/o toggle irons          6                   .481

vessels with bomb lances         68                   .649
vessels w/o bomb lances           7                   .567


The mean productivity of the voyages using advanced gear was greater than

the mean productivity of the rest, but the sample sizes are small and the

differences between the sample means are not significant (student's t). We

also ran various regressions in which the technological date dummy was

replaced by dummies relating to the use of toggle irons and whale guns.

Not surprisingly, none was very illuminating. The regression in Table 11

is characteristic.

     It will be observed that only one of the technological variables has

the right sign, and neither carries a coefficient significantly different

from zero at a conventionally acceptable level. In view of the very

limited number of vessels outfitted with the earlier technology, and in the

absence of evidence on the darting gun, the regression results cannot be

taken to be a very serious challenge to the view that improved whalecraft

technology did, indeed, raise whaling productivity. Settling the matter

definitively will require the acquisition of more outfitting books; but if,

as we believe, the new technology did diffuse very rapidly, even more

outfitting evidence may not make it possible to distinguish the effects of

technical change from other time-dependent processes.38
                                     37

     The wage variables were introduced into the regressions to test an

hypothesis drawn from the whaling literature: as wage rates ashore went

up, the best men were bid out of whaling, the quality of crews

deteriorated, and productivity fell. Our modeling of this hypothesis seems

straight-forward enough, linking, as it does, the underlying cause (higher

wage rates ashore) with the ultimate consequence (lower productivity). We

also believe, as we indicated above, that wage rates ashore rose relative

to the earnings of whalemen. The middle step in the argument, however, is

by-passed: the deterioration of the quality of crews. Did crews really

decline in quality? We are presently exploring this question by collecting

signatures and marks as well as stations from the crew lists. While this

task is as yet incomplete, the data assembled so far strongly suggest that

both literacy and the skill level among crewmen fell markedly, in the

1840's and 1850's. If the analysis confirms these conjectures we should be

able to conclude that the testimony of the whaling literature and of the

coefficients on the wage variables in the regressions is correct: the

quality of whaling crews did decline, as time passed.

     The wage series pose a second problem. We know that the productivity

index for the fleet as a whole declined from 1820 to the 1860's, while the

wage rate ashore rose. The strong negative association between the wage

series and the vessel productivity series may, therefore, describe only the

numerical relations between two trends that, in fact, have no true

theoretical connection. The latter proposition could be tested by

differencing or detrending the data. Such a procedure is not appropriate

in the present case, however. The hypothesis in the literature is, in

fact, an hypothesis relating to trends. That is, the argument is not that

a rise in wages ashore in year 1 reduced the quality of whaling seaman in
                                          38

year 1, and that a decline in wages ashore in year 2 raised the quality of

seamen in that year. The argument is that a persistent, strong increase in

the wage rate ashore led to the deterioration of whaling crews.

     Nonetheless, we did attempt a species of detrending, above and beyond

that attempted in equation #1. First, we restricted the regression to

voyages departing after 1833 - -   a   period that saw productivity first fall

and then rise, finally re-achieving in the 1890's the levels attained sixty

years before. Second, in order to allow for the remaining long-term

variations in productivity, we entered time and time squared variables.

The regression appears in Table 12.

     It will be observed that the common wage coefficient retains a large

negative value and is significantly different from zero at better than the

one percent level. The correlations between the coefficients of the two

time variables and the common wage coefficient are also very small (- .082

and -.035). The wage series appears to be capturing something other than

time. The suggestion that the quality of whalemen deteriorated, as

opportunities ashore improved, and that the decline in the quality of crews

tended to lower productivity, ceteris paribus, is strengthened.39

     Two other features of the regression are worthy of notice. First, the

signs, coefficient values, and significance levels of most of the variables

are very similar to those in Table 10, which is reassuring, since it

suggests that we have identified stable relationships. The significance

levels are also very high, across the board.

     Second, one might have supposed, before the fact, that the

introduction of time squared might displace the technological dummy - -    a
dummy that divides the observations at January 1, 1870. The reason for

this expectation is that productivity turned up late in the period (see the
                                     39

chart), so that one could expect time squared to carry a positive

coefficient, which it does. Notice, however, that the technological dummy

retains a large coefficient, significantly different from zero at the one

percent level. The correlation matrix also shows clearly that the

technological dummy is not simply a version of time squared. The

correlation between the coefficients on the technological dummy and time

squared is only 0.0144.



(7) Conclusions

     After 1820 a series of changes in the economic environment pressured

whaling agents to change their ways. The rapid growth of the demand for

lubricants and illuminants led agents to send their captains farther and

farther from home in search of whale and sperm oil. The whalemen opened

rich grounds in the South Atlantic, the Indian Ocean, and the Pacific. The

subsequent change in the structure of demand for whaling products -- a

change that favored whale bone over sperm and whale oil -- sent captains to

the North Pacific in search of right whales. One of them was venturesome

enough to push through the Bering Strait into the Bering Sea, where he

found a profusion of the greatest of the bone whales, the bowhead. He was

quickly followed by many other captains.

     These shifts in demand and in hunting grounds, coupled with emerging

labor problems, led the agents to re-organize the industry. In place of

the fourteen-month voyage to Davis Strait and the Atlantic, typical of the

early nineteenth century, voyages of two, three, and even four or more

years to the Indian Ocean, the Pacific and the Western Arctic had become

common by mid-century. Different vessel types (ships in the Pacific; barks

in the Arctic) and new designs of each type (clipper style, with heavy use
                                          40

of power winches) were adopted. The new designs came in part from

unspecialized builders for the merchant marine, and in part from ship

architects specializing in whalers. Longer voyages meant the adoption of

larger vessels of each type and the development of re-supply and trans-

shipment points in Hawaii and Panama. In the whale boats, the whaling gun

replaced the hand-held lance, and toward the end, the darting gun, the most

effective American whalecraft innovation, was widely adopted. The agents

responded to the economic and technical stimuli. They reacted quickly and

effectively. For example, when the writing was on the wall - - when the

Arctic had become the most profitable hunting ground, when steamers proved

the most effective whalers, and when the transcontinental rail lines were

in place - -   they   abandoned New Bedford and reberthed their vessels in San

Francisco.

       These changes in environment and the reactions to them by the agents

affected productivity in ways nicely captured in the regression appearing

in Table 10. The clearest and most powerful environmental change was the

deterioration in the quality of labor, occasioned by competition ashore.

According to the coefficient on the common wage variable, productivity fell

.006 points for every point the real wage ashore went up. Since the real

common wage ashore rose by 52 points between 1820 and 1860 and another 34

points between 1860 and 1895, the effect was a strong one. Thus, if we

press these results as far as we can - -    perhaps harder than they should be
--   the common wage variable ttaccountstt for a decline of .504 in the
productivity index across the full period. Given a dependent mean of .733,

this is a very powerful effect, indeed.

      The changing quality of labor may also be hidden in a second variable,

the one concerned with voyage length. This paper had been completed to
                                      41

this point in its present form when we encountered Charles Nordhoff's

little book, Whaling and Fishing.4° Nordhoff's account strongly suggests

that the quality of crews deteriorated as voyage length went up. Except

when whales were actually under attack, whaling was immensely boring,

particularly for seamen accustomed to the constant activity of a

merchantman, or a naval vessel, or even a fishing smack. As voyages

increased in length, the boredom became unbearable and the rate of

desertion increased dramatically, a point made by many students of the

industry. Nordhoff claims that the problem became so serious that

recruiters began to by-pass seamen and recruit the greenest of green hands.

These hands, since they had not had the experience of merchant service,

might be less likely to be unfavorably affected by the tedium of the

voyage, but also their prospects on desertion were dim. A seaman could

desert and easily pick up another vessel. Not so a green hand who had

nothing but his brief whaling experience.

     Whether or not Nordhoff is right as to the recruitment practices of

agents, the variable "voyage length" may pick up the unfavorable

consequence of the rising desertion rate, in addition to the factors

previously discussed. Indeed, it may well be that this factor is the most

important one influencing the coefficient on the variable "voyage length."

     The reactions of agents to these - -   and   other - -   environmental   changes

are also captured nicely in the regression. There are, first, the shifts

in hunting ground, the movement first into the Pacific, with its vast

supplies of sperm whales, and then into the Western Arctic, in pursuit of

the bowhead. These changes can be though of as the results of a persistent

search for better hunting grounds, the agents adjusting activities in ways

that raised productivity. There is also, however, another aspect of them:
                                      42

they reflect the changing structure of demand. The drive into the Pacific

in the 20's, 30's and 40's was motivated by the high price of sperm oil;

the drive into the Western Arctic after 1848, by the market for baleen.

     All of the preceding discussion of the regression, while it is

concerned with productivity change, leaves technical considerations aside.

This point is an important one. The principal environmental influences on

productivity and some of the chief actions taken by agents to raise

productivity had nothing to do with technology. That point is worth

stressing. Nonetheless, agents also manipulated technological variables

and the results they obtained show up in the coefficients of the regression

in Table 10.

     Thus the adoption of ships, as opposed to other rig types, increased

productivity (ceteris paribus) by a substantial amount (coefficient of

+0.11, as compared with a dependent mean of +0.733), presumably reflecting

the advantage of ships in the Indian and Pacific Ocean hunting grounds, the

grounds that were most important throughout the full period. The choice to

re-rig to bark specification with the opening of the Arctic also is shown

to have been an important factor promoting higher productivity (coefficient

of +0.09), while the adoption of improved vessel design and, perhaps more

important, better whale craft, had an enormous effect, according to the

regression (+0.310). The change in vessel size was also favorable,

although of a smaller order of importance. For example, the rise in

average ship size between 1821-35 and 1871-75 improved productivity only

+0.006, according to the regression coefficient.

     The regression, then, effectively describes the chief influences

bearing on whaling productivity, including the activities of agents. A

substantial part -- a little over half --   of   the variance is left
                                     43

unexplained, however. The place to seek for further enlightenment is

surely among the human actors in this drama. How far did the identity of

the agent matter? Presumably there were good agents and bad ones. How far

did the quality of the agent determine the result of the voyage? The same

question may be asked with respect to the captain. Did crews regularly

break up after each voyage, or were some crews kept together to sail a

second and a third time? If so, were such crews more effective? All of

these queries can be treated with the data set detailed in this paper and

all will be the subject of our attention in the months ahead.

with Starbuck pr Hegarty or Whaling Masters, we accepted Dias, unless there
was very good reason to prefer the other. Hegarty's records for the late
nineteenth century and early twentieth century are more complete than
Dias's; we therefore filled out our data set with Hegarty's data. The Dias
records for the period before 1876 are also probably incomplete (perhaps
ten to fifteen percent) but less seriously so, and we made no effort to
complete them. It should be said that matters of completeness are not
easily settled. The ports of Dartmouth, Fairhaven, Mattapoisett, and New
Bedford were within a few miles of each other and whether a vessel belonged
to one or the other of these ports on any given voyage was not always
easily settled. For example, Dias lists some voyages as beginning from New
Bedford, which Whaling Masters attributes to Fairhaven, across the Acushnet
River from New Bedford, and vice versa. This type of disagreement appears
to be of a random nature and should have absolutely no importance to the
statistical estimates described in this paper.


16. The official procedure for measuring vessels changed in 1865. In most
cases Dias recorded the tonnage of the vessel when it entered the fleet,
and, since most entered before 1865, the tonnages of most of the vessels in
our data set are ttoldlt tonnages. In virtually every one of those few cases
where Dias chose to report "new" tonnage, we were able to adjust to the
"old" standard by consulting Starbuck. A few cases remain, however, of
vessels that were built or transferred from the merchant marine into the
whaling fleet after 1865. The "old" tonnages of these vessels are unknown,
and while we have developed formulae for translating "new" into "old"
tonnages that work quite well for many purposes (Davis, Gallman, and
Hutchins, "The Structure... ,". cit.,    footnote 10), we decided that they
are not sufficiently exact for the purposes of this paper. We therefore
left the capacities of these few vessels expressed in "new" tons and
recognized the problem in the regression analysis by entering a dummy
variable.

months, and for right whalers, twenty-three months (see p. 327, 1843). The
estimates were carried to other years than 1844 on the basis of the Warren

of the New Bedford Port Society, since they appear to be less comprehensive
than the records of the other two sources.

21. The possibilities for specialization were greater than this statement
suggests. Among baleens, bowheads were taken in the Arctic; grays and
humpbacks, in temperate and tropical waters. Bowheads produced large
amounts of high quality baleen (whale bone); grays and humpbacks, much
less, per whale, and of lower quality.

should be said that, while the size of whalers increased, the range through
which the increase occurred was quite limited. The typical ship, for
example, ran between 300 and 350 tons, although some were as much as 500
tons.

32. The wage rate indexes entered the regression with a lag. That is, a
voyage beginning in year n was associated with wage rate index numbers for
year n-i. The common wage rate series was computed from Paul A. David and
Peter Solar, "A Bicentenary Contribution to the History of the Cost of
Living in America," Research Economic History, vol. 2, 1977, data on p. 59
divided by data on p. 16. The skilled wage rate index was derived by
multiplying the series on p. 59 of David and Solar by the skill ratios on
p. 307 of Jeffrey G. Williamson and Peter H. Lindert, American Inequality
(New York, London, Toronto, Sydney, San Francisco, 1980) and then dividing
by the price index on p. 16 of David and Solar.


33. The superlative index is said to represent outliers badly, which could
distort our results. To test to see how large were the effects of
outliers, we dropped the 240 voyages (about 10 percent of all voyages) with
the highest productivities, and the 240 voyages with the lowest
productivities and ran the regression on this restricted data set. The
results were not markedly different.

36. The possibility that the variable, voyage length, was capturing over-
hunting and competition led us to drop the variable in one run, to see if
the signs, coefficients, and significance levels of the pressure and
competition indexes changed dramatically. They did not.

papers.


39. The t value on the ratio of the skilled to common wage indexes drops
to a low value, however, and the correlations between this coefficient and
the time coefficients become large. These are quite unimportant matters,
however, compared with the results with respect to the common wage series.

                                Appendix 1

                       Whale Stock Pressure Indexes



General Procedures

     We began by assembling Frost's data on the initial stock of mature

female sperm whales for each of the oceans in which sperm whales are found:

the Atlantic (Frost's Divisions 1 and 2), Indian (Divisions 3-5), and

Pacific (Divisions 69).1 We then used the parameters from Frost's sperm

whale model (pp. 254-256, especially 257-260) to estimate the maximum

sustainable yield in each ocean. Next we distributed the U.S. catch of

sperm oil among the three oceans on the basis of the New Bedford catch,

which we derived from the Dias-Hegarty data set, described in the text. We

converted the catch into numbers of whales killed, following Starbuck's

procedure, and computed four-year moving averages.2 These averages, dated

to the year following (e.g., 1816-19 = 1820). were expressed as ratios of

the maximum sustainable yield relevant to the particular hunting ground.

The ratios, which reflect relative pressures on whale stocks (differing by

year and by ground), were then associated with the voyage data. Thus, a

vessel leaving New Bedford in 1820 to hunt in the Pacific would have an

associated "pressure index" of 1820 (reflecting average hunting 1816-19)

for the Pacific Ocean. We used four-year averages so that the indexes

would reflect the hunting pressures over an extended period, but there is

nothing sacrosanct about the number four. It could easily have been a

larger or a smaller number.

     There are many things wrong with the sperm hunting "pressure index,"

but it is clearly the best option open to us, and we think that it is a

satisfactory proxy for the relative degree of sperm population depletion,
                                       50

by hunting ground and by year.3 Similar procedures were followed in the

case of baleens.



Maximum Sustainable Yield

       In order to produce indexes of the pressure placed on whale stocks by

U.S. hunting in the nineteenth century, we were obliged to estimate the

maximum sustainable yields of the sperm whale populations inhabiting the

Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian oceans (a separate estimate for each

population) and the baleen whale populations inhabiting the Bering Strait

and Okhotsk Sea (taken together), and the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian

oceans (taken together). The absolute levels of these estimates matter not

at all; all that matter are the relative levels among hunting grounds and

years for each of the two broad whale types.   (Even relative levels between

the two broad whale types do not matter.) Since the initial population

numbers establish these relative differences, we could have adopted

procedures producing only rough estimates of the true maximum sustainable

yields. Our actual methods, while entirely adequate, were probably too

elaborate for the purpose.

      According to Frost, the natural rate of mortality of sperm whales is

about 0.133 for the first two years of life and 0.05 thereafter (p. 257 --

but   see, also, Allen, pp. 9, lO). We assumed a static population with an

unchanging number of births each year. Given Frost's death rate data, and

the assumption of numerical equality between the sexes at each age, we were

able to estimate the age-sex structure of the population. Frost says that

the sperm whale population models assume females reach the age of sexual

maturity at between 8.5 and 10 years (p. 257). We chose 10 years, which

implies an average pregnancy rate of .22 in the stationary population (a
                                     51

figure .03 higher than the one used by Frost). Since the maximum pregnancy

rate is .25, according to Frost, the implied ratio of net increase to the

sexually mature female population is .03 (assuming that the structures of

the stationary and maximum yield populations are the same).

     The maximum sustainable yield is achieved at various female population

levels, depending upon the form in which the yield is to be obtained (i.e.

in females alone, or in males alone, or in females and males combined, or

in weight) (Frost, p. 260). We assumed that the yield was to be taken in

females alone, and therefore computed the yield against a mature female

population 60 percent of the original level (Frost, p. 260).

     Without any doubt, our sperm M.S,Y. estimates are too low. One could

make a good case that the Frost "net pregnancy rate" of 0.06 should have

been used in place of our derived 0.03, and that we should have computed

the yield on the assumption that it was to be taken disproportionately in

the form of males. Moving to these assumptions would have produced much

larger M.S.Y. estimates and much lower indexes of hunting pressure on the

sperm whale stocks. But it would not have altered the relative levels of

the indexes from year to year or from hunting ground to hunting ground.

     The regression requires that there be a pressure index for each

hunting ground for each type of whale. Since there are virtually no sperm

whales in the Arctic, we were obliged to produce a synthetic value for this

type of whale for this ocean. We used the average value of the indexes for

all other oceans. The coefficient on this index for the Arctic has no

substantive meaning.

     We used the same mortality rates and population structure in the

estimating procedures for baleens. We assumed a maximum pregnancy rate of

.50 (e.g., Burton, p. 86) and an age of sexual maturity of 10.5. Both
                                     52

these estimates may be too high (e.g., see Matthews, p. 84), but the errors

tend to offset and, in the event, they seem to have offset very well.5 At

least it is true that the crude birth rate implied by our simple model is

almost identical with the crude birth rate observed by D. W. Rice and A. A.

Wolman among the California gray whales during the recovery of this group

from over-hunting.6 The implied crude death rate, however, while at the

level of the average for sperm whales (Allen, p. 10), is about two

percentage points below the death rate found by Rice and Wolman among the

grays. The difference may reflect the fact that smaller whales, such as

the grays, have higher mortality rates than larger ones (Allen, p. 9),

presumably in part because they suffer the depredations of the killer

whales, while the larger types do not. It is also possible that our

mortality estimate is too low and that, as a result, our estimated M.S.Y.

level is too high. Once again it is worth remarking that for our purposes

such an error matters not at all, as long as the relative levels of the

hunting pressure index numbers among years and hunting grounds are correct.

Whether they are depends not on the M.S.Y. estimates but on the estimates

of the initial population levels.



Estimates of Whales Killed

     The estimates of the numbers of whales killed were based on the

quantity of sperm and baleen oil brought back by hunters, following

procedures established by Alexander Starbuck. That technique works well

for sperm whales, and for baleen whales through the 1870's. After 1880 the

ratio of oil to baleen brought back drops sharply. Whalers were probably

abandoning blubber, a rational response to the dramatically changing

relative prices of baleen and oil. For the years after 1878, therefore,
                                     53

the estimate of the number of whales killed was based on the amount of

baleen brought back. To produce the estimate it was necessary to infer

from the baleen returned the amount of oil that could have been obtained

from the whales that produced the baleen. This estimate (3.49 gallons per

pound of bone) was derived from the returns of U.S. hunting in the period

immediately preceding the 1880's.



Competition Index

     The number of exploitable sperm whales in each hunting ground

(Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian) was taken from Frost. We defined the

Atlantic as Frost's divisions 1 and 2, the Indian, 3, 4, and 5, and the

Pacific, 6, 7, 8, and 9. We then converted exploitable whale stocks to

total whale stocks, per James Scharff.7 Gray whales were allocated to the

Pacific, bowheads, to the western Arctic and to the North Atlantic, per

Frost (pp. 266-267). We accepted Allen's estimates (p. 19) of the number

of humpbacks and rights in the North Pacific, and the latter were allocated

to the Arctic.8 Frost's estimates of the number of humpbacks and rights in

the Southern Hemisphere (converted from exploitable to total numbers, per

Scharff) were divided among the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian oceans in

proportion to the number of sperm whales in these oceans.

     Whales are not of equal size or equal value, but we made no attempt to

adjust for these matters. On the whole, baleens were bigger, but yielded

less valuable output, ton for ton, than sperm whales. Summing up without

weighting is a reasonable enough procedure.

     Hunting voyages differed in duration, from time to time, hunting

ground to hunting ground, and voyage to voyage. Again, we made no effort

to introduce these subtleties into our index numbers. We assumed that a
                                        54

vessel arriving in New Bedford from the Pacific, in, say, 1830 was affected

during its whaling voyage by the amount of competition from vessels leaving

for the Pacific in 1828. Thus if the vessel had hunted in the Pacific and

had returned to New Bedford in 1830, it was assigned the "competition index

numbert' for 1828. We were unable to allow for competition offered by

vessels other than those sailing from New Bedford.

     We assumed that the western Arctic encompassed about 2.17 million

square miles (one-ninth of the Arctic Sea - -    representing   the Chukchi Sea

--   the   Bering Sea, the Sea of Okhotsk, and the Bering Strait); the

Atlantic, about 10 million square miles (roughly one-third of the area of

the Atlantic); the Pacific, about 22 million square miles (roughly one-

third of the area of the Pacific); the Indian, about 7 million square miles

(roughly one-quarter of the area of the Indian Ocean). These estimates

rest on data from the Columbia Gazeteer of the World (New York, 1962) and

maps showing whale migration routes in The Times Atlas of the World,

Comprehensive Edition (New York, 1980).

3. The short-comings of the index:
     (1) A more subtle index would allow the whale stock of each ground to
decline, with hunting, and the fertility rate gradually to rise. But to
carry through with such a model would require judgments as to the identity
of the whales (by age and sex) captured each year. We opted for a simpler,
more straight-forward calculation, which calls for fewer judgments about
the nature of whale hunting.
     (2) The procedure implicitly assumes that each ocean contains a single
population group, whereas each contains more than one. But our hunting
ground data do not permit us to draw distinctions so narrow.
     (3) The division of the U.S. catch among hunting grounds on the basis
of the New Bedford catch involves the assumption that New Bedford was
typical of U.S. sperm whaling. It probably was, but we are unable to
demonstrate that. If we had the data to do so, we would be able to work
out a better method of division. Our procedure here is less than perfect,
but it is the best we could produce.
     (4) The use of an average annual catch in the index is readily
defended, but there is no good defense for the selection of four years as
against other possibilities, a point already made in the text.
     (5) Vessels sailing, e.g., to the Pacific might kill whales in the
Atlantic and the Indian Ocean, on the way to and from the Pacific. Thus
New Bedford "Pacific" catches probably include whales from other oceans.
     (6) Only U.S. hunting is accounted for. While the U.S. was far and
away the leading hunter, other nations also participated in the hunt and
accounted for between 20 and 25 percent of the total catch.

and Porpoises: An Interdisciplinary Assessment," Part One, Ecology Law
Ouarterlv. Vol. 6, 1977, 323. Scharff asserts that the ratio of the total
population to the exploitable population was 2 to 1, in the case of sperm
whales, and 1.5 to 1, in the case of baleens. Scharff uses these ratios to
convert both current (i.e., disequilibrium) and initial (i.e., equilibrium)
figures. One would expect the ratios to vary, from the first to the second
case, but for present purposes the coefficients are adequate.


8.  The geographic definition of the Arctic used here -- including all of
the Bering Sea, as well as the Bering Strait -- is probably somewhat too
broad. To compensate, we included in the region the North Pacific right
whales, whose migration route takes them through the Bering Sea.

                  The Diffusion of Whalecraft Innovations



     "There has been as great a revolution in the mode of killing whales

during the past twenty years, as there has been in the art of naval

warfare; were it not for this, but few whalers would now be afloat. .

Charles M. Scammon, The Marine Mammals of the North-Western Coast of

America (San Francisco, 1874), p. 226.

     Scammon refers to whalecraft innovations, which he believes produced

effects in 20 years roughly equivalent to the changes in vessel design and

other aspects of outfitting that took place in the period between the 17th

and late 19th centuries. This appendix describes the principal innovations

and investigates the speed of their adoption)

     The American style of whaling involved (1) a sailing vessel (later in

the period some had auxiliary steam power) and (2) several small (28 to 30

feet by 6 feet), light whaling boats, from which the attack on the whale

was made. The equipment in the boat and the attack on the whale depended

somewhat on the type of whale involved and the place of the attack. Gray

whales and humpbacks were typically taken in bays in shallow water, which

required certain types of equipment (e.g., humpbacks sank when killed, so

that boats had to carry gear to mark them and hold their bodies in place

until, eventually, they rose again; bay hunting called for the use of

anchors, useless in the open sea, where most hunting went on) and permitted

the use of other gear that was not very effective in the rougher waters

outside the bays (the Greener swivel harpoon gun, for example). Sperm

whales were regarded as much more ferocious than rights, requiring special

caution in the attack. Bowheads posed peculiar problems, since they could
                                               58

-   - and   did - -   seek   escape from the hunters under the Arctic ice.

       Despite these variations the fundamental character of the American

system is clear. It can be described best if we consider the case of, say,

a large bark hunting the Pacific. Slung from davits above the decks of the

bark are four whaling boats; two or three spares are stored elsewhere. Men

are in the cross-trees on watch for whales. When whales are sighted, the

boats are lowered to give chase. Each boat carries six men, five oarsmen

(three starboard and two port) and a steersman, called a boatheader. The

boatheader of each boat is normally a mate. With all four boats on the

sea, there are typically five or six men left to sail the vessel, keep

lookout, and signal the movements of the whales to the boats.

       Whale boats were sailed and sometimes rowed. If there was danger that

the sounds of the oars would frighten the whale, they were paddled. The

boat crew attempted to approach the whale closely; if possible, they would

run the boat onto the whale's back, when the forward starboard oarsman --

known as the boatsteerer or harpooner -- would rise and thrust two harpoons

into the whale. Boatsteerer and boatheader would then change places in the

boat and, in the early days of whaling, the latter would slash at the whale

with a sharp implement called a spade, in an effort to sever the tendons in

the whale's flukes (tail) and to cripple him. This dangerous practice was

later generally abandoned.

       The purpose of the harpoon was to hook the whale and attach it by a

line to the whaleboat. The weight of the line and the whaleboat were

intended to tire the whale and permit him to be approached once again. The

dispatching of the whale was then left to the boatheader, who killed it

with a tool called a lance, originally a long, hand-held stabbing

implement.
                                          59

     While the technique remained essentially unchanged, the implements

were improved in important respects. The principal innovations were

introduced between the late 1840's and the mid 1860's and they diffused

during the period of decline of the American fleet.

     The most important innovations in harpoons (called "irons" by

whalemen) centered on the mode by which the implement was conveyed from the

boat to the whale, and on the features of the head of the harpoon that

affected its ability to hook the whale.

     Most American harpoons were thrust or thrown - -   darted,   the whalers

said - -   by   hand. The harpoon was attached to a cut sapling, with bark left

on to improve the grip. The harpooner then thrust or threw the pole. If

he was successful, the harpoon hooked the whale and the pole was detached

and floated away.

     Harpoon poles could not be thrown very far; thus attempts were made to

shoot the harpoon from swivel guns and from rocket launchers that closely

resembled the World War II bazooka. The swivel gun was invented at a very

early date and figured importantly in the Scotch and English fisheries, but

it never established itself in the American fisheries, except in the hunt

for gray whales in the California bays. Success with the swivel depended

upon calm seas (otherwise aim was thrown off) and sturdy boats, neither

common in the American fisheries.2

     The rocket launcher would seem to have been a more promising line. It

was light and it did not have the kick of a swivel gun, an important matter

for American whalemen, in view of the small, light boats in which they

hunted. According to Lytle, notable whalemen from Scoresby to Rotch to

Roys reported great success with various rocket launchers. Yet there

appears to have been no rush among American whalemen to adopt this
                                          60

innovation and its general impact seems to have been negligible.

     Innovations respecting the head of the harpoon were numerous and some

were widely and rather quickly diffused. Although the variations on each

style were great, there appear to have been only three basic styles of

harpoon head: the two-flued, the one-flued, and the toggle. The terms are

descriptive. The head of a two-flued harpoon was shaped like an arrow

head, with sharp leading edges and dull following edges, the latter

intended to lodge in the flesh of the whale. Sometimes, however, the two-

flued harpoon pulled out. The one-flued harpoon --          with   only one following

edge -- was designed to minimize the chances that would happen, and was

widely regarded as superior to its predecessor. The toggle iron had a head

that turned on a pivet. When the harpoon was being thrown, the head was

held in a fixed position - -   sharp   edges forward - -   by   a small, light piece

of wood. When the head entered the whale, the wood broke, the head turned,

and the whale was securely hooked.

     The crucial innovation - -   dated   to 1848 - -   appears to have been the
toggle iron.3 James Durfee, a leading New Bedford manufacturer of

whalecraft, produced 22,133 harpoons between May 15, 1830, and October 29,

1844, all two-flued. Between October 29, 1844, and May 9, 1850, only two

years after the invention of the toggle, he produced 7,526 two-flued

harpoons and 265 toggle irons, while between May 9, 1850, and October 27,

1862, the numbers were almost equal: 20,462 two-flued versus 20,191

toggle. The outfitting books of the bark Ospray list 190 "common" irons

and 50 toggle, in 1854; 40 two-flued, 10 one-flued, and 60 toggle, in 1866;

and 10 two-flued, 11 one-flued, and 90 toggle, in 188O. The bark Louisa

carried all common irons in 1850; 130 common and 50 toggle, in 1853; 42

each of the one- and two-flued and 100 of the toggle, in 1856; 36 two-
                                        61

flued, 20 one-flued, and 100 toggle, in 1865; 10 two-flued, 3 one-flued,

and 120 toggle, in l874. The bark Globe listed 36 toggle in 1869.6

Scammon says that a first class whale ship on a Cape Horn voyage in the

early 1870's should carry 15 two-flued and 150 toggle harpoons.7

     The examples could readily be multiplied. The lessons seem clear.

According to these records, the two-flued and toggle irons were the

important designs, the one-flued having limited transitional significance.

A clearer and firmer finding is that the toggle iron was adopted quickly,

achieved equal importance with the two-flued iron in the 1850's, but did

not clearly dominate the other forms until the 1870's, a quarter of a

century after its innovation. Even then, outfit books typically called for

a few common irons, in addition to the toggles.

     Harpoons were made of iron, the shank of soft iron, to allow it to

bend under pressure and, thus, to reduce the likelihood that the head would

pull out of the whale. Hand lances, however, were to serve not as hooks,

but as stabbing devices, easily thrust into the whale and easily withdrawn,

so that subsequent thrusts could be made. The lance was typically made of

tough wrought iron, mounted on a pole, but the head was frequently of

steel. Lytle says steel was preferred --     for   obvious reasons -   - and that

it completely displaced wrought iron,        .once steel was produced in

quantity in this country... ," a development presumably associated with a

decline in the relative price of steel.8 In fact, the timing is almost

right. Relative steel prices fell particularly sharply after 1867. If the

ratio of steel to wrought iron prices in 1867 is taken as the base of an

index number series (100) the index fell to 71, in 1870, and 59, in 1875.

Outfitting lists immediately reflected the change: the lists for the Emily

Morgan, 1842-1845, and the ships Julius Caesar, 1837, Magnolia, 1842, and
                                        62

Francis Henrietta, 1843, mention no steel-headed lances, while those for

the barks Globe, 1869, and Mary Frazier, 1876, mention no iron-headed hand

lances.1° Scammon's list for the early 1870's also contains no hand lances

with iron heads.11 The Ospray carried half common and half steel-headed

lances in 1854, but its outfit had changed to all steel-headed lances by

1868.

        There were other proposals to make the lance deadlier: heat it,

electrify it, poison it. None of these plans came to much, for fairly

obvious reasons: for example, crewmen reasoned (correctly) that if the

poison killed the whale, it might kill them, too, when they handled their

victim. The proposal to make the lance explosive, however, did come to

something. Explosive devices were commonly innovated with new modes of

delivering the lance to the whale, guns of various kinds.

        The first set of guns consisted of shoulder guns, similar to shotguns,

and they were intended to be managed by the boatheader. Unfortunately they

produced a substantial kick, that frequently threw the boatheader to the

bottom of the boat, sometimes broke his collar bone, and occasionally

capsized the boat. Much inventive effort was directed toward dealing with

these problems, and eventually the Allen gun --   usually   called the Brand

gun because C.C. Brand developed and promoted it -- achieved a wide

acceptance. The progress of the shoulder gun is exhibited nicely in the

outfitting lists of the bark Ospray: The lists for 1851 and 1854 show no

whale guns, while those for 1866 and 1868 refer to three (fewer than one

per boat), presumably all shoulder guns. The number rises to six at the

end of the 1860's and the beginning of the 1870's, and remains at six in

1880, one per boat plus two spares. The bark Globe carried four in 1869,

Scammon (early 1870's) calls for four on his Cape Horn whaler, and John
                                           63

Williams, Ca. 1880, allowed one gun per boat. The Lottie Beard, a resupply

vessel, Carried eight boxes of guns and lances, in 1886, while the order

books of Frank E. Brown, a New Bedford seller of whaling implements, show

the sale of 1,906 feathered lances --       i.e.,   lances for shoulder guns -- and

only 921 long lances and unspecified lances - -       presumably hand lances - -   in
1877 and 1878. By the fall of 1899 and the spring of 1900, Brown listed

only feathered lances and lances for darting guns (discussed below).12

     The final whalecraft innovation of note combined in one instrument

most of the important characteristics of harpoon and whaling gun. It

consisted of a gun - -    called   a darting gun, or a Pierce gun, for its

inventor -- mounted on the staff of a harpoon. When the harpoon was darted

into the whale, a lever was depressed. The gun was fired and an explosive

lance was driven deep into the whale. The Pierce gun could deliver an

explosive lance more accurately than a shoulder gun. The location of the

gun - -   close   to the whale when it went off - -   meant that the lance was

delivered with great power, without conveying a "kick" to harpooner or

boat. Finally, the apparatus usually stopped the whale, preventing the

long struggles common when a standard harpoon was placed. In the Arctic,

where there was always danger that a harpooned whale would dive under the

ice, this feature was particularly important.

     The darting gun was probably the most effective piece of whalecraft

introduced in the American fishery in the nineteenth century. It developed

late, however. It was invented in 1865 and its diffusion did not begin on

a large scale until the 1870's. The outfitting books of the bark Ospray in

the late 1860's and early 1870's make no mention of darting guns, but two

of them plus fifteen lances appear in 1880. None are on John Williams's

list for Ca. 1882, despite the fact that Williams had in mind an Arctic
                                     64

voyage, but Scammon (early 1870's) called for four --   one   per boat -- and

50 darting gun bomb-lances. Clearly Scammon saw important uses for the

darting gun, but did not conceive of its replacing all its predecessors:

his list includes 35 steel-headed hand lances, four whaling guns, other

than the darting guns, and 150 shoulder gun bomb-lances. The Frank E.

Brown order books show a steady increase in the relative importance of the

darting gun: the fraction of the total lances supplied by Brown that fit

the darting gun rose from 7 percent, in 1877, to 9 per cent, in 1878, to 14

per cent, in 1879, to 41 per cent, in the fall of 1899 and the spring of

1900. A clearer indication of the change under way is that Brown sold only

eight Brand shoulder guns in the period 1877 through 1879, while he

disposed of 81 Pierce darting guns in the same years.13

     In summary, the important whalecraft innovations were made in the

period between 1848 and 1865, and they diffused in the 1850's through at

least the 1880's. The order of adoption ran about as follows: toggle iron

(1848-1870), steel-head lance (1845?-l870), shoulder gun (1855?-1880),

darting gun (l865?-1885?). From the time when the diffusion of the toggle

iron was clearly well under way to the time when the darting gun had made a

substantial impact is an interval of about 30 years. The process began at

about mid century and was over in the early 1880's.

     (a) The t statistics were adjusted to allow for the large size of the
sample:

     Adjusted t =    coefficient/adjusted    standard error
                                                 Sample Size

     (b) The equation was also run in natural logs. The fit was poorer,
while the results did not change substantially.

     (c) A priori there is no strong reason to expect heteroskedasticity
or, if it exists, to anticipate serious problems with it, in view of the
enormous size of the sample compared with the universe. Nonetheless, since
the data are panel data we tested for heteroskedasticity by regressing the
variances of the error terms against the continuous explanatory variables,
and the test turned up evidence of heteroskedasticity. We made corrections
by dividing the dependent and independent variables by the standard errors
of the residuals and ran the regression again. The significance levels did
not deteriorate and the results did not change substantively.
