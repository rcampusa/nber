                                            ABSTRACT




This paper evaluates the political economy and structural factors explaining the collection efficiency
of the Value Added Tax [VAT]. We consider the case where the collection efficiency is determined
by the probability of audit and by the penalty on underpaying. Implementation lags imply that the
present policy maker determines the efficiency of the tax system next period. Theory suggests that
the collection efficiency is impacted by political economy considerations greater polarization and
political instability would reduce the efficiency of the tax collection. In addition, collection is
impacted by structural factors affecting the ease of tax evasion, like the urbanization level, the share
of agriculture, and trade openness. Defining the collection efficiency of the VAT as the ratio of the
VAT revenue to aggregate consumption divided by the standard VAT rate, we evaluate the evidence
on VAT collection efficiency in a panel of 44 countries over 1970-99. The results are consistent with
the theory - a one standard deviation increase in durability of political regime, and in the ease and
fluidity of political participation, increase the VAT collection efficiency by 3.1% and 3.6%,
respectively. A one standard deviation increase in urbanization, trade openness, and the share of
agriculture changes the VAT collection efficiency by 12.7%, 3.9%, and - 4.8%, respectively. In
addition, a one standard deviation increase in GDP/Capita increases the tax efficiency by 8.1%.
Qualitatively identical results apply for an alternative measure of VAT collection efficiency, defined
by the ratio of VAT revenue to GDP divided by the standard VAT.

        GROWING numbers of policy analysts and politicians are saying that it may finally be time to consider a value-added tax
        as part of our federal revenue system. In years past, I would have been in the forefront of those denouncing the idea… the
        main reason for this is that it was too easy to raise V.A.T. rates amid the double-digit price increases of the inflationary
        1970's. In those days, there were many economists who still believed that budget deficits caused inflation, making it easier
        to delude people into thinking that higher taxes were necessary to get inflation under control…Those countries that adopted
        the value-added tax since the end of the great inflation, however, have been very restrained in raising rates… But unless
        spending is checked or revenue raised, we are facing deficits of historic proportions… When that day comes, huge tax
        increases are inevitable because no one has the guts to seriously cut health spending. Therefore, the only question is how
        will the revenue be raised: in a smart way that preserves incentives and reduces growth as little as possible, or stupidly by
        raising marginal tax rates and making everything bad in our tax code worse? If the first route is chosen, the value-added
        tax is by far the best option available to deal with an unpalatable situation.

        The globalization of trade and finance has profound implications on the patterns of taxes.
Developing countries used to rely heavily on trade taxes, seigniorage and financial repression as
the main sources of fiscal revenue. A common denominator of these taxes is that they are
associated with a relatively low cost of collection and enforcement – trade taxes are collected at a
centralized port of entry, and seigniorage and financial repression act as an implicit tax. Greater
trade integration has implied a drastic cut in tariffs, reducing thereby the revenue of trade taxes.
Successful macro stabilizations and greater financial openness sharply reduced the revenue from
seigniorage and financial repression.1 While most of these developments enhanced efficiency,
they also exposed developing countries to the challenge of finding alternative means of financing
fiscal needs.
        Most countries dealt with the new challenges by adopting new taxes, including the Value
Added Tax [VAT]. Today, the VAT is a major part of the tax system in over 136 countries,
raising about one-fourth of the world's tax revenue [Ebrill, Keen, Bodin, and Summers (2001,
2002)]. The debate regarding the welfare gains associated with switching from trade taxes to the
VAT is not over. Emran and Stiglitz (2005) cautioned that the welfare gains from a switch to the
VAT are questionable in the presence of a large informal sector. Baunsgaard and Keen (2005)
found that for middle-income countries, revenue recovery following trade liberalization has been
about 50 cents for each dollar of lost trade tax revenue, and the revenue recovery has been very
weak in low-income countries. Nor is there much evidence that the mere presence of a value-
added tax has made it easier to cope with the revenue effects of trade liberalization. As the lead

  The greater de-facto financial integration may be either the outcome of policy choice [de-jure financial
integration], or a by product of greater trade openness, forcing greater de-facto financial openness [see Prasad,
Rogoff, Wei and Koss (2003), Aizenman (2004) and Aizenman and Noy (2005)]. See Gordon and Li (2005) and
Jinjarak (2005) for tax collection challenges facing developing countries.

citation points out, adopting the VAT also remains a debated issue in the USA, framed
occasionally as “A too easy tax to collect” by advocates of the “Starve the beast” approach to
government’s size, versus views that focus on the welfare cost of alternative taxes.
           A frequently cited advantage of the VAT is that this tax is collected throughout the
production chain, giving it a practical advantage.2 Specifically, the VAT should be associated
with easier enforcement, as it allows the fiscal authority to compare reported sales of each
intermediate product with reported purchases of producers using that intermediate product as an
input in a vertical production chain. While the VAT may indeed be an easier tax to enforce than
income tax, the VAT is not a panacea – enforcing it involves spending resources on collecting
and processing information, prosecuting and penalizing agents found underpaying the tax, etc.
Hence, one expects that VAT collection efficiency increases with the resources spent on
enforcement, and with the efficiency of monitoring, collecting and processing information.
Theory suggests that the enforceability of taxes is impacted by political economy considerations
– greater polarization and political instability would tend to reduce the efficiency of tax
collection, reducing the resources devoted to tax enforcement. In addition, collection is impacted
by structural factors that affect the ease of tax evasion, like the urbanization level, the share of
agriculture, and trade openness.
           The purpose of this paper is to verify the dependence of VAT collection efficiency on
key structural and political economy factors. Section 2 outlines a model determining VAT
efficiency, extending Cukierman, Edwards and Tabellini (1992). Specifically, we model the
optimal tax evasion of agents, in an economy where the government determines optimally the
probability of audit and the penalty associated with underpaying the VAT. We show that greater
political instability and polarization tends to reduce tax efficiency. Similarly, economic
structures that increase the cost of enforcement, like less urbanization, less trade openness, and
higher share of agriculture, reduce the collection efficiency of the VAT.
           Section 3 confirms these predictions in a study that explains two measures of VAT
collection efficiency. The first, dubbed C-efficiency, is the ratio of the VAT revenue to
aggregate consumption, divided by the standard VAT rate. The second is the ratio of VAT

    See Gordon and Nielsen (1997) for an assessment of the gains associated with the switch to the VAT.

revenue to GDP, divided by the standard VAT rate. 3 The closer these ratios are to zero (one),
the lower (higher) the collection efficiency of the VAT tax. Having information on the standard
VAT rate in 2003 for a sample of 44 countries, we assume that the statutory rates do not change
frequently in practice, and use information about the annual VAT revenues, economic and
political variables of the 44 countries over the period 1970-1999. During this sample period, the
collection efficiency of VAT ranges from 2.4 percent in Belarus, 9.6 percent in Mexico, to 45.2
percent in Finland. The data also suggest a wide range of VAT experiences. There is no
systematic difference in statutory VAT rates between high-income and developing countries. The
size of VAT revenue as a percentage of total tax revenue varies from 6.6 percent in Japan, to
40.5 percent in Chile. VAT revenue to GDP ranges from 0.1 percent in Guinea to 10 percent in
Norway. Across countries, VAT revenues to GDP increase with real GDP per capita, and
urbanization share of population, and decreases with agriculture share of GDP.
         The main findings reported in Section 3 are that political economy and structure matter in
ways consistent with the theory. The effects are economically and statistically significant. A
one standard deviation increase in durability of political regime, and in the ease and fluidity of
political participation, increase the first VAT collection efficiency measure (C-efficiency) by 3.1
percent and 3.6 percent, respectively. A one standard deviation increase in urbanization, trade
openness, and the share of agriculture changes the VAT collection efficiency by 12.7 percent, 3.9
percent, and - 4.8 percent, respectively. In addition, a one standard deviation increase in the
GDP/Capita increases the tax efficiency by 8.1 percent. Qualitatively identical results apply for
the alternative measure of VAT collection efficiency. Section 4 closes the paper with concluding
remarks.


2.       The model
         Our benchmark model is adopted from Cukierman, Edwards and Tabellini (1992), which
explains the obstacles to tax reforms in polarized countries, characterized by political instability.
They focused on the case where fiscal revenue can be raised by taxes associated with collection
costs [like income taxes], and implicit taxes where the collection cost is zero, like the inflation

3
  See Ebrill et. al. (2001) for a detailed discussion of these two measures of VAT collection efficiency. They point
out that the appropriate benchmark for the VAT should be total consumption (being the ideal VAT base, exempting
investment), and not GDP. In addition, GDP may be subject to greater measurement error than consumption.

tax. They assumed implementation lags – the present policy maker determines the efficiency of
the tax system next period. This implies that the choice of the tax system efficiency may be
strategic – the current policy maker may choose an inefficient future tax system in order to
constrain the fiscal revenue available to future policy makers. This prevents future policy makers
from spending in ways that are viewed as inferior from the vantage point of the present policy
maker.


         The economy at time t is described by two representative budget constraints: the
government, (1) and the private sector, (2):


                        gt + f t + θ t ≤ τ at + st                                      (1)


                        ct = 1 − τ ta − st − δ (τ~t ) − γ ( st ) .                      (2)


Each individual is endowed with one unit of output in each period. The variables g t ; f t

represent two different public goods [say guns and butter] in per capita terms, and ct is per-

capita private consumption. The term θ t is the fiscal investment in tax capacity, the impact of

which is discussed below. The government collects from each individual an amount s t , in the

form of seigniorage, and an amount τ at of actual VAT revenue. The statutory VAT rate is τ~t .

Seigniorage carries no administrative costs, whereas the VAT is associated with costly
enforcement, described below. Both VAT and seigniorage impose convex deadweight losses on
the private sector, equal to δ (τ~ ); γ ( s ) , satisfying δ ' > 0, δ " > 0, γ ' > 0, γ " > 0 .

The agent’s problem


         Underpaying the VAT is costly: with probability pt , the agent is audited. If she is found

paying τ t below the statutory rate, she would be penalized, paying τ~t + 0.5φt [τ~t − τ t ]2 . Hence,

underpaying is associated with a quadratic penalty of 0.5φt [τ~t − τ t ]2 , paid with probability pt .
                                                            6


The period t utility from the private consumption is U (ct ) . The representative agent would

submit tax payment τ ts , maximizing her expected utility:




                                    MAX [ ptU (ct , a ) + (1 − pt )U (ct , n )]                           (3)
                                      τt


where ct , a ( ct , n ) is the agent’s private consumption at time t if she is audited (not audited):

ct , a = 1 − {τ~t + 0 .5φt [τ~t − τ t ]2 } − st − δ (τ~t ) − γ ( st );
                                                                              .

Optimizing (3), the optimal submitted tax, denoted by τ ts , is:

                                                           1 − pt
                                             τ ts = τ~ −          (1 − λ )                                (4)

where λ is the risk premium adjustment, λ =                                            ≥ 0 , and U ' (ct ) is the marginal
                                                               U ' (ct , a )

utility associated with consumption ct . The risk term, λ , is the percentage gap of the marginal
utilities between the audit and no-audit cases. The resultant expected tax payment is


                                                                 (1 − pt )    2
                                             E[τ t ] = τ~t − 0.5           (1 − λ2 )                      (5)
                                                                    p t φt


The expected tax payment increases with the probability of an audit, and with the penalty rate
associated with underpayment. It also increases with the degree of risk aversion – higher risk
aversion increases the utility cost associated with being audited. In practice, the risk adjustment
term, λ , is of second order magnitude in circumstances where the tax gap between the increases
                                                                   7

in tax payment associated with audit, is small relative to total consumption. Thus, for simplicity,
we henceforth ignore this risk adjustment term, assuming λ ≅ 0 .4
            The economy is populated with a large number of atomistic agents. Hence, from the
point of view of the authorities, the idiosyncratic risk associated with tax evasion is diversified
away – in the macro budget constraints (1) - (2), the actual tax revenue τ at is the expected tax

payment of the atomistic agent,

The policy maker problem


            There are two possible policymaker types, L and R, who randomly alternate in office.
The policy maker of type i, i = L, R maximizes welfare:


                     ⎧∞
                                 [                                 ]⎫
            wit = Et ⎨∑ β k U (ct + k ) + H i ( g t + k , f t + k ) ⎬ ; 1 > β > 0 ,                               (6)
                     ⎩ k =0                                         ⎭


where Et denotes the expectation operator, U is a concave utility function. The utility from

consuming g and f, H i , is defined as follows,


                 ⎛     1      ⎞
H L ( g , f ) = ⎜⎜            ⎟⎟ min[αg , (1 − α ) f ];
                 ⎝ α (1 − α )  ⎠
                                                                                    1>α > 0.                      (6’)
                 ⎛     1      ⎞
H R ( g , f ) = ⎜⎜            ⎟⎟ min[(1 − α ) g , αf ];
                 ⎝ α (1 − α )  ⎠

    It is easy to verify that   λ≅                                   . Hence, λ is negligible when               is small. Note that
                                           ct , a     U ' (ct , a )                                     ct ,a
audit risk is idiosyncratic, and may be diversified away by distributing it across agents. The risk adjustment would
be zero in the presence of such insurance. Our analysis can be extended to the case where the risk adjustment factor
is positive, without impacting the main results.

          Thus, the two policy makers differ only in the desired composition of the public good,
where their disagreement is parameterized by α − 0.5 . By construction, the overall weight

given to private versus public consumption, does not depend on the disagreement parameter, α.
          The political system is described as a Markov process with transition probabilities π and
1 – π : the government in office at time t has a fixed probability 1 – π of being reappointed next
period. With probability π, it is thrown out of office and the other policymaker type is
appointed.
          Let x ≡ g + f denote the total amount of government spending. For concreteness, we
assume α > 0.5 . While the private agent views the probability of an audit, and the penalty rate
at time t, as exogenous, these variables are pre-determined by the policy maker at time t -1. The
efficiency of the tax system is determined by the probability of an audit, and by the penalty
associated with tax evasion, p and φ, respectively. We assume that both p and φ are determined
by the investment in tax capacity, θ . To capture the greater inertia in reforming the tax system
than in changing fiscal policy, assume that the investment in tax efficiency, θ , along with p and
φ, but not the other policy variables ( τ~ ; s ; g ; f ), must be chosen one period in advance. Thus,
                                           t   t    t      t


θ t −1 was chosen at time t-1, but exerts an influence on the efficiency of the tax system only at
time t:




                                 pt = pt (θ t −1 ; ST );       p' > 0;   p" < 0;
                                                                                   .   (7)
                                 φt = φt (θ t −1 ; ST ); φ ' > 0; φ " < 0;


where ST is the vector of structural factors impacting the cost of tax collection. Specifically,
high urbanization rate, lower share of agriculture and higher trade openness may reduce the
effective cost of monitoring and collecting information, implying greater efficiency of the
collection system. As these structural factors are changing slowly, we view them beyond the
control of the policy maker, and focus on the determination of optimal investment in tax
capacity, θ t .
          Our system differs from the one in Cukierman et. al (1992) in two ways: we model the
tax aversion and the auditing process, and we assume that improving the efficiency of the tax
                                                             9

system at time t involves a costly investment at time t – 1. Despite these modifications, the
solution methodology of Cukierman et. al (1992) continues to apply. As in proposition 1 in
Cukierman et. al. (1992), optimal choices of consumption, aggregate public good, seigniorage
and VAT are a function of the efficiency of the tax system:


          c* = C (θ ); x* = X (θ ); s* = S (θ ); (τ a )* = T (θ );                                       (8)


satisfying C ' (θ ) < 0; X ' (θ ) > 0; S ' (θ ) < 0; T ' (θ ) > 0 , where z* denotes the optimal value of z.
The equilibrium value of the tax rate chosen, θ , satisfies the first order condition:5


                                           ⎡            1−α ⎤
                   βU ' (C (θ ))C ' (θ ) + ⎢1 − π + π         X ' (θ ) = 1                               (9)
                                           ⎣             α ⎥⎦

The main results of the model are summarized in a proposition akin to proposition 2 in
Cukierman at. al (1992):


    I.        If the current government is certain of being reappointed, or if there is no polarization
              ( π = 0 or α = 0.5 ), then it brings about the most efficient tax system. The
              corresponding FOC is β U ' (C (θ ))C ' (θ ) + X ' (θ ) = 1 .


    II.       The lower the probability that the current government will remain in office and the
              greater the polarization, the more inefficient is the tax system left as a legacy to the
              future administration. This inefficiency is manifested by lower investment in tax
              capacity, inducing a lower probability of auditing, and a lower penalty on tax evasion,

5
  As in Cuikerman et. al. (1992), since the tax capacity is set one period in advance, and is reset each period, the
infinite horizon equilibrium is characterized by looking one period ahead. The symmetry of the specification
implies that the policy maker at time t is setting the tax capacity for the next period, θ , by maximizing

            reducing thereby the tax collection associated with a given statutory VAT rate.
            Structural factors that increase the ease of tax evasion reduce the equilibrium tax
            collection.


3.      The evidence
        As of 2004, 136 countries have implemented a VAT (International Tax Dialogue, 2005).
About one-third of these countries has complete information on annual VAT revenues, and
corresponding economic, structural, and political variables in those years. Table 1 reports
statutory VAT rates, and averages of the actual VAT revenues over 1970-1999, for these 44
countries for which data are available. Because we only have access to the last year of cross-
country information on statutory VAT rates, our investigation is forced to use VAT rates as of
the year 2003. Nevertheless, the VAT rates do not change frequently over time. Due to these data
limitations, we end up with a total of 454 observations.
        In the sample, the earliest implementation of the VAT was by Brazil in 1967, and the
latest by Cameroon in 1999.6 There is no systematic difference in statutory VAT rates between
high-income and developing countries. The size of VAT revenue in total tax revenue varies from
6.6 percent in Japan to 40.5 percent in Chile. Figure 1 relates cross-country VAT revenue to a set
of economic variables. VAT revenue to GDP tends to increase with real GDP per capita, and
urbanization share of population, and decrease with the agriculture share of GDP. To answer
how this cross-country variability can be explained by economic variables, we estimate panel
linear equations of VAT collection efficiency controlling for a set of explanatory variables
suggested in the literature.
        We calculate VAT collection efficiency using two alternatives: (i) C-efficiency ratio,
defined as annual VAT revenue to consumption divided by the year 2003 standard VAT rate; (ii)
Efficiency ratio, defined as annual VAT revenue to GDP divided by the year 2003 standard VAT
rate. The difference between the two alternatives is that the C-efficiency ratio is normalized by
reference to a consumption-type VAT, whereas the Efficiency ratio is normalized by reference to
an income-type VAT.
        The explanatory variables are:

6
  France was the first to implement a VAT in 1948. Cape Verde recently implemented a VAT in 2004. Due to data
limitations, these two countries were excluded from the sample.
                                                   11

(a)     Measures of economic development: real GDP per capita. We expect that a higher level
of income should be associated with higher VAT collection efficiency.
(b)     Composition of gross domestic product and population: agricultural share in GDP, trade
openness, and urbanization of population. We expect that it is more difficult to administer and
collect a VAT in less urbanized, more rural countries. We also include trade to GDP since
imports are an important base for VAT, and represent the part of the VAT that is more easily
enforced.7
(c)     Measures of political instability and fluidity of political participation: durability of
political regime, and regulation of political participation. We expect higher VAT performance in
countries with a more stable political regime and highly regulated political participation (hence,
more homogeneous societies with relatively fluid political participation), than less stable, more
polarized political systems.
The Data Appendix provides sources and details of these variables.
        Table 2 reports the results for the two alternative measures of VAT collection efficiency.
To handle both the time and cross-country dimension of the data, we employ fixed-effects
estimation including year dummies. The dependent variable for the first three columns is the C-
efficiency ratio, and for the last three columns the Efficiency ratio. Using the C-efficiency ratio
as a measure of VAT performance (columns I-III), all of the coefficient estimates have the
expected sign. Urbanization, trade openness, real GDP per capita, and measures of political
stability and fluidity if political participation, enter positively, indicating that VAT collection
efficiency is increasing in these variables. In addition, a higher agriculture share of GDP is
associated with a significantly lower VAT performance. Furthermore, these explanatory
variables are robust to various specifications. Columns IV-VI, with the Efficiency ratio as the
dependent variable, yield similar results. One exception is the urbanization of population, which
has the expected sign, but is not statistically significant.
        These regressions account for 55-67 percent of the variance in the data. Figure 2
summarizes the contribution of the explanatory variables in regressions III and VI. The economic
significance of these variables is sizable. The two most important variables explaining the VAT
performance are the urbanization share of population, and real GDP per capita. A one standard
                                                      12

deviation increase in the urbanization share (18.1 percent of the total population) raises the VAT
C-efficiency ratio by 12.7 percent, and the Efficiency ratio by 4.4 percent. A one standard
deviation increase in per capita GDP (US$5,960) raises the C-efficiency ratio by 8.1 percent and
the Efficiency ratio by 4.6 percent. A one standard deviation increase in trade openness raises
the C-efficiency ratio by 3.9 percent, and the Efficiency ratio by 1.7 percent. A one standard
deviation increase in the GDP share of agriculture reduces the C-efficiency ratio by 4.8 percent,
and the Efficiency ratio by 3.5 percent. Political economy variables also provide significant
explanation of the VAT performance. A one standard deviation increase in the durability of the
political regime, and in the regulation of political participation, raise the VAT C-efficiency by
3.1 percent and 3.6 percent, respectively. Similar results apply to the impact of political economy
variables on VAT measured by the Efficiency ratio.
        Tables 3 and 4 report robustness checks of our main results. In columns VII and VIII of
Table 3, we added the age of the VAT (years since first implemented) to the regressions to
capture how the maturity of the VAT may influence its collection efficiency. The age of the
VAT has an unexpected negative sign, but it is insignificant and provides essentially no
explanatory power to the regressions of VAT performance. Ebrill et. al. (2001) found weak
support for the role of VAT age in collection efficiency. One interpretation is that while
administration of, and compliance with the VAT, may improve with experience, the structural
and political factors of the economy are more important considerations. Indeed, we continue to
find economically significant effects of the main explanatory variables in our benchmark
regressions of Table 2.
        In the last four columns of Table 3 we check whether the association between VAT
collection efficiency, and its determinants, differs between high-income and developing
countries. Columns IX and X refer to high-income countries in the sample. The last two columns
refer to developing countries only. For the developing countries, all of the coefficient estimates
continue to have the expected sign and economic significance. Contrast this with the result that
only real GDP per capita, and agriculture share of GDP have explanatory power when
considering VAT collection efficiency in the high-income group. It is possible to interpret this
result as supporting the hypothesis that collection costs and political instability are likely to be

imports.
                                                 13

more important to VAT performance in developing countries, than in high-income countries.
Alternatively, the variation in the political economy variable, among the high income countries,
is not sizable enough to matter for explaining the tax efficiency. It is also possible that given the
importance of, and difference in, the level of financial openness across countries, the actual
implementation of a VAT on financial services involves different problems in developing
countries, than exist in high-income countries (on taxation of financial services under a VAT, see
Auerbach and Gordon, 2002).
       Table 4 reports cross-country OLS regressions, which, given data limitations, allow us to
explore the association between VAT collection efficiency and income inequality. The cross-
country sample is an average over the period 1970-1999, covering 40 countries. In a cross-
country context, income level, as measured by real GDP per capita, is highly correlated with
other explanatory variables (-0.69 with the agriculture share; 0.68 with the durability of political
regime; -0.50 with the GINI index). Columns XIV and XVI provide the explanatory power of the
main structural, political, and income inequality variables, on VAT performance. As in the panel
estimation, the effects of the agriculture share and the durability of political regime continue to
be sizable and the cross-country regressions account for 59 percent –61 percent of the variance in
the data. A one standard deviation increase in the former is associated with 5.15 percent (9.3
percent) reduction in VAT Efficiency (C-efficiency). An additional year of continuing political
regime is associated with a 0.31 percent increase in VAT performance. Income inequality, as
measured by the GINI coefficient, enters the regressions negatively and is statistically
significant: a one standard deviation increase in the GINI is associated with 2.53 percent (4.43
percent) reduction in the collection efficiency of VAT revenue as a percentage of GDP (of
consumption).


4.     Concluding remarks
       The evidence presented in this paper is consistent with the structural, political economy
approach to taxation. While our paper does not negate the possibility of efficiency gains
associated with greater reliance on a VAT, it points out that these gains are not automatic, and
may depend on structural factors. We close the paper with a discussion of limitations and future
research. Our analysis focused on the de-facto efficiency of a VAT. A limitation of this
concept is that it is impacted by both tax evasion, and statutory exemptions from VAT (like
                                                14

allowing for lower tax rates on some categories). The absence of detailed information prevents
us at this stage from a more detailed decomposition of the de-facto collection efficiency between
tax evasion and statutory exemptions. Similarly, we assumed limited time variation in the
standard VAT in each country. Better data should allow us to improve the precision of the
empirical part. Despite these data limitations, our empirical investigation supports the prediction
of a political economy, public finance approach to taxation. This approach may be useful in
addressing the design and use of other taxes, including income, sales and trade taxes. Identifying
the trade-offs between a VAT and other taxes remains a topic worthy of future research.

Regulation of Political Participation: Participation is regulated to the extent that there are
binding rules on when, whether, and how political preferences are expressed. One-party states
and Western democracies both regulate participation but they do so in different ways, the former
by channeling participation through a single party structure, with sharp limits on diversity of
opinion; the latter by allowing relatively stable and enduring groups to compete nonviolently for
political influence. The polar opposite is unregulated participation, in which there are no
enduring national political organizations, and no effective regime controls on political activity. In
such situations political competition is often characterized by recurring coercion among shifting
coalitions of partisan groups. The index ranges from 1 to 5:
        1 = unregulated. Political participation is revolving around personalities, regional
        interests, and religious/ethnic/clan groups; but the number and relative importance of
        such groups in national political life varies substantially over time. There are no enduring
        national political organizations and systematic regime control of political activity is
        limited, that is, a situation characterized by a coincidence of a weak state and society.
        These conditions are increasingly rare following decolonization and the increasing
        globalization of economic exchange systems. In the contemporary context,
        uninstitutionalized competition is most likely to occur in resource poor countries and/or
        following the collapse of central authority under a (former) repressive, authoritarian state.
        5 = regulated. Relatively stable and enduring political groups regularly compete for
        political influence and positions with little use of coercion. No significant groups, issues,
        or types of conventional political action are regularly excluded from the political process.

GINI index: Gini index measures the extent to which the distribution of income (or, in some
cases, consumption expenditure) among individuals or households within an economy deviates
from a perfectly equal distribution. A Lorenz curve plots the cumulative percentages of total
income received against the cumulative number of recipients, starting with the poorest individual
or household. The Gini index measures the area between the Lorenz curve and a hypothetical
line of absolute equality, expressed as a percentage of the maximum area under the line. Thus a
Gini index of 0 represents perfect equality, while an index of 100 implies perfect inequality.
World Bank staff estimates are based on primary household survey data obtained from
government statistical agencies and World Bank country departments.
