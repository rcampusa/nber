1.     Introduction.

       Governments have at their disposal several different tax instruments that can be used singly

or in concert to finance their activities. These tax alternatives include personal and corporate

income taxes, sales taxes, value added taxes, property taxes, excise taxes, and numerous others. It

is not uncommon for a single government to elect to use many or all of these alternatives

simultaneously. The likely impact on a country’s ability to attract investment and stimulate

economic activity typically ranks highly among the criteria used in making choices over these tax

instruments.

       There is by now extensive evidence that high tax rates discourage foreign direct investment

(FDI), thereby offering support for the working hypothesis of many governments that maintain low

corporate tax rates in order to encourage investment. Empirical studies of the effect of taxation on

FDI typically consider the impact of differences in corporate income tax rates. This literature has

considerably less to say about the effect of taxes other than corporate taxes, even though, from a

theoretical standpoint, all types of taxes have the potential to reduce FDI. For example, high

personal income tax rates may be reflected at least in part in high pretax wages, which in turn

discourage FDI if labor and capital are complementary. Similarly, high rates of property taxation

may reduce the demand for FDI by as much as high rates of income taxes. The role of non-income

taxes may be particularly important for FDI as governments of many countries (including the

United States) permit multinational firms to claim foreign tax credits for corporate income taxes

paid to foreign governments, but do not extend this privilege to taxes other than income taxes. As

a result, taxes for which firms are ineligible to claim credits may have the strongest impact on firm

decision-making, including decisions of where and how much to invest.
        The purpose of this paper is to investigate the effect of the multiple tax instruments that

comprise a host country tax system on the magnitude and characteristics of foreign investment

activity by American multinational firms. In particular, the empirical work focuses on the

differential impacts of corporate income taxes and other taxes, such as personal income taxes,

property taxes, and value added taxes. The analysis uses data collected by the Bureau of Economic

Analysis of the U.S. Department of Commerce on the activities of American multinational firms in

1982, 1989, and 1994, the most recent years for which such comprehensive Benchmark data are

available. The high degree of correlation between corporate income tax rates and other tax rates

suggests that previous work may have conflated the effects of these distinct tax instruments. Since

the foreign indirect tax obligations of American multinational firms are roughly three times their

direct tax obligations, there is obvious scope for indirect taxes to influence their behavior.

        The results confirm that high tax rates discourage business activity by American

multinational firms, but suggest that there are important effects of all types of taxes, including

taxes other than corporate income taxes. Since Americans are ineligible to claim tax credits

against home-country tax liabilities for anything other than foreign income taxes, it stands to

reason that other taxes such as labor income taxes and property taxes might have the potential to

discourage business activity. The results indicate that indirect business taxes influence the location

of profit-generating business activity, with an impact that is particularly noticeable on the

capital/labor ratios used in offshore operations. In addition, the paper provides evidence that

indirect tax rates affect the location of profits even controlling for the use of productive inputs.

        The magnitude and impact of indirect taxation on the activities of foreign investors carries

potentially important implications for the dynamics of tax competition. Countries that are eager to

protect their tax bases, possibly at the expense of others, have incentives to select direct and




                                                                                                       2
indirect tax rates that reflect this goal. Given that large capital exporters such as the United States

provide explicit tax relief for direct taxes through foreign tax credits, the scope for competition on

indirect taxes may be much greater – and all the more likely in the absence of bilateral treaties or

multilateral conventions on indirect taxation. Consequently, one of the objectives in studying the

behavioral impact of indirect taxation is to anticipate possible pressure points for international tax

competition.

         Section 2 of the paper describes the tax systems used by the United States and other

countries, and reviews the findings of earlier research on the effect of taxation on investment and

other activities of multinational firms. Section 3 presents a model of firm behavior and

characterizes its implications for American firms investing abroad in countries with multiple taxes.

Section 3 also describes the BEA data used to analyze the activities of American multinational

firms. Section 4 presents the results of estimating the determinants of capital/labor ratios and profit

location. Section 5 is the conclusion.



2.       International income taxation in perspective.1

         It is useful to review existing systems of taxing international income in order to interpret

the incentives facing American firms investing in foreign countries using multiple tax instruments.

This summary of international tax rules provides not only a basis for the analysis that follows in

sections 3 and 4, but also serves as a framework with which to interpret the studies reviewed in

section 2.2.



2.1. International tax practice.


1
  Some parts of this brief description of international tax rules and evidence of behavioral responses to international
taxation are excerpted from Hines (1991, 1997, 1999) and Hines and Hubbard (1995).


                                                                                                                          3
         The taxation of international transactions differs from the taxation of domestic economic

activity primarily due to the complications that stem from the taxation of the same income by

multiple governments. In the absence of double tax relief, the implications of multiple taxation are

potentially quite severe, since national tax rates are high enough to eliminate, or at least greatly

discourage, most international business activity if applied two or more times to the same income.



2.1.1 The foreign tax credit.

         Almost all countries tax income generated by economic activity that takes place within

their borders. In addition, many countries – including the United States – tax the foreign incomes

of their residents. In order to prevent double taxation of the foreign income of Americans, U.S.

law permits taxpayers to claim foreign tax credits for income taxes paid to foreign governments.2

These foreign tax credits are used to offset U.S. tax liabilities that would otherwise be due on

foreign-source income. The U.S. corporate tax rate is currently 35 percent, so an American

corporation that earns $100 in a foreign country with a 10 percent tax rate pays taxes of $10 to the

foreign government and $25 to the U.S. government, since its U.S. corporate tax liability of $35

(35 percent of $100) is reduced to $25 by the foreign tax credit of $10.



2.1.2 Tax deferral.

         Americans are permitted to defer any U.S. tax liabilities on certain unrepatriated foreign

profits until they receive such profits in the form of dividends.3 This deferral is available only on


2
  The United States is not alone in taxing the worldwide income of its residents while permitting them to claim foreign
tax credits. Other countries with such systems include Greece, Italy, Japan, Norway, and the United Kingdom. Under
U.S. law, taxpayers may claim foreign tax credits for taxes paid by foreign firms of which they own at least 10 percent,
and only those taxes that qualify as income taxes are creditable.
3
  Deferral of home-country taxation of the unrepatriated profits of foreign subsidiaries is a common feature of systems
that tax foreign incomes. Other countries that permit this kind of deferral include Canada, Denmark, France, Germany,
Japan, Norway, Pakistan, and the United Kingdom.


                                                                                                                       4
the active business profits of American-owned foreign affiliates that are separately incorporated as

subsidiaries in foreign countries. The profits of unincorporated foreign businesses, such as those of

American-owned branch banks in other countries, are taxed immediately by the United States.

         To illustrate deferral, consider the case of a subsidiary of an American company that earns

$500 in a foreign country with a 20 percent tax rate. This subsidiary pays taxes of $100 to the

foreign country (20 percent of $500), and might remit $100 in dividends to its parent U.S.

company, using the remaining $300 ($500 - $100 of taxes - $100 of dividends) to reinvest in its

own foreign operations. The American parent firm must then pay U.S. taxes on the $100 of

dividends it receives (and is eligible to claim a foreign tax credit for the foreign income taxes its

subsidiary paid on the $100).4 But the American firm is not required to pay U.S. taxes on any part

of the $300 that the subsidiary earns abroad and does not remit to its parent company. If, however,

the subsidiary were to pay a dividend of $300 the following year, the firm would then be required

to pay U.S. tax (after proper allowance for foreign tax credits) on that amount.

         U.S. tax law contains provisions designed to prevent American firms from delaying the

repatriation of lightly-taxed foreign earnings. These tax provisions apply to controlled foreign

corporations, which are foreign corporations owned at least 50 percent by American individuals or

corporations who hold stakes of at least 10 percent each. Under the Subpart F provisions of U.S.

law, some foreign income of controlled foreign corporations is “deemed distributed,” and therefore

immediately taxable by the United States, even if not repatriated as dividend payments to

American parent firms.5


4
  In this example, the parent firm is eligible to claim a foreign tax credit of $25, representing the product of foreign
taxes paid by its subsidiary and the subsidiary's ratio of dividends to after-tax profits [$100 x ($100/$400) = $25].
5
  Subpart F income consists of income from passive investments (such as interest and dividends received from
investments in securities), foreign base company income (that arises from using a foreign affiliate as a conduit for
certain types of international transactions), income that is invested in United States property, money used offshore to
insure risks in the United States, and money used to pay bribes to foreign government officials. American firms with
foreign subsidiaries that earn profits through most types of active business operations, and that subsequently reinvest


                                                                                                                           5
2.1.3 Excess foreign tax credits.

         Since the foreign tax credit is intended to alleviate international double taxation, and not to

reduce U.S. tax liabilities on profits earned within the United States, the foreign tax credit is limited

to U.S. tax liability on foreign-source income. For example, an American firm with $200 of

foreign income that faces a U.S. tax rate of 35 percent has a foreign tax credit limit of $70 (35

percent of $200). If the firm pays foreign income taxes of less than $70, then the firm would be

entitled to claim foreign tax credits for all of its foreign taxes paid. If, however, the firm pays $90

of foreign taxes, then it would be permitted to claim no more than $70 of foreign tax credits.

         Taxpayers whose foreign tax payments exceed the foreign tax credit limit are said to have

“excess foreign tax credits;” the excess foreign tax credits represent the portion of their foreign tax

payments that exceed the U.S. tax liabilities generated by their foreign incomes. Taxpayers whose

foreign tax payments are smaller than their foreign tax credit limits are said to have “deficit foreign

tax credits.” American law permits taxpayers to use excess foreign tax credits in one year to

reduce their U.S. tax obligations on foreign source income in either of the two previous years or in

any of the following five years.6

         In practice, the calculation of the foreign tax credit limit entails certain additional

complications, notable among which is that total worldwide foreign income is used to calculate the

foreign tax credit limit. This method of calculating the foreign tax credit limit is known as


those profits in active lines of business, are not subject to the Subpart F rules, and are therefore able to defer U.S. tax
liability on their foreign profits until they choose to remit dividends at a later date.
6
  Foreign tax credits are not adjusted for inflation, so are generally the most valuable if claimed as soon as possible.
Barring unusual circumstances, firms apply their foreign tax credits against future years only when unable to apply
them against either of the previous two years. The most common reason why firms do not apply excess foreign tax
credits against either of the previous two years is that they already have excess foreign tax credits in those years.
           Firms paying the corporate alternative minimum tax (AMT) are subject to the same rules, with the added
restriction that the combination of net operating loss deductions and foreign tax credits cannot reduce AMT liabilities




                                                                                                                              6
“worldwide averaging.” A taxpayer has excess foreign tax credits if the sum of worldwide foreign

income tax payments exceeds this limit.7



2.2. Empirical lessons from international taxation.

         International tax rules and the tax laws of other countries have the potential to influence a

wide range of corporate and individual behavior, including, most directly, the location and scope of

international business activity. A sizable literature is devoted to measuring behavioral responses to

international tax rules.8 This literature focuses on the impact of corporate tax rates on investment

behavior as well as various financial and organizational practices used to avoid taxes.



2.2.1 Investment.

         Tax policies are obviously capable of affecting the volume and location of FDI,9 since, all

other considerations equal, higher tax rates reduce after-tax returns, thereby reducing incentives to

commit investment funds. Of course, all other considerations are seldom equal. Countries differ

not only in their tax policies, but also in their commercial and regulatory policies, the

characteristics of their labor markets, the nature of competition in product markets, the cost and

local availability of intermediate supplies, proximity to final markets, and a host of other attributes


by more than 90%. It is noteworthy that, since the AMT rate is only 20%, firms subject to the AMT are considerably
more likely to have excess foreign tax credits than are firms that pay the regular corporate tax.
7
  Not all countries that grant foreign tax credits use worldwide averaging. For example, while Japan uses worldwide
averaging, the United Kingdom instead requires its firms to calculate foreign tax credits on an activity-by-activity basis.
The United States once required firms to calculate separate foreign tax credit limits for each country to which taxes
were paid; the current system of worldwide averaging was introduced in the mid-1970s.
8
  See Hines (1997, 1999) for further elaboration and critical analysis of many of the studies surveyed in this section.
9
  FDI consists of changes in the ownership claims of controlling foreign investors. For example, an American parent
firm that establishes a wholly-owned foreign affiliate with $100 million of equity and $50 million of loans from the
parent company thereby creates $150 million of FDI. In order for foreign investment to count as FDI, the American
investor must own at least 10 percent of the foreign affiliate. FDI is the sum of parent fund transfers and American
owners’ shares of their foreign affiliates’ reinvested earnings, minus any repatriations to American owners. Prior to
1974, the United States reported FDI only for investments in which American owners held at least 25 percent
ownership shares. Reported FDI typically represents book values.


                                                                                                                         7
that influence the desirability of an investment location. Furthermore, the various tax and

regulatory policies that are relevant to foreign investors may be correlated with non-tax features of

economies that independently affect FDI levels. Consequently, it is necessary to interpret evidence

of the effect of taxation with considerable caution.

        The empirical literature on the effect of taxes on FDI considers almost exclusively U.S.

data, either the distribution of U.S. direct investment abroad, or the FDI patterns of foreigners who

invest in the United States.10 The simple explanation for this focus is not only that the United

States is the world’s largest economy, but also that the United States collects and distributes much

more, and higher-quality, data on FDI activities than does any other country.

        The available evidence of the effect of taxation on FDI comes in two forms. The first is

time-series estimation of the responsiveness of FDI to annual variation in after-tax rates of return.

Implicit in this estimation is a q-style investment model in which contemporaneous average after-

tax rates of return serve as proxies for returns to marginal FDI. Studies of this type consistently

report a positive correlation between levels of FDI and after-tax rates of return at industry and

country levels.11 The implied elasticity of FDI with respect to after-tax returns is generally close to

unity, which translates into a tax elasticity of investment of roughly -0.6. The estimated elasticity

is similar whether the investment in question is American direct investment abroad or FDI by

foreigners in the United States.

        The primary limitation of aggregate time-series studies is that they are identified by yearly

variation in taxes or profitability that may be correlated with important omitted variables. As a

                                                                                                              8
result, it becomes very difficult to distinguish the effects of taxation from the effects of other

variables that are correlated with tax rates.

        Two of the time-series studies exploit cross-sectional differences that offer the potential for

greater explanatory power. Slemrod (1990) distinguishes FDI in the United States by the tax

regime in the country of origin. Investors from countries (of which Slemrod analyzes data for

Japan and the United Kingdom) with tax systems similar to that used by the United States receive

foreign tax credits for taxes paid to the United States. Investors from certain other countries (of

which Slemrod analyzes data for Australia, Canada, France, Germany, and the Netherlands) are

more or less exempt from home-country taxation of any profits earned in the United States.

Consequently, investors from France and Germany have stronger incentives to invest in the United

States during low-tax years than do investors from Japan and the United Kingdom, since Japanese

and British investors are eligible to claim tax credits for any U.S. taxes they pay. In his analysis of

data covering 1962-1987, Slemrod finds no clear empirical pattern indicating that investors from

countries that exempt U.S. profits from home-country taxation are more sensitive to tax changes

than are investors from countries granting foreign tax credits. This evidence suggests either that

home-country tax regimes do not influence FDI, or that time series variation in tax rates is

inadequate to identify tax effects that are nonetheless present.

        Swenson (1994) considers the tax determinants of industry-level FDI in the United States

over the 1979-1991 period. U.S. tax changes often affect industries to differing degrees, based

largely on the assets in which they invest; this was particularly true of tax legislation enacted in

1981 and 1986. Swenson finds that industries in which the (U.S.) after-tax cost of capital rose the

most after passage of the U.S. Tax Reform Act of 1986 were those in which foreign investors

concentrated their FDI in the post-1986 period. This is consistent with the tax incentives of foreign




                                                                                                       9
investors from countries granting foreign tax credits, since such investors are the least affected by

U.S. tax provisions – but it is also possible that foreign investors chose to concentrate in such

industries for any of a number of non-tax reasons. Auerbach and Hassett (1993) lend credence to

the latter interpretation with their finding that investors from countries granting foreign tax credits

were no more likely than were other foreign investors to concentrate their FDI in tax-

disadvantaged industries after 1986.

         Other studies of investment location are exclusively cross-sectional in nature, exploiting the

very large differences in corporate tax rates around the world to identify the effects of taxes on

FDI. Grubert and Mutti (1991) and Hines and Rice (1994) estimate the effect of national tax rates

on the cross-sectional distribution of aggregate American-owned property, plant and equipment

(PPE) in 1982. PPE differs from FDI in that PPE represents (the book value of) real productive

assets held by American-owned affiliates, while FDI equals the book value of ownership claims of

controlling foreign investors.12 Grubert and Mutti analyze the distribution of PPE in

manufacturing affiliates in 33 countries, reporting a –0.1 elasticity with respect to local tax rates.

That is, controlling for other observable determinants of FDI, ten percent differences in local tax

rates are associated with one percent differences in amounts of local PPE ownership in 1982.

Hines and Rice consider the distribution of PPE in all affiliates in 73 countries, reporting a much

larger –1.0 elasticity of PPE ownership with respect to tax rates. Altshuler et al. (2001) compare




12
   The distinction between FDI and PPE ownership of foreign affiliates is perhaps best illustrated by an example.
Consider two American-controlled foreign affiliates, each with $100 million of assets entirely invested in PPE. One
affiliate is 100 percent owned by its American parent, while the other is 60 percent owned by the parent company and
40 percent owned by investors in its host country. Both affiliates account for $100 million of PPE. Establishing the
first affiliate with $100 million of debt and equity from the parent company represents $100 million of outbound FDI
from the United States, while establishing the second with parent funds represents $60 million of FDI. If half of the
affiliate financing represented funds borrowed from local banks, then establishing the affiliates would represent $50
million and $30 million of FDI respectively. To the degree that the affiliates’ assets were not entirely invested in PPE,
then the PPE figures could change without any corresponding change in FDI.


                                                                                                                       10
the tax sensitivity of PPE ownership in 58 countries in 1984 to that in 1992, reporting estimated tax

elasticities that increase from –1.5 in 1984 to –2.8 in 1992.

         One of the difficulties facing all cross-sectional studies of FDI location is the inevitable

omission of many important determinants of FDI that may be correlated with tax rates and

therefore bias the estimation of tax elasticities. Hines (1996) incorporates state fixed effects in

comparing the distributions of FDI within the United States of investors whose home governments

grant foreign tax credits for federal and state income taxes with those whose home governments do

not tax income earned in the United States. The inclusion of fixed effects implicitly controls for

hard-to-measure state attributes, as long as the effect of these attributes does not vary

systematically between investors from countries with differing home-country tax regimes. Tax

effects are identified by comparing, for example, the extent to which investments from Germany

(which exempts from tax foreign-source income earned in the United States) tend to be located in

lower-tax states than are investments from the United Kingdom (which provides foreign tax credits

for state income taxes paid). The evidence indicates that one percent state tax rate differences in

1987 are associated with ten percent differences in amounts of manufacturing PPE owned by

investors from countries with differing home-country taxation of foreign-source income, and three

percent differences in numbers of affiliates owned. Taken as a structural relationship, the estimates

imply a tax elasticity of investment equal to –0.6. It is worth bearing in mind, however, that this

estimate reflects the effect of taxation on the identity of ownership of capital as well as on the

volume of investment.13



2.2.2. International tax avoidance.

         13
            Swenson (2001a) estimates separate regressions for differing types of transactions (such as the
establishment of new plants, plant expansions, mergers and acquisitions, and joint ventures) undertaken by foreign
investors in the United States, finding tax effects to differ between transaction type.


                                                                                                                     11
        One of the important issues in considering the impact of taxation on international

investment patterns is the ability of multinational firms to adjust the reported location of their

taxable profits. To the extent that FDI can facilitate the advantageous relocation of profits, then

firms will have incentives to tailor their international investment strategies with such relocation in

mind. Of course this is not a simple process, nor are its implications necessarily straightforward.

Firms that are able to use international transactions to avoid the bulk of their tax obligations are in

turn unlikely to avoid high-tax investment locations. Hence any complete analysis of the impact of

taxation on the operations of multinational firms must necessarily consider the ability and evident

willingness of multinational firms to undertake activities to avoid international tax obligations.

        The financing of foreign affiliates presents straightforward opportunities for international

tax avoidance. If an American parent company finances its investment in a foreign subsidiary with

equity funds, then its foreign profits are taxable in the host country and no taxes are owed the U.S.

government until the profits are repatriated to the United States. The alternative of financing the

foreign subsidiary with debt from the parent company generates interest deductions for the

subsidiary that reduce its taxable income, and generates taxable interest receipts for the parent

company.

        Simple tax considerations therefore often make it attractive to use debt to finance foreign

affiliates in high-tax countries and to use equity to finance affiliates in low-tax countries.14 The

evidence is broadly consistent with these incentives. Hines and Hubbard (1990) find that the

average foreign tax rate paid by subsidiaries remitting nonzero interest to their American parent

firms in 1984 exceeds the average foreign tax rate paid by subsidiaries with no interest payments,

while the reverse pattern holds for dividend payments. Grubert (1998) estimates separate




                                                                                                       12
equations for dividend, interest, and royalty payments by 3,467 foreign subsidiaries to their parent

American companies (and other members of controlled groups) in 1990, finding that high

corporate tax rates in countries in which American subsidiaries are located are correlated with

higher interest payments and lower dividend payout rates.

         Contractual arrangements between related parties located in countries with different tax

rates offer numerous possibilities for sophisticated (and unsophisticated) tax avoidance. It is

widely suspected that firms adjust transfer prices used in within-firm transactions with the goal of

reducing their total tax obligations. Multinational firms typically can benefit by reducing prices

charged by affiliates in high-tax countries for items and services provided to affiliates in low-tax

countries. OECD governments require firms to use transfer prices that would be paid by unrelated

parties, but enforcement is difficult, particularly when pricing issues concern unique items such as

patent rights. Given the looseness of the resulting legal restrictions, it is entirely possible for firms

to adjust transfer prices in a tax-sensitive fashion without even violating any laws.

         The evidence of tax-motivated transfer pricing comes in several forms. Grubert and Mutti

(1991) and Hines and Rice (1994) analyze the aggregate reported profitabilities of U.S affiliates in

different foreign locations in 1982. Grubert and Mutti examine profit/equity and profit/sales ratios

of U.S.-owned manufacturing affiliates in 29 countries, while Hines and Rice regress the

profitability of all U.S.-owned affiliates in 59 countries against capital and labor inputs and local

productivities. Grubert and Mutti report that high taxes reduce the reported after-tax profitability

of local operations; Hines and Rice find considerably larger effects (one percent tax rate

differences are associated with 2.3 percent differences in before-tax profitability) in their data.

While it is possible that high tax rates are correlated with other locational attributes that depress the


14
  Hines (1994) identifies exceptions to this rule that stem from the benefits of limiting equity finance in affiliates
located in countries with very low tax rates in anticipation of reinvesting all of their after-tax profits over long periods.


                                                                                                                           13
profitability of foreign investment, competitive conditions typically imply that after-tax rates of

return should be equal in the absence of tax-motivated income-shifting. The fact that before-tax

profitability is negatively correlated with local tax rates is strongly suggestive of active tax

avoidance. Similarly, the reported low profit rates of foreign-owned firms in the United States

over the last 20 years is a source of concern to observers who suspect foreign investors of

transferring profits earned in the United States to low-tax jurisdictions offshore.15

         Patterns of reported profitability are consistent with other indicators of aggressive tax-

avoidance behavior, such as the use of royalties to remit profits from abroad and to generate tax

deductions in host countries. Hines (1995) finds that royalty payments from foreign affiliates of

American companies in 1989 exhibit a –0.4 elasticity with respect to the tax cost of paying

royalties, and Grubert (1998) also reports significant effects of tax rates on royalty payments by

American affiliates in 1990. Clausing (2001) finds that reported trade patterns between American

parent companies and their foreign affiliates, and those between foreign affiliates located in

different countries, are consistent with transfer-pricing incentives. Controlling for various affiliate

characteristics, including their trade balances with unaffiliated foreigners, Clausing finds that ten

percent higher local tax rates are associated with 4.4 percent higher parent company trade surpluses

with their local affiliates. This pattern is suggestive of pricing practices that move taxable profits

out of high-tax jurisdictions.16

         This literature has developed strong evidence that multinational firms are highly responsive

to international income tax rate differences, undertaking investments in low-tax locations and using

15
   Grubert et al. (1993) use firm-level tax return data to compare the tax liabilities of foreign-owned firms in the United
States with the tax liabilities of otherwise-similar American-owned firms in 1987. They report that approximately 50
percent of the difference in the reported U.S. tax obligations of foreign and domestic firms is explainable on the basis
of observable characteristics such as firm sizes and ages. The other 50 percent may reflect the use of aggressive
transfer pricing by those foreign investors with stronger incentives than American firms to shift taxable income out of
the United States, though it may also simply capture the effect of important omitted variables.




                                                                                                                         14
various methods at their disposal to avoid tax obligations on their existing investments. One

noteworthy feature of this evidence is its almost exclusive focus on differences in corporate income

tax rates. Whether and to what extent taxes other than corporate profit taxes influence the activities

of multinational firms represent, by comparison, almost entirely open questions.

           The relative importance of these alternative questions can be illuminated by the relative

magnitudes of foreign income taxes and non-income taxes paid by U.S. firms that operate abroad.

Figure 1 provides the ratio of non-income taxes to foreign income taxes paid by American

multinational firms from 1982 to 1994. For overall investment as well as within manufacturing,

non-income taxes are large relative to income taxes and increasing in importance over the last two

decades. The relative importance of non-income taxes in tax competition dynamics is also

highlighted in Slemrod (1995) and documented in Desai (1999). Since non-income taxes are

typically non-creditable, the relative incentive to use non-creditable versus creditable taxes can be

a function of the tax-credit status of multinational firms in large capital-exporting countries such as

the United States.

3.         Behavioral implications of multiple taxes.

           American multinational firms are typically subject to several different types of taxation in

foreign countries; in addition, they must also pay taxes to the U.S. government on any profit

repatriations. In order to identify the behavioral implications of these multiple taxes, it is useful to

consider the incentives facing a firm for which after-tax profits (i) in country i are given by:



(1)                  π i ≡ [(1 − t1i ) pi Qi (K i , Li ) − t 2i K i − wi Li ](1 − τ i ) .




16
     Swenson (2001b) finds a similar pattern in the reported prices of goods imported into the United States, in which


                                                                                                                         15
In expression (1), the term t1i is country i’s tax rate on gross output (such as a sales tax or value

added tax), t2i is country i’s property tax rate on industrial capital, and i is the combined host

country and home country profit tax. The firm produces output in country i with production

function Qi(Ki, Li), in which Ki is the firm’s capital in country i, and Li its labor input. The

production function is assumed to be strictly concave and twice continuously differentiable. As a

gesture toward simplifying the analysis, capital is assumed not to depreciate. The firm sells its

output in country i at an average price of pi, and hires labor at a wage of wi; since (by assumption)

capital does not depreciate, the firm is not entitled to claim depreciation allowances for capital

investment. Firms are assumed to finance their foreign investment with parent equity rather than

local or related party debt.



3.1.     Income shifting.

         As the literature on profit-shifting and transfer-pricing indicates, multinational firms have

access to various methods of reallocating tax obligations between jurisdictions. Some of these

methods entail the use of tax-motivated financial transactions between related parties, while others

may consist of selecting the location of high-value-added foreign production activities. Expression

(1) indicates what a firm’s after-tax income would be if it were not to avail itself of any of these

opportunities. If, instead, the firm were to attempt to reallocate profits between jurisdictions, then

its after-tax profits might become:



(2)                πi ≡ (1 − t1i ) pi Qi ( K i , Li ) + (1 − at1i )ψ i − c (ψ i , pi Qi ) − t2i Ki − wi Li  (1 − τ i ) ,




high unit tariff rates appear to be associated with unusually low prices.


                                                                                                                                16
in which π~i is reported profits, ψ i is the volume of additional income (positive or negative)

allocated to jurisdiction i, and c(ψ i , p i Qi ) is the cost of engaging in such income-reallocation. The

term (1 − at1i ) that multiplies ψ i in (2) reflects that a fraction a of income shifted into jurisdiction i

is subject to gross output taxation. Hence, to the extent that destination-based gross output taxation

operates seamlessly, and profit-shifting takes the form of over- or under-invoicing transactions

between related parties located in different countries, then a might be very small or even zero. To

the extent that countries impose gross output-based taxes, or fail to adhere perfectly to the

destination basis of destination-based taxes (as when, for example, taxpayers receive credits and

refunds only after significant delays), then a will take a value somewhere between zero and unity.

         The cost of income reallocation is captured by the term c(ψ i , p i Qi ) . It is commonly

assumed (e.g., Hines and Rice, 1994; Grubert and Slemrod, 1998) that this function is increasing

(and convex) in the absolute magnitude of ψ i and decreasing in the absolute magnitude of piQi.

This assumption corresponds to the notion that the cost of engaging in a given volume of income

shifting is smaller for firms with vast amounts of income. A convenient specification of the c(⋅)

function is:



                                     f (ψ i )
                                            2

(3)              c(ψ i , pi Qi ) =            .
                                     2 p i Qi



The specification (2) of the firm’s adjusted profit function imposes that the costs captured by the

c(⋅) function are tax-deductible, which is sensible to the degree that they include top management

time and energy, lawyer fees, forgone output, and other expenses that firms deduct from profit

taxes.


                                                                                                          17
         The ability to reallocate taxable income between jurisdictions carries implications not only

for the pattern of reported income but also for factor demands in different jurisdictions. Since the

optimal choices of Ki, Li, and ψ i can be evaluated in any order, consider the optimal selection of

ψ i , taking Ki and Li as given. Since profit-shifting cannot generate aggregate net revenue, it

follows that the firm’s optimization problem is to choose ψ i to maximize (2), subject to (3) and the

constraint that:



                    n
(4)                ∑ψ
                   i =1
                          i   ≤ 0.




The first-order condition for this maximization problem is:



                              fψ i 
(5)                1 − at1i −        (1 − τ i ) = λ ,
                              pi Qi 



in which λ > 0 is the lagrange multiplier corresponding to the constraint (4). Equation (5) then

implies:



                                (1 − at1i )(1 − τ i ) − λ 
(6)                ψ i = pi Qi                             ≡ p i Qiν i ,
                                       f (1 − τ i )       



which in turn carries the implication that firm i’s pretax income, denoted µ i , is given by

[pi Qi + ψ i − c(ψ i , pi Qi ) − wi Li ], or:


                                                                                                      18
                              1 − a 2 t12i     λat1i            λ2        
(7a)             µ i = pi Qi 1 +           +             −              2 
                                                                             − wi Li ≡ pi Qi [1 + θ i ] − wi Li .

Taking labor input to be roughly (for the purpose of this calculation only) a constant share (α ) of

gross output, as it is with a Cobb-Douglas production function, (7a) becomes:



(7b)             µ i = pi Qi [1 + θ i − α ].



        In order to evaluate the impact of tax rates on income allocation, it is convenient to take

logs of both sides of (7b), which yields:



(8)             ln (µ i ) ≅ ln ( p i Qi ) + θ i − α .



The first term on the right side of (8) can be expanded to be a function of productive inputs (capital

and labor compensation) as well as economy-wide productivity indicators such as GDP. The

second term on the right side of (8) reflects the impact of income reallocation, and is a function of

local direct and indirect tax rates, as well as the cost of income reallocation.



3.2.    Factor demands.

        Factor demands can be conveniently analyzed by combining (2), (6), and (7a), so that the

firm’s after-tax profits in jurisdiction i can be rewritten as:




                                                                                                                    19
(9)             π~i ≡ [ pi Qi (K i , Li )[1 + θ i − t1i (1 + aν i )] − t 2i K i − wi Li ](1 − τ i ) .



Firms choose inputs Ki and Li to maximize firm value (V), which reflects the difference between

profits and the carrying cost of capital; this difference is given by:



                      n
                               n     
(10)            V ≡ ∑ π~i − ϕ  ∑ K i  ,
                    i =1       i =1 



in which ϕ > 0 is the opportunity cost of employing a unit of capital abroad. The first-order

conditions characterizing factor inputs that maximize V are:



                ∂Qi (K i , Li )                wi
(11)                            =
                    ∂Li           pi [1 + θ i − t1i (1 + aν i )]



and



                                         ϕ                 
                                                    + t 2i 
(12)
                ∂Qi ( Ki , Li )
                                =        (1 − τ i )        
                    ∂Ki           pi 1 + θ i − t1i (1 + aν i )



It follows from equation (11) and the usual properties of production functions that higher wages or

higher output tax rates raise required marginal revenue products of labor and thereby depress labor

demand. The profit tax rate does not appear explicitly in the first-order condition for labor demand

as written in (11). Depending on the substitutability of capital and labor, profit taxation can



                                                                                                        20
influence Ki and thereby affect the demand for labor by changing the marginal product on the left

side of (11). In addition, profit taxation has the potential to influence pi.

        Demand for FDI is captured by (12), which indicates that higher profit tax rates, higher

output or property tax rates, and lower values of pi all reduce capital demand. The terms

containing pi appearing in the denominators of the right side of (12) are noteworthy in this respect,

since product prices are very plausibly functions of local profit and other tax rates. Consider, for

example, the case in which a multinational firm sells all of its output in local markets, and local

production is depressed by high tax rates. Then pi will be an increasing function of local tax rates,

and the net effect of taxation on labor and capital demand is of uncertain sign.

        The ability of American firms to claim tax credits for foreign income tax payments

influences the implications of (11) and (12). In the case in which an American firm has deficit

foreign tax credits and does not benefit from deferral of home country taxes, its effective foreign

profit tax liability is given by the U.S. tax rate, and   i   is the same for all foreign locations. As a

result, local profit tax rates should not influence factor demands – except insofar as they affect pi,

which case higher profit tax rates will be associated with greater demand for labor and capital. In

the population of all American investors, some firms have excess foreign tax credits and others

have deficit foreign tax credits, so the net implication of higher profit tax rates is in principle

unclear. It is, however, clear that there was an important change after 1986, when the steep

reduction in the U.S. statutory corporate tax rate suddenly greatly increased the number of

American companies with excess foreign tax credits.17 An implication of this change is that local

tax rates should become more important to factor demands after 1986.

        One of the difficulties of interpreting estimated factor demand equations is that of

removing the effect of correlated omitted variables. In particular, countries that are attractive




                                                                                                            21
locations for FDI may also choose to subject such investment to taxation at high rates. One

empirical specification that removes the most obvious form of such endogeneity is a regression of

capital/labor ratios on tax rates. This specification offers the advantage of identifying the impact of

taxation on one aspect of capital demand (capital-labor substitutability) in a way that is not a

simple function of the general attractiveness of an investment location. The implications of the

model for capital-labor ratios are apparent from considering the ratios of both sides of equation

(11) and equation (12):



                     ∂Qi ∂Li     wi (1 − τ i )
(13)                         =                      .
                     ∂Qi ∂Ki ϕ + t2i (1 − τ i )



Equation (13) then serves as the basis of the factor demand estimation described in section 4 and

presented in Tables 4, 5, and 7.



3.3.       Total income.

           Firms should demand fewer productive factors in high-tax jurisdictions (all other

considerations equal), and thereby generate less income than they would if the same jurisdictions

instead had low tax rates. The same firms also have incentives to tailor their financial and

nonfinancial practices to reduce still further the income attributed to their affiliates located in high-

tax jurisdictions. Both of these considerations therefore imply that the reported income of

American affiliates, not controlling for levels of productive inputs, should be a declining function

of local tax rates.

                                                                                                       22
         From the standpoint of host governments, the responsiveness of taxable income to local tax

rates carries with it the implication that there might be direct and indirect tax rates in the (0, 1)

interval at which tax revenue from foreign investors is maximized. While governments might

reasonably not want to impose such taxes – since governments have more than tax revenue in their

objective functions, and, in particular, might strive to encourage economic activity – it is revealing

to consider the levels of revenue-maximizing tax rates.18 In particular, it is interesting to evaluate

whether revenue-maximizing tax rates have fallen over time in response to (possibly) greater tax

competition, and whether small economies have the lowest revenue-maximizing rates.

         Let B denote the tax base to which an indirect tax (denoted t) is applied, and let B(1-t) be

the tax base to which the direct tax (at rate τ ) is applied. Total tax revenue ( ρ ) is then:



(14)              ρ = Bt + B(1 − t )τ



Taking derivatives of (14) with respect to t and τ yields:



                  ∂ρ               ∂B
(15a)                = B(1 − τ ) +    [t + τ (1 − t )]
                  ∂t               ∂t

                  ∂ρ               ∂B
(15b)                = B(1 − t ) +    [t + τ (1 − t )]
                  ∂τ               ∂τ



Setting these derivatives equal to zero to solve for the revenue maximizing tax rates (denoted t*

and τ * ) yields the conditions:


18
   The numerous other considerations in selecting tax revenue-maximizing rates include the frequent requirement that
all foreign and domestic investors receive equal tax treatment, and the possibility that domestic residents bear the
ultimate incidence of taxes imposed on foreign investors.


                                                                                                                   23

Expressions (16a) and (16b), together with empirical estimation of semi-elasticities of the tax base

with respect to tax rates, provide simple benchmarks against which actual tax rates can be

evaluated.




3.4.       Data.19


           The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) provides data on the financial and operating

characteristics of U.S. firms operating abroad through periodic benchmark and annual surveys of

the activities of U.S. firms operating abroad. These surveys ask reporters to file detailed financial

and operating items for each affiliate and information on the value of transactions between U.S.

parents and their foreign affiliates. The International Investment and Trade in Services Survey Act

governs the collection of the data and the Act ensures that "use of an individual company's data for

tax, investigative, or regulatory purposes is prohibited." Willful noncompliance with the Act can

result in penalties of to $10,000 or a prison term of one year. As a result of these assurances and

penalties, BEA believes that coverage is close to complete and levels of accuracy are high.




19
     This data description draws on Desai and Hines (1999) and Desai, Foley and Hines (2001).


                                                                                                      24
        The three most recent benchmark surveys conducted in 1982, 1989, and 1994 (BEA (1985,

1992, 1997)) report data on country and industry bases including details on income statements,

balance sheets, employment patterns and parent affiliate transactions. BEA reports aggregate

figures of countries in which there is substantial U.S. investment; to protect the confidentiality of

survey respondents, BEA suppresses information for countries in which one or two firms represent

large fractions of total U.S. investment. U.S. direct investment abroad is defined as the direct or

indirect ownership or control by a single U.S. legal entity of at least ten percent of the voting

securities of an incorporated foreign business enterprise or the equivalent interest in an

unincorporated foreign business enterprise.

        The BEA reports aggregate tax payments by country for both foreign income taxes as well

as indirect business taxes. Since U.S. firms pay corporate taxes to foreign host countries but on

occasion receive special treatment in the form of tax holidays and other local tax concessions, it is

necessary to calculate income tax rates specifically available to American investors. Following

Hines and Rice (1994) and Desai and Hines (1999), the income tax rates used equal the smaller of

the statutory corporate tax rate and the average tax rate paid by American firms in a given year.

The average tax rate is calculated as the ratio of foreign income taxes paid by local affiliates of

American firms to their local pre-tax income. American firms are also specifically asked to report

taxes other than income and payroll taxes. In the surveys distributed by the BEA, these other taxes

are defines as sales, value-added, consumption, excise, property, import and export duties, license

fees, fines and all taxes other than income and payroll taxes.

        In the following analysis, the corporate income tax rate described above is referred to as the

direct tax rate and the ratio of indirect business taxes to the sum of local pre-tax income and

indirect business taxes is referred to as the indirect tax rate. In order to consider seperately the



                                                                                                        25
potential effects of output taxes, value-added taxes obtained from the University of Michigan

World Tax Database are also employed. Table 1 provides descriptive statistics for the relevant

variables for 1982, 1989 and 1994.



4.     Results and interpretation.

       This section presents estimated regression coefficients for equations explaining the

aggregate profitability of American affiliates conditional on factor inputs, aggregate factor

demands, and total taxable incomes. Since the results indicate the importance of taxes other than

corporate income taxes, it is useful to start by considering the extent to which taxes of different

kinds are correlated.



4.1.   Tax rates.

       Tax rates facing American multinational firms exhibit strong positive cross-sectional

correlations, meaning that countries with high corporate tax rates are also likely to have high value-

added tax rates, high individual tax rates, and high rates of other taxes. This correlation may

reflect differing national revenue needs, or perhaps the working of tax competition in which some

countries are more subject to competitive pressures (on all their tax rates) than are others. The high

degree of correlation also means that it can be difficult to identify the behavioral impact of one tax

against another.

       Table 2 presents tax rate correlations for 1994, the last year for which it is possible to

obtain detailed information from a benchmark survey. The “direct tax rate” in 1994 is defined as

the ratio of income taxes paid by all American affiliates to the sum of aggregate 1994 after-tax

income of these affiliates plus income taxes paid. Consequently, the “direct tax rate” can be




                                                                                                      26
interpreted as an average corporate tax rate faced by American firms. Since this is potentially a

noisy variable, its value is restricted to lie in the (0, 1) interval, and to equal the statutory corporate

tax rate whenever the statutory rate is below the measured average corporate tax rate. The

“indirect tax rate” in 1994 is the ratio of non-income and non-payroll taxes paid by all American

affiliates to the sum of aggregate 1994 pre-tax income of these affiliates plus income taxes paid

and non-income taxes and non-payroll taxes. The “statutory corporate tax rate” is the top marginal

corporate tax rate, and the “statutory individual tax rate” is the top marginal individual income tax

rate. The “withholding tax rate” is the ratio of withholding taxes on distributed earnings paid by all

American affiliates in 1994 to total distributed earnings of those affiliates. The “value-added tax

rate” is the statutory value-added tax rate on typical consumed goods.

        Table 2 indicates that every one of these tax rates exhibits a positive correlation with all of

the others. Notably, direct tax rates have a greater than 0.5 correlation with indirect tax rates and

with statutory corporate tax rates, while indirect tax rates also have a greater than 0.5 correlation

with value-added tax rates. The statutory individual tax rate has a greater than 0.5 correlation with

both the statutory corporate tax rate and the value-added tax rate. The high degree of correlation

between the statutory rates is not only suggestive of competitive tax-setting pressures, but also

offers reassurance that the high correlation of measured direct and indirect tax rates reflect

something other than statistical artifacts.

        An important feature of indirect tax rates is their magnitude compared to more commonly-

studied direct tax rates. Table 1 reports that indirect tax rates exceed direct tax rates for all three

years of the sample, which in turn implies a significant revenue difference between these two tax

types, since the indirect tax base typically exceeds the direct tax base. Indeed, Figure 1 plots the

ratio of total indirect tax payments by U.S. majority-owned foreign affiliates to direct tax payments




                                                                                                          27
by the same affiliates for every year between 1982 and 1994. This ratio exceeds 1.5 for every year

of the sample, and in the 1990s (after a wave of direct tax reductions around the world) began to

exceed three.



4.2.   Profit location.

       Tables 3a, 3b, and 3c offer estimates of variants of the profit location equation (8), in which

the log of pretax income is regressed against its determinants: labor inputs, capital inputs, local

GDP, and direct and indirect tax rates. The data used to estimate these equations consist of

country-year observations of the activity of all U.S. majority-owned affiliates. These equations are

consistent with simple Cobb-Douglas specifications of aggregate production functions, in which

local GDP is included as a productivity scaling factor. Table 3a reports results for 1982, Table 3b

reports results for 1989, and Table 3c reports results for 1994. The first three columns of each

table report regressions in which the dependent variable is the log of the sum of after-tax income

and profit taxes; columns 4-7 of the same tables report regressions in which the dependent variable

is the sum of after-tax income, profit taxes, and non-income and non-payroll taxes.

       Higher tax rates are associated with lower pretax income in almost every specification.

The results reported in first three columns of Tables 3a – 3c are consistent with the specifications

and results reported by Hines and Rice (1994), who estimate similar equations for 1982, and who

find that higher direct tax rates are associated with reduced pre-tax income. Since direct and

indirect tax rates are positively correlated, and higher indirect tax rates reduce pre-tax income as

defined in columns 1-3 of Tables 3a – 3c, it follows that high direct tax rates might be correlated

with low pretax income simply through the effect of indirect tax rates. It is in part to guard against

this possibility that the regressions reported in columns 2 and 3 are re-run with a dependent




                                                                                                       28
variable that adds back indirect tax payments; these regressions are reported in columns 4 and 5 of

Tables 3a – 3c. While the estimated direct tax rate coefficients in the regressions reported in

columns 4 and 5 indeed turn out to be smaller than the corresponding tax coefficients reported in

columns 2 and 3, they remain large and significant.

        The impact of including indirect tax rates in the pretax profit location estimation is apparent

from considering the 1989 results reported in Table 3b. The specification reported in column 8 of

Table 3b indicates that, controlling for levels of productive inputs, higher indirect tax rates have

negative and significant effects on reported pretax income: an indirect tax rate difference of 10

percent is associated with a 9.2 percent difference in reported income. While direct tax rates are

estimated to have larger effects in this and other regressions, these estimates are often imprecise

when the (highly correlated) indirect tax rates are included in the same equations. The estimated

effect of a direct tax rate difference of 10 percent in the regression reported in column 7 is an 18.2

percent difference in reported income, but this estimate has a large standard error.

        The available information is sufficient to use changes between 1982 and 1989, and again

between 1989 and 1994, to estimate the profit reporting regressions in first differences. Doing so

offers the benefit of controlling for time-invariant location-specific factors that affect reported

profitability. Columns 1-3 of both panels of Table 7 report estimated coefficients from such first

difference specifications. The results from the 1982-1989 first difference are quite similar to those

from the 1989 cross-section reported in Table 3a. The regression reported in column 3 of the left

panel of Table 7 indicates that a ten percent indirect tax rate change between 1982 and 1989 was

associated with a 7.4 percent change in reported profitability, controlling for productive inputs.

The same regression indicates that a 10 percent direct tax rate change was associated with a 12.3

percent change in reported profitability, though a large standard error is associated with this




                                                                                                       29
estimate. Columns 1-3 of the right panel of Table 7 indicate that indirect tax changes between

1989 and 1994 had smaller effects on reported profitability than they did over the 1982-1989 time

period, while direct tax changes had much larger effects. Ten percent indirect tax changes between

1989 and 1994 are associated with 3.7 percent changes in reported profitability, while ten percent

direct tax changes are associated with 29.3 percent profitability differences.



4.3.     Factor demands.

         Taxation of different kinds has the potential to discourage FDI and to distort the mix of

factors that firms demand. Equation (13) illustrates that capital/labor ratios are positively affected

by wage rates, and negatively affected by income taxes and property taxes. One of the difficulties

with implementing (13) empirically is that labor does not come in identifiable homogenous units;

as a result, employee compensation rather than employment is used in the denominator of the

capital/labor ratio in an effort to adjust for human capital. The results of estimating variants of (13)

are presented in Table 4.

         The estimates reported in Table 4 indicate that capital/labor ratios are decreasing functions

of wage rates, which is sensible when it is recalled that labor is measured as total employee

compensation.20 The estimated effects of direct tax rates on capital/labor ratios in 1982 are small

and not statistically significant, while the effects of indirect tax rates are considerably larger and

are significant in the quadratic specification reported in column 4. A similar pattern appears in

1989, with the difference that estimated coefficients on direct tax rates are not uniformly negative.

In the regression reported in column 3 of the 1989 results in Table 4, a ten percent higher indirect

tax rate is associated with an 8.6 percent lower capital/labor ratio, presumably reflecting the


20
  Data on wage rates are available only for production workers in manufacturing, which are no doubt correlated, albeit
imperfectly, with wage rates paid by all majority-owned American affiliates.


                                                                                                                    30
property tax and related components of indirect taxation. The same regression reports a positive

and insignificant effect of higher direct tax rates on capital/labor ratios.

        These results suggest that factor demands are influenced by indirect tax rates, and indeed,

offer stronger evidence that indirect tax rates affect factor demands than they do evidence that

direct tax rates affect factor demands. While there is ample other evidence in the literature of the

impact of direct taxation on the demand for FDI, the ability of indirect taxation to influence factor

demands should not be minimized, particularly since American investors are ineligible to claim

foreign tax credits for indirect taxes paid. As a check on the reliability of the factor demand

results, and the interpretation of indirect tax rates as reflecting at least in part the impact of property

and property-like taxes, the equations reported in Table 4 were re-run using statutory value-added

tax rates in place of indirect tax rates.

        The results are reported in Table 5. Since, as indicated in equation 13, value-added taxes

should not influence capital/labor ratios, it follows that the results of these new specifications

should look markedly different from those reported in Table 4. And the results reported in Table 5

in fact do differ greatly from the results of estimating the same equations using indirect tax rates in

place of value-added taxes. Estimated coefficients on value-added tax rates are positive (though

insignificant) in the linear specification (column 2) in each of the three cross-sections, while direct

tax rates are estimated to have insignificant negative effects in 1982 and 1989. Due to data

limitations there are fewer observations in the regressions reported in Table 5 than there are in

those reported in Table 4; nevertheless, the specifications are so otherwise similar that their

differences offer evidence in favor of the previous interpretation of the results reported in Table 4.



4.4.    Total income.




                                                                                                        31
        Total income earned by American affiliates is a function of factor demands and profit

allocation behavior. Table 6 offers estimates of the determinants of total pre-tax income in which

only log(GDP) and tax rates are used as regressors (in various combinations), since the goal is to

endogenize factor demands and thereby reveal the choices made by governments in selecting their

tax rates.

        The results reported in Table 6 indicate that high direct tax rates discourage income

production in all three cross-sections, and that, in 1982 and 1989, high indirect tax rates likewise

discourage income production. The coefficients reported in column 3 of the 1982 panel of Table 6

indicate that ten percent higher indirect tax rates are associated with 8.4 percent lower income

production, while ten percent higher direct tax rates are associated with 13.3 percent lower income

production (thought the latter effect is estimated with considerable imprecision). The estimated

effect of indirect taxation is similar in 1989, though the estimated impact of direct taxation is much

larger: ten percent differences in direct taxation are associated with 55.8 percent income

differences. Neither direct nor indirect tax rates significantly affect reported profits in 1994.

Equations 16a and 16b, the coefficients in columns 1 and 2 of the 1989 panel, and the mean tax

rates for 1989 can be combined to find the revenue-maximizing direct and indirect tax rates for

1989. These rates, -35 percent for direct tax rates and 33 percent for indirect tax rates, suggest that

income tax subsidies in combination with hefty indirect taxes would raise maximal revenues from

U.S. firms. Such a combination of income tax subsidies and indirect taxes reflects the prevalence

of excess credit firms amongst U.S. firms in 1989.

        These results can be mapped to a dynamic of direct and indirect tax competition from 1982

through 1994. The coefficients imply that the revenue-maximizing direct tax rate fell considerably

between 1982 and 1989 while the revenue-maximizing indirect tax rate also fell, but by




                                                                                                       32
considerably less. The larger relative decline in the revenue-maximizing direct tax rate is

consistent with the importance of the distinction between creditable and non-creditable taxes in

influencing how U.S. multinationals firms respond to taxation. The rapid increase in the share of

U.S. firms with excess foreign tax credits would increase their sensitivity to creditable (income)

taxes relative to noncreditable (non-income) taxes. These changed sensitivities, and the

corresponding revenue-maximizing rates, change the incentives for tax competition over different

tax instruments.

           Column 4 in each of the panels of Table 6 report the results of specifications that include

interactions between tax rates and log(GDP), in order to check whether the responsiveness of

income to tax rates (and therefore also the revenue-maximizing tax rates) varies with economy

size. The results confirm that economic size dampens the responsiveness of pretax income to tax

rates. The reduced responsiveness to tax rates in larger countries likely reflects the immobility of

specific factors (such as local markets or local resources) in large countries or the efficiency with

which tax revenue is deployed in those countries. The estimates in column 4 for 1989 can be

combined with equations 16a and 16b to derive the revenue-maximizing tax rates for particular

countries. For the country with the median GDP in the sample for 1989, Egypt, the coefficients in

column 4 for 1989 along with Egypt’s tax parameters imply a revenue-maximizing direct tax rate

of 24 percent and a revenue-maximizing indirect tax rate of 152 percent.21

           Table 7 reports the results of first-difference estimates of the determinants of the location of

reported in Table 6. In the 1989-1994 regression reported in column 6, a ten percent change in the

indirect tax rate is associated with a 7.5 percent change in reported income, while a ten percent

change in the direct tax rate is associated with a 25.4 percent change in reported income.



5.     Conclusion.

       This paper offers evidence that taxes other than income taxes significantly influence the

pattern of income production by multinational firms by altering their investment and transfer

pricing incentives. The high degree of correlation between income and non-income tax rates

suggests that the body of empirical work exclusively emphasizing income taxes may have

inadvertently obscured the role of non-income taxes. Since American taxpayers can claim tax

credits for income taxes paid to foreign governments, but are unable to claim similar tax credits for

indirect taxes paid to foreign governments, it follows that foreign indirect taxes have much greater

potential to influence their behavior.

       Governments that are concerned about the potential for competing jurisdictions to lure

economic activity and about indirect tax receipts may already be competing on non-income taxes

and are likely to be increasingly aware of relative indirect tax burdens in their own and other

jurisdictions. While a race to the bottom dynamic on indirect taxation has not been demonstrated,

there is, however, considerable evidence to suggest that multinational firms respond to indirect tax

rate differences. Since indirect tax burdens greatly exceed direct tax burdens, there is ample scope

for downward competitive dynamics as governments respond to greater international mobility of

productive factors.
