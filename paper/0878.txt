                       What! Another Minimum Wage Study?



                                    ABSTRACT



     The Minimum Wage Study Commission was established in 1977 to aid

Congress in investigating the effects and possible consequences of two

proposed changes in the minimum wage law: indexing the wage to inflation

and providing for a youth differential. This paper seeks to determine

to what extent the Minimum Wage Study Commission's work has been helpful

in policy debate, and compares the Commission's findings with those of

the more conservative American Enterprise Institute. The paper also examines

whether the Commission's final product was worth three years of study

and $17 million.

     Our overall finding is that the Commission's report appears to

have had little or no policy impact. The research did little to expand

upon similar studies done prior to 1977, and cannot be said to be worth

three years and $17 million. However, policy—makers still regard the

report as a useful and credible examination of the effects of the mini—

mum wage on the economy.

                    What 1   Another   Minimum Wage Study?

         11The minirrini wage   has been around for decades. It is always nice
         to   have study corrtnissions, but we have commissions running out
         of our ears in this government. We have had studies by private
         organizations, by labor, by Government, by the Chamber of Comnerce.
         I cannot see anything that this Ccrrunission is going to be able
         to do that private groups or labor unions cannot    ." Former

         During Congressional consideration of amendments to the Fair Labor
Standards Act in 1977, there was considerable uncertainty and political
division over two potentially important proposed changes in the minimum
wage law: indexing the wage to inflation, and providing for a youth dif-
ferential. After some debate the House voted to establish a Minimum Wage
Study Cortrnission (MWSC), which it charged with investigating a dozen topics,
including the effects of increasing the minimum on inflation, employment
and unemployment; the ability of the minimm wage to ameliorate poverty;
and the economic consequences of proposals for automatic indexing of the mini-
mum wage and for setting a special sulininimum rate for young workers.
         Over a three year period, an eight member Commission headed Initially

by Gerald Feder and through most of its life by former Rep. James O'Hara (D Mich.)

funded a large body of economic research on minimum wage issues, at a cost of

$17 million,. Altogether, the Commission's contracts involved over 90 researchers,

consultants and discussants (including one of us). There were also

several studies carried out by the Commission's own staff economists and two

surveys of emploeyrs conducted by government agencies.

         On May 24, 1981, the Commission issued a 250 page report suninarizing

its findings and setting forth conclusions and policy recairnendations.

Six   additional   volumes containing research papers    were   published later in

the year.

           Because the Corrinission was established by a Democratic Congress,
with Corrmissioners selected by Demjcratic cabinet officers, Republicans
consistently voiced doubts alx)ut the potential impartiality of the proposed
study.     Notcoincidentally, the American Enterprise Institute (AEI), a
conservative think tank, shortly thereafter initiated its own major study
of the rniniimirn wage.
           To what      extent has the   Minimum Wage Study Cortmission' s ork been

helpful    in policy debate?        Did the research funded by the liberal Cc—
mission    yield results different fraTi         that funded by the     conservative   AEI?
Overall,    was   the   Commission' s pnxluct rth three years of study and $17

million? What        can   be learned fran the Commission experience         about   the value

of study corrinissions to those outside the research camunity?

          To answer      these   questions we have reviewed the seven        volume Report
of the Miniimxn Wage Study Coninission, and          a   series of other AEI    studies   on

the minimum;      and   have interviewed    members and staff    of the House and Senate

Labor   Coninittees     which have jurisdiction over the Fair Labor          Standards Act,
and thus tend to be the nst important Congressional consumers                  of   research

on the minimum wage.


The Commission research

          Table 1 presents in capsule form our           surrinary of   the research by

the MWSC and the AEI        organized    according to the following topics: daio—

of   the youth sutniinimum;      income distribution; macroeconanic effects on real

wages and inflation; nonwage job effects.

          Because the Comnission did not undertake           studies    of foreign ex-

periences, the political issues involved in support of the minimum wage,

or the pathological effects of teenage unemployment             on   crime, we have

cznitted    the AEI studies on those subjects fran the table.
        Our reading of the results of the research is that there is no
discernible liberal MWSC or conservative AEl bias to the studies: the
professional economists selected by the two groups produced results generally
consistent with each other and with previous firdings on the minimum. If
one did not know which study had been funded by which group, one could not
guess fran the results. In several cases the MWSC work yielded results
nore unfavorable to the minimum wage than the AEI work, in other cases,
the reverse is true. Persons predisposed against the minimum can read the
MWSC research studies and the staff stuimary of the research without worrying
about   distortions due to      political bias by the MWSC; conversely,   persons predisposed

for the minimum can      read   the AEI-sponsored research without worrying about

distortions      due to political bias   by the AEI.

            On   the issue of the diserrplonent effects of the minimum, the
vast bulk of the research studies funded by the two groups show mDdest/
rioderate impacts consistent with the professional consensus. With respect
to the youth subiiinimuin, which tends to be favored by conservatives, the
AEI study    notedimportant administrative probls while the MWSC studies
can   hardly be termed as negative. On the issue of inflation the conclusion         of

both sets of studies was that the minimum does not have sizeable impacts on

inflation. Turning to income distribution effects of the minimum, a similar

conclusion seems warranted, with both MWSC aid AEI showing only slight increases

or decreases in inequality as a result of the minimum.

            Overall, we find that the MWSC and    AEI studies   fall well within

the general findings of the literature that the minimum wage has          only nodest
effects on the economy       as   a whole. On net, neither the MWSC nor the AEl

studies     yielded results that will    raise the eyebrows of the research can—

The Coimiission reconuriendatjons
        Volume I of the Coirmission report gives the recaimendations of the
corrrnission. While the central chapters of the final report deal with the
effects on employment, inflation, and poverty, nearly a third of the dis—
cussion--and nst of the specific policy reoiimiendations—-concern relatively
narrow issues of exemptions for particular industries and enforcement
matters. Only two of the Corrumission' s recoirinendations address major policy
questions. By a vote of 6 to 1 with one present, the Corrinission rejected
the youth differential; by a vote of 5 to 2 with one not voting it advocated
automatic indexing of the minimum wage to adjust for inflation. By a vote
of 5 to 1, with one voting present, and one not voting, the Commission
voted down a proposal to permit local experimentation with a lower minimum
for youth. With respect to other policy issues, the Commission called for
restrictions in the current differential wage for full-time students;
increases in the salary test for exempting certain professionals from over-
time requirents; and the repeal of a large number of narrowly-drawn ex-
emptions to the Fair Labor Standards Act.
        Both the positions and the general tone of the report express favorable
attitudes toward the minimum wage, prompting an angry dissent from one
member of the Commission. Commissioner S. Warne Robinson attacked the final
report as blatantly biased toward labor unions and "an undistinguished piece
of work" that did not adequately use the research findings. Indeed, the
latter criticism seems valid; the conclusions do indeed seem unconnected
to the research results. Rarely, if at all are specific research studies
referenced in the Commission recorrrnendations: for instance, the recorrmnendation
for restricting the current student suhminimum has ro link to the NWSC
funded research on the operation of the subtninimumn.
        In short, the Carinission caine in with a final report to which one

present, and another often did not vote, and which did not appear to rely
heavily on funded research.

Policy—makers' response to the report
          The MWSC was instituted by a Dancratic Congress under a Dro—
cratic administration; in the three intervening years, the political climate
changed, putting Republicans in control of the White House and. Senate. These
changes are important in understanding the reaction to the Coiriruissioner's
report.
          When the MWSC final report and reccxnriendations were released on
May 24, 1981, they did not attract nuch attention. Press coverage was
minimal, consisting of routine treatment by the wire services and a few
articles in specialized publications like the Daily Labor Report (Bureau
of National Affairs). There were no briefings on the findings for press
or Capitol Hill, presumably because of the obvious absence of political
interest in minimuii wages at the time by a Congress prccupied with the
tax and budget proposals of the Reagan Administration.
          Anticipating that rrost congressional offices ould simply file the
report away until legislative action appeared irore imminent, we interviewed
tkose with the strongest reason to follow the work of the Caiimission:
rners and staff of the Senate and House Labor Corrinittees. The Corrinittee
members and staff we interviewed generally knew the report existed but were
far from equally knowledgeable about its contents. Some committee staff
had read or skimmed the material; others planned to look it over during a
slow week. Corrinittee members typically had neither read nor glanced at nor
seen a staff sirmary of the Cormuission's wrk. Rep. Millicent Fenwick
(R, N.J.) said that she hadn't heard of the Carinission or its prodit
"until this minute". In only a few of the interviews did the members indicate
much awareness of specific findings or recorrinendations.
          Given the absence of the rninixrnim wage from this year 's legislative
                                  —9—



agenda, the "back burner" treatrrent of the report by Congress does rot
preclude   greater attention to the work in the future. When sane action on
the minimum wage is anticipated, the Lalx)r Carmittees will start the
hearings process. Dccratic aides, at least, say the Corrrnission's studies
will be useful as backgrourx:1 and that individual researchers may be sought
out as withesses.
        Anong those familiar with the Corrrnission Report, evaluations split
along partisan lines. Republicans found it biased--an inevitability given
the make-up of the Commission. "It just gave a recitation of organized
labor' s demands on the minimum wage," said Sen. Orrin Hatch (R, Utah),
Chairman of the Senate Labor Caumittee. Republicans also agreed with
Pobinson' s indictment that the Camiission' s conclusions igrored the research
findings. While   the report and its recorrinendations could be easily dis-

missed, some suggested the underlying studies might still be worth looking

at. Deriocrats conceded the Conmission's slant toward   labor   but strongly

defended   the professional quality of the investigation. "The research
isn' t tainted.., or even partisan," said an aide to the House Education
and Labor Ccttmittee. "Most of the academics doing the studies were rela-
tively conservative".
        During the intex'iiis, staff and members tended to interpret various
Corrrnission findings according to their predispositions on the issues. Tlose
opposed to a sulininimum wage for youth, for example, considered the reported
effects on enployment small and emphasized the possibility that young workers
would be substituted for low-paid adults--a result the Commission said could
not be ruled out. Supporters of a suhnininiurn viewed the emplonent effects
as appreciable and took note of the lack o evidence on the issue of sub—
sitution. "I favor a youth suhninimurn, but if a valid study shows sig-
nificant firing of adults I could change my mind," said Rep. John Erlenborn
(R, Ill.). Rep. Paul Sirron (D, Ill.), noting that an earlier study had
caused him to change positions and support a sulininimurn, said he'd be
                                    —10—


open-minded about anything new from the ConTnission. "But we do tend to
go through these things to look for information that agrees with our po-
sitions and buttresses our     prejudices,"   he said.
         The   existence of the Minirruirn Wage Study Cairiission may have in-

fluenced the policies of the Reagan Administration on the question of the

youth differential, at least indirectly. Surprising many Republican sup-
porters of the suhninimum, the Administration did not take a position on
the issue in the spring of 1981: Secretary of Labor Paynond J. Donovan
said that the department was waiting to see the Sti1y Cournission's report
before making reccimnendations on the suthdnimum.
       It is possible, however, that the reference to the report was just
a convenient excuse. Business interest in the idea of a suthilnimurn had
begun   to wane. A fight over establishing a suthiinimum for young workers
or any other group would open the Fair Labor Standards Act to all kinds of
amendments, inclining another series of increases in the minimum wage.
In addition, some pivotal groups, like the fast-food industry, had apparently
expressed   doubts about the feasibility of a suhninimum, since it would
violate the principle of equal pay for equal work.
         On the other hand, the idea had some natural appeal to a Repub-
lican Administration. It provided an "incentive" to employers witbout
costing the government any ironey. Perhaps if the Corrrnission's research had
found that   lowering   the minimum produced large numbers of new jobs for
youth, the Administration might have decided to corrinit    itself.


Evaluation
         Overall, the Cormiission's report appears to have had little or no
policy impact. while in a different political climate, the recomnerxlation
for indexing the minimum wage might have been given serious Congressional
attention, the reception of the report suggests it would have been taken
as a partisan document under any circumstances.
                                       —11—


          Peturning to    our   original question, was the Corrimission's product
vrth three years of study and $17 million?
          Our answer is no.
        To begin with, the research did not generate anything strikingly
new in the minimum wage literature. On rrost questions, the findings corro-
borate those of similar studies done prior to 1977. If, instead of em-
barking on a broad research plan that duplicated a lot of existing s'xrk,
the Cc*rtission had surveyed the literature and identified the gaps and then
initiated a limited number of studies it might have perfonned a nore             useful

function. For a fraction of the cost, it could then have funded a few
projts that would clearly have added to the knowledge base. In par-
ticular, on the issue of the youth sulxniniiium, much might have been learned
from   a three year    experiment   of the measure in several cities.

Lessons on the value of study coninissions
          "I'm against these studies. No one ever looks at them—not even
          the reconTnendations." Rep. Fenwick (R, N.J.).
          Does our    conclusion   about the Minimum Wage Study Conmission Report
imply that such corrmissions invariably have little impact on policy-makers?
          Our answer and that of     irost of the Members and staff   we   inter-
viewed is   no.

         As   a counterexample, several of those we interviewed       referred   to
the National Corrmission on State Workmen's Canpensation Laws (set up in
1971) as a comnission whose report had a significant impact. Chaired by
Johr Burton,      the Carimission was given high marks for   professionalin;
for   developing nodel legislation that was useful to state       wo' compen-
sation programs, and for achieving agrerent on key policy reconinendations.

"When you have unanimity, it's a sign that a study has led them (the Corn—

missioners)    someplace," a Senate aide explained. Another, producing         his

dog-eared   copy, said he still referred      to   the nearly ten-year-old report
when a workers' compensation issue arose.
                                  —12--

        Mcre generally, members and staff expressed preferences for narrowly-
focused reports with clear policy orientations. "1 like to see specific
recortinendations--not just a lot of infornation," said Rep. SilTon. Reports
that analyze the effectiveness of programs are especially useful. While
positive evaluations are obviously good airinuruition in a debate, aides ex-
plained, even negative findings can help members legislate changes in programs
that avoid the pitfalls. Aides also indicated interest in empirical work,
as long as it wasn't too technical. "We see a lot of studies by the General
Accounting Office or by various interest groups that just aren't very
solid," said one. "They're based on a few cases, and have no statistical
validity."
        To   have a policy impact, in our judgment, a study oortrnission must
have:
        involvement by recognized experts and balancing of idlogical
        interests, to minimize doubts about the credibility of the in—
        vestigation;
        strong policy orientation in final reports with results based
        on the research studies funded by the cormiission;
        consensus, if not unanimity, in conclusions.
        As our comparison of MWSC and PEI funded research on the mini-
mum wage indicates, initial conservative concerns about 'bias' in the
research funded by MWSC proved wrong. While not exciting, the MWSC research
generally produced credible estimates of the effects of the minirmxrn wage
on the econany. Lack of connection between the research findings and the
Commission recommendations, lack of unanimity in the Commission recormndations,
and the changed political climate, however, make this a case in which the
research results have had little impact on policy and, in our view, are
unlikely to have much impact on policy in the future.
