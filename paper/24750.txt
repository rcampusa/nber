                                         ABSTRACT

This paper examines the effect of Walmart Supercenters, which lower food prices and expand
food availability, on household and child food insecurity. Our food insecurity-related outcomes
come from the 2001-2012 waves of the December Current Population Study Food Security
Supplement. Using narrow geographic identifiers available in the restricted version of these data,
we compute the distance between each household’s census tract of residence and the nearest
Walmart Supercenter. We estimate instrumental variables models that leverage the predictable
geographic expansion patterns of Walmart Supercenters outward from Walmart’s corporate
headquarters. Results suggest that closer proximity to a Walmart Supercenter improves the food
security of households and children, as measured by number of affirmative responses to a food
insecurity questionnaire and an indicator for food insecurity. The effects are largest among low-
income households and children, but are also sizeable for middle-income children.

    I.      Introduction

         The United States Department of Agriculture’s (USDA’s) Food and Nutrition Service has

long sought to end hunger. To this end, they have worked to establish programs aimed at

providing ready access to cheap and nutritious foods. Meanwhile, some states and municipalities

(like Los Angeles, Chicago, and New York City) have passed laws, taxes, and mandates seeking

to block or restrict entry by Walmart, America’s largest corporation and largest grocer. 1

Research has shown that Walmart Supercenters lower food prices and increase food availability, 2

so we ask, so we ask: are barriers to Walmart’s entry at odds with the goal of eliminating

hunger? We add to existing research on food security by exploring the relationship between the

diffusion of new retail technologies—specifically, the Walmart Supercenter mass merchandiser

format—and various measures of food insecurity.

         The United States Department of Agriculture defines food security as “access by all

household members at all times to enough food for an active, healthy life.” 3 14.5% of U.S.

households lacked food security during at least some of the year 2012. 5.7% had “very low food

security”, meaning at least one household member had reduced food intake and disrupted eating

patterns due to a lack of money or other resources for food (Coleman-Jensen et al. 2013). These

rates are particularly striking in light of American wealth and the existence of a federal program

– the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program – that specifically aims to provide every U.S.

household with sufficient resources for a balanced diet.

         Food insecurity has been linked to adverse health outcomes. Among adults, these include

poor nutrient intakes (McIntyre et al. 2003; Kirkpatrick and Tarusak 2007), mental health

problems (Heflin et al. 2005), decreased physical health (Tarasuk 2001), depression (Whitaker et

al. 2006), diabetes (Seligman et al. 2007), higher prevalence of chronic disease (Seligman et al.

2010), and worse outcomes on health exams (Stuff et al. 2004). Food insecurity among children

is associated with higher risks of certain birth defects (Carmichael et al. 2007), anemia (Skalicky

et al. 2006; Eicher-Miller et al. 2009), decreased nutrient intakes (Cook et al. 2004), cognitive

difficulties (Howard 2011), greater aggression and anxiety (Whitaker 2006), asthma (Kirkpatrick

et al. 2010), behavioral problems (Huang et al. 2010), oral health problems (Muirhead et al.

2009), and poorer general health (Cook et al. 2006). Although it is typically assessed by

subjective responses to a series of closed end questions, these studies make clear that food

insecurity is correlated with many important aspects of health and well-being. Moreover,

understanding the relationship between food insecurity and health outcomes is particularly

important for researchers interested in low-income families, for whom medical treatment is a

luxury good and for whom, therefore, the relative returns to prevention are higher (Steckel 2008,

pp. 136-137).

       Debate continues about the causes of food insecurity and the roles for the public and

private sectors in solving the problem. Individual factors linked to food insecurity in the U.S.

include economic variables such as low wages, poverty, unemployment, low education levels,

high housing costs, renting rather than owning one’s home, and high medical expenses. They

also include demographic characteristics such as having children in the home and being African

American or Hispanic, unmarried, and relatively young (Ziliak, et al. 2008; City Policy

Associates 2010; Gundersen et al. 2011b; Gundersen and Ziliak 2014).

        Evidence suggests that SNAP and local food assistance programs ameliorate food

insecurity to at least some extent, but concerns about access to these programs remain for some



                                                3
households while others remain food insecure despite receiving SNAP benefits (Gundersen et al.

2011a; Gregory et al. 2013). The limited effectiveness of public programs has drawn attention to

the role of the local food environment in perpetuating food insecurity. In particular, researchers

have shown that high food prices and limited access to food stores are both associated with food

insecurity (Gregory and Coleman-Jensen 2011; Bonanno 2015). However, the extent to which

these associations reflect causal effects is unclear.

        We advance the discussion about the relationship between the local food environment

and food security by examining how a broad structural change in the American grocery sector –

the rapid expansion of Walmart’s Supercenter model – affected food security. In 1988, Walmart

expanded into large-scale food retail when it opened its first Walmart Supercenter, and the

company grew into the U.S.’ largest grocer with a 19% market share (Hayes 2013). Walmart

Supercenters are by far the dominant supercenter chain, with 3561 locations in 2018 compared to

just 239 Super Targets. 4 In the last decade, scholars have turned their attention to the effects of

Walmart entry and changes in the structure of the grocery industry on health outcomes

(Courtemanche and Carden 2011; Michelson et al. 2018; Borrescio-Higa 2015). 5 Courtemanche

and Carden (2011) find that Walmart Supercenters increase obesity, while Volpe et al. (2013)

find supercenter entry is followed by a larger proportion of food consumption that is

“unhealthy.” However, these studies did not examine the other side of the coin of Walmart’s

“Everyday Low Prices” and expanded food availability: Walmart could also improve food

  More generally, Walmart per se has become the subject of a ponderous body of research analyzing its effects on
everything from (for example) social capital, values, and leisure activities (Goetz and Rupasingha 2006; Carden et
al. 2009a, 2009b; Carden and Courtemanche 2009) to the size of the tax base and tax rates (Vandegrift and Loyer
2015; Vandegrift 2016) and even real estate prices (Caceres and Geoghegan 2017; Pope and Pope 2015). See
Carden (2013) and Carden and Courtemanche (2016) for summaries of the literature on the mass-market
merchandise sector.

security, which is primarily a measure of the quantity of food available to a household, as

opposed to its nutritional quality. 6

        Walmart Supercenter entry can provide a significant shock to an area’s food availability

and food prices. Walmart often opens stores in or near “food deserts” that lack sufficient options

for fresh produce. Matsa (2011) shows that Walmart entry leads to better inventory control and

fewer stock-outs by competitors, which should improve the reliability of food access. Basker and

Noel (2009) and Courtemanche and Carden (2014) show that Walmart Supercenters reduce local

food prices both by underselling existing food retailers and by inducing these competitors to

lower their own prices. Basker and Noel (2009) also find that the largest price reductions after

Walmart Supercenter entry come at stores that serve primarily low-income consumers. Hausman

and Leibtag (2009) and Furman (2005) argue that the consumer benefits from diffusion of mass-

market merchandisers are considerable and progressively distributed: the major beneficiaries of

these firms’ lower prices are low-income consumers who spend large percentages of their

incomes on food. 7 Hwang and Park (2016) study the effect of Supercenter conversion on

shoppers’ behavior and find that the conversion leads to larger per-visit expenditures, suggesting

that Supercenters affect the local food environment in part by inducing changes in shopping

technologies.

        We estimate the impacts of Walmart Supercenters on food security using data from the

2001-2012 waves of the December Current Population Study Food Security Supplement (CPS-

FSS). Narrow geographic identifiers available in the restricted version of these data enable us to

6
  As we show below, only two out of the 18 questions in the food security module address anything related to diet
quality. The rest are aimed at establishing the quantity of food available to the household.
7
  Additionally, the income effect from Walmart’s effect on non-food prices could lead to more spending on food and
better food security. In a back-of-the-envelope calculation, Courtemanche and Carden (2011) argue that Walmart
Supercenters’ direct and indirect price effects saved the average household $177 in 2002—additional income that
could be spent on more or better nutrients.

compute the distance from each household’s census tract to the nearest Walmart Supercenter.

Our outcomes are counts of the number of affirmative responses on the household and child-

specific portions of the food insecurity questionnaire along with binary variables for household

food insecurity, household very low food security, child food insecurity, and child very low food

security. We estimate instrumental variables (IV) models that leverage the predictable

geographic expansion patterns of Walmart Supercenters outward from corporate headquarters.

Specifically, we instrument for Walmart Supercenters with the interaction of distance from

Bentonville, Arkansas (Walmart’s headquarters) with time. For both households in general and

children, the results show that closer proximity to the nearest Walmart Supercenter leads to

sizeable and statistically significant improvements in all food security measures except the

indicator for very low food security. Subsample analyses reveal that the effects are especially

large for low-income households and children, though they are also sizeable for middle-income

children.


    II.      Methods

          We begin by estimating linear probability models (LPMs) of the form
                                                                    𝐽𝐽                𝑌𝑌

                    𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛽𝛽0 + 𝛽𝛽1 ln(𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷_𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 ) + � 𝛾𝛾𝑗𝑗 𝑋𝑋𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 + � 𝜏𝜏𝑦𝑦 𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑦𝑦 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖   (1)
                                                                  𝑗𝑗=1              𝑦𝑦=1


where 𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is the outcome (each of the aforementioned food insecurity variables) for household i

living in census tract c in year t, 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷_𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 is distance in miles from census tract c to the nearest

Walmart Supercenter in year t, 𝑋𝑋𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 is a set of J control variables, 𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑦𝑦 is a set of Y year fixed

effects (𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑦𝑦 = 1 if 𝑦𝑦 = 𝑡𝑡), 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is the error term, and the other Greek letters are parameters to be




                                                              6
estimated. 8 Distance from a census tract to the nearest Walmart Supercenter indicates to what

extent residents are exposed to Walmart Supercenters, and therefore 𝛽𝛽1 measures the association

between Walmart Supercenters and households’ food insecurity. We take the natural logarithm

of distance since it seems reasonable to expect a diminishing marginal effect. For instance, if a

new Walmart Supercenter reduces a household’s distance to the nearest Walmart Supercenter

from 50 to 40 miles, this is unlikely to matter since both stores are prohibitively far away.

Standard errors are heteroskedasticity-robust and clustered by census tract, since census tract is

the geographic level at which we measure Walmart Supercenter exposure.

         Supercenter locations are likely endogenous, which complicates our interpretation of

equation (1). First, omitted variable bias could result if changes over time in unobserved area

characteristics influence both the entry of Walmart Supercenters and residents’ levels of food

security. We are able to control for some obvious confounders such as income, but it is difficult

to account for all of them. Second, results may be driven by reverse causality as big box grocers

may specifically target areas with limited food supply. Indeed, Dukes v. Wal-Mart lead plaintiff

Betty Dukes criticized Wal-Mart for “promoting themselves to low-income people…They don’t

put Wal-Mart in those high-end parts of the community. They plant themselves right in the

middle of Poorville” (Featherstone 2005).

         We address these endogeneity concerns with instrumental variables, or variables that are

strongly correlated with the endogenous store variables but otherwise uncorrelated with the

outcome (food insecurity) variables conditional on the controls. We adopt a similar strategy used

by Courtemanche and Carden (2011) to investigate the impact of Walmart Supercenters on

8
  In unreported regressions, we verified that the estimated marginal effects are virtually identical using probit and
logit models instead of linear probability models. This is not surprising since LPMs have been shown to give reliable
estimates of average effects (e.g. Angrist and Pischke 2008, Section 3.4.2). We prefer to focus on the LPM estimates
since they are easier to implement in the subsequent instrumental variables regressions.


                                                         7
obesity. This strategy is based on the observation that the pattern of Walmart Supercenter

expansion starting in 1988 was to radiate outward from the area surrounding Walmart’s

headquarters in Bentonville, AR. In other words, in the first few years, areas close to northwest

Arkansas were the most likely to experience Walmart Supercenter entry, then as time passed

entry became more likely in areas progressively further away. Distance from Bentonville

therefore influenced the probability an area experienced Walmart Supercenter entry in a given

year, and this effect changed over time. This implies that the interaction of distance from

Bentonville with time provides plausibly exogenous variation that can identify the causal impact

of Walmart Supercenters on food security. 9 Our sample period will be 2001-2012, meaning that

Walmart’s Supercenter expansion pattern had already been underway for over a decade before

our sample starts. Figures 1 through 6 show that the most significant store opening activity

during this period was in major metropolitan areas relatively far from Bentonville, implying a

diminishing relationship over time between distance from Bentonville and distance from

Walmart.

         We operationalize the IV strategy by dividing the U.S. into 17 distance rings reflecting

100-mile increments of distance from Bentonville (e.g. less than 100 miles, 100-200 miles, …,

1600 or more miles) and creating an indicator variable for each ring. 10 The distance ring

dummies are included as controls, while the interactions of the distance ring dummies with

(linear) year are used as instruments. Additionally, to address the possible concern that coastal

and inland areas may have experienced different labor market shocks (and therefore different

shocks to food security) during the Great Recession and subsequent recovery, we also control for

9
   This strategy is modeled after those of Neumark et al. (2008) and Dube et al. (2007), who observed a similar
pattern for Walmart discount stores (as opposed to Supercenters) starting in the 1960s and used it to study the effect
of Walmart on local labor markets.
10
   The 100-mile distance ring classification follows Neumark et al. (2008) and Dube et al. (2007).

where 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷_𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝑑𝑑 is the distance from census tract c to Bentonville, 𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑦𝑦 is the national

unemployment rate, the other variables are the same as in (1), 𝜇𝜇𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is the error term, and the other

                                           𝑑𝑑=1

This differs from the naïve regression (1) by replacing the distance to Walmart Supercenters with

the predicted values of this variable estimated in equation (2) and adding the distance ring fixed

effects and their interactions with national unemployment rate as controls.

        Identification of 𝛽𝛽1 in the IV model comes from the assumption that the distance*year

interactions can be excluded from the second-state regression (3) – i.e. that these interactions are

uncorrelated with changes over time in food security conditional on the controls. By including


11
   Basker (2005) criticizes Neumark et al. (2008) and Dube et al.’s (2007) distance-from-Bentonville-based
identification strategy on the grounds that areas close to Bentonville (inland areas) experience differential labor
market fluctuations than those far from Bentonville (coastal areas). Courtemanche and Carden (2011) conduct a
wide array of robustness checks and placebo tests to verify that Basker’s criticism did not apply to at least one
health-related context (obesity). Nonetheless, we find that omitting the distance ring*unemployment rate
interactions does meaningfully influence the estimated effects on food security, so we include them in all
specifications.


                                                                   9
the distance ring fixed effects in (3), we allow for the distances to be correlated with levels of

food security; we only need to assume that they are uncorrelated with trends. We will later assess

the validity of the identifying assumption through a number of robustness checks.


   III.      Data

          Our individual-level data come from the 2001-2012 waves of the Current Population

Survey Food Security Supplement, an annual household survey conducted by the U.S. Census

Bureau for the USDA. The CPS-FSS is the December supplement to the monthly Current

Population Survey (CPS), which is a nationally representative survey on labor force statistics.

The participants of the CPS-FSS are the same as those interviewed by the original monthly CPS.

In the month when the CPS-FSS is conducted, the participants answer the labor force questions

as well as a series of questions concerning food security, food consumption, and the usage of

food assistance programs.

          The CPS-FSS includes the standard set of 18 questions that are used to assess household

and child food security. These questions are shown in Table 1. We use responses to this

questionnaire to construct four dependent variables for both households in general and children

in those households specifically. The first is a simple count of affirmative responses, where the

value ranges from zero to eighteen (ten) for households with (without) children, and zero to eight

for children (since only the last eight questions focus on children). The remaining outcomes are

dichotomized variables commonly used in the literature (e.g. Nord et al. 2005). “Household food

insecurity” is defined as three or more affirmative answers on the questionnaire, while “child

food insecurity” indicates two or more affirmative answers on the eight questions pertaining to

children. “Household very low food security” is defined as eight or more “yes” answers or six or




                                                10
more in households without children. “Child very low food security” indicates five or more

“yes” answers on the child-specific questions.

        We also use the CPS-FSS to construct three sets of individual-level control variables:

demographic characteristics, economic characteristics, and participation in government food

assistance programs. The demographic variables include adult responder’s age; number of own

children (dummies for 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5+, with 0 as the omitted base category); dummies for

whether race/ethnicity is non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, or Hispanic (with other

race/ethnicity as the omitted category); dummies for married and formerly married (with never

married as the omitted category); and dummies for high school degree but no further, some

college, college degree, and graduate degree (with less than high school degree as the omitted

category). The economic variables are household income (dummies for the 16 categories given

by the CPS), occupation (dummies for 17 categories), and median income in the census tract. 12

The food assistance variables are indicators for whether any household member received

Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits; Women, Infants, and Children

(WIC) benefits; and free/reduced-price school breakfasts or lunches in the past year.

        Our independent variable of interest is distance from each respondent’s census tract of

residence to the nearest Walmart Supercenter as of the end of each year. Walmart Supercenter

entry dates and locations were pieced together from several sources. We began with a list of

Walmart Supercenter addresses as of July 2014 from the Brigades Open Data Network. 13


12
   About 15% of the sample has missing income data. We drop these individuals for the reported regressions, but the
results are very similar if we include them and indicate them with a dummy variable.
13
   The list, which includes all Walmart discount stores, Supercenters, and Neighborhood Markets as well as Sam’s
Clubs in both the United States and Canada, is available at

However, this list does not include the dates on which the stores opened. Entry dates through

2003 come from Thomas Holmes’ website and were used in Holmes (2011). 14 We previously

updated these data through 2007 using press releases on store openings (either new stores or

conversions from discount stores to Supercenters) from Walmart News; these data were used in

Courtemanche and Carden (2011, 2014). After 2007, the company only issued online press

releases for some store openings and supercenter conversions, leaving 307 Supercenters (out of

3294) unmatched to a more specific entry date. We deduced the year of entry for these remaining

stores using a combination of: 1) annual zip code- and county-level counts of

supercenters/warehouse clubs from the U.S. Census Bureau’s County Business Patterns, 2) the

date of the store’s first Yelp review that indicates it is a Supercenter, 3) phone calls to the stores,

and 4) searching of Internet news articles. 15

         The census tract geographic data come from the U.S. Census Bureau Tiger/Line

Shapefiles 2000. For each census tract, an internal point, usually a geographic center of the area,

is identified, and its latitude and longitude coordinates are used to label the census tract. The

distance from a census tract to the nearest Walmart Supercenter is then computed using the

geodetic distance between the two sets of corresponding coordinates. The geodetic distance

measures the length of the shortest arc between two points on the ellipsoid surface of the earth.

The distance from a census tract to the headquarters of Walmart at Bentonville, AR, is calculated

following the same algorithm, then categorized into 17 distance rings.



14
  Holmes’ data are available at http://users.econ.umn.edu/~holmes/data/WalMart/.
15
  The zip-code level files appear to classify all supercenters/warehouse clubs that opened between 2008 and 2012 as
opening in 2012. This means that those files are only useful for identifying which stores opened after 2012, i.e. after
our sample period. The county-level files identify exact years. However, in counties where supercenters/warehouse
clubs opened in multiple years between 2008 and 2012, it is not possible to tell which year pertains to the store in
question, necessitating the other data collection strategies. Yelp reviews proved particularly useful, as very often a
reviewer comments soon after a Supercenter opens to talk about the new (or expanded) store.


                                                          12
       We also include a set of controls for proximity to other discount grocers constructed

using a similar method. These controls are distance to the nearest Walmart Neighborhood

Market, Sam’s Club, and Costco. The Neighborhood Market is Walmart’s newest store format,

and it is similar in size and scope to a traditional grocery store. Sam’s Club, owned by Walmart,

and Costco are the two leading warehouse club chains. We collected data on Neighborhood

Market and Sam’s Club entry dates and locations using the same process described for

Supercenters above. Costco lists each store location and opening date on its website.

       Merging the CPS-FSS to the census tract-level geographic data and county-level store

variables requires precise geographic identifiers that are not available in the public-use data. We

therefore use the restricted version of the CPS-FSS, provided by the Census Bureau after an

application process and accessed in the Atlanta Census Research Data Center.

       Dropping observations with missing data yields a final analysis sample of approximately

396,000 households, 120,000 of which have children. Following Research Data Center

disclosure policies, we are only able to report sample sizes rounded to the nearest 1,000

observations. Table 2 presents the summary statistics, both for the full sample of all households

and the subsample of households with children, for the food security variables as well as

distances from the nearest Walmart Supercenter and Bentonville. 14% of households are food

insecure, with 5% having very low food security. Children are food insecure in 10% of

households, though the rate of children’s very low food security is only 1%. The average

household lives 18 miles from the nearest Walmart Supercenter and 844 miles from Bentonville.

Appendix Table A1 shows the summary statistics for the control variables while Appendix Table

A2 does the same for the dummy variables for distance from Bentonville in 100-mile increments.




                                                13
   IV.      Results

         Table 3 reports the key results for the baseline OLS and IV regressions for each of the

eight food insecurity outcomes. The left half of the table contains the results for the household

measures while the right half displays those for the child measures. Coefficient estimates for the

independent variable of interest – ln(Distance to the Nearest Walmart Supercenter) – are shown.

For the IV regressions, we also report the F statistic from a test of the joint significance of the

instruments in the first stage, along with the p-value from the overidentification test of the

instruments’ validity. The table also contains sample sizes as well as means and standard

deviations of the outcome variables, which provide a reference point when interpreting the

magnitudes of the coefficient estimates.

         The OLS results suggest that Walmart Supercenters, if anything, worsen food insecurity.

The coefficient estimates are negative for all eight outcomes, meaning that a greater distance

from Walmart is associated with less food insecurity, i.e. better food security. However, only two

of the six estimates are statistically significant at the 10% level or better, and their magnitudes

are small. For instance, since log-units have a percentage interpretation, a 100% increase in

distance from Walmart decreases the count of affirmative household responses by just 0.008,

which is just 0.9% of the sample mean for that outcome and 0.4% of a standard deviation. It is

unclear, of course, whether these small associations actually reflect detrimental effects of

Walmart as opposed to “negative selection” in Walmart locations.

         In contrast to the OLS results, the IV estimates imply that the causal effect of Walmart

Supercenters is to improve food security. The coefficient estimates are positive for all six

outcomes, meaning that greater distance from Walmart worsens food insecurity. These estimates

are statistically significant at the 5% level or better for four of the six outcomes. The only



                                                14
exceptions are the very low food security outcomes, for which the lack of significance could

potentially be attributable to the relative lack of variation, as the sample rates are just 5% and 1%

for households and children, respectively. Moreover, the magnitudes of the significant effects

are, in our view, economically meaningful. For households in general, a 100% increase in

distance from Walmart (e.g. from 10 to 20 miles) reduces the number of affirmative responses by

0.047 and the probability of being food insecure by 1.2 percentage points. These magnitudes

represent 5.1% and 8.7% of the respective outcomes’ sample means and 2.1% and 3.5% of their

standard deviations. For the children’s food security measures, a 100% increase in distance from

Walmart reduces affirmative responses by 0.032 and likelihood of being food insecure by 1.4

percentage points. These magnitudes are 8.7% and 14.3% of the corresponding sample means

and 3.4% and 4.7% of the corresponding standard deviations.

       The instruments perform reasonably well in the diagnostic tests. The F-statistics are over

100, well beyond the rule-of-thumb critical value of 10, indicating that the instruments are

sufficiently strong. The overidentification test results are more difficult to interpret.

Conceptually, the overidentification test evaluates whether different subsets of instruments lead

to statistically different estimated effects of the endogenous variable, with such differences

suggesting that at least one of the instruments is invalid. In our case, the model is only

overidentified because of our use of a flexible functional form for distance from Bentonville

(separate variables for each 100-mile increment), meaning that it is unclear what a “failed”

overidentification test would indicate. Nonetheless, the overidentification test only rejects the

null hypothesis at the 5% level in one of the six IV regressions.




                                                 15
   V.      Robustness Checks

        We next conduct a number of robustness checks to address possible critiques of our

baseline IV model. First, the large set of control variables could conceivably “control away” part

of the causal effect of Walmart. For instance, part of Walmart’s effect on food security could

potentially operate through its effects on employment and wages, which are theoretically

ambiguous and are the subject of debate in the literature (Basker 2005; Cardiff-Hicks et al. 2014;

Neumark et al. 2008; Dube and Jacobs 2004; Dube et al. 2007). In this case, including income

and employment status could lead to an overcontrolling problem. Similarly, Coleman-Jensen

(2011) argues that “nonstandard” work (i.e. irregular hours) is associated with greater food

insecurity. If big box chains’ influence the share of “nonstandard” versus “standard” work,

controlling for occupation could be problematic. Walmart could also conceivably influence food

security via participation in nutrition assistance programs such as SNAP or by affecting location

decisions of other big box stores, either of which would create overcontrolling issues. Therefore,

our first series of robustness checks explores the sensitivity of the results to dropping different

subsets of controls. Specifically, we re-estimate the IV model including only demographic

controls (dropping the economic, food assistance, and food availability controls), only

demographic and economic controls, only demographic and food assistance controls, and only

demographic and food availability controls.

        The second set of checks goes the other direction, adding further controls to help address

remaining concerns about the IV model’s identifying assumption that distance from Bentonville

is uncorrelated with changes over time in food insecurity. In particular, the densely-populated

coastal areas that are relatively far from Bentonville could be trending in a different direction

than less-populated inland areas that are relatively close to Bentonville. Our baseline model’s

detailed array of covariates, which include controls for differential effects of economic cycles
                                                16
across distance from Bentonville rings, should substantially mitigate this concern. Nonetheless,

we conduct two robustness checks that explicitly address differential trends by population and

region. The first adds the interaction of year with county population, while the second adds the

interaction of year with a dummy variable indicating whether the state is on a coast.

       The next concern is that, besides Supercenters, Walmart owns two other types of stores

with full grocery departments – Sam’s Clubs and Walmart Neighborhood Markets – that could

conceivably follow the same geographic rollout pattern, creating a problem for the IV model’s

exclusion restriction. Recall that our baseline model controls for distance from both of these

stores, but does not address the endogeneity of their locations, which could conceivably lead to

spillover bias in the Walmart Supercenter coefficient estimator. This concern can be easily

dismissed for Sam’s Clubs, as Courtemanche and Carden (2011) previously documented that the

distance-from-Bentonville expansion pattern for Sam’s Clubs was finished before the start of our

sample period. In unreported regressions, we confirm this by re-estimating the first-stage of the

IV model with distance from Sam’s Club as the outcome variable, finding that the F statistics are

quite small. Neighborhood Markets are potentially more problematic, though, as a similar

analysis reveals that they did indeed follow a distance-from-Bentonville-based expansion pattern

during our sample period. We therefore conduct two robustness checks that give Neighborhood

Markets “equal treatment” to Supercenters in the empirical model. First, we re-define the

Walmart variable to be distance from the nearest Supercenter or Neighborhood Market

(whichever is closer). Second, we allow the distance-ring-by-year interactions to instrument for

both distance from the nearest Supercenter and distance from the nearest Neighborhood Market

(separate variables). Note that we prefer to use these models as robustness checks rather than the

main specification since we are unaware of any evidence documenting whether Neighborhood



                                                17
Markets feature the same price advantages as Supercenters, meaning that their predicted effect

on food insecurity is less clear.

        The next series of checks experiments with different functional forms for the key

variables. The first uses a linear, rather than logarithmic, functional form for the distance from

the nearest Supercenter variable. The second uses quadratic distance from Bentonville instead of

the series of dummies, meaning that the instruments are distance from Bentonville*year and

squared distance from Bentonville*year. The third check allows time to be modeled more

flexibly when constructing the instruments; specifically, rather than the instruments being the

interaction of each distance ring with linear year, in this model the instruments are a full set of

distance-ring-by-year fixed effects.

        Finally, we consider an entirely different IV strategy based on distance from the nearest

Walmart food distribution center, as measured in 2000, the year before the start of the sample

period. The intuition is similar to that behind distance from Bentonville. Early in the sample

period, Walmart Supercenters were presumably most likely to open near existing distribution

centers, but this relationship should weaken over time as the chain expands and new distribution

centers open. In other words, the interaction between proximity to year 2000 distribution center

locations and time provides plausibly exogenous variation in Walmart Supercenter entry. Since

distribution centers were already scattered across the country by 2000, this approach is less

susceptible than the distance-from-Bentonville-based strategy to the criticism of differential

shocks across coastal and inland areas. Specifically, we estimate the exact same IV model as

before, but replace the 100-mile distance from Bentonville dummy variables with 100-mile

distance from food distribution center variables. We also estimate another model in which both




                                                18
the distance from Bentonville*year and distance from food distribution center*year variables are

used as instruments.

        Table 4 reports the estimated effects of proximity to Walmart on food security across the

different robustness checks. For the four outcomes in which Walmart was statistically significant

in the baseline model, there are a total of 52 robustness checks (thirteen for each outcome).

Walmart remains significant at the 5% level in all but five of these and the 10% level in all but

two. While there is some sensitivity in the magnitudes, we do not view the sensitivity as

sufficient to meaningfully affect our conclusions. For households in general, a 100% increase in

distance from Bentonville increases the count of affirmative responses by between 0.036 and

0.075 and the probability of being food insecure by to 0.7 to 1.2 percentage points. For children,

there is even less sensitivity. The effects range from 0.027 to 0.034 for the count of affirmative

responses and 1.2 to 1.4 percentage points for the probability of being food insecure.16

Moreover, even though the baseline estimate for very low household food security was

statistically insignificant, in four of the thirteen robustness checks this effect becomes significant.

The effect on very low child food security remains insignificant across all specifications, but this

is perhaps not surprising given the very low prevalence of this condition (less than 1%).

Interestingly, in the robustness check that separately estimates the effects of Walmart

Supercenters and Neighborhood Markets, greater proximity to Neighborhood Markets does not

significantly improve any of the food security outcomes, suggesting either that these stores either

do not offer the same discounts as Supercenters or cater to a different clientele (e.g. individuals

who are not as close to the margin of food insecurity).


16
  We exclude the results using linear distance from the nearest Supercenter from this discussion of magnitudes since
the scale of the Supercenter variable becomes different in this specification, meaning the magnitudes are not
comparable.


                                                        19
   VI.        Subsample Analyses

         We close our empirical analysis by re-estimating the baseline IV model separately for

low, middle, and high income subsamples. Since food insecurity is most prevalent among low-

income households, we expect Walmart to lead to the largest improvements for that group. The

income cutoffs used for the stratifications are chosen to divide the sample into three groups that

are as similar in size as possible. Since the CPS only reports income in ranges, exactly equal

sample sizes are not possible. Our low-income subsample includes households with annual

incomes below $30,000, while the middle-income subsample includes those with incomes

between $30,000 and $59,999 and the high-income group contains those with incomes $60,000

and higher.

         Table 5 reports the results. For the low-income group, a 100% increase in distance from

the nearest Walmart Supercenter significantly increases a household’s count of affirmative

responses by 0.108 and probability of being food insecure by a 2.0 percentage points. These

magnitudes represent 6% and 7.5% of the corresponding sample means. For children, the

increases in number of affirmative responses and probability of being food insecure are 0.05 and

2.7 percentage points, or 6.3% and 12% of the sample means. While the coefficient estimates are

larger than those for the full sample presented in Table 3, the effect sizes expressed as a

percentage of the sample means are roughly similar. In other words, the reason the effects are

relatively large for the low-income subsample is simply because food insecurity is more

prevalent among that group.

         The bottom two panels of Table 5 display the results for the middle- and high-income

subsamples. All estimates are statistically insignificant and relatively small for middle- and high-

income households as well as high-income children. Interestingly, though, proximity to Walmart



                                                20
does appear to influence the food security of middle-income children: a 100% increase in

distance raises the number of affirmative responses by 0.044, and the probability of being food

insecure by 1.5 percentage points. Expressed as percentages of the sample means, these

magnitudes are 14% and 18%. Therefore, while the absolute effects are not as large for middle-

income children as they are for low-income children, they are actually larger in percentage terms.


   VII.     Conclusion

       This paper asks whether Walmart Supercenters, which lower food prices and expand food

availability, improve food security. We estimate instrumental variables (IV) models that exploit

the predictable geographic expansion patterns of Walmart Supercenters outward from corporate

headquarters. Our results rely on data from the restricted-access 2001-2012 waves of the

December CPS Food Security Supplement, which allow for relatively precise measurement of

each household’s distance from Walmart. We find that the entry of Walmart Supercenters helps

to alleviate food insecurity across most measures for both households and children. The effects

are strongest for low-income households and children but are still sizeable for middle-income

children.

       Our finding contributes to the literature in multiple ways. First, we provide new evidence

on the causes of food insecurity. Considerable resources are allocated through food assistance

programs toward protecting households, especially children, from food insecurity. However, no

research to date has examined the influence of big box grocers on food insecurity. Second, we

contribute to the debate about Walmart’s health effects. Big box grocers, Walmart Supercenters

in particular, are blamed for causing obesity (Courtemanche and Carden 2011; Courtemanche et

al. 2015). However, we are the first to study the other side of the coin: how the same cheap and

readily available food that drives big box grocers’ effect on obesity may also help in fighting


                                               21
food insecurity. This improvement in food security adds another factor local governments should

consider when deciding whether to use policy levers (e.g. taxes, zoning laws) to either encourage

or discourage Supercenter entry.

       Caveats of our study provide directions for future research. For instance, we focus only

on Walmart. Other types of food retailers, such as traditional supermarkets, smaller grocery

stores, conveniences stores, and warehouse clubs, could all influence food security in different

ways. To our knowledge, researchers have not yet identified quasi-experimental sources of

variation to identify the causal effects of these store formats. Additionally, our research does not

identify the specific mechanisms through which Walmart Supercenters influence food insecurity.

While food prices are perhaps the most likely mechanism, food availability and income effects

could play a role as well. Furthermore, the net effect of Walmart on health – encompassing the

improvement in food security, the increases in obesity and consumption of unhealthy food found

by prior studies, and any effects on other health outcomes that have not yet been documented –

remains ambiguous.

       Along those lines, in recent years Walmart has launched multiple initiatives to explicitly

focus on health. During President Barack Obama’s first term Walmart joined a number of other

firms and organizations in the Partnership for a Healthier America (Simon et al. 2017). As part of

the Partnership, Walmart adopted “Great For You” labeling for items that met the 2010 Dietary

Guidelines for Americans, renovated stores where food access was a concern, and worked with

suppliers to reformulate some of what they sold in order to reduce sodium, sugar, and other

unhealthy additives (Simon et al. 2017). In 2011, Walmart collaborated with Tuskegee

University to provide market access for small farmers in Alabama which ultimately led to higher

productivity for the farms that were able to participate in the study (Karki et al. 2017). Neither



                                                22
our identification strategy nor our data – which end in 2012 – are well-suited to identify the

impacts of these initiatives, but they could represent an important component of Walmart’s

health effects moving forward.
