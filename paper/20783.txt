                                            ABSTRACT

This paper explores cost-effective low-carbon R&D and capital investment portfolios for the electricity
generation sector through 2060. We present a novel method for long-term planning by combining
an economic model of endogenous non-linear technical change and a generation capacity planning
model with key features of the electricity system. The model captures the complementary nature of
technologies in the power sector; physical integration constraints; and the opportunity to build new
knowledge capital as a non-linear function of R&D and accumulated knowledge, which reflects the
diminishing marginal returns to research characteristic of the energy innovation process. We show
portfolios for future scenarios with and without carbon emission limits, and demonstrate the importance
of including various features by comparing results from a reference version of the model to results
from alternative versions that omit these features. Our results caution that using economic frameworks
that do not incorporate critical electricity and innovation system features may over- or under-estimate
the value of emerging technologies, and therefore the cost-effectiveness of R&D opportunities.

1.     Introduction

       Effectively managing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from fossil-based electric

power generation is critical for executing a comprehensive global climate change

mitigation and sustainable energy plan. In the United States, for example, the electric

power generation sector is responsible for approximately forty percent of the country’s

annual emissions (EIA 2012).        Unfortunately, many technologies for significantly

reducing CO2 emissions from the electricity sector are either in early conceptual stages or

are only available at relatively high costs or small scales, requiring additional research

and development (R&D).         Meanwhile, the industry continues to meet increasing

electricity demands with carbon-emitting technologies that are both commercially

available and economically viable. To address the dilemma of resolving increasing

electricity demands with emission reduction goals, it would be useful to find cost-

effective investment portfolios for R&D on emerging electricity technologies and new

generation capacity at the utility or power producer level (DOE 2011). On one hand,

incentivizing existing low-carbon technology adoption can play an important role in near-

term carbon reductions. On the other hand, supporting R&D can benefit long-term

carbon reductions by commercializing new, less expensive low-carbon technologies for

the future. What is the right balance between, and timing for, these two efforts?

       Previous studies of optimal low-carbon R&D and capital investment portfolios for

the electric power generation sector have neglected one of two critical aspects of the

electricity industry and the energy R&D process needed to provide useful insight. First,

existing research in this area lacks resolution of the critical structure of, and engineering

constraints within, the electric power system. The necessary cooperation between highly




                                             2
complex, time-dependent technical operations and the infrastructure itself sets electricity

apart from other large-scale, commodity-delivering infrastructure systems.            This

characteristic requires a diverse portfolio of generating technologies during any given

period of time in the system complementing each other to deliver reliable electricity.

Research is underway to integrate detailed system-level features into economic modeling

frameworks (e.g., Tapia-Ahumada, Octaviano, Rausch, & Pérez-Arriaga 2014; Shawhan

et al. 2014), but the typical approach for studying the joint energy R&D and capacity

planning problem thus far still uses a “top-down” economic perspective. This approach

lacks explicit disaggregated capital, variable, and other fixed costs; real operational

constraints (e.g., solar and wind intermittency, nuclear plant cycling); and adequate

temporal resolution in the demand-supply power balance over the course of a year (e.g.,

Goulder & Schneider 1999; Goulder & Mathai 2000; van der Zwaan, Gerlagh, Klaassen,

& Schrattenholzer 2002; Buonanno, Carraro, & Galeotti 2003; Popp 2004; Popp 2006;

Baker & Solak 2013; Pugh et al. 2011).

       Second, the studies that do represent the power system in detail typically omit an

explicit endogenous representation of the energy R&D process. Due to data limitations,

most existing studies for electricity investment portfolio planning rely on exogenous

discrete time trends or experience curves to represent the change in costs of different

technologies over time, neglecting the role of R&D (e.g., Short et al. 2011; Ross 2008;

Grubb, Kohler, and Anderson 2002; Messner 1997; Mattheson & Wene 1997; Loulou,

Goldstein, & Noble 2004; EIA 2009; Seebregts et al. 1999; Morris 2002; Berglund &

Soderholm 2006; Kypreos & Barreto 2000). A few studies have included R&D, but

assume linear (or one-to-one) relationships between R&D investments and new technical




                                            3
knowledge creation (e.g., Kouvaritakis, Soria, & Isoard 2000; Turton & Barreto 2004;

Barreto & Kypreos 2004; Miketa & Schrattenhozler 2004). The linear approach does not

capture diminishing marginal returns to research, for which there is considerable

empirical evidence and theoretical support. The functional form of the returns to R&D is

a critical assumption, because empirical studies suggest that the state of scientific

knowledge significantly affects the overall outcome of the R&D investment at a given

point in time (Popp, Newell, & Jaffe 2010; Popp 2002). There have been a few studies

that represent both rich technological details of the power system alongside key features

of the innovation process using a “hybrid” perspective (e.g., Mann, Mendelsohn, &

Richels 1995; Bosetti, Carraro, Galeotti, Massetti, & Tavoni 2006). For example, Bosetti

et al. (2006) assume a non-linear functional form for returns to R&D that exhibits

diminishing returns. However, this study and other similar hybrid modeling efforts still

use a relatively coarse resolution of the power sector. Although hybrid modeling efforts

offer the promise of improved models in the future, many current economic models omit

the detailed engineering cost structures of the different generation technologies, the

temporal variability of electricity demand, and the interaction between different

technologies with demand to determine optimal operations.

        In this paper, we explore socially optimal low-carbon R&D and capital

investment portfolios for the electric power generation sector, using a model with

endogenous non-linear R&D and a relatively detailed representation of the power

systemi. We present a novel modeling approach that considers the complementary roles

that generation technologies play within the power system, the physical integration

i
 We refer to the “optimal” investment strategy here, and throughout the remainder of the paper, in
reference to our numerical implementation of the investment problem rather than to an “absolute”
optimum.


                                                    4
constraints they face, and the economics at play in electric utilities’ least-cost investment

decisions. Our approach also considers specific characteristics of the innovation process,

including the opportunity to build knowledge capital as a non-linear function of R&D

investments and the current state of technical knowledge, and explicitly represents

diminishing marginal returns to research inherent in the energy innovation process. Note

that in each respective area—electric power generation capacity investment planning and

energy R&D investment planning—research and modeling capability has steadily

progressed. For example, state-of-the-art “bottom-up” electricity generation capacity

planning models integrate hourly, or even more frequent, temporal demand; unit-level

features such as start-ups and shut-downs; geographic heterogeneity with respect to

technology base and demand; and/or very sophisticated representations of intermittent

renewables such as wind and solar (e.g., Blanford et al. 2014; Palmintier 2013; Short et

al. 2011). Our goal is to demonstrate the value for energy planning of combining an

engineering cost-based structure with an economic model of the innovation process.

Doing so requires bringing together some of the most salient features of power system

operations and the energy innovation process into a single modeling framework.

However, we intentionally keep the approach stylized, and avoid integrating many

additional state-of-the-art modeling capabilities, to keep the results as straightforward and

interpretable as possible.

       Overall, the model indicates that the optimal R&D strategy should focus on

renewable energy technologies in the near- and medium-term, with gradual and

increasing R&D investment in nuclear power in the longer-term to meet carbon limits.

The optimal capital investment strategy follows a similar pattern, with the exception that




                                             5
under carbon limits, investment in nuclear power is deferred until costs are sufficiently

reduced from R&D. We demonstrate that when realistic details of the power system are

represented, the optimal strategy is qualitatively different from the resulting strategies

from current state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, the improved model shows that large

R&D and capital investments in baseload technologies such as coal with carbon capture

and sequestration (CCS) may not be optimal, given the impracticality for nuclear plants

to cycle (i.e., frequent startups and shutdowns), and the respective cost structures and

innovation potentials of these technologies.     It also shows that existing modeling

approaches may underestimate the contribution of variable renewable technologies, such

as solar, to the power system, and thus the cost-effectiveness of their R&D opportunities.

Finally, the explicit introduction of diminishing marginal returns to R&D cautions against

underinvesting in emerging technologies such as renewable energy and nuclear, for

which it is necessary to support on-going technological change and associated cost-

reductions.

       The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. The next section formulates

the specific investment problem we seek to solve, and provides details about the new

modeling approach, describing its structure and calibration. In Section 3, we use the new

modeling approach to study optimal R&D and capital investment portfolios with and

without carbon limits.    We also solve for the optimal investment strategy for two

additional cases—one without critical power system details and another without

diminishing returns to R&D—in order to demonstrate the value of explicitly representing

these components of the problem.       Finally, we show the sensitivity of the optimal

investment strategy to key innovation process characteristics.       The new modeling




                                            6
approach allows explicit study of the effects of different components of the knowledge

building process on optimal R&D and capital investments, which we find valuable given

recent empirical evidence showing notable variation between technology groups in the

contribution of their knowledge stocks on successful innovation (Popp, Santen, Fisher-

Vanden, & Webster 2013). Section 4 provides a discussion of the results and suggests

future research directions.



2.     Modeling framework

       We begin with a traditional engineering cost-based electricity generation capacity

expansion optimization model (e.g., Turvey & Andersen 1997; Hobbs 1995) with ten

technology categories, and modify it to simultaneously choose R&D investments for four

emerging low-carbon technologies: coal with carbon capture and sequestration, nuclear,

wind, and solar. The cost-based structure of the model includes technology specific

costs; temporal load variability; and engineering constraints governing the power

balance, supply reliability, intermittent wind and solar power, and constraints on cycling

nuclear generators.    We build upon previous modeling work that incorporates both

endogenous experience curves and endogenous R&D dynamics to allow overnight capital

costs to evolve as a function of capital investments and technological innovation (e.g.,

Barreto & Kypreos 2004; Fischer & Newell 2008).            However, the model of the

innovation process exhibits diminishing returns with increasing research effort (e.g.,

Popp 2004; Popp 2006; Bosetti et al. 2006). The planning horizon is sixty years, with

capital investment and R&D investment decisions made every five years. A centralized

planning approach is used, which assumes that a central decision maker simultaneously




                                            7
makes national investment and generation decisions.          This centralized approach is

appropriate for the long-range strategic policy and technology-planning objective of the

current question, and the large structural uncertainties inherent in short-term market

behaviors of individual firms over such long time scales (Pérez-Arriaga & Meseguer

1997). Below, we present the key features of the model, data, calibration, and solution

approach below. Full model details are provided in the appendix.



2.1 Objective

        Every five years, the decision maker chooses new power plant capacities, NCg,t,

for each technology g, and R&D investments, RDg*,t, for the subset of emerging

technology categories g*, to minimize the net present value of total system costs,



                                                     !!
min!"!,! ,!"!∗,! !"!,! + ! !"!,! + ! !"!∗ ,!   1−!                                   (1)




where g* ∈ g, FCg,t represents the total fixed costs (overnight capital and fixed O&M

costs) of technology category g in period t, VCg,t, represents the total variable costs (fuel

and variable O&M costs) of technology g in period t, and r is the discount rate.

        In addition to the constraints that define the design and operation of the

underlying electric power system, summarized below, the key constraint driving the

optimal investment strategy is a cumulative carbon emissions cap, ecap, applied to the

power sector,




                                                8
 !
 ! !!   ≤ !"#$                                                                    (2)



where Et represents total carbon emissions from the electricity sector during each period.

The existence of a cumulative cap forces a choice between reducing emissions now

versus later, given current technology costs and future R&D-based cost-reduction

potential.



2.2     Electricity system operations

        We parameterize the power system model to be qualitatively representative of the

U.S. generation portfolio and electricity demand (EIA 2011; Short et al. 2011). Table 1

lists the technology categories and associated values used for key parameters in the

generation expansion problem. Electricity demand is characterized using an annual load

duration curve with seventeen time slices representing four seasons, four daily segments,

and a “super peak” representing the highest forty (non-consecutive) hours of demand.

Figure 1 shows the duration and power level associated with each segment of the load

duration curve.

        Key constraints of the traditional power generation expansion planning and

optimal dispatch problem are retained, including those dictating energy demand balance,

reliability of supply, and energy resource availabilities. To this, we introduce several

additional details. First, we model to first order the effects of intermittent renewable

resources and the dominant operational constraints of nuclear power plants. Using a net-

load approach, both solar power and nuclear power are defined as “non-dispatchable,”

and all other technologies compete on cost in order to meet demand. Wind is modeled as




                                            9
“dispatchable” in order to allow its curtailment. Solar power is also represented as

operating only during demand slices that correspond to the daytime.ii Second, a high

retirement rate is used for old coal and old oil/gas steam plants, as a very large capacity

of these technologies is expected to retire in the U.S. over the next one to two decades. A

high retirement rate for nuclear power is also included, given the aging stock of the U.S.

nuclear fleet. Conversely, new investments in old coal technology, old oil/gas steam, and

hydropower are not allowed in the model because these technologies are outdated or near

their energy resource limits in the U.S. Third, we represent the inability to scale up

emerging technologies rapidly and without limit by assuming a constraint on the rate of

change of installed capacities between periods.               Table 3 shows values assumed for

additional parameters associated with the problem as defined.



2.3     Technical change dynamics

        The process of innovation enters the model through two distinct complementary

pathways. Building on the recent empirical and numerical modeling literature, we use a

two-factor learning curve (2FLC) to simultaneously represent learning-by-doing (LBD)

and learning-by-searching (LBS) (Klaassen, Miketa, Larsen, & Sundqvist 2005;

Soderholm & Klaassen 2007; Miketa & Schrattenholzer 2004; Barreto & Kypreos 2004).

Through the 2FLCs, the overnight capital cost of a technology is decreasing in the

technical knowledge stock for the technology, and decreasing in the cumulative capacity

installed. While the 2FLC formulation applies to the emerging technology groups (coal



ii
  Representing each of these constraints can be approached in many ways, with varying degrees of
sophistication. Our stylized model includes the minimum degree of realism we believe is necessary to
study whether results change after integrating power system operation and innovation process details.


                                                   10
with CCS, nuclear, wind, and solar), all technologies for which new capacity can be

added continue to learn via LBD via a traditional one-factor learning curveiii.

         The technical change dynamics in the model are summarized with the following

three equations:



                         !    !
!"#$!,! = ! !! !"!,! !"!,!                                                                        (3)



                 !!,!
!!,! ! = !     !!!      !!!                                                                       (4)
             !"!,!   !"!,!




!"!,!!! ! = ! !"#$!,! + ! !! !"!,!                                                                (5)




         Equation (3) represents the production of new knowledge, NEWKg,t, for

technology g in time period t, defining it as a function of R&D investment, RDg,t, and the

cumulative technical knowledge stock, KSg,t, for technology g in time period t. The

parameter βg represents the contribution of R&D dollars invested in the creation of new

knowledge, ϕg represents the contribution of the current knowledge stock in the creation

of new knowledge, and αg is a technology-specific scalar used to calibrate the behavior of

the new innovation possibilities frontier to the current learning literature. Diminishing



iii
  There are many other pathways for technical change, including but not limited to spillovers, learning-by-
association, and exogenous technical change (progress of the overall economy). Additionally, there are
many outstanding theoretical and empirical issues with respect to definition and measurement (e.g., Clarke,
Weyent, Birky 2006; Nordhaus 2013). Integrating the full range of these is beyond the scope of this paper.
Instead, we keep the model stylized including learning-by-doing and learning-by-researching as the
pathways most directly connected to decisions about new capacity and R&D.


                                                    11
returns to research are incorporated in this “innovation possibilities frontier (IPF),” by

constraining the sum of βg, and ϕg to less than 1.0.

         Equation (4) represents the two-factor learning curve that combines LBD and

LBS. Cg,t is the capital cost of technology g in time period t, C0,g is the initial capital cost

at unit capacity and knowledge stock, ICg,t is the cumulative installed capacity in GW of

technology g in time period t, KSg,t is once again the cumulative human knowledge stock

for technology g in time period t, and η1g and η2g are the learning-by-doing and learning-

by-research output elasticities for technology g, respectively.                    As indicated by the

subscript g, the parameters η1g and η2g are technology specific; their interpretation

follows directly from traditional experience curve “progress-ratio” calculations where 1 -

2ηi describes the cost reduction that occurs from a doubling of capital stock (η1) or

knowledge stock (η2) (e.g., Ibenholt 2002). For the non-emerging technology groups,

η2g is set to zero, resulting in one factor LBD curves being applied to the evolving

overnight capital costsiv. Technology specific parameters of the IPF and 2FLC, listed in

Table 4, are calibrated to estimates in the published literaturev. Specifically, the scaling

parameter, αg, minimizes the sum of squared differences between capital cost reductions

as formulated here, and capital cost reductions based on published two-factor LBD and

LBS rates, and R&D and knowledge stock output elasticities (Barreto & Kypreos 2004;

Popp 2006).



iv
  For consistency, one-factor LBD parameter values were re-constructed from the 2FLC values employed
by Barreto & Kypreos (2004), based on achieving the same cost-reduction over capital stocks.
v
  There is a wide range of estimates in the published literature on learning rates, as well as considerable
debate about the appropriateness of using historical data to estimate future costs for emerging technologies.
Addressing these issues is beyond the scope of this paper, which aims to present a new framework, but it is
important for the reader to note that these differences exist and could impact the specific numerical results
presented here.


                                                     12
       Equation (5) represents the knowledge building process, capturing the stock

nature of the technical knowledge capital dimension in this problem. The parameter kgt

represents the new knowledge gained for technology g during period t through the

innovation possibilities frontier, and   g   represents a technology-specific decay rate for

the knowledge stock from one period to the next.



2.4    Numerical Implementation

       We solve the electricity generation capital and R&D investment planning problem

numerically, as a non-linear program. We use the GAMS modeling environment, and a

standard non-linear programming (NLP) solver, CONOPT. A 20-point seeding algorithm

is also used to set initial values widely distributed over the solution space. The optimum

is the solution to the NLP that minimizes total system costs across all twenty seeds. We

address terminal conditions for this multi-period decision problem by running the 60-year

planning problem for an additional 40 years. Results from only the first 12 (5-year)

periods are used in each of the analyses to ensure that decisions being made at or near the

end of the planning horizon are not “end-of-world” artifacts or a result of artificially

imposed terminal conditions.




                                              13
3.      Results

        In this section, we present the results of four numerical modeling experiments.vi

We first present the optimal investment strategy resulting from solving the reference

model with no carbon limit and then with a moderately stringent carbon limit equivalent

to reducing business-as-usual carbon emissions from the power generation sector by fifty

percent annually. Next, we show the impact of modeling critical power system details

and diminishing returns to R&D on the resulting optimal strategy. Our focus is to

explicitly show how the optimal investment strategy changes when these features are

considered, and to demonstrate the value for energy planning of combining an

engineering cost-based structure with an economic model of the innovation process.

Finally, we present results from a sensitivity analysis of the optimal investment strategy

on the efficiency of R&D, and on the strength of the technology knowledge stocks. An

additional advantage of the modeling framework we present is the capability to directly

study component drivers of new technology knowledge creation. The sensitivity analysis

results illustrate the behavior of the model with respect to these components.



3.1     Reference optimal investment strategy

        When carbon emissions from the power generation sector are allowed to grow

unconstrained, the new modeling framework with endogenous R&D-based technical

change and diminishing returns shows that it is optimal in the near-term to invest

aggressively in wind power R&D, and to a lesser extent in solar PV R&D, and then to


vi
  Note that throughout this paper we refer to investment strategies using the names of the technologies we
have included in our model, but in reality the results are driven by the underlying engineering and cost
characteristics of the technologies themselves. Therefore, the reader should feel free to consider the
strategies more generically, using the technology characteristics we have included as a benchmark.


                                                    14
decrease investments of both to negligible amounts after two to four decades (Figure 2).

The temporal pattern of optimal capital investments (deployment) for the reference model

(Figure 3) helps to explain this behavior. Several gigawatts of wind are installed in the

second and third periods in order to make up a sizeable share of the total installed

capacity by the fourth period.              R&D investments reflect this deployment pattern.

Investments occur early and aggressively to reduce costs as much as possible before

massive deployments. Solar PV deployments in the fifth through the ninth periods occur

on a much smaller scale, but solar R&D investments similarly reflect the capacity

increases over time. Investments begin early in order to reduce capital costs as much as

possible, but to a lesser extent than for wind, and they occur over a longer interval of time

because deployments occur further in the future.

         Note that wind and solar PV technology R&D and deployments appear even in

the absence of a carbon emissions limit; this is due to their specific cost structures and the

presence of learning in the model. Wind technology is already close to being cost-

competitive with the other technologies’ capital costs (See Table 1). Because of the

competitive cost and relatively rapid learning rates, near-term R&D investments and

deployment in wind technology yields significant cost savings during future installations,

which in turn encourages further deployment vii , viii .               Solar PV technology, despite


vii
     When engineering details of power system operations and merit-order effects are considered in
combination with endogenous learning opportunities, as in the current modeling framework, it is common
to witness significant wind technology deployment; fuel costs are zero, other variable costs are among the
lowest in the technology suite, and overnight capital costs become quite low due to cumulative LBD, LBS,
and other effects). In our results, the amount of wind (or any other technology) R&D and deployment can
also be attributed to previous technology support policies such as a production tax credit or state RPS since
implicit in the learning rates and thus costs is the effect of past installations motivated by these policies.
Note, however, that technology capital costs do not directly reflect the impact of such support policies.
viii
     While capital and other engineering costs for wind power decrease to the point of being cost-
competitive with some conventional technologies, note that other constraints continue to exist (e.g.,
transmission capacity) that can prevent actual wind deployment and are not represented in our model.


                                                     15
significantly higher capital costs compared with other technologies, is also developed and

deployed due to its high learning potential (both through experience and R&D) (See

Table 3).     In contrast, low-carbon coal with CCS and zero-carbon nuclear, both

technologies with high relative overnight capital costs but lower learning potentials, do

not have sufficient incentive for either R&D or deployment in the absence of a carbon

constraint. Figure 2 also shows the relative allocation of the R&D amount for the optimal

investment strategy in each period, and indicates the substantial early R&D investment in

wind technology, followed by a delayed, but prolonged investment in solar PV. For the

remainder of the paper, we will present the optimal R&D investment strategy in terms of

the ratio of R&D by technology to the total R&D, and emphasize insights into the relative

investment allocation, rather than the absolute magnitudes from our stylized model.

         Under a moderately stringent carbon limit, one that is equivalent to constraining

annual carbon emissions from the power generation sector to fifty percent of 2010

“business-as-usual” emissions, the optimal strategy involves R&D and capital

investments in nuclear technology, in addition to the same absolute wind and solar

development and deployment plan as with no carbon limit. Nuclear technology R&D

investments occur more gradually than wind and solar, peaking after 35 years, just before

new nuclear capital investments occur (Figures 2 and 3). Because nuclear generation is

baseload (operating for most hours of the year), emits no carbon emissions, and has lower

capital and operating costs than coal with CCS—the alternative baseload low carbon

technology—it plays an important role in reducing cumulative carbon emissions. Note

the significant amount of electricity generated by nuclear in Figure 3 under a carbon

limit.   However, the deployment of nuclear is deferred until later periods to take




                                            16
advantage of the capital cost reductions from early R&D investments. Under the carbon

limit, nuclear technology has the largest share of R&D (Figure 2). We note that neither

development nor deployment of coal with CCS occurs in the optimal strategy for the

reference model. This is a result of its higher overnight capital costs and fuel costs

relative to alternative low-carbon technologies (Table 1), combined with its relatively

lower learning rates (Table 3).ix



3.2      The effect of power system details

         The results described above have been obtained using an engineering cost-based

structure for the electric power R&D and capital investment planning model instead of a

typical economic modeling structure, to ensure that critical physical and technological

characteristics of the power system are represented in sufficient detail. In this section, we

present results obtained with an alternative formulation of the model (hereafter referred to

as the “simplified power system model”) with several important engineering constraints

omitted to show that the optimal investment strategy is indeed different than that in the

reference model. Specifically, we neglect the explicit representations of temporal load

variability, time-of-day output constraints for solar PV panels, and the inability of nuclear

plants to cost-effectively manage repeated start-up and shut-downs. Instead, we assume

an average annual demand value, a solar PV panel output that assumes a specific average

capacity factor (30%), and neglect the baseload “must-run” constraint we place on

nuclear power generation. These assumptions are consistent with the vast majority of

ix
  The numerical model considers the possibility that coal with CCS and nuclear power technologies can
incur an upper bound in deployment for political or physical reasons (e.g., concerns about nuclear waste
disposal or public safety, physical limitation of carbon sequestration sites) by including a maximum
installed capacity of 30% (for each) of total system capacity. However, neither constraint is active in the
solution, indicating that the results are robust to these types of concerns within this limit.


                                                     17
economic energy models that focus on the rest of the economy but use a simplified

electricity sector with an annual demand representation.

       Figures 4 and 5 present the optimal R&D and capacity investments, respectively,

resulting from the simplified power system model. Without a carbon limit, the optimal

R&D investment strategy focuses solely on wind technology; R&D investments in solar

PV are not part of the investment strategy, which differs significantly from the results

obtained with the reference model.      Solar PV technology is also dropped from the

deployment plan, with wind making up the balance. Furthermore, under a carbon limit,

R&D and capital investments in solar are effectively zero. In contrast to the reference

model, under the carbon limit wind R&D investments continue throughout the sixty-year

planning horizon (albeit at smaller share of total R&D relative to nuclear technology).

Another significant difference in this version is that the optimal investment strategy

includes both baseload low-carbon technologies, nuclear and coal with CCS. Investment

in nuclear R&D is still optimal under the alternate model, and remains at a relatively high

share throughout the planning horizon (rather than starting out small and gradually

increasing over time). Coal with CCS generation changes most dramatically under this

simplified power system formulation, and exhibits positive optimal R&D and capital

investments throughout the planning horizon, in contrast to zero investment in the

reference model. In fact, investment is so high for coal with CCS that by the seventh

period it makes up the largest share of R&D expenditures across the four emerging

technologies.

       Why are R&D investments into coal with CCS justified under a carbon limit in

the alternate model? A main reason is the absence of the must-run constraint on nuclear




                                            18
generation. Without that constraint, both coal with CCS and nuclear technology can

contribute to meet electricity demand. Nuclear generation, initially with lower overnight

capital cost, is deployed sooner in this version than in the reference model, and therefore

also has high R&D investment shares in early periods. Coal with CCS is initially higher

cost, and is consequently deployed in later periods, after R&D investments have had

sufficient time to reduce capital costs and increase its competitiveness.       The R&D

investment share in coal with CCS starts off small in the early periods, and then rises

swiftly over the next few periods. The optimal deployment strategy under the simplified

power system formulation also includes less wind and more natural gas plants.

       The reason why the optimal R&D investment plan from the simplified power

system model does not include solar PV is that the model does not differentiate between

the times when solar generation is and is not available. Solar generation is effectively

assumed to be available at any time of day or in any season regardless of solar incidence,

but only and always at 30% output, as opposed to the much higher levels for some

seasons and times of day. A maximum capacity factor of 30% combined with its high

initial capital cost, makes this technology not cost-effective. In general, we caution that

using economic modeling frameworks that do not resolve temporal variation may

underestimate the value of variable generation technologies such as solar PV, and

therefore may also underestimate cost-effective R&D opportunities.          Similarly, for

baseload technologies with specific engineering constraints such as nuclear, such

frameworks may overestimate the opportunity for competing baseload technologies (e.g.,

coal with CCS, gas) and the corresponding value of R&D investment into these

technologies.




                                            19
3.3     The effect of diminishing returns to research

        An important contribution of this work is the incorporation of diminishing returns

to research into an R&D and capital investment planning model for the power sector.

Here, we demonstrate the value of taking this realistic approach, relative to the common

approach that assumes linear R&D-knowledge building relationships without diminishing

returns. We formulate a third version of the model, which replicates the reference

version from Section 3.1 with the important exception of the mechanism through which

knowledge increases about emerging technologies.        Specifically, in this version, we

replace Equation (3) in the reference model with:



!!,! = ! !"!,! ,                                                                      (5)



where new knowledge, k, for technology, g, in time, t, is a one-to-one function of the

dollars invested in technology, g, and time, t. This formulation closely matches the

dominant assumption in many energy models, which equates R&D dollars with new

knowledge. We refer to this version as the “linear R&D” model version.

        Figure 6 shows the optimal R&D investment strategies with and without a carbon

limit when the linear knowledge production function is assumed, omitting diminishing

returns. In the absence of a carbon limit, the relative shares of R&D investments into

wind and solar technologies in the early periods is approximately the same, but R&D into

solar ceases after the fifth period. The same pattern holds for wind and solar R&D

investment under a carbon limit. In the linear R&D model, R&D into nuclear technology




                                            20
under the carbon limit has a higher optimal share in the first two periods, after which

investment stops abruptly. In contrast, when diminishing returns are considered (Figure

2), nuclear R&D begins gradually, and becomes dominant for most of the planning

horizon.

       In general, the impact of ignoring the decreasing returns from research effort as a

function of cumulative effort is to overestimate the effect of R&D into technologies. The

linear R&D model also results in a different temporal path of optimal R&D investments,

leading to a “boom-and-bust” pattern of investing a lot in early periods, after which R&D

ceases. This is particularly true for technologies such as solar PV and nuclear, which

have delayed deployment and thus investment in the reference model spread out over

many periods.     For technologies with low learning-by-searching rates but large

deployments in the reference model (e.g., nuclear under a carbon limit), the linear R&D

model chooses a disproportionate level of R&D effort in the early periods. The shift in

the timing of R&D, in turn, changes the optimal capital investment pattern, resulting in

earlier deployment of nuclear generation (Figure 7), displacing combined cycle natural

gas plants during those periods. A similar pattern is seen for nuclear technology R&D

investments under a carbon constraint in the engineering cost model of Barreto &

Kypreos (2004), which assumes linear R&D-based knowledge building and the same low

learning rate. In their model, technologies with higher learning rates witness continued

R&D investment over their planning horizon.




                                           21
3.4      Optimal investment strategies v. knowledge building components

         An additional benefit of representing endogenous learning-by-searching with an

innovation possibilities frontier (IPF), such as Equation (3) of the reference model, is the

ability to explicitly study the impact of assumptions about R&D efficiency (parameter )

and about the effect of the knowledge stock level in generating new knowledge

(parameter ϕ) on the inter-temporal knowledge building process, and consequently on

the optimal investment strategy.             This is particularly salient given evidence in the

technical change literature showing variation across energy technologies in the

contribution of their knowledge stocks to successful innovation (Popp et al., 2013). In

the reference model (Section 3.1), we assume values of                       and ϕ from the literature,

assigning all emerging technologies the same valuesx. Here we summarize results from

sensitivity analyses of the optimal strategy to both of these characteristics of the

innovation process. We focus on the impact on R&D investments, because capacity

investments are less sensitive to changes in the IPF parameters in our model.

         Figure 8 shows the share of R&D investments, defined by the peak investment

over time, in each of the four emerging technology groups for a range of R&D

investment efficiency (parameter β) values under a carbon limit (reference value for                           is

0.1). With increasing R&D efficiency, the shares of wind and solar power (technologies

with high learning rates and early R&D) investments display only mild sensitivity; the

R&D investment shares for these technologies only decrease slightly as R&D efficiency

x
  Although parameters       and ϕ of the innovation possibilities frontier are the same across the four
emerging technologies, a scaling parameter       is used to calibrate each technology to technology specific
learning values in the literature allowing each technology to follow its own cost-reductions over R&D
investment (See Section 3 and supplemental information for more details).


                                                     22
increases. In contrast, nuclear power, which has a much lower learning rate and an

optimal path of R&D that peaks in later periods, experiences increasing investment

shares with increasing R&D efficiency. The general trend is robust to R&D investment

efficiencies, however; it is optimal to invest the largest share into nuclear, the next largest

share into wind, the least into solar, and none into coal with CCS.

       The optimal investment pattern is more sensitive to assumptions about ϕ, the

elasticity of new knowledge to current knowledge stock levels (Figure 9). As the impact

of knowledge stock on new knowledge increases, the relative share of wind R&D

investments increase and the relative share of nuclear R&D investments decrease.

Specifically, for values of ϕ below approximately 0.4 (reference value is 0.54), it is

optimal to invest the majority of R&D into wind over nuclear, but for values greater than

0.4, it is optimal to invest the majority of R&D into nuclear power. The effect on optimal

R&D share into solar and coal with CCS is more robust to the knowledge stock effect. It

is optimal to spend approximately one-tenth of total R&D expenditures on solar PV

technology for any value of knowledge stock strength. The optimal strategy continues to

exclude R&D or capital investments into coal with CCS across all values of             and ϕ

studied here.

       We conclude that for technologies for which early R&D investments are optimal

and learning rates are high (e.g., wind), more favorable innovation processes shift the

optimal strategy away from R&D investment. The intuition is that if the same amount of

R&D expenditures yields greater returns, there is no need to spend extra money.

Additionally, because expenditures take place in the first few years for these




                                              23
technologies, there is less time to benefit from accumulating knowledge. However, for

technologies with low learning rates and deferred R&D investments (e.g., nuclear),

increasing the strength with which the knowledge stock contributes to new knowledge

(and ultimately cost reductions) incentivizes increasing R&D investments.       In these

cases, there is more time for benefits from additional R&D to accrue. Discounting of

future period R&D investments also makes an increase in R&D not as costly a decision.

       Overall, when compared side-by-side, the sensitivity of the optimal investment

strategy in terms of relative shares of R&D investment on both R&D efficiency and

knowledge stock strength is similar in that for the technologies with high learning rates

and early period R&D investments, R&D investment tends to decrease (or stay constant)

with increasing values for both innovation process components. On the other hand, for

technologies with low learning rates (e.g., nuclear) and deferred R&D investments, R&D

investment tends to increase with increasing values of the innovation components. One

noteworthy difference in the sensitivities however, as Figure 9 below shows, is that the

impact of knowledge stock strength is large enough to change the priority ordering of

R&D investments under a carbon limit. At low levels, the model shows us that it is

optimal to invest the majority of the R&D expenditures on wind, whereas at high levels

on nuclear. Given the limited empirical data on these parameters, and the inherent

uncertain nature of the innovation process, we leave the exploration of the impact of

uncertainty in these parameters as future work.




                                           24
4.     Discussion

       In this paper, we present a novel modeling framework for informing investment

decisions about R&D and generation capital infrastructure in the electric power sector.

Specifically, the new framework improves upon state-of-the-art modeling in this area by

using an explicit engineering-cost structure for representing important power system

details such as temporal load variability, technology-specific operational constraints,

intermittent renewable generation, and technology-specific engineering and fuel costs.

We also utilize a non-linear innovation possibilities frontier function for representing a

process of technology knowledge building that captures diminishing returns to R&D.

Results from the model inform decision makers about the relative balance of low-carbon

R&D investments and new capital investments that is cost-effective at transforming the

currently high-carbon emitting power generation sector.

       In particular, for capital investments, the most competitive emerging technologies

(e.g., wind power) are deployed early with and without carbon limits, to meet increasing

demand. Without any limits on carbon, the remaining deployment of new capacity is

made up of natural gas plants, whereas with a carbon limit, solar PV deployment

increases and nuclear power is also deployed. The deployment of nuclear in the presence

of a carbon limit is critical—the baseload nature of the technology affords deep emission

cuts. R&D investments generally track the deployment patterns. R&D investments in

early periods are optimal for technologies with high learning rates and do less overall to

contribute to emission cuts (e.g., both wind and solar are intermittent generating

technologies). However, a greater share of R&D investment is dedicated to wind than

solar, because solar is more resource constrained in the model. Lower initial levels of




                                           25
R&D that increase gradually over the planning horizon are optimal for technologies with

lower learning rates and deferred deployment (e.g., nuclear).

       The results above demonstrate the value of incorporating critical power sector

details and diminishing returns to energy R&D into the state of the art modeling

frameworks. If key characteristics of the electricity sector such as load variability,

intermittent generation, and operational constraints such as cycling are omitted, the

optimal solutions of the models differ significantly—observable at even the minimum-

level of detail we integrate. Specifically, under a carbon limit, the optimal strategy

involves R&D and capital investments in coal with CCS (whereas in the reference model

such investments are not optimal), and the relative share of R&D investment allocated to

coal with CCS grows over time to dominate all other emerging technologies. Likewise,

the optimal strategy excludes any investments in solar PV technology. We conclude that

the engineering cost structure of the model we use is critical to representing features of

the power system such as the ineffectiveness for nuclear plants to cycle and the temporal

variability of solar PV generation. If diminishing returns to research effort are not

explicitly represented in the model of the innovation process, there is a tendency for the

optimal strategy to exhibit underinvestment in future periods. This results from the fact

that the average return rate from R&D investments appears to be much higher in a model

without diminishing returns, thus reducing the benefit of continued investments.

       A number of questions are raised for future research. First, given the sensitivity

of the share of optimal R&D investments to the components of the knowledge building

process such as knowledge stock strength, and the paucity of data available about the

actual value of these innovation process components, it would be valuable to study the




                                            26
optimal R&D investment strategy under uncertainty in the return rate of R&D programs

(R&D efficiency) and knowledge stock strengths. We present one such a study in a

forthcoming paper that uses a stochastic R&D model for the power generation sector, but

in general this is an open area of research that would benefit from multiple perspectives.

Second, we have developed the current model using an engineering cost structure with

the intention of presenting a framework that could be used as the “bottom-up” component

of a more integrated hybrid modeling effort. There are many feedbacks between the

electricity sector and the rest of the economy, as well as between the energy innovation

that occurs in electricity and the rest of the economy, that would be beneficial to include

in a modeling framework used to inform investment decisions and related policies. The

integration of a modeling framework such as the one presented here into a hybrid model

with macroeconomic interactions would be a valuable line of research. Finally, due to

our research objective, we have used a stylized model that relies on a single, aggregated

entity that engages in innovative activity and chooses R&D investments only in response

to opportunities for minimizing system-wide costs.       However, in reality, innovation

occurs via several different institutions, through both public and private entities that

respond to different incentives. Representing public and private innovation separately in

a model like the one we present here could help inform the allocation of R&D funds

across different actors, as would characterizing and representing other key features of the

innovation process such as R&D feedbacks upstream at the technology suppliers from

downstream deployment at the utilities and power producers.

  The lack of experience with carbon capture and sequestration technology in the electric power sector
makes it difficult to find reliable learning data for use in numerical models of technological change. Thus,
other authors have used learning rates for coal SO2 scrubbing technology or NOx reduction technologies
and applied them to coal with CCS technology in numerical decision support models (Rubin, Taylor, Yeh,
& Hounshell 2004). This paper uses the history of nuclear fission technology and its learning rates as a
proxy for coal with CCS (both are capital-intensive, large baseload technologies with significant challenges
of space, scale up, public acceptance, permitting, waste, etc.).
