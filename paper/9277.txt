                                           ABSTRACT

        Anomalies are empirical results that seem to be inconsistent with maintained theories of
asset-pricing behavior. They indicate either market inefficiency (profit opportunities) or
inadequacies in the underlying asset-pricing model.
       The evidence in this paper shows that the size effect, the value effect, the weekend effect,
and the dividend yield effect seem to have weakened or disappeared after the papers that highlighted
them were published. At about the same time, practitioners began investment vehicles that
implemented the strategies implied by some of these academic papers.
       The small-firm turn-of-the-year effect became weaker in the years after it was first
documented in the academic literature, although there is some evidence that it still exists.
Interestingly, however, it does not seem to exist in the portfolio returns of practitioners who focus
on small-capitalization firms.
       All of these findings raise the possibility that anomalies are more apparent than real. The
notoriety associated with the findings of unusual evidence tempts authors to further investigate
puzzling anomalies and later to try to explain them. But even if the anomalies existed in the sample
period in which they were first identified, the activities of practitioners who implement strategies
to take advantage of anomalous behavior can cause the anomalies to disappear (as research findings
cause the market to become more efficient).

1       Introduction

        Anomalies are empirical results that seem to be inconsistent with maintained theories of

asset-pricing behavior.         They indicate either market inefficiency (profit opportunities) or

inadequacies in the underlying asset-pricing model. After they are documented and analyzed in

the academic literature, anomalies often seem to disappear, reverse, or attenuate. This raises the

question of whether profit opportunities existed in the past, but have since been arbitraged away,

or whether the anomalies were simply statistical aberrations that attracted the attention of

academics and practitioners.

        Surveys of the efficient markets literature date back at least to Fama (1970), and there are

several recent updates, including Fama (1991) and Keim and Ziemba (2000), that stress

particular areas of the finance literature.             By their nature, surveys reflect the views and

perspectives of their authors, and this one will be no exception. My goal is to highlight some

interesting findings that have emerged from the research of many people and to raise questions

about the implications of these findings for the way academics and practitioners use financial

theory.1

        There are obvious connections between this chapter and earlier chapters by Ritter (10 –

Investment Banking and Securities Issuance) and Ferson (16 – Multifactor Pricing Models), as

well as later chapters by Barberis and Thaler (18 – Behavioral Issues), Cochrane (20 – New

Facts in Finance), and Easley and O’Hara (21 – Market Microstructure and Asset Pricing). In

fact, those chapeters draw on some of the same findings and papers that provide the basis for my

conclusions.

        At a fundamental level, anomalies can only be defined relative to a model of “normal”

    1
      This chapter is not meant to be a survey of all of the literature on market efficiency or anomalies. Failure to
cite particular papers should not be taken as a reflection on those papers.

return behavior. Fama (1970) noted this fact early on, pointing out that tests of market efficiency

also jointly test a maintained hypothesis about equilibrium expected asset returns.            Thus,

whenever someone concludes that a finding seems to indicate market inefficiency, it may also be

evidence that the underlying asset-pricing model is inadequate.

       It is also important to consider the economic relevance of a presumed anomaly. Jensen

(1978) stressed the importance of trading profitability in assessing market efficiency.           In

particular, if anomalous return behavior is not definitive enough for an efficient trader to make

money trading on it, then it is not economically significant. This definition of market efficiency

directly reflects the practical relevance of academic research into return behavior.         It also

highlights the importance of transactions costs and other market microstructure issues for

defining market efficiency.

       The growth in the amount of data and computing power available to researchers, along

with the growth in the number of active empirical researchers in finance since Fama’s (1970)

survey article, has created an explosion of findings that raise questions about the first, simple

models of efficient capital markets. Many people have noted that the normal tendency of

researchers to focus on unusual findings (which could be a by-product of the publication process,

if there is a bias toward the publication of findings that challenge existing theories) could lead to

the over-discovery of “anomalies.” For example, if a random process results in a particular

sample that looks unusual, thereby attracting the attention of researchers, this “sample selection

bias” could lead to the perception that the underlying model was not random. Of course, the key

test is whether the anomaly persists in new, independent samples.

       Some interesting questions arise when perceived market inefficiencies or anomalies seem

to disappear after they are documented in the finance literature: Does their disappearance reflect




                                                  4
sample selection bias, so that there was never an anomaly in the first place? Or does it reflect the

actions of practitioners who learn about the anomaly and trade so that profitable transactions

vanish?

       The remainder of this chapter is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses cross-sectional

and times-series regularities in asset returns, including the size, book-to-market, momentum, and

dividend yield effects. Section 3 discusses differences in returns realized by different types of

investors, including individual investors (through closed-end funds and brokerage account

trading data) and institutional investors (through mutual fund performance and hedge fund

performance). Section 4 evaluates the role of measurement issues in many of the papers that

study anomalies, including the difficult issues associated with long-horizon return performance.

Section 5 discusses the implications of the anomalies literature for asset-pricing theories, and

Section 6 discusses the implications of the anomalies literature for corporate finance. Section 7

contains brief concluding remarks.


2      Selected Empirical Regularities
2.1    Predictable Differences in Returns Across Assets

Data Snooping

       Many analysts have been concerned that the process of examining data and models

affects the likelihood of finding anomalies. Authors in search of an interesting research paper

are likely to focus attention on “surprising” results. To the extent that subsequent authors

reiterate or refine the surprising results by examining the same or at least positively correlated

data, there is really no additional evidence in favor of the anomaly. Lo and MacKinlay (1990)

illustrate the data-snooping phenomenon and show how the inferences drawn from such

exercises are misleading.




                                                 5
        One obvious solution to this problem is to test the anomaly on an independent sample.

Sometimes researchers use data from other countries, and sometimes they use data from prior

time periods. If sufficient time elapses after the discovery of an anomaly, the analysis of

subsequent data also provides a test of the anomaly. I supply some evidence below on the post-

publication performance of several anomalies.

The Size Effect

        Banz (1981) and Reinganum (1981) showed that small-capitalization firms on the New

York Stock Exchange (NYSE) earned higher average returns than is predicted by the Sharpe

(1964) – Lintner (1965) capital asset-pricing model (CAPM) from 1936-75. This “small-firm

effect” spawned many subsequent papers that extended and clarified the early papers. For

example, a special issue of the Journal of Financial Economics contained several papers that

extended the size effect literature.2

        Interestingly, at least some members of the financial community picked up on the small-

firm effect, since the firm Dimensional Fund Advisors (DFA) began in 1981 with Eugene Fama

as its Director of Research.3 Table 1 shows the abnormal performance of the DFA US 9-10

Small Company Portfolio, which closely mimics the strategy described by Banz (1981).

        The measure of abnormal return αi in Table 1 is called Jensen’s (1968) alpha, from the

following familiar model:

                                (Rit – Rft) = αi + βi (Rmt – Rft) + εit,                                  (1)

where Rit is the return on the DFA fund in month t, Rft is the yield on a one-month Treasury bill,

    2
    Schwert (1983) discusses all of these papers in more detail.

Research in Security Prices (CRSP) Mutual Fund database. Ken French maintains current data for the Fama-French
factors on his web site: http://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/.

and Rmt is the return on the CRSP value-weighted market portfolio of NYSE, Amex, and Nasdaq

stocks. The intercept αi in (1) measures the average difference between the monthly return to the

DFA fund and the return predicted by the CAPM. The market risk of the DFA fund, measured

by βi, is insignificantly different from 1.0 in the period January 1982 – May 2002, as well as in

each of the three subperiods, 1982-1987, 1988-1993, and 1994-2002. The estimates of abnormal

monthly returns are between -0.2% and 0.4% per month, although none are reliably below zero.

          Thus, it seems that the small-firm anomaly has disappeared since the initial publication of

the papers that discovered it. Alternatively, the differential risk premium for small-capitalization

stocks has been much smaller since 1982 than it was during the period 1926-1982.

The Turn-of-the-Year Effect

          Keim (1983) and Reinganum (1983) showed that much of the abnormal return to small

firms (measured relative to the CAPM) occurs during the first two weeks in January. This

anomaly became known as the “turn-of-the-year effect.” Roll (1983) hypothesized that the

higher volatility of small-capitalization stocks caused more of them to experience substantial

short-term capital losses that investors might want to realize for income tax purposes before the

end of the year. This selling pressure might reduce prices of small-cap stocks in December,

leading to a rebound in early January as investors repurchase these stocks to reestablish their

investment positions.4

 There are many mechanisms that could mitigate the size of such an effect, including the choice of a tax year different from a calendar
year, the incentive to establish short-term losses before December, and the opportunities for other investors to earn higher returns by
providing liquidity in December.

       Table 2 shows estimates of the turn-of-the-year effect for the period 1962-2001, as well

as for the 1962-1979 period analyzed by Reinganum (1983), and the subsequent 1980-1989 and

1990-2001 sample periods. The dependent variable is the difference in the daily return to the

CRSP NYSE small-firm portfolio (decile 1) and the return to the CRSP NYSE large-firm

portfolio (decile 10), (R1t - R10t). The independent variable, January, equals one when the daily

return occurs during the first 15 calendar days of January, and zero otherwise. Thus, the

coefficient αJ measures the difference between the average daily return during the first 15

calendar days of January and the rest of the year. If small firms earn higher average returns than

large firms during the first half of January, αJ should be reliably positive.

       Unlike the results in Table 1, it does not seem that the turn-of-the-year anomaly has

completely disappeared since it was originally documented. The estimates of the turn-of-the-

year coefficient αJ are around 0.4% per day over the periods 1980-1989 and 1990-2001, which is

about half the size of the estimate over the 1962-1979 period of 0.8%. Thus, while the effect is

smaller than observed by Keim (1983) and Reinganum (1983), it is still reliably positive.

       Interestingly, Booth and Keim (2000) have shown that the turn-of-the-year anomaly is

not reliably different from zero in the returns to the DFA 9-10 portfolio over the period 1982-

1995. They conclude that the restrictions placed on the DFA fund (no stocks trading at less than

$2 per share or with less than $10 million in equity capitalization, and no stocks whose IPO was

less than one year ago) explain the difference between the behavior of the CRSP small-firm

portfolio and the DFA portfolio. Thus, it is the lowest-priced and least-liquid stocks that

apparently explain the turn-of-the-year anomaly.          This raises the possibility that market

microstructure effects, especially the costs of illiquidity, play an important role in explaining

some anomalies (see Chapters 12 (Stoll) and 21 (Easley and O’Hara)).

The Weekend Effect

       French (1980) observed another calendar anomaly. He noted that the average return to

the Standard & Poor's (S&P) composite portfolio was reliably negative over weekends in the

period 1953-1977. Table 3 shows estimates of the weekend effect from February 1885 to May

2002, as well as for the 1953-1977 period analyzed by French (1980) and the 1885-1927, 1928-

1952, and 1978-2002 sample periods not included in French’s study. The dependent variable is

the daily return to a broad portfolio of U.S. stocks. For the 1885-1927 period, the Schwert

(1990) portfolio based on Dow Jones indexes is used. For 1928-2002, the S&P composite




                                                 10
portfolio is used. The independent variable, Weekend, equals one when the daily return spans a

weekend (e.g., Friday to Monday), and zero otherwise. Thus, the coefficient αW measures the

difference between the average daily return over weekends and the other days of the week. If

weekend returns are reliably lower than returns on other days of the week, αW should be reliably

negative (and the sum of α0 + αW should be reliably negative to confirm French’s (1980)

results).

        The results for 1953-1977 replicate the results in French (1980). The estimate of the

weekend effect for 1928-1952 is even more negative, as previously noted by Keim and

Stambaugh (1984). The estimate of the weekend effect from 1885-1927 is smaller, about half

the size for 1953-1977 and about one-third the size for 1928-1952, but still reliably negative.

Interestingly, the estimate of the weekend effect since 1978 is not reliably different from the

other days of the week. While the point estimate of αW is negative from 1978-2002, it is about

one-quarter as large as the estimate for 1953-1977, and it is not reliably less than zero. The

estimate of the average return over weekends is the sum α0 + αW, which is essentially zero for

1978-2002.

        Thus, like the size effect, the weekend effect seems to have disappeared, or at least

substantially attenuated, since it was first documented in 1980.

The Value Effect

        Around the same time as early size effect papers, Basu (1977, 1983) noted that firms with

high earnings-to-price (E/P) ratios earn positive abnormal returns relative to the CAPM. Many

subsequent papers have noted that positive abnormal returns seem to accrue to portfolios of

stocks with high dividend yields (D/P) or to stocks with high book-to-market (B/M) values.

       Ball (1978) made the important observation that such evidence was likely to indicate a

fault in the CAPM rather than market inefficiency, because the characteristics that would cause a

trader following this strategy to add a firm to his or her portfolio would be stable over time and

easy to observe. In other words, turnover and transactions costs would be low and information

collection costs would be low. If such a strategy earned reliable “abnormal” returns, it would be

available to a large number of potential arbitrageurs at a very low cost.

       More recently, Fama and French (1992, 1993) have argued that size and value (as

measured by the book-to-market value of common stock) represent two risk factors that are




                                                 12
missing from the CAPM. In particular, they suggest using regressions of the form:

                   (Rit – Rft) = αi + βi (Rmt – Rft) + si SMBt + hi HMLt + εit                  (2)

to measure abnormal performance, αi. In (2), SMB represents the difference between the returns

to portfolios of small- and large-capitalization firms, holding constant the B/M ratios for these

stocks, and HML represents the difference between the returns to portfolios of high and low B/M

ratio firms, holding constant the capitalization for these stocks. Thus, the regression coefficients

si and hi represent exposures to size and value risk in much the same way that βi measures the

exposure to market risk.

       Fama and French (1993) used their three-factor model to explore several of the anomalies

that have been identified in earlier literature, where the test of abnormal returns is based on

whether αi = 0 in (2). They found that abnormal returns from the three-factor model in (2) are

not reliably different from zero for portfolios of stocks sorted by: equity capitalization, B/M

ratios, dividend yield, or earnings-to-price ratios. The largest deviations from their three-factor

model occur in the portfolio of low B/M (i.e., growth) stocks, where small-capitalization stocks

have returns that are too low and large-capitalization stocks have returns that are too high (αi >

0).

       Fama and French (1996) extended the use of their three-factor model to explain the

anomalies studied by Lakonishok, Shleifer, and Vishny (1994). They found no estimates of

abnormal performance in (2) that are reliably different from zero based on variables such as

B/M, E/P, cash flow over price (C/P), and the rank of past sales growth rates.

       In 1993, Dimensional Fund Advisors (DFA) began a mutual fund that focuses on small

firms with high B/M ratios (the DFA US 6-10 Value Portfolio). Based on the results in Fama

and French (1993), this portfolio would have earned significantly positive “abnormal” returns of




                                                 13
about 0.5% per month over the period 1963-1991 relative to the CAPM. The estimate of the

abnormal return to the DFA Value portfolio from 1994-2002 in the last row of Table 1 is -0.2%

per month, with a t-statistic of -0.59. Thus, as with the DFA US 9-10 Small Company Portfolio,

the apparent anomaly that motivated the fund’s creation seems to have disappeared, or at least

attenuated.

       Davis, Fama, and French (2000) collected and analyzed B/M data from 1929 through

1963 to study a sample that does not overlap the data studied in Fama and French (1993). They

found that the apparent premium associated with value stocks is similar in the pre-1963 data to

the post-1963 evidence. They also found that the size effect is subsumed by the value effect in

the earlier sample period. Fama and French (1998) have shown that the value effect exists in a

sample covering 13 countries (including the U.S.) over the period 1975-1995. Thus, in samples

that pre-date the publication of the original Fama and French (1993) paper, the evidence supports

the existence of a value effect.

       Daniel and Titman (1997) have argued that size and M/B characteristics dominate the

Fama-French size and B/M risk factors in explaining the cross-sectional pattern of average

returns. They conclude that size and M/B are not risk factors in an equilibrium pricing model.

However, Davis, Fama, and French (2000) found that Daniel and Titman’s results do not hold up

outside their sample period.

The Momentum Effect

       Fama and French (1996) have also tested two versions of momentum strategies.

DeBondt and Thaler (1985) found an anomaly whereby past losers (stocks with low returns in

the past three to five years) have higher average returns than past winners (stocks with high

returns in the past three to five years), which is a “contrarian” effect. On the other hand,




                                               14
Jegadeesh and Titman (1993) found that recent past winners (portfolios formed on the last year

of past returns) out-perform recent past losers, which is a “continuation” or “momentum” effect.

Using their three-factor model in (2), Fama and French found no estimates of abnormal

performance that are reliably different from zero based on the long-term reversal strategy of

DeBondt and Thaler (1985), which they attribute to the similarity of past losers and small

distressed firms. On the other hand, Fama and French are not able to explain the short-term

momentum effects found by Jegadeesh and Titman (1993) using their three-factor model. The

estimates of abnormal returns are strongly positive for short-term winners.

        Table 4 shows estimates of the momentum effect using both the CAPM benchmark in (1)

and the Fama-French three-factor benchmark in (2).                  The measure of momentum is the

difference between the returns to portfolios of high and low prior return firms, UMD, where

prior returns are measured over months -2 to -13 relative to the month in question.5 The sample

periods shown are the 1965-1989 period used by Jegadeesh and Titman (1993), the 1927-1964

period that preceded their sample, the 1990-2001 period that occurred after their paper was

published, and the overall 1927-2001 period. Compared with the CAPM benchmark in the top

panel of Table 4, the momentum effect seems quite large and reliable. The intercept α is about

1% per month, with t-statistics between 2.7 and 7.0. In fact, the smallest estimate of abnormal

returns occurs in the 1965-1989 period used by Jegadeesh and Titman (1993) and the largest

estimate occurs in the 1990-2001 sample after their paper was published.6

      Jegadeesh and Titman (2001) also show that the momentum effect remains large in the post 1989 period. They
tentatively conclude that momentum effects may be related to behavioral biases of investors.

UMDt is the return to a portfolio that is long stocks with high returns and short stocks with low returns in
recent months (months -13 through -2). The market risk premium is measured as the difference in return
between the CRSP value-weighted portfolio of NYSE, Amex and Nasdaq stocks (Rm) and the one-month
Treasury bill yield (Rf). SMBt is the difference between the returns to portfolios of small- and large-
capitalization firms, holding constant the B/M ratios for these stocks, and HMLt is the difference
between the returns to portfolios of high and low B/M ratio firms, holding constant the capitalization for
these stocks. Heteroskedasticity-consistent standard errors are used to compute the t-statistics.

          Fama and French (1996) noted that their three-factor model does not explain the

momentum effect, since the intercepts in the bottom panel of Table 4 are all reliably positive. In

fact, the intercepts from the three-factor models are larger than from the single-factor CAPM

model in the upper panel.

          Lewellen (2002) has presented evidence that portfolios of stocks sorted on size and B/M

characteristics have similar momentum effects as those seen by Jegadeesh and Titman (1993,

2001) and Fama and French (1996).         He argues that the existence of momentum in large

diversified portfolios makes it unlikely that behavioral biases in information processing are likely

to explain the evidence on momentum.

          Brennan, Chordia, and Subrahmanyam (1998) found that size and B/M characteristics do

not explain differences in average returns, given the Fama and French three-factor model. Like

Fama and French (1996), they found that the Fama-French model does not explain the

momentum effect. Finally, they found a negative relation between average returns and recent

past dollar trading volume. They argue that this reflects a relation between expected returns and

liquidity as suggested by Amihud and Mendelson (1986) and Brennan and Subrahmanyam

(1996).

          Thus, while many of the systematic differences in average returns across stocks can be

explained by the three-factor characterization of Fama and French (1993), momentum cannot.

Interestingly, the average returns to index funds that were created to mimic the size and value

strategies discussed above have not matched up to the historical estimates, as shown in Table 1.

The evidence on the momentum effect seems to persist, but may reflect predictable variation in

risk premiums that are not yet understood.

2.2      Predictable Differences in Returns Through Time

         In the early years of the efficient markets literature, the random walk model, in which

returns should not be autocorrelated, was often confused with the hypothesis of market efficiency

(see, for example, Black (1971)). Fama (1970, 1976) made clear that the assumption of constant

equilibrium expected returns over time is not a part of the efficient markets hypothesis, although

that assumption worked well as a rough approximation in many of the early efficient markets

tests.

         Since then, many papers have documented a small degree of predictability in stock

returns based on prior information. Examples include Fama and Schwert (1977) [short-term

interest rates], Keim and Stambaugh (1986) [spreads between high-risk corporate bond yields

and short-term interest rates], Campbell (1987) [spreads between long- and short-term interest

rates], French, Schwert, and Stambaugh (1987) [stock volatility], Fama and French (1988)

[dividend yields on aggregate stock portfolios], and Kothari and Shanken (1997) [book-to-

market ratios on aggregate stock portfolios]. Recently, Baker and Wurgler (2000) have shown

that the proportion of new securities issues that are equity issues is a negative predictor of future

equity returns over the period 1928-1997.

         An obvious question given evidence of the time-series predictability of returns is whether

this is evidence of market inefficiency, or simply evidence of time-varying equilibrium expected

returns. Fama and Schwert (1977) found weak evidence that excess returns to the CRSP value-

weighted portfolio of NYSE stocks (in excess of the one-month Treasury bill yield) are

predictably negative. Many subsequent papers have used similar metrics to judge whether the

evidence of time variation in expected returns seems to imply profitable trading strategies. I am

not aware of a paper that claims to find strong evidence that excess stock returns have been




                                                 18
predictably negative, although that may be an extreme standard for defining market inefficiency

since it ignores risk.

Short-Term Interest Rates, Expected Inflation, and Stock Returns

        Using data from 1953-1971, Fama and Schwert (1977) documented a reliable negative

relation between aggregate stock returns and short-term interest rates. Since Fama (1975) had

shown that most of the variation in short-term interest rates was due to variation in expected

inflation rates during this period, Fama and Schwert concluded that expected stock returns are

negatively related to expected inflation.

        Table 5 shows estimates of the relation between stock returns and short-term interest

rates or expected inflation rates for the period January 1831 - May 2002, as well as for the 1953-

1971 period analyzed by Fama and Schwert (1977). The dependent variable Rmt is the monthly

return to an aggregate stock portfolio (based on the Schwert (1990) data for 1831-1925 and the

CRSP value-weighted portfolio for 1926-2001, and the Standard & Poor’s composite for 2002),

                                  Rmt = α + γ Rft + εt,                                                    (3)

where Rft is the yield on a short-term low-risk security (commercial paper yields from 1831-1925

and Treasury yields from 1926-2002).7 The negative relation between expected stock returns

and short-term interest rates is strongest for the 1953-1971 period, but the estimate is negative in

all of the sample periods in Table 5, and it is reliably different from zero over 1831-1925. The t-

statistic for 1972-2002 is -1.08.

        It is common to use the average difference between the return from a large portfolio of

stocks and the yield on a short-term bond (Rmt – Rft) as an estimate of the market risk premium


    7
    Schwert (1989) describes the sources and methods used to derive the short-term interest rate series.




                                                        19
(e.g., Ibbotson Associates (1998) and Brealey and Myers (2000)). This model of the market risk

premium implies that the coefficient of Rft in (3) should be 1.0, so that the negative estimates are

even more surprising. For example, the t-statistic for the hypothesis that the coefficient of Rft

equals 1.0 for 1972-2002 is -2.03.

        Table 5 also shows estimates of the relation between stock returns and two measures of

the expected inflation rate, using the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the Producer Price Index

(PPI). The model for expected inflation uses a regression of the inflation rate on the short-term

interest rate with ARMA(1,1) errors,

                          PPIt = α0 + γ0 TBt + [(1 - θL) / [(1 - φL)] εt,                                    (4)

where L is the lag operator, LkXt = Xt-k, estimated using the most recent 120 months of data to

forecast inflation in month t+1.8 It is notable that the negative relation with stock returns is

stronger for the interest rate Rft than for either measure of the expected inflation rate, even

though Rft is a part of the prediction model for inflation. This shows that the interest rate is not a

close proxy for the expected inflation rate outside the 1953-1971 period. It also shows that the

negative relation between stock returns and short-term interest rates is not always due to

expected inflation.

        Thus, the apparent ability of short-term interest rates to predict stock returns is strongest

in the period used by Fama and Schwert (1977). Nevertheless, it does seem that excess returns

on stocks are negatively related to interest rates, suggesting a slowly time-varying market risk

premium. If the market risk premium varies because of underlying economic fundamentals, this

is not an anomaly that would allow investors to trade to make abnormal profits.


    8
    This model is similar the model used by Nelson and Schwert (1977) to model the CPI inflation rate from 1953-
1977. It is a flexible model that is capable of representing a wide variety of persistence in the inflation data.

from a predictive model for PPI inflation:

estimated with the prior 120 months of data. Similarly, E(CPIt) is the one-month-ahead forecast
from a predictive model for CPI inflation. Heteroskedasticity-consistent t-statistics are in

Dividend Yields and Stock Returns

       Using CRSP data for the period 1927-1986, Fama and French (1988) showed that

aggregate dividend yields predict subsequent stock returns.         Many subsequent papers have

amplified this finding and several have questioned aspects of the statistical procedures used,

including Goyal and Welch (1999). Table 6 reproduces some of the main results from Fama and

French (1988), but also uses the Cowles (1939) data for 1872-1926 and additional CRSP data for

1987-2000. The equation estimated by Fama and French is,

                              r(t, t+T) = α + δ Y(t) + ε(t, t+T),                               (5)

where Y(t) = D(t)/P(t-1), P(t) is the price at time t, D(t) is the dividend for the year preceding t,

and r(t, t+T) is the continuously compounded nominal return from t to the slope estimates are

much smaller and the explanatory power of the models (R2) is negligible. t+T.

       What is clear from Table 6 is that the incremental data both before and after the 1927-

1986 period studied by Fama and French shows a much weaker relation between aggregate

dividend yields and subsequent stock returns. None of the t-statistics for the slope coefficient

δ are larger than 2.0, even for the 1872-2000 sample which includes the 1927-1986 data used by

Fama and French (about half of the sample). This occurs because the slope estimates are much

smaller and the explanatory power of the models (R2) is negligible.

to the CRSP value-weighted portfolio from 1926-2000 and to the Cowles portfolio from 1872-
1925. The regressions for two-, three- and four-year returns use overlapping annual
observations. The t-statistics t(δ) use heteroskedasticity- and autocorrelation-consistent standard
error estimates. R2 is the coefficient of determination, adjusted for degrees of freedom, and S(ε)
is the standard error of the regression.

         Fig. 1 illustrates the limitations of the dividend yield model for predicting stock returns.

Fig. 1a shows the predictions of stock returns from the model based on lagged dividend yield,

D(t)/P(t-1), for a one-year horizon based on estimates for 1927-1986 (the top row in the right-

hand panel of Table 6). It also shows the one-year return to short-term commercial paper and

Treasury securities. The model for 1927-1986 is used to predict stock returns both before and

after the estimation sample, for the 1872-2000 period. Until 1961, the predicted stock return is

always higher than the interest rate. However, starting in 1990, the predicted stock return is

always below the interest rate. 9

         Fig. 1b shows the investment results that would have occurred from following a strategy

of investing in short-term bonds, rather than stocks, when the dividend yield model in Table 6

predicts stock returns lower than interest rates. Both that strategy and a benchmark buy-and-hold

strategy start with a $1,000 investment in 1872. By the end of 1999, the buy-and-hold strategy is

worth almost $6.7 million, whereas the dividend yield asset allocation strategy is worth just over

$2.2 million. This large difference reflects the high stock returns during the 1990s when the

dividend yield model would have predicted low stock returns. In short, the out-of-sample

prediction performance of this model would have been disastrous.10

         In Chapter 20, Cochrane discusses return predictability in returns in relation to various

indicators, such as yield spreads, dividend yields, and momentum. Again, if market returns vary

because of underlying economic fundamentals, this is not an anomaly that would allow investors

to trade to make abnormal profits.



    9
     Campbell and Shiller (1998) also stress the pessimistic implications of low aggregate dividend yields and
apparently followed the advice of their model (Wall Street Journal, January 13, 1997).
    10
      Of course, it is possible that a less extreme asset allocation model that reduced exposure to stocks when
dividend yields were low relative to interest rates would perform better.

3      Returns to Different Types of Investors
3.1    Individual Investors

       One simple corollary of the efficient markets hypothesis is that uninformed investors

should be able to earn “normal” rates of return. It should be just as hard to select stocks that will

under-perform as to select stocks that will out-perform the market, otherwise, a strategy of short-

selling or similarly taking opposite positions would earn above-normal returns. Of course,

investors who trade too much and incur unnecessary and unproductive transactions costs should

earn below-normal returns net of these costs.

       Odean (1999) examined data from 10,000 individual accounts randomly selected from a

large national discount brokerage firm for the period 1987-1993. This sample covers over

160,000 trades. Because the data source is a discount brokerage firm, recommendations from a

retail broker are presumably not the source of information used by investors to make trading

decisions.   Odean found that traders lower their returns through trading, even ignoring

transactions costs, because the stocks they sell earn higher subsequent returns than the stocks

they purchase.

       Barber and Odean (2000, 2001) used different data from the same discount brokerage

firm and found that active trading accounts earn lower risk-adjusted net returns than less-active

accounts. They have also found that men trade more actively than women and thus earn lower

risk-adjusted net returns and that the stocks that individual investors buy subsequently under-

perform the stocks that they sell.

       The results in these papers are anomalies, but not because trading costs reduce net

returns, or because men trade more often than women. They are anomalies because it seems that

these individual investors can identify stocks that will systematically under-perform the Fama-




                                                 26
French three-factor model in (2). One potential clue in Odean (1999) is that these investors tend

to sell stocks that have risen rapidly in the recent weeks, suggesting that the subsequent good

performance of these stocks is due to the momentum effect described earlier. By going against

momentum, these individual investors may be earning lower returns.

Closed-End Funds

       The closed-end fund puzzle has been recognized for many years. Closed-end funds

generally trade in organized secondary trading markets, such as the NYSE. Since marketable

securities of other firms constitute most of the assets of closed-end funds, it is relatively easy to

observe both the value of the stock of the closed-end fund and the value of its assets. On

average, in most periods, the fund trades at less than the value of its underlying assets, which

leads to the “closed-end fund discount” anomaly.

       Thompson (1978) was one of the first to carefully show that closed-end fund discounts

could be used to predict above-normal returns to the shares of closed-end funds. Lee, Shleifer,

and Thaler (1991) argued that the time-series behavior of closed-end fund discounts is driven by

investor sentiment, with discounts shrinking when individual investors are optimistic. They

found that discounts shrink at the same time that returns to small-capitalization stocks are

relatively high.

       Pontiff (1995) updated and extended Thompson’s tests and found that the abnormal

returns to closed-end funds are due to mean reversion in the discount, not to unusual returns to

the assets held by the funds. In other words, when the prices of closed-end fund shares depart

too much from their asset values, the difference tends to grow smaller, leading to higher-than-

average returns to these shares.

       Since the anomaly here pertains to the prices of the closed-end fund shares, not to the




                                                 27
underlying investment portfolios, and since closed-end fund shares are predominantly held by

individual investors, this evidence sheds light on the investment performance of some individual

investors.


3.2    Institutional Investors

       Studies of the investment performance of institutional investors date back at least to

Cowles (1933). Cowles concluded that professional money managers did not systematically

outperform a passive index fund strategy (although he did not use the term “index fund”). There

is an extensive literature studying the returns to large samples of open-end mutual funds and,

more recently, to private hedge funds.

Mutual Funds

       Hendricks, Patel, and Zeckhauser (1993) have found short-run persistence in mutual fund

performance, although the strongest evidence is of a “cold-hands” phenomenon whereby poor

performance seems more likely to persist than would be true by random chance.

       Malkiel (1995) studied a database from Lipper that includes all open-end equity funds

that existed in each year of the period 1971-1991. Unlike many mutual fund databases that

retroactively omit funds that go out of business or merge, Malkiel’s data do not suffer from the

survivorship bias stressed by Brown, Goetzmann, Ibbotson, and Ross (1992). Malkiel found that

mutual funds earn gross returns that are consistent with the CAPM in equation (1) and net returns

that are inferior because of the expenses of active management. He also found evidence of

performance persistence for the 1970s, but not for the 1980s.

       Carhart (1997) also used a mutual fund database that is free of survivorship bias and

found that the persistence identified by Hendricks, Patel, and Zeckhauser (1993) is explainable

by the momentum effect for individual stocks described earlier. After taking this into account,




                                               28
the only evidence of persistent performance of open-end funds is that poorly performing

managers have “cold hands.”

Hedge Funds

        The problem of assessing performance for hedge funds is complicated by the unusual

strategies used by many of these funds. Fung and Hsieh (1997) showed that hedge fund returns

are not well characterized as fixed linear combinations of traditional asset classes, similar to the

Fama-French three-factor model. Because of changing leverage, contingent claims, and frequent

changes in investment positions, traditional fund performance measures are of dubious value.

Returns to IPOs

        The large returns available to investors who can purchase stocks in underwritten firm-

commitment initial public offerings (IPOs) at the offering price have been the subject of many

papers, dating at least to Ibbotson (1975). Most of the literature on high average initial returns to

IPOs focuses on the implied underpricing of the IPO stock and the effects on the issuing firm,

but this evidence has equivalent implications for abnormal profits to IPO investors. Several

theories have been developed to explain the systematic underpricing of IPO stocks (see Ritter’s

Chapter 10). Many of these theories point to the difficulty of individual investors in acquiring

the most underpriced of IPOs, which is why I include this discussion in the section under returns

to institutional investors.

        How large are the returns to IPO investing? Fig. 2a shows the cumulative value of a

strategy of investing $1,000 starting in January 1960 in a random sample of IPOs, selling after

one month, and then re-investing in a new set of IPOs in the next month. The returns to IPOs are

from Ibbotson, Ritter, and Sindelar (1994) and are updated on Jay Ritter’s website

[http://bear.cba.ufl.edu/ritter/ipoall.htm].   For comparison, Fig. 2a also shows the value of




                                                  29
investing in the CRSP value-weighted portfolio over the same period. By December 2001, the

CRSP portfolio is worth about $74,000. On the other hand, the IPO portfolio strategy is worth

over $533x1033. Clearly, no one has been able to follow this strategy, or people like Bill Gates

and Warren Buffet would be viewed as rank amateurs in the wealth-creation business!

       What are the impediments to IPO investing as a strategy for earning abnormal returns?

First, it is difficult to be included in the allocations made by the underwriters. Investment banks

usually allocate shares first to large institutional customers (see, e.g., Wall Street Journal,

January 27, 2000). If the institutional customers can distinguish between deals that are more

underpriced and those that are less underpriced, then the shares available to individual investors

are likely to offer lower initial returns. It has also been alleged that in exchange for potential

favors (“spinning”), investment banks allocate shares to preferred individual clients such as

politicians, including House Speaker Thomas Foley (Wall Street Journal, July 20, 1993) and

Senator Alphonse D’Amato, a prominent member of the Senate Banking Committee (Wall Street

Journal, June 6, 1996), or to the executives of private firms that are considering going public in

the near future (see, e.g., Wall Street Journal, November 12, 1997). Thus, a typical individual

investor would have difficulty acquiring shares in the IPOs that are most underpriced.

       Second, many investment banks discourage the practice of buying shares in an IPO and

then selling the shares in the secondary market (“flipping”). Forcing IPO investors to hold

shares for more than a month, for example, would increase the risk and costs of pursuing the IPO

strategy outlined above (although it would still seem extremely profitable). To the extent that

underwriters sometimes provide informal price support in the after-market by buying shares at a

price close to the IPO price, it is clear why they would want to discourage flipping when initial

returns are negative. On the other hand, when the after-market price rises dramatically and




                                                30
volume is high, flipping is beneficial to the underwriter by increasing market-maker profits. It is

necessary for some investors who purchased shares in the IPO to sell their shares to create a

public float and therefore liquidity. Indeed, there has been recent acknowledgement that flipping

is useful in helping to create liquidity (see, e.g., Wall Street Journal, February 2, 2000).

        Another unusual feature of IPO returns is their apparent persistence, shown in Fig. 2b.

While average IPO returns are positive in almost every month from 1960 to 2001, there seem to

be very noticeable cycles in these returns, with high returns following high returns and vice

versa. According to Lowry and Schwert (2002), these cycles are explained by two important

factors. First, the types of firms that go public tend to be clustered in time, so that cross-

sectional differences in IPO returns that may be due to information asymmetry, for example,

show up in average returns across IPOs. Second, the learning that occurs during the registration

period (as underwriters talk to potential investors) affects IPO prices and subsequent returns for

the similar-type firms that are in the IPO process at the same time, and this process usually lasts

more than one month. Lowry and Schwert argue that firms cannot use the persistence in IPO

returns shown in Fig. 2b to optimally time their IPOs (trying to minimize initial returns). By

analogy, investors cannot time their participation in the IPO market (trying to maximize their

returns).

        Thus, while IPOs seem to offer large abnormal returns to investors who can obtain shares

in the IPO allocation, it is not clear that this is an anomaly that can benefit most investors.

3.3     Limits to Arbitrage

        It has long been recognized that transactions costs can limit the ability of traders to profit

from mispricing (e.g., Jensen (1978)). The question of how market frictions affect asset prices

and allow apparent anomalies to persist has received increasing attention in recent years.

        Shleifer and Vishny (1997) have argued that agency problems associated with

professional money managers, along with transactions costs, can cause mispricing to persist and

that many anomalies are a result of such market frictions. Pontiff (1996) has shown that the

absolute value of closed-end fund discounts and premiums are correlated with various measures

of the costs of trying to arbitrage mispricing, including the composition of the funds’ portfolios

and the level of interest rates.

        Table 7 lists nine papers that will appear in a special issue of the Journal of Financial

Economics, all of which study the effects on asset prices of various kinds of frictions. Several of

these papers contain evidence similar to Pontiff’s in that the extent of apparent pricing anomalies

is correlated with the size of transactions costs.

4      Long-Run Returns
       DeBondt and Thaler (1985) tracked the returns to “winner” and “loser” portfolios for 36

months after portfolio formation and noted a slow drift upward in the cumulative abnormal

returns (CARs) of loser stocks that had performed poorly in the recent past. They interpret this

result as evidence of excessive pessimism following poor performance, making the stocks of

loser firms profitable investments.

       Ball, Kothari, and Shanken (1995) have argued that poor stock return performance will

generally lead to higher leverage, because the value of the stock drops more than the value of the

firm’s debt. The increase in leverage should lead to higher risk and higher expected returns than

would be reflected in risk estimates from a period before the drop in stock price. They have also

pointed out that many of the stocks earning the highest returns have very low prices, so that

microstructure effects, such as a large proportional bid-ask spread, can reduce subsequent

performance by large amounts.

Returns to Firms Issuing Equity

       Using both CARs and buy-and-hold abnormal returns (BHARs), Ritter (1991) measured

post-IPO stock performance and concluded that IPO stocks yield below-normal returns in the 36

months following the IPO. He interpreted this result as evidence that investors become too

optimistic about IPO firms, inflating the initial IPO return (from the IPO price to the secondary

market trading price), and lowering subsequent returns. Loughran and Ritter (1995) extended

Ritter’s analysis using a sample of IPOs from 1970-1990.

       Brav and Gompers (1997) and Brav, Geczy, and Gompers (2000) have studied the returns

to IPO firms for the period 1975-1992 and found that underperformance is concentrated

primarily in small firms with low book-to-market ratios. They argue that this is the same




                                                35
behavior as seen by Fama and French (1993) in their tests of their three-factor model and that the

IPO anomaly is thus a manifestation of a general problem in pricing small firms with low book-

to-market ratios. Brav, Geczy, and Gompers (2000) also studied seasoned equity offerings

(SEOs) and found that momentum, in addition to the Fama-French three-factor model, helps

explain the behavior of returns after SEOs. Eckbo, Masulis, and Norli (2000) have shown that

the reduction in leverage that occurs when new equity is issued reduces subsequent equity risk

exposure and thus contributes to the apparent unusual behavior of returns following SEOs.

       Schultz (2001) used simulations to study the behavior of abnormal return measures after

events that are triggered by prior stock price performance. For example, if a firm chooses to

issue stock after its price has risen in the recent past, even if the stock price is fully rational,

many of the popular measures of long-run abnormal returns will falsely reveal subsequent poor

performance (he refers to this as ‘pseudo-market timing’). The driving force behind his result is

that the covariance between current excess returns and the number of future offerings is positive.

       Many papers have analyzed long-run stock returns following a variety of events and a

large number of papers have also analyzed the properties of these long-run stock return tests and

alternative hypotheses to explain these types of results.

       Fama (1998) has argued that the problem of measuring normal returns is particularly

important when measuring long-run returns, because model problems that may be small in a day

or a month can be compounded into larger apparent effects over three or five years. He has also

argued that most papers that attribute apparent abnormal stock returns to behavioral effects are

not testing a specific alternative model. Recent papers by Barberis, Shleifer, and Vishny (1998),

Daniel, Hirshleifer, and Subrahmanyam (1998, 2001), and Barberis and Shleifer (2002) are

examples of models that make predictions for short- and long-run stock returns from irrational




                                                 36
investor behavior. At this point, however, it is unclear whether these models have refutable

predictions that differ from tests that have already been performed.

       Several papers have studied the statistical properties of long-run CARs and BHARs,

including Barber and Lyon (1997), Kothari and Warner (1997), and Mitchell and Stafford

(2000). All of these papers conclude that it is difficult to found long-run abnormal return

measures that have well-specified statistical properties and reasonable power. Mitchell and

Stafford (2000) argue that the calendar-time regression approach originally used by Jaffe (1974)

and Mandelker (1974), and advocated by Fama (1998), provides more reliable inferences than

long-run CARs or BHARs.

Returns to Bidder Firms

       The returns to bidder firms’ stocks provide another example of potentially anomalous

post-event behavior. Since at least Asquith (1983), researchers have noted that there is a

pronounced downward drift in the cumulative abnormal returns to the stocks of firms that are

bidders in mergers. One interpretation of this evidence is that bidders overpay and that it takes

the market some time to gradually learn about this mistake.

       Schwert (1996) analyzed the returns to 790 NYSE and Amex-listed bidders for the period

1975-1991 and found a negative drift of about 7% in the year following the announcement of the

bid. He concluded, however, that the explanation for this drift is the unusually good stock return

performance of the bidder firms in the period prior to the bid.             To measure abnormal

performance, he used a market model regression,

                               Rit = αi + βi Rmt + εit,                                          (5)

where Rit is the return to the bidder firm and Rmt is the return to the CRSP value-weighted

portfolio in period t, based on 253 daily returns in the year before the event analysis (which starts



                                                  37
six months before the first bid is announced). Using the estimates of αi and βi, abnormal returns

are estimated, averaged, and cumulated for the period from 127 trading days before the bid

announcement to 253 trading days after the bid announcement,

                                εik = Rik - αi - βi Rmk

                                ARk =    Σ     εik
                                         i=1

                                CARJ =       Σ       ARk .                                      (6)
                                         k=-127



        The dashed line in Fig. 3 represents the CAR to the bidder firms in (6). It drifts

downward after the first bid announcement to about –8% a year afterwards. The solid line in

Fig. 3 represents a simple adjustment to the calculation of abnormal returns to bidders’ stocks:

the intercept αi is set equal to zero. This adjusted cumulative abnormal return does not have a

noticeable drift in Fig. 3, which is consistent with the efficient markets hypothesis.

        The adjustment eliminates the negative drift in abnormal returns because the estimated

intercepts in the market model are systematically positive for bidder stocks in the year and a half

before the bid, reflecting the fact that bidder firms are more likely to have recently experienced

good performance, at least in terms of their stock prices. This abnormally good performance

vanishes after the first bid (as it should in an efficient market).

Fig. 3. Cumulative average abnormal returns to bidder firms' stocks from trading day -126 to
+253 relative to the first bid for NYSE- and AMEX-listed target firms for the period 1975-1991.
Market model parameters used to define abnormal returns are estimated using the CRSP value-
weighted portfolio for days -379 to -127. The solid line shows the effect of setting the intercepts
to zero, since the bidder firms seem to have abnormally high stock returns during the estimation
period (shown by the dotted line that drifts downward from day -126 to day +253). There are
790 NYSE- or Amex-listed bidder firms that made the first bid for exchange-listed target firms
in this period.




                                                                                                39
          Note that this does not mean that the bid somehow caused something bad to happen to the

bidder firm; it simply means that bidders’ stock returns were normal in the period following the

announcement of the bid. The unusually positive performance of bidders’ stocks before the bid

is an example of sample selection bias: the decisions of bidder firms to pursue acquisitions is

correlated with their past stock price performance.

          It is important to note that it is not necessary to adjust the CAR for the sample of target

firms. The CAR for target firms rises gradually before the first bid announcement, reflecting bid

anticipation, and jumps on the day of the announcement. After that, it remains flat for the next

year. In contrast with the bidder firms, the target firms’ intercepts from the estimated market

models are not unusually large, reflecting neither positive nor negative stock price performance

in the year and half before they become targets.

          Mitchell and Stafford (2000) used the calendar-time portfolio method suggested by Fama

(1998) to measure abnormal returns to acquiring firms. They concluded that an equal-weighted

portfolio of acquirers seems to earn negative abnormal returns over a three-year window

following an acquisition, but that a value-weighted portfolio does not, using the Fama-French

three-factor model in (2) as a benchmark. This method of measuring the size and significance of

abnormal returns is not affected by unusual prior performance in the same way as the CARs in

Fig. 3.

          Loughran and Vijh (1997) compared buy-and-hold returns to bidders’ stocks measured

five years after acquisitions with returns to control firms that are matched on size and book-to-

market characteristics. They found that stock mergers are followed by negative excess returns

and cash tender offers are followed by positive excess returns. Since the choice of payment by

the bidder is similar to a choice concerning equity financing, the sample selection issues raised




                                                   40
by Schultz (2001) might affect the Loughran and Vijh (1997) results.




5      Implications for Asset Pricing

       Consistent with Fama’s observation (1970, 1976, 1998) that tests of market efficiency are

necessarily joint tests of a model of expected returns, evidence of anomalies is also potentially

evidence of a short-coming in the implied asset-pricing model used for the test. One example of

this phenomenon that has created much activity in the finance literature in recent years is the

Fama and French (1993) three-factor model, which incorporates the size and book-to-market

anomalies into the asset-pricing model.

The Search for Risk Factors

       An obvious question that arises from empirically motivated adjustments of asset-pricing

models is whether the new, extended model accurately describes equilibrium behavior, or is just

a convenient offshoot of the anomalous findings that motivated the extension. For example, the

simple two-parameter CAPM of Sharpe (1964) and Lintner (1965) was motivated by portfolio

theory. Many people have developed extensions of theoretical asset-pricing models that include

multiple factors (see, for example, Chapters 14 (Ross), 15 (Duffie), and 16 (Ferson)), although

none of these models match closely with the empirical Fama-French model.

       On the other hand, as Fama and French (1993) have pointed out, some versions of

multifactor models are vague about the risk factors that might lead to differences in expected

returns across assets, so that their empirical proxies (size and book-to-market) may be reflecting

equilibrium trade-offs between risk and expected return. The Fama and French (1993, 1996)

tests are consistent with their three-factor model being an adequate asset-pricing model, in the

sense that the intercepts in their regression tests (measuring average abnormal returns to different




                                                 41
portfolio strategies) are not reliably different from zero.11

         There is at least one other issue that must be addressed, however, before concluding that

the three-factor model is an accurate equilibrium-pricing model. As noted by MacKinlay (1995),

the estimates of factor risk premiums from the Fama-French model seem very high, particularly

for the book-to-market factor. In some ways, this is analogous to the “equity premium puzzle”

that has been frequently discussed in the macro-finance literature (see Campbell’s Chapter 19).

If the estimates of risk premiums are too high (or too low) to be consistent with the underlying

economic theory that motivates the model, the fact that average returns are linearly related to the

risk factors is not sufficient to conclude that the market is efficient. If the book-to-market

premium is too high, as argued by MacKinlay, then returns vary too much with this risk factor.

From this perspective, the evidence that the three-factor model provides a good linear model of

risk and return may be just a fortuitous description of an anomaly.

Conditional Asset Pricing

         The evidence on time-varying expected returns has obvious implications for the growing

literature on conditional asset-pricing models.             On the other hand, the poor out-of-sample

performance of some of the predictor variables raises questions about their role in asset prices.

Excess Volatility

         I have not addressed the question raised by Shiller (1981a,b) of whether stock market

volatility is “too high.” His provocative papers on “excess volatility” stimulated many rebuttals,

including Kleidon (1986) and Marsh and Merton (1986), that raised questions about the validity

and robustness of his statistical methods. While I have written many papers on the behavior of

    11
       An exception is that the Fama-French (1993) portfolio of the smallest firms with the lowest book-to-market
ratios has a reliably negative intercept. Also, as mentioned above, the Fama-French model does not seem to explain
the momentum evidence.




                                                       42
stock volatility, some of which raise questions about why volatility varies over time as much as it

does (e.g., Schwert (1989)), I do not believe that this literature is closely linked with the

literature on anomalies and market efficiency. In my 1991 review of Shiller (1989), I argue that

Shiller’s research on excess volatility is really a test of a particular valuation model and provides

no guidance on how to identify or profit from mispricing.

The Role of Behavioral Finance

         Finally, there is the issue of whether the findings in the anomalies literature can be

combined with behavioral theories from the psychology literature to create new asset-pricing

theories that combine economic equilibrium concepts with psychological concepts to create an

improved asset-pricing model (see Chapter 18 by Barberis and Thaler). My impression, to date,

is that the attempts to proceed in this direction have produced models that might explain some of

the existing anomalies, but they make no predictions for observable behavior that have not

already been tested extensively.12 In other words, the new behavioral theories have not yet made

predictions that are refutable with new tests. Going beyond the stage of building theories to

explain the “stylized facts” that already exist will be a significant challenge.




6        Implications for Corporate Finance

         What implications do market efficiency and anomalies have for corporate finance? The

standard textbook treatment of corporate finance in an efficient market (for example, Brealey and

Myers (2000)) tells firms to choose projects that maximize value, and perhaps choose capital

structures or dividend policies that create value, but to take the market prices of their stocks and

bonds as given and more or less correct.
    12
      Fama (1998) is less sympathetic to the ability of these new models to explain existing anomalies.




                                                         43
Firm Size and Liquidity

         How would the kinds of anomalies discussed above change this advice, if at all? To the

extent that the small-firm effect is real, firms that merge and become larger would have a lower

cost of capital, and therefore a higher value. But this kind of financial synergy is hard to believe.

In fact, it raises the question of whether firm size somehow proxies for a more fundamental

source of risk or value.

         Amihud and Mendelson (1986) have argued that firm size proxies for the illiquidity of

the stock and that higher transactions costs for small firms raise the required gross return so that

net expected returns are equalized, given the risk of the stock. In their empirical work, they

found that the cross-sectional dispersion in average returns across portfolios of NYSE stocks

sorted on bid-ask spreads is similar to the dispersion in average returns across portfolios sorted

on risk estimates.       From this perspective, size is not a risk factor, but rather a proxy for

differential transactions costs.13 Thus, actions that increase the liquidity of a firm’s stock would

reduce required returns and increase the stock price if such actions were costless. Decisions on

whether the firm should undertake policies that increase liquidity depend on whether the benefits

exceed the costs.         There has been much recent work on the linkages between market

microstructure, asset pricing, and corporate finance (see Chapter 21 by Easley and O’Hara).

Book-to-Market Effects

         Fama and French interpret the book-to-market ratio as an indicator of “value” versus

“growth” stocks, and the HML risk factor as reflecting “distress risk.” In their tests, firms with

high book-to-market ratios or risk sensitivities are often firms whose value has fallen recently


    13
       The apparent disappearance of the size effect discussed in 2.1, if true, would be problematic for the liquidity
effect unless small-capitalization stocks have relatively low transaction costs in recent years.




                                                         44
because of bad performance. These firms are more likely to suffer financial distress costs in

future periods if further bad news hits.

       To the extent that Fama and French (1993) are correct that SMB and HML reflect priced

risk factors, then reducing a firm’s exposure to these types of risk would lower the expected

return on its stock, and therefore, its cost of capital. Such a change would not increase the value

of the firm, however, so there is no obvious prescription for managerial behavior.

       If Daniel and Titman (1997) are correct that firms with lower book-to-market ratios have

lower expected returns, holding risk constant, then corporate financial policies designed to lower

B/M would improve firm value by lowering the cost of capital. Of course, holding book value

constant, this is equivalent to increasing the market value of the stock, which is generally good

for shareholders (and not a new insight).

       In the corporate finance literature, the book-to-market ratio has been interpreted as a

measure of the type of investment opportunities that are available to the firm. For example,

Smith and Watts (1992) have interpreted high book-to-market firms as those with “assets-in-

place” and low book-to-market firms as those with relatively more “growth options.” From this

perspective, the fact that accounting book values make no attempt to measure the value of

growth options drives the cross-sectional dispersion in book-to-market ratios. Interpreted this

way, the book-to-market ratio is exogenous and reflects the investment opportunity set facing the

firm. It would not make sense, for example, to advise firms to sell assets in place and invest in

growth options just to lower book-to-market and, from the perspective of Daniel and Titman, to

lower the cost of capital.

       There has also been a substantial literature using Tobin’s Q-ratio (a close relative of

book-to-market) as a proxy for the efficiency with which managers use corporate assets. Dating




                                                45
back at least to Mørck, Shleifer, and Vishny (1988), high book-to-market ratios have been

interpreted as indicating poor performance and possibly the existence of agency problems

between stockholders and managers.

       The fact that the same empirical proxy has been used in three quite different ways raises

serious questions about interpreting any of this evidence in a normative way to give firms or

managers advice about corporate financial policy.

Slow Reaction to Corporate Financial Policy

       Much of the literature studying long-horizon returns focuses on corporate financial policy

decisions such as IPOs, seasoned equity offerings, share repurchases, merger bids, and so forth.

A common theme in this literature is that there is a slow drift in the stock price of the firm after

the event, apparently reflecting a gradual process of learning the good or bad news associated

with the event. A slow reaction is inconsistent with the efficient markets hypothesis.

       As mentioned above, the papers that have systematically studied the behavior of long-

horizon performance measures found that they have low power and unreliable statistical

properties in most situations. Even if one were to accept the premise that the market learns very

slowly about the implications of changes in corporate financial policy, the uncertainty associated

with the future price performance for an individual firm over a period of one to five years is so

great that it would be senseless to advise that firms choose their financial policies so as to take

advantage of market mispricing that is only corrected after five years.




7      Conclusions

       This chapter highlights some interesting findings that have emerged from empirical

research on the behavior of asset prices and discusses the implications of these findings for the




                                                 46
way academics and practitioners use financial theory. In the process, I have replicated and

extended some puzzling findings that have been called anomalies because they do not conform

with the predictions of accepted models of asset pricing.

       One of the interesting findings from the empirical work in this chapter is that many of the

well-known anomalies in the finance literature do not hold up in different sample periods. In

particular, the size effect and the value effect seem to have disappeared after the papers that

highlighted them were published.       At about the same time, practitioners began investment

vehicles that implemented the strategies implied by the academic papers.

       The weekend effect and the dividend yield effect also seem to have lost their predictive

power after the papers that made them famous were published. In these cases, however, I am not

aware of any practitioners who have tried to use these anomalies as a major basis of their

investment strategy.

       The small-firm turn-of-the-year effect became weaker in the years after it was first

documented in the academic literature, although there is some evidence that it still exists.

Interestingly, however, it does not seem to exist in the portfolio returns of practitioners who

focus on small-capitalization firms.

       Likewise, the evidence that stock market returns are predictable using variables such as

dividend yields or inflation is much weaker in the periods after the papers that documented these

findings were published.

       All of these findings raise the possibility that anomalies are more apparent than real. The

notoriety associated with the findings of unusual evidence tempts authors to further investigate

puzzling anomalies and later to try to explain them. But even if the anomalies existed in the

sample period in which they were first identified, the activities of practitioners who implement




                                                47
strategies to take advantage of anomalous behavior can cause the anomalies to disappear (as

research findings cause the market to become more efficient).
