                    Social Security and the Decision to Retire



                                     ABSTRACT



      This study examines empirically whether social security influences

 the retirement decisions of individuals. The framework for this study is

 the life—cycle model of individual behavior. The life—cycle model shows

that there are two main ways in which social security can affect behavior.

One way is through the change in an individual's lifetime income that social

security can bring about. The other way has to do with how the system

changes compensation for work. Social security's income and substitution

effects are included in a model for examining retirement decisions. This

model is based on the model of labor force participation that has become

standard in the literature on labor supply. The data used in this study

come from the Social Security Administration and are particularly well

suited for this study. Retirement models are estimated separately for

samples of 62—64 and 65—70 year old men. The empirical results support the

conclusion that social security influences the decision to retire. The

magnitude of behavioral responses to changes in social security benefits

are reported and implications for future behavior are discussed.

     I.    Introduction
           Social   security is the major source   of   income support for
    retirement      in   the U.S.; the program paid benefits of approximately 105

    billion in 1980.1 There are two broad views on how people are affected

    by social security. One view emphasizes that people retire because of

    poor health or because they are otherwise forced out of their jobs and

    that social security benefits compensate in part for the concomitant

    reduction in earnings. This view stresses the insurance aspect of

    social security with the implication that social security has little or

    no effect on when people retire.2 Another view based on economic models

    of labor supply allows for a potential effect of social security on

    retirement. This economic view has received considerable theoretical3

and empirical4 attention in recent years. Determining whether social

security influences individual behavior, especially retirement, is

important. Such information can be used to structure the system so that

 it does not distort individual behavior and is financially sound. The

purpose of this paper is to examine empirically whether social security

influences the retirement decisions of individuals.


     Social security can affect both an individual's decision to retire

and, if he does not retire fully, his decision on how much to work.

Based on these two dimensions of social security's effect on the labor

supply, my empirical study of retirement has been divided into two

parts. This paper presents the first part which focuses on the

retirement decision and the influence that social security benefits can

have upon this decision. A companion paper (Pellechio, l981b) presents

the second part of my study which examines how much retirement-aged

individuals work when they do not retire fully. In this second part the

social security earnings test, a regulation that reduces an individual's

benefit payment when his earnings exceed a certain amount, enters the

analysis. The econometric problems posed by the earnings test require a

methodology for estimating labor supply over kinked budget constraints;

this methodology has been developed in Pellechio (1979b). The

examination of the separate effects of social security benefits and the

earnings test on retirement is an important feature of this two-part

study.


     The framework for the empirical study here is the life-cycle model

of individual behavior. The empirical specification of the model allows

for testing whether the life-cycle model is a valid description of

behavior. The way in which social security enters the model is

presented in Section II. Briefly, what this section shows is that there




                                -2-
  are two main ways in which social security can affect behavior. One way

  is through the change in an individual's lifetime income that the system

  can bring about. Several studiesS have shown that the total amount an

  individual can expect to receive from social security does not

 necessarily equal what that individual paid into the system. In

 somewhat more precise terms, the present value of the benefits that an

 individual can expect to receive during retirement does not necessarily

 equal the present value of payroll taxes paid during his working career.

 Any difference between these two present values represents a change in

 lifetime income that has a potential income effect on economic behavior

 in general and retirement in particular.


      The other way in which social security can affect retirement is by

 changing compensation for work. This can happen because benefits are

based on earnings and will in general change in value in response to

continued employment, i.e. delayed retirement.   Any change in the value
of benefits from delayed retirement becomes part of the compensation for

work just like the money wages paid at the time of employment.

Excellent discussions of this incentive to delay retirement in order to

receive larger benefits in the future are given by Blinder, Gordon, and

liise (1980) and Bulow (1981). This study represents, in part, an

attempt to measure responses to this incentive empirically. The main

point is that by changing the compensation for work social security has

potential substitution effects on how much people work. Social

security's income and substitution effects are discussed in more detail

in Section II.


     The model used for examining retirement decisions is based on the

model of labor force participation that has become standard in the

literature on labor supply. This model uses two equations, one for the

market wage that an individual faces and another for the individual's

value of time or shadow price. The market wage equation is expanded to

include variables that measure social security's effect on an

individual's compensation for work. Social security variables that

influence an individual's shadow price are added to the shadow price

equation. The final alteration that converts the standard labor force

participation model into a retirement model is to define

nonparticipation according to a suitable definition of retirement. The

definition adopted here in effect implements the definition of

retirement that is implicit, in the rules for receiving full social

security benefits. With this definition the effect of these benefits on

retirement can be examined independently of the earnings test. A

description of the retirement model and techniques for identifying and

estimating parameters are given in Section III.


     The data used in this study come from the Social Security

Administration. An important feature of the data is that it is possible

to calculate accurately the social security benefit that an individual

is entitled to receive. In other words, an individual's potential

benefit is known even when no benefit payment is made. This benefit is

used to construct the social security variables presented in Section II.

Details on the empirical specification of the model are given in

Section IV.

            Estimated retirement models for samples of retirement-aged men are

     given in Section V. The empirical results support the conclusion that

     social security affects the decision to retire. There are significant

    responses to the system's income and substitution effects and the

    magnitudes of these responses are presented and discussed. The results

    of this study and their implications for future behavior are summarized

    in Section VI.




    II.    The Life-Cycle Model and Social Security




           The potential effects of social security on retirement will be

    discussed using the model of life-cycle behavior.6 In the absence of

social security an individual chooses a path of lifetime consumption and

labor supply by maximizing lifetime utility subject to the following

Constraint:


            T            R-l
(1)         E cD =        Z    wiD
           t=l           t=l

     Two excellent theoretical models of life-cycle behavior are given by
     Blinder and Weiss (1976), and Heckman (1976). Versions of the life-
     cycle model that add social security in a way similar to what is done
     here are given by Feldstein (1976b), Samuelson(1975), Kotlikoff
     (1979), and Ru (1979).

           R = year   of retirement

               discount factor from year t to whatever year


               defines present value

This simply says that the present value of total lifetime consumption

expenditures must equal the present value of total lifetime earnings.


      The adjustment to equation (1) for social security entails reducing

an individual's earnings during his working career by the payroll taxes

he pays and    increasing     his income during retirement by the benefits he

receives. The lifetime budget constraint becomes:

       T                R-l                        T
(2)     E cD =                  (l_p)wltD     +
                                                        BtDt
      t=l               t=l                       t=R


where Pt       payroll tax rate in year t


        Bt =   social   security retirement benefit payments in


               year t


      The first term on the right-hand side of equation (2) can be

separated into two components as follows:




                                        -6-
                         R- 1
              PVE    =              w1D
     (3a)                 E               =   present value of earnings
                         t=l

                              R-l
     (3b)     PVTAX =          Z     p wtltDt =    present   value of payroll taxes
                              t=l




            The second term on the right-hand side of
                                                      equation (2) equals the
    actuarial present value of the social security benefits to which an

    individual is entitled as a retired worker; the survival probabilities

    that make it an actuarial calculation are included in the Dt's

    This    present value of benefits is          called "social security wealth" and is
    denoted SSW.7 If SSW equals PVTAX then
                                              equation (2) is the same as
    equation    (1) which means that social security does not change lifetime
    income.     However, as was       pointed out before (see n. 5),     SSW does not

    necessarily equal PVTAX. When SSW exceeds PVTAX social security has

    raised an individual's lifetime income. The life-cycle model predicts a

potential decrease in labor supply on the usual assumption that leisure

is a normal good. This decrease could occur as a reduction in labor

supply              in the years in which a person works or a reduction in

     Whether social security can affect behavior is a
                                                      question with diverse
    answers. Crawford and Lilien (1981) show in a theoretical model how
    behavior can be affected by social security even when it does not
    change lifetime income, i.e. when it is actuarially fair. In another
    theoretical model with perfect capital markets and fixed labor supply
    Barro (1974) shows that social security has no economic effects even
    if it is not actuarially fair.

the number of years of work (R-l). Of course, if SSW is less than PVTAX

 labor supply may be affected in the opposite way, i.e. individuals may

work more per year or increase their number of years of work. The

overall point is that SSW - PVTAX measures the change in lifetime income

produced by social security and this change has a potential income

effect on retirement.9


        Another effect of social security comes from the influence that an

additional year of earnings can have on an individual's present and

future benefit payments. The influence on present benefit payments

arises because an individual foregoes current benefits when he decides

not to retire. The effect on future benefits arises from the fact that

earnings are used to calculate benefits. To see these effects consider

the change in the budget constraint when a person works rather than

retires in year R:'°




     Barro's (1974) theory of life-cycle behavior with bequests implies
     that there is no lifetime income effect. Intergenerational transfers
     would cancel any change in an individual's lifetime income that social
     security might try to impose. However, Barro's argument rests on his
     assumption that labor supply is fixed. This paper examines whether
     labor supply responds to changes in the lifetime budget constraint
     produced by social security. Information on bequests is needed along
     with the data used here (see Section IV) to examine Barro's theory.
     The results here do not refute Barro's model but do stand in
     juxtaposition to his assumption of fixed labor supply.

    where BR = foregone benefits in year R


             B = the   benefit obtained in year t by adding earnings

                 in year R to the benefit calculation


          The term (lpR)wR1R denotes the individual's net

 earnings from working in year R. The last two terms in equation (4)

 represent the two ways in which social security can affect the

compensation from work. One way has to do with the fact that benefits

are foregone in year R by working. The BR term represents this

loss in current benefits. This loss reduces the compensation from work

and as such raises the likelihood of retirement.


          The second way in which social security can affect compensation for

work is through the influence that earnings can have on future benefits.

Excellent discussions of this point are given by Blinder, Gordon, and

Wise (1980) and Bulow (1981). The issue arises because an average of an

individual's earnings is used to calculate benefits.11 Earnings in the

current year tend to increase this average because they are likely to be




'    The calculation of benefits begins by calculating the
                                                           average of an
     individual's annual earnings from age 22 through the year before
     retirement. Only earnings up to a maximum amount in each year are
     used. In 1972, the year of this study, the social security system
     computed the simple average of actual earnings after dropping the
     five years of lowest earnings, i.e. no adjustment was made for
     different wage or price levels in different years. This simple
     average is the base for calculating benefits; in other words, a
     benefit formula is applied to this average to yield a benefit amount.

                                        -9-
higher in nominal terms, if not in real terms, than past earnings. An

earnings-induced increase in future benefits is denoted by

           in the last term of equation (4). The present
Bt -   B
value of any increase in future benefits constitutes additional

compensation for work and this additional compensation makes retirement

less attractive and therefore less likely. This present value is given

by the last term in equation (4) and will be denoted DSSW.


       Both the influence of foregone current benefits and increased

future benefits come under the heading of a substitution effect in the

sense that they change the compensation for work and as such can change

how much people work. Compensation for work is decreased by the loss in

current benefits, _BR, and increased by any gain in the value of

future benefits, DSSW. Thus, the main point of equation (4) is that

social security has two potential substitution effects that work in

opposite directions. The variables needed to estimate these

substitution effects as well as the income effect discussed in this

section are included in the retirement model constructed in the next

section.




III.   The Retirement Model

       The labor force participation model developed in the labor supply

literature'2 is used to construct an econometric model for examining

retirement behavior. The model uses equations that describe an

     Gronau (1973, 1977); Hall (1975); Hanoch (1976); Heckman (1974).
                                     10 -
 individual's total compensation for work and his value of time in

 nonmarket activities or shadow price. Let an individual's market wage,

 w, be given by the following equation:


 (5)   w = X     + e1



 where X is a set of variables measuring wage,    is the vector of

 coefficients for X, and e. is an error term.
                             1



       As discussed in Section II, a person's compensation for work equals

his market wage and any earnings-induced change in the value of current

or future benefits. A loss of current benefits, denoted BR as


before,- reduces compensation and a gain in the value of future benefits,

denoted DSSW, raises compensation. An individual's compensation for

work, denoted v, is therefore given as follows:


       v =
              clBR + c2DSSW + w
(6)



          =          + c2DSSW + X +
              c1BR                    e1




The coefficients of BR and DSSW should ideally equal -].   and   1


respectively. However, they are left open to empirical estimation and

given as c1 and c2 in equation (6); c1 is expected to be

negative and c2 positive.




                                      —   1]. —
      The decision to retire also depends on the value of an individual's

 time in activities other than working in the labor market, i.e. his

opportunity cost or shadow price. The lifetime income effect discussed

 in Section II arises because a change in lifetime income has a potential

effect on an individual's shadow price. For example, an increase in

 lifetime income makes it possible to spend more time outside the labor

market and therefore raises an individual's shadow price. As shown in

Section II, the change in lifetime income produced by social security is

given by the difference between social security wealth and the present

value of payroll taxes. The number of hours an individual spends

working also affects his shadow price. The more an individual woiks the

more valuable leisure time is to him. So, as hours of work go up so

does shadow price. The equation for shadow price, denoted s, is given

as follows:


(7)   S   = b1SSW   +
                        b2PVTAX
                                  +
                                      b3h
                                                +    'f       +
                                                                  e2


where SSW and PVTAX denote social security wealth and the present value

of payroll taxes as defined in equations (2) and (3b) of Section II, h

equals hours of work, Y is a set of additional variables that influence

shadow price,    is the vector of coefficients for Y, and e2 is an

error term.


      A strict interpretation of the life-cycle model implies that an

individual responds to the change in lifetime income brought about by

social security; Section II showed this change to be SSW - PVTAX.      A

consequence of this is that the coefficients of SSW and PVTAX should be


                                            -       12    -
 equal in magnitude and opposite in sign. These coefficients will be

 estimated freely. Examining whether b2 =
                                          -b1 serves as a test
 of the life-cycle model.


      The definition of retirement used in this study says that a person

 is retired when his earnings are low enough so that there is no

 reduction in his social security retirement benefit payment due to the

 earnings test. In other words his earnings are below the amount at

      Let   DR be a binary variable that indicates whether a person is

retired (DR=l) or not (DR=O). The probability of retirement, P(DR1),

equals the probability that equation (9) holds which depends on the

distributions of
                      e1 and e2. Let e1 and e2                  be

Letting F denote the standard normal distribution function, the

retirement probability becomes:

         P(DR=l) =         1 -            +            -           -             -   b_K

                                    + Xrz -   Y)/a]
The argument of F will be called the "retirement index" and denoted J.



        Estimates of c1, c2, b1, b2, b3, a, and                up

to a scale factor a can be obtained from a probit analysis of DR. This

is done by dividing a sample of individuals into the subsamples of those

who are retired, (DR1), and those who are not, DRO}, and maximizing

the likelihood of observing this behavior in the sample. The likelihood

function following from equation (10) that is maximized is:


(11)     L =          II     [1 -   F(J.)]             U      F(J.)
                                       1                         1
                ie{DR=l}                           ic{DR=0}

where    J. =   the   value of the retirement index using individual's

                values for the variables.

In this way maximum likelihood estimates of c1/ø, c2/C,


b1/a, b2/a, b3/a, a/a, and /a are obtained.


       It is important to point out that the above retirement model is

valid even in the presence of the social security earnings test. The

effect of the earnings test on the individual budget constraint is

illustrated in Figure 1. The social security benefit that an individual

could receive in retirement is represented by the vertical distance AB.

The variable BR in the model is measured by this distance. As

Figure 1 shows, the budget constraint is divided into three segments by

the earnings test. On the first segment, points B to C, a person can

receive his full retirement benefit and earn income up to the exempt

amount without losing benefits. Along the second segment, points C to

D, benefit payments are reduced by $.50 for every $1.00 of earnings

above the exempt amount. This effectively reduces a person's wage by 50

percent and, as the figure shows, the slope of the budget constraint

drops in magnitude. Once benefit payments are reduced to zero at point

D a person goes back to receiving his full wage above this point. Due

to this increase in wage from 50 percent to its full amount, the budget

constraint is nonconvex around point ID.        The overall effect of the

earnings test on the individual budget constraint is to make it kinked

and nonconvex.


     The crucial feature of the earnings-tested budget constraint for

the analysis here is that the extension of its initial segment BC, given

by the dashed line CF in Figure 1, lies above the rest of the

constraint. In this situation when an individual's shadow price at

point C is greater than   his   compensation for work there is no chance of

the reverse happening above point C.       In other words, equation (9) is a

necessary and sufficient condition for retirement. This would not be

the case if the budget constraint, because of a nonconvexity, did lie

above CF at some point. It would then be possible both for equation (9)

to hold indicating a decision to retire and for an individual's shadow

price to be less than or equal to the slope of a portion of the budget

constraint above CF which indicates awillingness to work above point C,




                                     -   16 -
   i.e. a decision not to retire.
                                        However, this problem does not arise
  with the earnings-tested
                             budget constraint as illustrated in
                                                                       Figure 1,
  and equation (9) remains a complete description of retirement.'3


       It is important to point out that the slope of the budget

  constraint equals the individual's
                                          compensation for work and not his
  wage alone. As such it includes the value
                                                     of any earnings-induced
 increase in the value of future benefits. This additional
                                                            compensation
 could result in the budget
                            constraint lying above its initial segment.
 Blinder, Gordon, and Wise (1980) focus attention on this additional

 compensation and how it affects the
                                           budget constraint. They find that
 in some cases this additional
                                  compensation approximately cancels the
 implicit tax rate of 50 percent in the
                                                earnings test. A cancellation of
 the earnings test would not
                                affect the analysis here; it would just
 imply that point C is not a
                               very important point to focus attention on
 and that K is not an important
                                  variable. The important question that
Blinder, Gordon, and Wise raise is whether individuals understand
                                                                  or
perceive this additional compensation
                                               and change their retirement
behavior in response to it. This
                                        additional compensation was presented
as the variable DSSW in Section II and is included in the retirement

model that is estimated here.
                                  Given the data used in this study DSSW
can be accurately calculated.
                                  By including DSSW in the empirical
specification of the retirement model I attempted to find out whether




13 Because
           the budget constraint has the above.mentioned feature the
  effect of the earnings test at point C and above can be excluded from
  the analysis here. This feature provides the technical justification
  for the division of my study of retirement behavior into two

the work incentive discussed by Blinder, Gordon, and Wise and in

Section II affects individual retirement decisions empirically. The

data and calculation of variables in the empirical analysis are

described next.




IV. Data and Empirical Specification


       The empirical analysis is based on a rich file of data from the

Social Security Administration --   the   1973 CPS-IRS-SSA Exact Match

file.14 This file starts with the March 1973 Current Population Survey

(CPS). Each individual's CPS record is matched to extracts of his 1972

income tax return (IRS) and social security records (SSA). The sample

drawn from this file for empirical study here consists of married men

age 60 -. 70 who are entitled to social security retirement benefits.


       The social security data permit precise calculation of the social

security variables mentioned in previous sections. The reason for this

is that annual earnings covered by social security and the number of

quarters of coverage in each year from 1951 through 1975 are given for

each individual. This earnings information is precisely that used by

the Social Security Administration to calculate benefits. Benefits for

each individual were calculated according to the law in 1972, the year

for which the CPS gathered information and in which retirement behavior

is being examined in this study. The benefit variable, denoted BEN, in

the empirical specification of the model equals the retirement benefit

     that the couple is entitled to receive based on the earnings histories

     of the husband and the wife and the allowance for a dependent spouse.

     It is important to point out that the calculation of this variable in no

     way depends on their earnings in 1972. It is a potential benefit, not

     an actual benefit payment, and as such is exogenous with respect to the

     behavior in 1972 being estimated.


         The benefit payments that the husband and wife are entitled to

 receive in the future if they retire in 1972 are also projected

 according to the law. Social security wealth, SSW, equals the actuarial

 present value of these benefit payments. The actuarial part of the

 calculation takes into account the probabilities that husband and wife

 each survive to years in the future. In this study the potential

 benefit payment in a future year is multiplied by the probability of

 surviving to that year.15 If the husbandts own benefit is under

 consideration then the probability of his surviving to that year is

used. If a dependent spouse benefit is under consideration then the

probability that both survive is used. If a survivors benefit is under

consideration then the probability that the partner who is being

considered the survivor survives and the other partner does not is used.

The survival probabilities used here are the latest available from the

Bureau of the Census.'6 These probabilities are given by sex and age and



' The
          use of survival probabilities in this study rather than life
      expectancies as in other studies is an important difference worthy of
      note. These other studies assume individuals live to their life
      expectancies. I do not know how life expectancies could be used to
      account for the contingencies discussed in the following sentences in
      the text.

 incorporate improvements in survival rates to the year 2050. Benefit

 payments in future years are also discounted at a real interest rate of

 1 percent.


      The present value of an individual's earnings and the present value

 of the payroll taxes he paid over his working career are calculated from

 the social security earnings data. These variables are denoted PVE and

 PVTAX and equation (3) gives the formula for each. It is important to

 note that PVE is the present value of covered earnings and as such falls

 short of encompassing a person's entire lifetime earnings. PVTAX is

 computed accurately from covered earnings. Earnings and payroll taxes

 in past years are converted into dollars of present value, i.e. 1972

dollars, at the same real interest rate of 1 percent as were benefits in

future years in the calculation of SSW.


     The social security earnings data are also used to compute a wage

variable for each individual. This computation uses earnings in the

years 1967-71 to produce a variable measuring a person's potential full-

time earnings in 1972. In order to do this a limitation in the earnings

data had to be overcome. This limitation is that earnings only up to

the maximum amount taxed by social security are reported. However,

along with these earnings the data report the number of quarters in

which the individual had covered earnings during the year. If an

individual earned the taxable maximum in any year a procedure developed

by Fox (1976) that approximates earnings above the maximum based on the

number of quarters it took to reach the maximum is employed here. This

procedure is used to calculate full-year earnings. An approximation to

full-year earnings is also made when an individual did not earn the



                                 -   20   -
  taxable maximum but   had less. that four quarters of coverage. Thus, the

  first step in constructing a wage variable is to use actual earnings and

 quarters of coverage in 1967-71 to calculate full-year earnings in those

 years. The objective is to convert actual earnings which may depend on

 labor supply into a wage variable that does not depend on labor supply.


      After computing full-time earnings in 1967-71, earnings in each

 year are converted to 1972 dollars. This is done by increasing full-

 time earnings in a particular year by the rate of increase in average

 wages in the population as a whole between that year and 1972.
                                                                     Finally,
 full-time earnings in 1967-71 expressed in 1972 dollars are averaged to

 yield the variable used as the measure of a person's potential market

wage in 1972. This variable is calculated for both husband (WAGE) and

wife (WAGEW).


     The number of years of past earnings used to construct the wage

variable is of course arbitrary. However by
                                                considering using more past
years an important issue is raised. It can be argued that a person's

entire history of earnings and labor supply should be used to examine

his behavior in any particular year. An implication of this is that it

is possible to consider using all past annual   earnings   to compute WAGE.

However, this would cause problems for a study such as this where the

objective is to examine whether social security influences retirement

decisions independently of other variables. The reason is that social

security benefits are computed from a person's entire history of

earnings. It would be difficult to estimate an effect of social

security independently of other variables if the assertion is made that

these other variables include all the information that goes into



                                  - 21   -
 calculating social security benefits. This would be the case if WAGE

were computed from all previous earnings.


      It is important to point out that this issue arises in any

empirical study of retirement, not just this one. Consequently there is

an identifying assumption in this and any other retirement study that

should be made explicit. The assumption is that there is a difference

between the way in which past earnings affect current behavior and the

way in which social security benefits, as computed from past earnings,

affect current behavior. The form that this identifying assumption

takes in this study is that the wage variable is computed from the

previous five years of earnings, and social security benefits are

computed according to the law from the entire earnings history. In

other words, benefits depend on an earnings history that is longer than

that which directly affects behavior, and therefore can have an

exogenous effect on retirement.


     Given a person's potential earnings it is possible to figure out

how his benefit would change if an additional year of earnings were

included in the benefit formula. This is done in order to calculate the

variable DSSW discussed in previous sections. DSSW equals the present

value of any increase in future social security benefits that can be

gained from working an additional year and adding another year of

earnings to the benefit calculation. Operationally, a person's average

earnings as specified by social security law is recomputed with earnings

in 1972 set equal to his potential earnings. The benefit that a person

would be able to receive based on this new average earnings at the end

of 1972 is calculated using the same benefit formula used to calculate



                                  - 22 -
  benefits in 1972. DSSW equals the present value of the difference

  between this benefit and the benefit he would receive if he did not

  work, i.e. retired, in 1972. Discounting in the calculation of DSSW is

  done at the same real interest rate of 1 percent used in the other

 present value variables.


      Table 1 illustrates the magnitude of the variables discussed up to

 this point. The table reports retirement rates, social security wealth,

 social security benefits, and DSSW by potential earnings (WAGE) brackets

 and age groups in 1972. The definition of retirement is that a person's

 earnings in 1972 are less than the exempt amount in the earnings test

 for that year, which was $1,680. The age groups in the table are those

 over which the retirement model was estimated; results are presented in

 the next section. The benefit is the combined benefit that the husband

 and wife are entitled to receive. SSW is the present value of the

benefit payments to both the husband and wife. In the bracket where the

mean value of potential earnings of $8,967 for 62 - 64 year olds falls

the table shows that the retirement rate is .257, social security

benefits equal $4,576, SSW equals $80,830, and DSSW equals $2,275. In

the potential earnings bracket containing the mean value of potential

earnings for 65 - 70 year olds the retirement rate is .695, social

security benefits are $4,508, SSW equals $73,143, and DSSW equals

$1,358.


     Another variable in the retirement model is the number of hours of

work it would take to earn the exempt amount in the earnings test. It

appears because a person's shadow price depends on how much he works.

This variable is denoted K and equals $1,680, the exempt amount in 1972,

 divided by a person's wage. Since the wage variable WAGE equals a:

 person's annual wage, K equals $1,680 divided by WAGE and multiplied by

 2080, the number of hours of work in a full-time year. Since the exempt

 amount   is   the same for everyone, K is really just the inverse of WAGE.

 As such it does not measure any response to changes in the earnings

 test. Thus, K may be more properly regarded as a variable measuring a

 nonlinear wage effect. If the effect of wage were taken to be strictly

 linear by assumption then the inverse of wage would measure the

 coefficient of hours of work in the shadow price equation as specified

 in equation (7). An exact interpretation of K is not an important point

in this study. It is important to realize that the wage effect i given

by both the coefficient of WAGE and that of K.


     Some additional variables that appear in labor force participation

models can     be   defined from the data used here and included in the

empirical specification of the retirement model. One such variable is

capital income, denoted KINC. The CPS data report capital income as the

sum of interest payments, dividends, rental income, and      other   property
income. The IRS data report total dividends and the taxable portion of

interest payments. The larger of the amounts reported by the CPS and
IRS as capital income is taken to be KINC.


     Other variables that appear in the empirical specification of the

retirement model are the husband's and wife's age (AGE and AGEW,

respectively) and number of years of schooling (ED and EDW,

respectively). There are also binary variables to denote race (RACE = 1

for whites) and residence in a rural area (RURAL).

V.      Empirical Results

        This   section presents estimated retirement models for the sample of

married men drawn from the 1973 Exact Match file.                                       These men are
eligible to receive social security benefits.                                    They did not receive

public assistance income in 1972. They were not covered by the railroad

retirement system. Their full-time annual earnings as given by the

variable WAGE described in the last section were greater than or equal•

to $2000. These criteria represent an attempt to exclude any potential

behavioral effects of low income support provided by programs other than

social security. In other words, attention is focused on social

securityts potential influence on retirement decisions.

       Estimates of the retirement model were obtained separately for

62      64 and 65 - 70 year olds. The results in Table 3 provide overall

support for the life-cycle approach taken here and the conclusion that

social security has significant effects on retirement decisions. As was

pointed out in previous sections, the life-cycle model leads to the

hypothesis that the coefficient estimates for SSW and PVTAX should be

equal in magnitude and opposite in sign. The coefficient estimates are

significantly different from zero and have opposite signs but the

magnitudes are not equal. Nonetheless, the coefficient estimates for

both SSW and PVTAX indicate that social security has a strong lifetime

income effect on retirement. The difference in magnitude says that the

lifetime income effect of benefits is different from that of taxes. The

positive coefficient for SSW and negative coefficient for P\7TAX both

  imply that an increase in lifetime income obtained through social

  security raises the probability of retirement.


      The estimated substitution effects of social security conform with

 expectations. The benefit variable BEN measures the current social

 security benefit that would be lost if the individual did not retire.

 Such a loss in benefits reduces the compensation for work and should

 raise the probability of retirement. The positive coefficient estimate

 for BEN indicates that this is what happens empirically. DSSW equals

 the present value of the increase in future benefits obtained when a

 person continues to work and adds another year of earnings to the

 benefit calculation. DSSW represents extra compensation for work and as

 such should encourage work and lower the probability of retirement. The

negative coefficient estimate for DSSW provides empirical evidence that

this is the case.


     It is interesting to note that the coefficient estimates for BEN

and DSSW have nearly the same magnitude for 62 - 64 year olds. The

difference in their magnitudes is statistically insignificant. When the

compensation for work equation, equation (6), was specified the fact

that the coefficients for BEN and DSSW should have the same magnitude

was pointed out. Although this should hold for 65 - 70 year olds as

well, it does not. This suggests that older individuals respond more to

the substitution effect of a loss in current benefits rather than that

of an increase in future benefits. In other words, older individuals

are more inclined to collect current benefits and less willing to

respond to the work incentive in the social security benefit formula.




                                 -   31   -
       The magnitude of the effect of a change in a variable on the

probability of retirement is not immediately apparent from the estimates

given in Table 3.        In order to calculate such effects it is necessary to

start with the estimated probability of retirement given by the model:

                             -J
(13)     P(DR=l) =       I        f(t)dt
        'S
where J is the estimate obtained from Table 3 of the retirement index

given in equation (12), and f is the normal density function. J equals

the coefficient estimates in Table 3 multiplied by their respective

variables. Let Z denote any variable and bz, its coefficient

estimate, then the change in the retirement probability with respect to

Z is given by:



             P(DR=l)
(14)                     =        f(J)b z


where use is made of the fact that f(-Z) =             f(Z).

       Equation (14) shows that the effect of one variable on the

probability of retirement depends on its coefficient estimate and on the

values of all other variables because of the presence of J in the

argument of f.         In order to calculate effects of variables, J was set

equal to its value at the mean value of all variables (see Table 2),

except that RACE was set equal to 1 and RURAL, 0. The derivative of the

retirement probability with respect to a variable was then computed

according to equation (14). These estimated derivatives were multiplied

by changes in the social security and wage variables and other selected



                                            -   32 -
 variables to find the effect of these changes on the probability of

 retirement. These results are presented in Table 4.


      Table 4 shows that, based on the estimated retirement models in

 Table 3, a $10,000 increase in SSW raises the probability of retirement

 by .103 for 62 - 64 year olds and .108 for 65 - 70 year olds. This

 result assumes that the current benefit remains the same. Such an

 increase in SSW could be achieved through an increase in the present

 value of future benefits. Also, an increase in SSW has the same effect

 as a decrease in the present value of payroll taxes. This follows as an

 empirical result because the coefficient estimates for SSW arid PVTAX are

opposite in sign. Thus the main point to draw from the effect of an

 increase in SSW is that it measures the effect of a corresponding

increase in lifetime income obtained through social security.


     An Increase in current benefits of $500 has a substitution effect

that raises the probability of retirement by .049 for 62 - 64 year olds

and .149 for 65 - 70 year olds. In this case SSW is held constant.

This could be achieved by increasing current benefits at the expense of

future benefits. It is interesting to consider just the opposite, i.e.

decreasing current benefits while keeping SSW constant. A $500

reduction in current benefits would reduce retirement probabilities by

the magnitudes just given for a benefit increase of the same amount. A

decrease in current benefits that holds SSW constant is, by definition,

actuarially fair. Such an actuarially fair reduction in current

benefits would not result in lower benefit payments in total from social

security to the individual (since SSW is constant). However, it would

increase revenue for the system because people work more years, i.e.

postpone retirement, and pay more taxes into the system.

                                                  a significant negative effect on
   the probability of retirement.       This result provides empirical support
   for the point raised by Blinder, Gordon, and Wise (1980) that social

  secuity law, in particular the calculation of benefits from earnings,

  provides a work incentive. Table 4 shows
                                                     that when DSSW goes up by $500
  the retirement probability decreases by .048 for 62 - 64
                                                           year olds and
  .061 for 65 - 70
                   year olds. Whether the change is an increase in DSSW
  or a decrease in current benefits
                                          holding SSW constant as before, the
  idea is the same: retirement is
                                        postponed when future benefits can be
 raised by foregoing current benefits.


        As discussed when K was defined, the effect of the wage variable is

 not given in the coefficient of WAGE alone. Recall that

 K = 1680 * 2080 / WAGE.
                               As a result the wage effect is determined by

 both the coefficient of WAGE and the coefficient of K. To be precise:




 (15)     P(nR=1)    =              -
                                             1680 * 2080
           WAGE            f            bK                 )
                                                               f(J)
                                                (WAGE)




where bWAGE and bK are the coefficient estimates for WAGE and K

in Table 3. Given the magnitude of
                                             these coefficient estimates and the
fact that the minimum value of WAGE is $2000, the estimated derivative

of the retirement probability with respect to WAGE is always negative.

Note that •this derivative depends on the level of WAGE. This derivative

was calculated at the mean value of WAGE in
                                                     both age groups. Based on




                                         35 -
this derivative, Table 4 shows that a $500 increase in an individual's

annual wage decreases the probability of retirement by .008 for 62 - 64

year olds and .021 for 65 - 70 year olds. The nonlinear wage effect

yields the expected result that individuals with higher wages are less

likely to retire.


     Having K in the model to pick up any nonlinear effect of the wage

variable is important. An argument can be made that the benefit

variable is really just measuring a nonlinear wage effect that is being

transmitted through the benefit formula. A person's benefit is, in

part, a nonlinear transformation of his wage. However, the presence of

K alleviates the problem posed by this argument.


     The estimated effects of schooling conform with Mincer's (1974)

hypothesis about the relationship between schooling and retirement.

Individuals who obtain more schooling are expected to retire later.     In

the estimated models the coefficient estimates for schooling (ED) are
                                                              b
significantly   negative. A one year increase in the number of years of

schooling lowers the probability of retirement by .103 for 62 - 64 year

olds and .027 for 65 - 70 year olds. The estimated effect of the wife's

schooling is small and insignificant in both age groups.


     Increases in age have the expected positive effect on retirement.

An increase in age of one year raises the probability of retirement by

.042 for 62 - 64 year olds and .030 for 65 - 70 year olds. Increases in

the wife's age raise the probability of the husband's retirement as

well. The coefficient estimates for wife's age (AGEW) are smaller. The

effect of the wife's age relative to that of the husband's is one-third

for 62 - 64 year olds and one-eighth for 65 - 70 year olds.


                                  - 36   -
       The effect of the wife's wage (WAGEW) on her husband's retirement

  is an interesting result. The highly significant negative coefficient

  estimates for WAGEW show that higher wages for a wife decrease the

  probability of her husband's retirement. A $500 increase in the wife's

  wage reduces the husband's retirement probability by .010 for 62 - 64

  year olds and .012 for 65 - 70 year olds. This implies that husband's

  and wife's time are complements in household
                                                    utility.


       The race variable indicates that whites have a higher retirement

 probability. The coefficient estimate for RACE for 65 - 70 year olds is

  larger in magnitude and more precisely measured than for 62 - 64
                                                                   year
 olds. These estimates imply that the retirement probability for whites,

 holding all the other variables constant, is higher than that for blacks

 by .062 for 62 - 64 year olds and .300 for 65 - 70
                                                    year olds.




     The negative coefficient estimates for the variable RURAL indicate

that retirement rates are lower for individuals who reside in a rural

area. These coefficient estimates
                                      are not precisely measured though.


     Both capital income (KINC) and the present value of earnings (PVE)

were expected to have positive coefficient estimates in the model. The

reason is that when a person's financial
                                               accumulation is larger it is
possible to spend more time on leisure in later years, i.e. to retire

early. For 62 - 64 year olds the coefficient estimates for KINC and
                                                                    PVE



                                  -   37   -
have the expected positive sign. However, the coefficient estimates for

65 - 70 year olds are opposite to what was expected. Since it was not

possible to measure capital income and the present value of earnings

precisely in the Exact Match dataset, problems in measuring KINC and PVE

may be responsible for the unexpected coefficient estimates in the 65 -

70 year old age group. These variables were not important for the

general purpose of this study. Also they did not have much effect on

the results obtained for the other variables that were the focus of

study. For these reasons KINC and PVE do not receive much attention in

the empirical results.




VI.   Summary and Conclusion

      The results of this study and their implications will be summarized

briefly. In the framework of the life-cycle model social security was

shown to have a potential lifetime income effect and two substitution

effects on retirement. A retirement model was defined by expanding the

standard labor force participation model to include life-cycle variables

that would measure these potential effects of social security. The

definition of nonparticipation implements the definition of retirement

that is implicit in the rules for receiving full social security

benefits. The retirement model was estimated using the 1973 Exact Match

file, a dataset well suited for this study.


      Retirement models were estimated for 62 - 64 and 65 - 70 year olds

separately. The results showed that an increase in lifetime income




                                  -   38   -
 obtained through social security raised the probability of retirement in

 both age groups. This increase could be achieved either through an

 increase in social security wealth or a decrease in the present value of

 payroll taxes. A clear implication of this result is that if the system

 were structured so that social security wealth equals the present value

 of payroll taxes there would be no lifetime income effect on retirement.

 Under such an actuarially fair system retirement rates would have been

 lower in past years because social security raised lifetime incomes of

 individuals reaching retirement age to date.


        The results showed that social security's two substitution effects

work in opposite directions on the decision to retire.       Larger current

benefits increase the probability of retirement. A larger gain in the

value of future benefits obtained through earnings reduces the

retirement probability. Given that the magnitude of the coefficient

estimate for current benefits equals that for the earnings-induced

increase in the value of future benefits for 62 - 64 year olds, social

security's two substitution effects cancel in this age group. The

estimated lifetime income effect implies that social security's net

effect is to induce retirement for 62 - 64 year olds.

The estimated effect of current benefits exceeds that of the earnings-

induced increase in future benefits for 65 - 70 year olds. A plausible

implication of this result is that individuals in the older age group

discount future benefits at a rate higher than the one percent real rate

used for both age groups. Consequently, both social security's income
and   substitution   effects induce retirement in this age group.




                                    - 39 -
      It is important to note that if social security were actuarially

fair, social sedurityts two substitution effects would cancel by the

very nature of what it means for the system to be actuarially fair. In

other words, social security would have no substitution effect by its

very structure. As mentioned, it also would not change lifetime income.

Thus, an actuarially fair social security system would have no economic

effects on individual retirement decisions.


     The results of this study have some interesting implications for

retirement behavior in the future. As mentioned, most people reaching

retirement age to date have experienced gains in lifetime income through

social security. Such gains were made possible for a variety of

reasons.17 However, social security has reached a point where such gains

are no longer going to occur. Workers reaching retirement age in the

next several years will be gaining little in lifetime income or breaking

even. Several studies (see note 5) have shown that younger cohorts in

the population can expect losses in lifetime income. Based on this

reversal of social security's effect on lifetime income, it is possible

to project a reversal in retirement rates in the future. Retirement

rates can be expected to level off and go down.




17 Some workers did not pay taxes in the early years of their working
   career because the system had not yet begun. Even after the system
   started some workers were not covered until later. When a worker
   began to pay into the system the payroll tax rate and covered
   earnings level were low. Also, as the system grew because of growth
   in the population and extension of coverage to more workers, it was
   possible to raise benefits with little or no increase in taxes. For
   these reasons workers reached retirement age with a large increase in
   lifetime income from social security that could be realized by
   retiring.
                                -   40   -
     The main result of this study is the empirical evidence that social

security affects the decision to retire. In a companion study

(Pellechjo, 1981b) social security's effect on how much people work even

when they decide not to retire fully is examined. Bringing the social

security earnings test into the analysis is an important factor in this

study. These studies and future research with other data should

contribute to the economics of retirement.
