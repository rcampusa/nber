                  Breath Testing and the Demand for Drunk Driving



                                     ABSTRACT

             This paper presents an empirical           investigation of the
 effect of a preliminary breath test law on drunk driving behavior.
 A preliminary breath test law reduces the procedural problems
 associated with obtaining evidence of drunk driving and thus
 increases the probability that a drunk driver will be arrested. In
 1985, only 23 states had a preliminary breath test law. According
 to the theory of deterrence, increasing the probability of arrest
 for drunk driving will reduce the future occurrence of this
 behavior. The data set employed to test the theory is a time
 series from 1980 to 1985 of cross sections of the 48 contiguous
states. Four highway mortality rates are used as measures of drunk
driving. The effect of the breath test law was estimated using four
independent variable models and 12 dummy variable models. The four
independent variable models were also estimated using Learner's
specification     test.The   purpose of using these alternative
specifications and Learner's specification test was to examine the
breath test coefficients for          specification bias. The econometric
results      show that the passage of a breath test                 law has a
significant deterrent effect on drunk driving. Simulations with
these results suggest that if all states had a preliminary breath
test law, highway mortality could be reduced by about 2000 deaths
per year.

 I. Introduction



           Over the past few years, public awareness of the social cost
 of alcohol abuse has been increasing. A particular area of concern
 is the number of alcohol related motor vehicle accidents. Highway
 mortality is the third leading cause of death for people aged 35 to
 54 and the leading cause of death for people under 35. The National

 Highway Traffic Safety Administration estimates that alcohol is
 involved in about 50 percent of these accidents. Because of these
 statistics, the evaluation of deterrents to drunk driving is an
 important goal of policy research.


           As a response to public pressure, a number of states have
enacted legislation designed to reduce alcohol         related traffic
deaths. Becker (1968) has shown that the deterrent effect of
legislation can be described in terms of expected utility. This
approach assumes that an individual will commit an offense if its
expected     utility   exceeds   the expected utility derived from
alternative activities. While some drunk       driving is impulsive,
expected utility can be used to model drunk driving behavior since
the choice of drinking and then driving is, a priori, a rational
decision. The expected utility approach implies that the number of
offenses committed by an individual is negatively related to the
cost of each offense. The cost of each offense is a positive
function of the probability of arrest and         conviction and the
severity of punishment if convicted.
                                2


       The probability of arrest while driving drunk is very low in

many states. Ross (1984) reports that this probability is generally
around one in a thousand. One reason this probability is so low is
the procedural difficulties the police encounter in obtaining
acceptable evidence of drunk driving. In many stateB, a suspected
drunk driver must be arrested before any tests for intoxication can
be performed. After the arrest the police must transport the driver
to a testing station where a test of blood alcohol concentration is
performed. This test can only be administered by trained medical
personnel. Only the results of this test can be used as evidence
of drunk driving.    A second reason the arrest probability is very

low is because the police are reluctant to        arrest drivers on

suspicion   of   drunk driving. Foley (1986) reports that this
reluctance is due to the fact that most drinking drivers are
primarily middle class with more political ties than the average
person who is arrested.


        To reduce the problems associated with detecting drunk
drivers, several states have recently enacted a preliminary breath
test law. This law allows the police to administer a breath test
for blood alcohol concentration without first arresting the driver.
This test can be administered on the highway without the assistance
of medicalpersonnel. Many states with preliminary breath test laws
now also accept these test results, in place of blood tests, as
evidence of drunk driving. Drivers who pass the breath test are
free to go without further delay and without a record of arrest.
                                         3


 The preliminary breath test thus allows the police to screen more
 drivers and increases the probability of detecting drunk drivers.



           Many states have adopted various other laws designed to
 increase the probability of conviction and severity of punishment.
 To increase the probability of conviction, most states have enacted
 a per Be law. This law makes driving with a given blood alcohol
 concentration conclusive evidence of drunk driving. The per se law
 results in the automatic conviction of drivers who fail the blood
 alcohol concentration test. In 1985, 43 states had per se laws. All
 but two of these states required a blood alcohol concentration of
 10 percent or more for automatic conviction of drunk driving. The
remaining          two   states   required   .08   percent   blood alcohol
concentration for automatic conviction. In addition, many states
have increased the severity of punishment by adopting mandatory
sanctions. These sanctions include fines, license suspension or
revocation and imprisonment or community service.             In 1985, 35
states had some type of mandatory sanction for a first conviction
on drunk driving.



         The preliminary breath test law is particularly important
since this law can have a greater impact on potential drunk drivers
than the per se law or mandatory sanction laws. The reason the
preliminary breath test affects more drivers than per se laws is
that a    .   10    percent blood alcohol concentration is required before
the per se laws have any application. The preliminary breath test
also can affect more drivers than the              mandatory sanction laws
                                        4


because blood alcohol concentrations under the per se level are not
considered conclusive evidence of impairment. This allows for plea-

bargaining        to a lesser charge to avoid mandatory sanctions.
According to the National Council on Alcoholism, a blood alcohol
concentration of        .   10 percent represents consumption that is far in
                                         1
excess of typical consumption.               Therefore, the per se laws, and

because of pleaâ€”bargaining, the mandatory sanction laws, increase
the expected cost of drunk driving primarily for individuals who
drink abnormal amounts of alcohol. The breath test, however,
because it increases the probability of detection, can result in a

variety      of     lesser charges imposed on individuals who would
otherwise have escaped detection.




          The purpose of this paper is to test the effect that the
preliminary breath test law has on drunk driving. The focus on the
breath test is important since it is an efficient method of
increasing the probability of arresting a drunk driver. The number
of states which have this law has increased from 13 in 1980 to 23

in   1985.        However,      no   study has specifically examined the
effectiveness of the preliminary breath test in deterring drunk
driving in the United States.


           There have been a number of prior studies of drunk driving
deterrence policies. Ross provides an extensive review of this
literature. The British Road Safety Act of 1967 was one of the more
important legislative initiatives since it served as a model for
                                        5


 several other counties. This Act Bet            a specific blood alcohol
 concentration of .08 percent as the definition of inebriation and
 permitted the use of a preliminary breath test. The Act did not
 increase the severity of existing penalties for drunk driving. Roes
 reports that the police were restrained in the enforcement of the
 new law and the courts required strict adherence to the details of
 the law which reduced the chance of conviction. However, using
 interrupted time series analysis, Rose concludes that the Act did
 have a deterrent effect on drunk driving, at least for a few years.



        Roes also reviews research on deterrence legislation in
France,  the Netherlands, Canada, New Zealand and Australia. He
finds that there have been serious methodological problems involved
in   the   evaluation  of   deterrence laws in these countries.
Nevertheless,      Ross     concludes   that    there is evidence of a
significant deterrence effect in these countries. The magnitude of
the deterrence effect, however, varies with the public's perception
that these laws will be enforced.




II. Empirical Framework



          Following Becker's work on deterrence, an empirical model is
derived     from   a      theoretical   model   of   constrained utility
maximization. The arguments in the individual's utility function
are drunk driving, other goods and taste. The budget constraint
includes income,       the price of drunk driving and the price of other
                                   6


goods. The price of drunk driving is determined by the price of
alcohol, the expected costs of a driving accident and the expected
penalties for drunk driving. The expected costs of a driving
accident are dependent on the probability of an accident and the
direct and indirect costs of all damage borne by the drunk driver.2
The expected penalties for drunk driving are dependent on the
probabilities of arrest and conviction and the sanctions generally
imposed on convicted drunk drivers. This budget           constraint is

nonlinear since the cost of drunk driving increases            with the

quantity of drunk driving. Optimization of the utility function
results in a demand for drunk driving equation. The arguments of
the demand function are the probability and expected cost of a
highway accident, the probabilities of arrest and conviction, the
penalties for drunk driving and alcohol demand variables. This
equation     can    be   aggregated across individuals to yield an
empirically estimable demand for drunk driving equation.


           Over the past few years a number of researchers have sought
empirical verification of Becker's deterrence hypothesis. These
studies often employ an aggregated cross section of annual data.
Like all other econometric studies, these empirical deterrence
models must address problems with specification, measurement and

endogeneity.


           Empirical deterrence studies whic.h have employed time series

data and interrupted time series analysis have also encountered
methodological problems. The data used in these studies often
                                       7


 consist of a few years of monthly observations. To insure that the
 legislative        change   occurred in a single time period it is
 generally        necessary to limit the data to a single jurisdiction.4
 The time series data used in a deterrence study should be extensive

 enough to correctly identify trend, seasonality and random error.
 Trends in drunk driving data          occur as a result of gradually
 shifting demographic patterns or as a result of gradually changing
 opinions about health and alcohol.           Seasonality occurs in drunk
 driving data due to the yearâ€”end holidays. Identifying random error
 is difficult when the data is limited to small jurisdictional
 aggregates. An additional problem with interrupted time series
 analysis     is     the difficulty of separating the effects         of a
legislative change from other changes that may have occurred at
about the same time. These other changes include changes in gas
prices      and     availability,   changes   in   alcohol             and
                                                             prices
availability, changes in insurance costs, new roads            or other
driving legislation.



         In this study pooled cross section and time series data are
used in regressions of a measure of drunk driving on a set of
independent variables. The independent variables include        a breath
test variable, highway conditions variables, alcohol availability
variables and a set of time dummies. The time dummies are included
to control time variation in the dependent variable. The advantage
of this specification is its ability to provide a separate estimate
of   the effect on drunk driving of all included independent
variables. Breath test coefficients estimated by this type of model
                                    a

can   be interpreted as measuring the effect of introducing a breath

test law holding constant other factors affecting drunk driving and

any time trend in drunk driving.


         Breath test coefficients from independent variable models of
this type should be tested for specification error.          This iB

important because regression coefficients can be sensitive to the
choice of independent variables included in        the specification.

Researchers have generally treated this problem by presenting a set

of alternative specifications of independent variables. These sets
of regressions, however can only represent a small subset all
possible relevant specifications.


         Learner (1982) proposes an alternative method of treating the

specification problem. The independent variables are divided into
necessary variables and doubtful variables. The necessary variables
must be included in any specification while the doubtful variables
may be excluded. Learner's procedure      uses the data matrix from a

specification which includes all doubtful variables and the data
matrix from a specification which constrains all doubtful variables
to have coefficients equal to zero. These two matrices are weighted

by the inverse of their respective equation error variances.
Varying the error variance from the        constrained equation will

generate a range of estimated coefficients. The degree of variation
in the necessary variable coefficients reveals their robustness.6

  111. Data



            The data used in this Study consist of state aggregates for
 the 48 contiguous states for the time period 1980 through 1985. The
 mean value and summary definition of              each variable is found in
 table one.



         Highway mortality accident rates          are the best empirical
 measures      of     drunk driving available. While not       all highway
 mortality is the result of drunk driving, there is a strong
 correlation between the two measures. Several highway mortality
 rates   are        available.   The    National   Highway Traffic Safety
 Administration estimates alcohol involved highway mortality rateB
 based on statistical factors. As an alternative to these estimated
 rates, four age and time specific            mortality rates are used as
dependent variables in this study.7 The first mortality rate
includes all mortality regardless of the age of the victims and
time of the accident and is called the total mortality rate. The
second mortality rate is limited to drivers who died between 12
a.m. and 4 a.m. and is called the night driver mortality rate. The
National Highway Traffic Administration estimates that 75 percent
to 90 percent of these drivers   had been drinking. The third
mortality rate is limited to highway mortality of 15 to 24 year
olds and is called the youth mortality rate. The National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration          estimates that the alcohol involved
accident rate for young drivers is three times that of older
drivers. The last mortality rate is limited to drivers aged 15 to
                                  10


24, killed between 12 a.m. and 4 a.m. This mortality rate is called

the night driver youth mortality rate. There are no estimates of
alcohol involvement for these drivers, but based on the other
estimates, it is likely that a large percentage of these drivers

had been drinking.


          Each mortality rate is computed as motor vehicle deaths by
state divided by the relevant state population.              Motor vehicle

mortality by state come from the Fatal Accident Reporting System
and the data pertain to state of occurrence rather than state of
residence. The population data are from the Census Bureau.


          Since the mortality rate has a restricted range, a logistic

specification will conform to the data more closely than a linear
specification. The logistic specification is most easily achieved
by transforming the mortality rate to ln(M/1â€”M), where N iB the
mortality rate and in is the natural logarithm. Maddala (1983)
shows that weighted least squares should be used with this logistic
                                                1/2       where   n is the
transformation.      The weight is: (nM(1-M)1         ,


                             a
population   of the state.


          The preliminary breath test is a dichotomous variable equal

tO one if a state has a preliminary breath test law and is
otherwise equal to zero. The data comes from the National Highway

Traffic      Safety Administration, the Department         of Justice and

various compilations of state laws.
                                       11


               Three measures are included in the regressions as empirical
 proxies for the probability and cost of a highway accident. They
 are the number of vehicle miles traveled in 100,000's of miles per
 licensed driver, the number of licensed drivers aged 24 years or
 less as a fraction of all licensed drivers, and the average vehicle

 speed in miles per hour. Similar variables have              been used in
 interstate studies of the determinants of motor vehicle death rates
 by Peltzman (1975) and Lave (1985). The number of vehicle miles
 traveled per driver reflects motor vehicle use and highway density
 and      is     expected to have a positive regresBion coefficient.
 According to Peltzman (1975), because young drivers have a higher
 demand for risky driving, they are more likely to have an accident
than older drivers. An increase in the per capita number of young
drivers should have a positive effect on the mortality rates. The
average vehicle speed should also have a positive effect on
mortality        rates   since the probability of collision and       the
consequences of colli1on are positively related to speed.


           The number of licensed drivers of all ages, the number of
licensed drivers aged 24 or less, average vehicle speed and the
number of vehicle miles traveled are published by the Federal
Highway        Administration.   The   Federal   Highway   Administration
estimates vehicle miles of travel from data on gasoline consumption

and motor vehicle registration by state. The average speed data are
derived from state certification reports.
                                 12


          Real per capita personal income is also included in the
demand curve. This variable should be positively related to the
demand for beer, to the quality and condition of motor vehicles,
and to safe driving practices. The last relationship emerges
because income and education are positively          related and more

educated persons are likely to be safer drivers. The predicted
effect of income on the mortality rate is thug, ambiguous. The
income data was published by the Bureau of Economic Analysis.


          Another variable included in the demand curve is the state

unemployment rate. This variable may measure alcohol consumption or
driving. Unemployment may be a stress factor increasing alcohol
consumption. Alternatively, unemployment may reduce driving because
of reduced work related travel and reduced income.


          In the demand for drunk driving equation        the price of

alcohol is measured by the excise tax on beer. Excise tax data was
chosen to measure price since it is the most reliable price data
available.9 Because the tax data on various alcoholic beverages are

highly correlated, only one beverage tax can be used in the
regressions. Data on beer was chosen since beer is the the most
popular alcoholic beverage in the U.S.


          The beer tax variable is defined as the sum of the Federal
and state excise tax rates on a case of 12 ounce containers of beer
                 the annual national Consumer Price Index       (CPI).
divided     by
Deflation by the CPI is required to take account of trends in
                                    13


 prices of other goods between 1980 and 1985. Each regression 18
 estimated with time dummy variables to control time trend in the
 price data and time trend In the other variables. The real beer tax
 is thus an accurate indicator of the          relative price of beer
 provided the non-tax component of the relative price is not state
 dependent.



         The Federal excise tax on a case of beer was fixed in
 nominal terms at 64 cents during the sample period. State excise
 tax rates were obtained from the U.S. Brewers Association (1985).
 If a state raised its tax during the year rather than on January 1,
 its tax for the year is computed as a weighted average of the
higher and lower rates. The weights are the fraction of the year
that each rate was in effect.



        The legal drinking age variable is the minimum age for the
purchase of beer with alcohol content of 3. 2 percent or more. These
data come from Wagenaar (1.981/1982) and the Digest of State Alcohol
Related Legislation.



        Three other alcohol variables are Included In the demand
curve. These variables are included as determinants of unobserved
exogenous alcohol sentiment. For example, antiâ€”alcohol sentiment
should be relatively widespread in states in which those religious
groups that oppose the use of alcohol are prevalent. The first and
second of these variables are defined         as the percentage of the
state   population     who   are   Mormons   and   Southern Baptists,
                                        14


respectively. The third variable measures other church membership
and is defined as the percentage of the state population who are
Catholics      and        Protestants   (excluding   Southern Baptists and
Mormons). These variables were available only for the years 1971

and   1980. Estimates for 1981 through 1985 were computed by
logarithmic trend.




IV. Results


            The      estimation results from the independent variable
specifications are presented in table two and the results for the
dummy variable specifications and the Learner test presented in
table three. Table two contains the estimation results from four
cross sectional models in columns one through four. These models
have different dependent variables but are otherwise identical. The
dependent variables are respectively: the total mortality rate, the
night driver mortality rate, the youth mortality rate, and the
night driver youth mortality rate. Table three contains only the
coefficients         of     the   preliminary breath test. The dependent
variables used in table two are repeated in the same order in table
three. The coefficients reported in panels A, B and C of table
three are dummy variable models. These models use the breath test
variable with state and time dummies only. The Learner specification
test is reported in panel D of Table three. For convenience, the
breath test coefficients of table two are repeated in panel E of
table three.
                                  15




         In table two, the coefficient of the preliminary breath test
 is negative and significant in all four specifications. Since the
 functional form of each equation is logistic, and the mortality
 rate is very small, the breath test coefficient approximately
 equals the percentage differential between the mortality rate in
 states with the test compared to states without the test, net of
 all other factors. Table two shows that the breath test law has a
 larger effect on night driver mortality than on total mortality.
 This could be due to the higher level of alcohol involvement in
 night driver mortality than in total mortality. The breath test
coefficients in both youth mortality equations are also larger than
the coefficient in the overall mortality equation. This again is
probably due to the higher level of alcohol involvement in youth
mortality than in total mortality.


        The highway variables in the demand for drunk driving
equation measure the probability and expected severity of highway
accidents. These variables are measures of total vehicle miles
driven, the number of young drivers and average vehicle speed. Each
of these variables is positive and significant in each regression
in table two.



        The two income variables, real income and unemployment are
both negative and significant in each specification in table two.
The   negative   income coefficient suggests that higher income
individuals are safer drivers and operate vehicles that are in
                                          16


better physical condition. The negative unemployment coefficient
suggests that in areas with relatively high unemployment, people
drive less or do less drinking away from home.


          The alcohol variables are included in the demand for drunk

driving     equation     as      measures of alcohol consumption. These
variables are the real beer tax, the drinking age and religious
sentiment variables. The real beer tax is negative and significant

in all four specifications presented in table two. The magnitude of
the beer tax coefficient is larger in all three subgroups than in
        overall mortality equation. Since alcohol involvement                 is
the
greater in these subgroups, the effect of alcohol prices should be
larger. Saffer and Grossman (1987a, 1987b) estimate the effect of
beer      taxes    on    youth        mortality   rates.     Their results are
approximately the same as the results reported in table two. The

legal      drinking     age      is     negative in each specification and
significant in the three subgroup specifications. The religious
sentiment variables are generally negative and significant. The
Mormon variable is negative and significant in all specifications.
The Southern Baptist variable is negative and significant only in
the     youth      mortality     regression.      Finally, the other church
                  variable     is      negative   and      significant   in each
membership
                                                                             10
specification except the night driver youth mortality regression.


           The preliminary breath test coefficients for three dummy
variable models are presented in panels A, B and C of table three.
All preliminary breath test coefficients in these models are
                                   17


 negative and significant. Panel A of this table contains the
 results for models using the breath test and time dummies only.
 These models are equivalent to those of        table two with the
 exclusion of all independent variables except the breath test. The

 coefficients in panel A are approximately the same as in panel E.
 This indicates that no distorting collinearity is introduced by the
 inclusion of the independent variables.



          Panel B of table three contains the results for models
 using the preliminary breath test, a set of 47 state dummies and
 three time dummies. Any influences on mortality that were excluded
from the models in table two are controlled by the inclusion of the
state dummies. Three time dummies       were dropped because of the
collinearity introduced by the 47 state dummy variables. 11 If the
time trend in the dependent variables is not   completely controlled
when the three time dummies are dropped there will be an upward
bias in the breath test coefficients. However, the results reported

in panel B are again approximately the same as those in panel E.
This suggests that the exclusion of relevant independent variables
from   the models reported in table two have not biased the
preliminary breath test coefficients in any significant way.


         Panel C of table three contains the results for models
using the state dummies only. The coefficients of the preliminary
breath test are clearly larger than in the models which control
time trend.

         The results from the Learner procedure are presented in panel

D of table three. Learner suggests that the error variance from the
constrained equation be set at one fourth and four. As this error

variance      is increased, the computed breath test coefficients
approach the coefficients of the independent variable models.



           The Learner procedure produces coefficient estimates which
are within the range delineated by panels E and C. This suggests
that any alternative subsets of the variables used in table two
would generate the same conclusions regarding the effects of the
breath   test.


V. Conclusions

           The purpose of this paper was to estimate the effect a
preliminary      breath test law has drunk driving. Four different motor
vehicle mortality rates were used as measures of drunk driving. The
effect of the breath test was estimated using four independent
variable models and 12 dummy variable models. The four independent
variable models were also estimated using Learner's procedure. The
purpose of using these alternative specifications          and Learner's

procedure was to test the breath test coefficient for specification
bias. The econometric tests show that the passage of a breath test
law has a significant deterrent effect on drunk driving.

         The final empirical problem to be considered is estimation
 of the number of lives that could have been saved if all states had
 a preliminary breath test law during 1985. Since the mortality
 equation is in logistic form, the log odds ratio, which would have
 occurred in 1985 if all states had         a breath test law, must be
 estimated. Thie estimated ratio is       equal to the actual 1985 log
 odds ratio, plus the breath test coefficient times one minus the
 percent of states with a breath test law in 1985. The actual log
 odds mortality rate in 1985      was -8.60133. The the breath test
 coefficient used for this calculation is the average of the breath
 test coefficients from two total       mortality regressions. These
regressions are the state and time dummy regression reported in
panel B of table two and the independent variable regression
reported in panel E of table three. The total mortality regressions
were used because this is the most inclusive mortality rate. The
state and time dummy regression and the independent variable
regressions were chosen because these are the most inclusive
specifications. The average of these two breath test coefficients
is -.0679. The value of one minus the percent of states with a
breath test law in 1985 is .521. The estimated log odds ratio of
mortality, if all states had a breath test law is thus -8. 63832.
This is equal to total      mortality of 41,971. Since the actual
mortality in 1985 was 43,982, if all states had a breath test law,
mortality would have been reduced by 2011 deathB.
                                20


        Finally, while the breath test law has been shown to reduce

drunk driving, many other anti-drunk driving laws have recently
been enacted. The most notable of these new laws are the mandatory
sanctions for drunk driving. These sanctions      include mandatory

revocation and mandatory imprisonment. Analysis of the deterrent
effects of these new laws remains an important topic for future
research.

3> Learner (1983) provides an example of the consequences of these
specification problems in estimation of the deterrence effect of
capital punishment.
4) See McPheters et a!. (1984) for an example of this type of study.

5) The estimation equation is:
                b =   (2     +
                                 -2 (Z'Z))1 -2

     b = a kxl vector consisting of k1 necessary variable coefficients
                       doubtful variable coefficients,            2
         = the error variance from the constrained equation, and a =
     fllowed  by k2
     the error variance from the unconstrained equation, elements
     3 = a kxk identity matrix with the first k1 diagonal
     changed to zero,
     Z = an nxk data matrix consisting of k1 necessary variables
     followed by k2 doubtful variables,
     Y = an nxl vector of values of the dpendent      variable.
Learner suggests values of .25 and 4 for s

6)   Endogeneity of the breath test may be a problem. However,
endogeneity  may be viewed as an omitted variable problem. The
specification tests show that the breath test coefficients are not
significantly affected by omitted variable bias.
7) Actual mortality data is preferable to estimated data because
the estimated data contains an error which may bias the regression
coefficients.
8) The weight for the difference specification is:

                 (1/n) (1/N1 ( 1â€”N1) +1/M0( 1â€”N0)]
     where N1 is the mortality rate in the latter year and N0
     is the mortality rate in the earlier year.

9) The excise tax on beer is a preferred measure of price. Assume that
the price of beer, exclusive of tax, varies among states because the
supply curve slopes upward. Under this assumption, an increase in the
demand for beer will simultaneously raise the price of beer, the
quantity of beer consumed and the mortality rate. This would result in
a biased price coefficient in the demand regression.

10) No consistent data sources could be found for the
measure mandatory sanctions for drunk driving. These  sample period to
desirable since estimates of the effects of these laws   data would be
interest. The specification tests show that omitted            are of
to omitted mandatory sanctions or due to omitted     variable bias due
not significant.                                  average sanctions is

11) The Belsley, Kuh and
dummies for 1980, 1981 andWelsch collirlearity test found the time
                            1985 with the highest   Condition index.
Therefore, instead of the usual case of dropping a single
three dummies were dropped from                           dummy, all
                               the models using the 47 state dummies.
