                                       EXCLUSIVE DEALING



                                             ABSTRACT



        In this paper, we provide a conceptual framework for understanding          the phenomenon     of

exclusive dealing, and we explore the motivations for and effects of its use. For a broad class of

models, we characterize the outcome of a contracting game in which manufacturers            may employ

exclusive dealing provisions in their contracts.    We then apply this characterization    to a sequence

of specialized settings. We demonstrate that exclusionary contractual provisions may be irrelevant,

anticompetitive, or efficiency-enhancing,   depending upon the setting. More specifically, we exhibit

the potential for anticompetitive   effects in non-coincident    markets (that is, markets other than the

ones in which exclusive dealing is practiced), and we explore the potential for the enhancement of

efficiency   in a setting where common representation       gives rise to incentive conflicts.   In each

instance, we describe the manner in which equilibrium           outcomes would be altered by a ban on

exclusive dealing. We demonstrate that a ban may have surprisingly subtle and unintended effects.

1. Introductkn

         A manufacturer engages in exclusive dealing when it prohibits a retailer or distributor who

carries its product from selling certain other products (often, although not always, those of its direct

competitors). For example, in one well-known antitrust case, Standard Fashion Co. v. Ma~rane-

Houston Co. (1922), a leading manufacturer                 of dress patterns (Standard) contracted               with a leading

Boston retailer (Magrane-Houston)              to sell its patterns on the condition that Magrane-Houston                    not sell

the patterns of any other manufacturer. 1

         Assessments     of exclusive dealing by various antitrust commentators                   are remarkably         divergent.

Throughout      much of this century, the Courts have treated exclusive dealing harshly.                          Fearful of the

foreclosure    of competitors      from retail outlets, the Court in the Magrane-Houston                  case struck down the

contract, arguing that “[t]he restriction of each merchant to one pattern manufacturer must                             in


hundreds,     perhaps in thousands,      of small communities          amount to giving such single pattern

manufacturer     a monopoly of the business in such community. ”

         At the same time, persuaded by the arguments of the Chicago School, many have come to

believe that exclusive dealing cannot serve as a profitable               mechanism for monopolization                and that it

should instead be regarded as an efficient contractual                form.    Commenting      on the Magrane-Houston

case, Bork [1978] puts the argument this way:

         “Standard can extract in the prices that it charges all that its line is worth.
                                                                                       It cannot charge
        the retailer that full amount in money and then charge it again in exclusivity that tie retailer
        does not wish to grant. To suppose that it can is to commit the error of double counting.
        . . .Exclusivity has necessarily been purchased from it, which means that the store has balanced
        the inducement offered by Standard . . . against the disadvantage of handling only Standard’s
        patterns . . . If consumers would prefer more pattern lines at higher prices, the store would not
        accept Standard’s offer. The store’s decision, made entirely in its own interest, necessarily
        reflects the balance of competing considerations that determine consumer welfare. Put the
        matter another way. If no manufacturer used exclusive dealing contracts, and if a local retail
        monopolist decided unilaterally to carry only Standard’s patterns because the loss in product
        variety was more than made up in the cost saving, we would recognize that decision was in the



   ‘For a summary     of federal   exclusive    dealing   cases that reached   at least the appellate   level,    s   Frasco   [1991].


                                                                  1
             consumer interest. We do not want a variety that costs more than it is worth,..      If Standard
             finds it worthwhile to purchase exclusivity..., the reason is not the barring of entry, but some
             more sensible goal, such as obtaining the special selling effort of the outlet. ” [pp. 306-7]

             In contrast to many other forms of vertical restrictions (such as resale price maintenance               and

exclusive territories),      exclusive dealing has received relatively little formal attention in the economics

literature     (see, for example,     Katz’s [1989] survey article; notable exceptions          include Marvel [1982]

and Mathewson         and Winter [1987] which we discuss below).             In this paper, we seek both to provide a

conceptual framework         for understanding     this phenomenon       and to explore more fully the motivations

for and effects of its use.         Central to our approach is the view that exclusive dealing is best understood

by studying its costs and benefits relative to those of common representation,                   These settings of

common representation formally involve what we have previously termed situations of “common

agency” (Bernheim and Whinston [1986a, 1986b]).                  Exclusive dealing is an explicit choice by the

retailer and a manufacturer         to avoid a setting of common agency.

             The remainder    of the paper is organized    as follows.     Section 2 describes a general framework

in which a single retailer may represent two manufacturers.               For a broad class of models encompassing

all of the specific settings considered        in subsequent sections, we characterize          the outcome of a

contracting     game in which manufacturers         may employ exclusive dealing provisions           in their contracts.

A central implication of this characterization         is that in these settings, unless common representation

introduces contracting       externalities   that reduce the manufacturers’        joint payoffs, the equilibrium

outcome is necessarilyy supportable          through non-exclusive    contracts.

         In section 3, we specialize to a simple setting in which the retailer buys and resells the

manufacturers’      products and in which the retailers’ choices are perfect] y observable.              The model

follows closely the scenario envisioned by Bork.            We show that, in this setting, there are no relevant

contracting     external ities associated with common representation.          By applying our general

characterization     results, we then obtain several strong conclusions            supporting   Bork’s assertions.   First,



                                                             2
the market outcome maximizes the profits of the vertical structure as a whole -- one obtains the fully

integrated solution.       Second, in this equilibrium,          each manufacturer        earns exactly its contribution to

aggregate profits. Third, although this outcome need not be first-best, banning exclusive dealing

cannot raise welfare.

          Despite these results, we argue that the model of section 3 may provide a poor framework                                for

understanding      the effects of the exclusionary         contracts that are observed in practice.           In that model,

exclusionary     provisions     are entirely superfluous;       even when the fully integrated solution would involve

the sale of only one product,          this outcome can be supported through non-exclusionary                    contracts.

Indeed, in this model, there is also no reason to permit exclusive dealing.

          Given that exclusivity provisions           are superfluous      in the model of section 3, it is natural to

investigate the circumstances          under which these provisions serve a meaningful                purpose.

Commentators        have suggested a number of different motivations                for the practice (see, for example, the

summaries      in Areeda and Kaplow [1988] and Scherer [1980]).                    nose     who are concernd          about the

practice believe that it may be motivated by the desire to preempt outlets, and thereby enhance market

power.     A leading explanation        of those who see exclusive dealing as an efficient contractual                  device, on

the other hand, is that it may be motivated by a manufacturer’s                    desire to secure the special selling

effort of the retailer.       As Scherer [1980] puts this view, “For manufacturers,                 exclusive dealing

arrangements      are often appeal ing, because they ensure that their products will be merchandised                          with

maximum energy and enthusiasm. ” In sections 4 and 5, we show that these two explanations                                 may

indeed be given rigorous theoretical            foundations     by introducing     suitable generalizations       into the model

of section 3.1

          In section 4, we demonstrate           that exclusive dealing can serve as a device for extracting rents




     ‘The other leading efficiency explanation is the manufacturer-free-trading   story presented in Marvel [1982].   We discuss this
explanation briefly in section 5.


                                                                   3
(conceivably by extending market power) from markets other than the ones in which they are

employed.       We refer to this phenomenon          as a non-coincident market effect.          In particular,    we explore

the role of non-coincident       market effects for an illustrative model in which retail markets develop

sequentially,     and where important economies can be achieved only by serving more than one market.

We demonstrate       that, as in section 3, effective exclusion occurs in the early-developing                 market

whenever      it is jointly optimal for the manufacturers         and retailer in this market.       However,      there are

two important differences        from the analysis of section 3. First, although exclusion may be optimal for

the these three parties, it may not maximize vertical structure profits across the two retail markets; an

externality     arises because exclusion may affect the degree of competition,                and hence the profits of the

retailer,   in the later-developing     market.    Second, it may be impossible to achieve the exclusionary

outcome in the absence of explicitly exclusionary              provisions,     precisely because the existence of non-

coincident effects may generate contracting            external ities for the manufacturers.         We derive a necessary

and sufficient condition describing         the circumstances        under which these provisions        are used.     In

addition, we examine the effects of banning explicit exclusion.                   We demonstrate      that this does not

always end effective exclusion.          Indeed, a ban may lead to effective exclusion continuing,                but through

even less efficient practices such as quantity forcing or quantity discounts.2                  Thus, the welfare

implications     of a ban are ambiguous,       even in the context of a model predicting            foreclosure      when

exclusive dealing is permitted.

            In section 5, we study the potential for exclusive dealing to arise in circumstances                  where

common representation         involves costly incentive conflicts.           In particular,   we imbed this conflict into

Airways. While British Airways apparently has not attempled to engage any travel agent in an exclusive relationship, it has
offered travel agent commission override (or “TACO”) programs, which grant rebates if agents purchase high quantities or high
fractions of their customers’ travel services from British Airways. Virgin Aisways has alleged that these programs effectively
amount to exclusive dealing arrangements, and that they result in market forwlosure.       See the decision of U.S. District Judge

the model by assuming that the retailer takes unobsemable                      actions that influence the manufacturers’

sales, and that the retailer is risk-averse.          We demonstrate           that common representation         may then

involve inefficiencies        (resulting again from contracting           externalities),   and that this can lead to

exclusive dealing when these costs are large relative to the benefits from carrying a second product.

We explore the nature of these inefficiencies,                and the precise circumstances in which exclusive dealing

arises.    We also demonstrate           that a ban on exclusive dealing may have surprisingly              subtle effects.    For

example, a ban can reduce welfare even in cases where no exclusion would have occurred.

2. The Contracting Model

           In this section, we describe the contracting game that we employ throughout                       the paper and

provide an initial characterization           result concerning       its equilibria.   The contracting     game involves three

players:    a retailer,     who is assumed to have sole access to some set of consumers,                    and two

manufacturers          ~ = A,B)        who wish to sell their products to these consumers.

           The contracting       process consists of three stages:

           m:             Firms simultan~usly       announce contract offers.           A contract maps obse~able

outcomes (discussed later) to payments,             which are made by the retailer to the manufacturer.                  Unless

legally prohibited        from doing so, a firm may condition its contract terms on the set of manufacturers

whose products are sold by the retailer.             Formally,        we represent manufacturer       j’s   offer as a

contingent pair        (y, ~).     y     is an exclusive contract, which applies if the retailer contracts only with

manufacturer      j.    y    is a common contract,      which applies if the retailer contracts with both

manufacturers.         For now we shall simply denote the set of possible exclusive and common contracts

for manufacturer          j by ~        and ~.    We assume throughout            that each set includes     +,    the choice not

to offer a contract of that type.           If manufacturer     j‘s    offer is (y, *) the retailer can accept j‘s            offer

only if he does not accept manufacturer              -j’s offer.

                                                                   5
            -:            me    retailer accepts or rejects each of tie two firms’ offers; accepting means

 accepting the contingent pair (y, P;). The retailer’s payoff if he rejects both firms’ offers is UO,

 while each manufacturer           j (j= A,B) then earns r!.

            -:            If the retailer serves only manufacturer            j, he chooses an element of tie set D;          if he

serves both manufacturers,           he chooses an action from the set ~.               If the retailer selects actions      & c ZJ

when serving only manufacturer             j under contract        Pj’ his payoff is uj(y,      uj), manufacturer       j earns

r~~,    uj), and manufacturer           i # j earns         ~(P;, uj) (thus, we permit manufacturer            i’s payoff to

depend on the contracting          outcome between manufacturer                j and the retailer).     If the retailer chooses

& t Z’ when serving both manufacturers,                   his payoff is uc(P~, P:, d)        and manufacturer      j earns

m~(P~, P;, d), j = A,B.            We denote the retailer’s         (possibly non-unique)     optimal choices in each of

these cases by          bi(~)    = argmaxd~ ~ d(q,         uJ)    and       &(P~,P~)   =     argt?’iaxd.
                                                                                                      ~~,u’(P*, ~E, d).

            We will be much more explicit about the nature of the sets @;, & , Ej, and Z’ and the

functions        uj(0), u’(?), r~(”), T{(o),        and T;(o)    in the sections that follow.     For the purposes of the

analysis in this section, however,             we begin with four minimal assumptions.                In stating them, we let

+ K denote the contract that differs from contract                      q   only by the addition of a fixed payment          K

from the retailer to manufacturer              j.    A similar meaning applies to the contract           q + K,



(Al)      ~~c~,then~+Ke~~orallKt                                     Ratis=e,c.

(A2)      Uc(pi + K> pi - K, UC)= uc(P~, P;, ~) ~or all K ~ R, (Pi, P;, d) c &~ x &; x D.




      3While optimal choices may not exist for all feasible contracts, this has little effect on our characterization of quilibria.
Formally, there are two possible ways to proceed. First, one can impose sufficient technical restrictions on payoffs and contracts
to guarant- existence. Second, one could assume that, when an optimum fails to exist, the retailer follows some arbitrary rule
of thumb (e. g., he could do nothing, or could “satistice, - choosing randomly from among those contracts whose payoffs cannot
be exceeded by more than some amount t). The tirst approach rules out problematic subgames, while the second renders them
irrelevant. Both approaches lead to the same results.


                                                                    6
(A4)         ti(P~ + K, uj) is a continuous, strictly increasing finction                 of K that is unbounded above and

             below.


             (A1) says that it is always possible to alter a feasible contract by demanding a larger (or

smaller) fixed payment from the retailer.                 (A2) says that the retailer does not care about the source of

his monetary earnings.                It implies that &(P~ + K, P: - K) = &(P~, P:)                for all K 6 R and

(P:, P;) 60:          x Q;.     (A3) says that a manufacturer’s         payoff increases dollar-for-dollar          in his

monetary earnings.             (A4) implies that by altering       P; by a fixed payment              K it is possible to give the

retailer any desired level of utility.

           In general, the model outlined above gives rise to multiple equilibria.                       We refine the set of

equilibria     by focusing on those that are Pareto undominated                for the manufacturers         (the first-movers)

within the set of equilibria.4               As a general matter, we can classify equilibria according to whether

they are exclusive (involve the retailer contracting              with only one manufacturer)             or common (involve

the retailer contract ing with both manufacturers).

          Consider,       first, exclusive equilibria.       If each manufacturer         j sets      P; = @, then bidding is

reduced to competition            to obtain an exclusive relationship       with the retailer.        The outcome of this

(Bertrand-like)       bidding game is that the exclusive relationship                is obtained by the manufacturer         who can

profitably     offer the retailer the highest payoff level.            Formally,      define for   U > ~        the function


               Z(U)=          Max         ~(~,d)
                           P,- C@;,   d



                      s.t. (i) uj E dj(~)                                                                                            (1)


                          (ii) d(~,uj)             > U.


~(U)      is the highest payoff level obtainable by manufacturer                   j in an exclusive relationship        with the




    %is    is equivalent to requiring that equilibria be perfectly coalition-proof    (see Bemheim,    Peleg, and Whinston [1987).

                                                                   7
retailer when the retailer has reservation           utility level    U. It is necessarily     non-increasing       in U. We

can also define        U(U)     = max {T{(y,uj) I (~,uj) solves (1)]           to be the maximal payoff of

manufacturer      i # j when j has such an exclusive relationship.                    We then denote by ~(u)              = ~(U)

+ ~(u)        the maximal level of a~~re~ate manufacturer              profits when manufacturer           j has an optimal

exclusive contract with a retailer who has reservation                utility level   U.

         If ~(U)        and U(U)        are continuous for j = A,B, i # j (as we assume below), then

exclusive equilibria always exist.          In any exclusive equilibrium         in which the retailer contracts with

manufacturer      j,    the retailer’s equilibrium     payoff     ~   must be such that ~(~)         - 11~(~) 202

~@)    - @(fi)     (where i z j),        Or equivalently,    ~(~)      ~ ~(fi)    + z(~)       ~ ~i(~).      me best exclusive

equilibrium     (for manufacturers)       gives the retailer the payoff       W = min {U: ~(u)             - ~(u)     < 0 for

some   i and j # i}, and has profits of ~(Ue)                    for the manufacturer       who is served, and ~~e)           for

the excluded manufacturer.5

         Now consider common equilibria (i. e., equilibria in which both manufacturers’                         offers are

accepted).     Lemma A. 1 in the appendix characterizes               these equilibria     in terms of an associated

intrinsic common agen~ game, which is the game that would arise were the agent only able to serve

both manufacturers        or none at all (see Bernheim and Whinston [1986b]).                  Formally,     one obtains this

game by imposing the restriction           that @; = @ for j = A,B,              and by assuming that the manufacturers

receive arbitrarily     large negative payoffs if the retailer rejects boti offers.             Henceforth,      we let R(U)

denote the highest uggrega~e payoff earned by the two manufacturers                        in any equilibrium       of an intrinsic

common agency game with retailer reservation                utility    U. We also denote by ~(u)              C O; x P: x

E’ the subset of equilibria of the intrinsic common agency game with reservation                          utility level    U that

generate aggregate profits for the manufacturers              of W(U).        Assumptions      (A 1) - (A4) imply that if

(P;, P:, ~) c E(U)            then   (P: + K, P; -K, d) c EC(U).



   ‘In any such undominated quilibrium       each manufacturer    offers a contract that solves problem (1) when    U = U.

                                                                  8
          The models studied in Sections 3-5 share a feature that makes identification             of undominated

equilibrium     outcomes particularly   simple.   We introduce this condition as our fifth assumption:



(A5)      ~ere exist constants @, ~f, H:, H:, H;) and a strictly increasing finction                    g(U)    with

          g(u”) = O such that, for all U > UO, &(U) = @ - g(U), Hj(U) = ~ - g(U) for j = A,B,

          and @(U) = ~ for j = A,B, i # j,


          Given (A5), for j = A,B        we can also write       ~(U)     =~-g(U)        where   Hj=~+~.               The

levels   ~,    H’,   and HB are the maximal aggregate manufacturer              profits that can be generated     in

common and exclusive relationships,        respectively,    with a retailer who has a reservation       utility level of

U = UO, Assumption         (A5) says that the differences       between the maximal aggregate manufacturer

profit levels in these types of relationships     are independent       of U.

         The models in Sections 3-5 satisfy two further conditions that help us characterize                equilibria.




The first pafl of condition (A6) says that some manufacturer              earns greater profits in an exclusive

relationship    with a retailer having reservation   utility UOthan in the no-contracting        outcome.      This rules

out the existence of a no-contracting     equilibrium.     The second part of (A6) implies that the retailer’s

reservation    utility constraint does not bind in a contracting        equilibrium   (see the expression for the

retailer’s payoff in proposition    2. 1). Condition (A7) says that each manufacturer            earns weakly less

when its rival has an optimal exclusive relationship        than in any other circumstance        where its contract

is rejected.    This condition is automatically    satisfied whenever a manufacturer         earns the same payoff

(e.g. zero) in any circumstance      where its contract is rejected.

         The following result characterizes       the undominated       equilibria of our contracting   game:



                                                            9
          Proportion 2.1: Suppose that (A 1) - (A6) hold. In any undominated equilibrium of the

contracting model, manufacturer j (j = A,B) earns max {R, HA, HB} - H: (where i # j) and the

retailer receives a payofl of g-‘~~ + ~~ - max {k, II*, IIB}).

          (i)       If max {HA, ~B} > ~,             then any undominated equilibrium involves the retailer

                    contracting with only one manufacturer j, with ~ = max {HA, HB}. ~e equilibrium

                    contract and retailer action (y, uj) solve (1) for U = g“l@ - ~.                           Moreover, if (A7)

                    holds, then no common equilibria exist in this case.

          (ii)      If k     > max {HA, HB), then all undominared equilibria are common equilibria. ~e

                    equilibrium conrracts and retailer action choice (P~,P;,ti)                 are elements of the set

                    &(g”’(rI: + I-I: - fi)).

         (iii)      lf R = max {~A, HB}, fhen both types of equilibria described in (i) and (ii) arise as

                    undominated equilibria.


         Proposition       2.1 tells us that the contracting   outcome in any undominated             equilibrium     of a

model satisfying (A 1) - (A6) must correspond             to the contracting   structure that maximizes aggregate

manufacturer     payoffs for any given level of retailer utility.        Note that in the case in which utility is

transferable,    so that g(U) = U for all U > 0, the equilibrium                   stticture    is therefore    also the one

that maximizes the aggregate payoff of the manufacturers               and the retailer.        Each manufacturer’s      payoff

in this equilibrium    is the difference    between the aggregate manufacturer             profit generated by this

structure and the profit that can be generated by the other manufacturer                   in an exclusive relationship.

         Finally, suppose we define          =’(u)    = fic - g(U)   to be the maximized joint profit in an intrinsic

common agency game with reservation             utility   U if the two manufacturers            cooperated in their choice

of contracts     (P;, P;).    In many settings (including all of those considered              in sections 3 through 5), it

is the case that ~      > Max {HA, HB} (e.g. as long as cooperating                 manufacturers      can replicate an

exclusive outcome by having one manufacturer               offer a prohibitively      high price per unit).        When this is

                                                               10
so, Proposition-2. 1 tells us that a necessav condition for exclusive dealing to arise (uniquely) in an
                                           —
undominated equilibrium is that ~ < ~: there must be some loss to the manufacturers arising from

externalities associated with the noncooperative offering of non-exclusive contracts.


3. The Simplest Model

         We begin our analysis by studying the potential for exclusive dealing in the simplest possible

setting in which it might arise.         The model corresponds        closely to the environment       envisioned by

Bork. In particular,      we assume that the retailer directly controls the level of retail sales for each

manufacturer     j, henceforth    denoted xj. Thus, uj = xj,          Ej =R+, & = (xA, x,),         and~         = R:.

Manufacturer     j can observe and verify xj, as well as the nature of j’s relation with the retailer

(exclusive or non-exclusive);       however, j is unable either to observe or to verify the level of retail sales

made on behalf of manufacturer           -j (x.j). Thus, each manufacturer        can offer a contract that ties

monetary payments to its own sales, as well as to the nature of its relationship                  with the retailer, but

cannot tie payments to sales of another manufacturer’s               product.b   It follows that the payment functions

map sales to monetary       transfers,    P; : R+~R,        s=c,e.

         Having chosen the levels of retail sales x = (xA,x~), the retailer receives revenues R(xA,x~)

(for convenience, we sometimes write R(xj,x.j)). Each manufacturer incurs production costs of cj(xj).

Thus, T;(P:, P;, x’) = P;(x; ) - Cj(x;), ~(P;, x;)                   = P;(x;)    - Cj(x;), U’(P:, P;, x’) =

R(x;,x;) - P;(x;) - P;(x;),       and     uJ(P~, x~) = R(xj, O) - P~(x~) .             It is easy to check that this

version of the general model satisfies (A 1) through (A4).               In addition, a manufacturer       earns zero if the

retailer rejects its offer, and the retailer earns zero if it rejects both manufacturers’              offers.     Hence   m:




     ‘As shown in a previous version of this paper (Bemheim and Winston,      1992), our analysis is essentially unchanged when
one permits manufacturers to condition payments on each others’ sales. The central difference is that, under this alternative
assumption, manufacturers can always write nominally non-exclusive contracts that are equivalent to exclusive contracts (e.g.
by permitting the retailer to serve olher manufacturers, while penalizing the retailer heavily whenever the sales of another
manufacturer are positive). Thus, the alternative assumption obscures the formal distinction between exclusive and non-exclusive
contracts without adding to the substantive content of the problem.


                                                               11

           In this setting, a fully integrated vertical structure would choose to produce and sell

                                                                                                   j=A,B




which, for convenience           only, we assume to be unique.                 On the other hand, were only product j

available,    a vertically     integrated firm consisting of the retailer and firm j would select


                                              Xj ●   = argmax,        R(xj ,0)        - Cj(xj) ,                                      (4)


We assume that



(Bl)         R(x~,     O) - CA(X~)        >   R(O,     Xi)    -      C~(X~)      >     0,



so that product A is the more profitable of the two products if only one of them can be sold.’                                 In

addition, we assume that the two products are substitutes,                           in the following sense:



(B2)         R(x*”)         _ CA(X~”)    _ C~(X~”)        <       ~        [R(xj”,     O) _ Cj(Xj* )].
                                                              j=A,    B




Assumption      (B2) implies that product j contributes                   less in incremental      profits when product -j is also

sold than it does when it is the only product sold in the market.



          A. Analysis of equilibria

          To apply the results of section 2, we must first characterize the functions Hj(u)                               and F(U),

Recall that xj- maximizes the joint profits attainable in an exclusive relationship between the retailer

and manufacturer       j.     Moreover, in an intrinsically exclusive setting, manufacturer                       j could extract all of

the economic surplus associated with this choice by writing a “forcing contract. ” The contract would




    7 If the first inequality in (B]) holds with equality, all of our results continue to hold, but there are also exclusive equilibrium
(possibly dominated) in which B is served; see proposition 2.1.


                                                                      12
require the retailer to choose xj’, and would specify a level of compensation                       such that the retailer’s

participation   constraint just binds.      Since    Q = O, it follows that



           Hj(U)       e H;(U)   e R(xj” ,0)       _ ci(xj”)     _ U .                                                    (5)


         Now consider an intrinsic common agency game with retailer utility U. Recall that x“

maximizes the joint profits attainable when the retailer represents both manufacturers.                           Thus,

R(U)     < R(x     ●   “ ) - CA(X1”) - c,(x; ” ) - U - fi.                  In fact, there exist equilibria that achieve

this upper bound on ~(U);          that is, for this simple model, there are no relevant contracting

externalities for the manufacturers.         One such equilibrium               involves forcing contracts:   the payments to

A and B are set at a level that provides the retailer with reservation                    utility U conditional    upon

choosing x-, and each firm j demands an infinite payment for any xjc * xj””,                          Another involves “sell-

out” contracts of the form Pjc(xj)          = Fj + Cj(xj), which essentially transfer to the retailer the full

marginal returns from the sale of each product j in return for fixed payments Fj. It follows that:


           ti(u)       =R(x”*)     -CA(X;     *)    -CB(X;      ”)    -U    .
                                                                                                                          (6)

         In light of equations (5) and (6), it is evident that (A5) is satisfied; simply take g(U) = U,

 ~j    = ~~ = R(xj”, O) _ cj(xj”),            and ~          = R(x” *) - c~(x~ “ ) - c~(x~ “).            Moreover, @l) and

(B2) imply that (A6) is satisfied, and (A7) holds because a manufacturer                       whose contract is rejected

always earns zero. Thus, Proposition 2.1 holds.                  It follows immediately        that undominated      equilibria

always yield the outcome that maximizes the joint payoffs for the entire vertical structure (consisting

of the retailer and both manufacturers):           the parties behave as if they were a single integrated firm.

         Can exclusion arise in this context?            Expressions        (3), (4), and @l) imply ~         > HA > H’. If

x** # X*, then fi         > HA and the equilibrium             outcome necessarily entails positive sales on behalf of

both manufacturers       (proposition   2.1, part (ii)).       If x --     = X*, then R       = II* and manufacturer       B

makes no sales in equilibrium.          However,      in that case, even a fully integrated firm would find it

                                                                     13
optimal to refrarn from selling B’s product.           Moreover,    this outcome can be sustained in a common

equilibrium    (Proposition   2.1 part (iii)); formal contractual exclusion of manufacturer                B is superfluous.

        We summarize the implications            of proposition    2.1 in the following result:



        Proposition 3.1: In any undominated equilibrium, the retailer chooses x“-, manufacturer j

earns its marginal contribution to joint profits, [R( x ●*) _            CA(X~-)     -   CB(X~”)]      -   [R(O>X~)       _ c.j(x-~ )],

and the retailer earns ~           [R(xj- ,0)   – cj(xj- )] – [R(x - “ ) - CA(X; ) – c~(x~ - )].
                                                                                     ●                        mere is always
                          j=A, B


a common equilibrium yielding this undominated outcome.


        Thus, undominated          equilibria always maximize the joint payoffs of the retailer and both

manufacturers.     Moreover,       even when an undominated        equilibrium     outcome entails no sales for

manufacturer     B, this outcome can always be achieved through non-exclusionary                    contracts.



        B. Policy implications

        For the simple model considered in this section, our analysis substantially                   corroborates        Bork’s

[1978] argument (quoted in the introduction)           that exclusive dealing cannot be used profitably              to

foreclose a rival from a market. Because each manufacturer must effectively compensate the retailer

to attract him to an exclusive dealing contract, manufacturers internalize the retailer’s cost from the

loss in product variety arising under exclusivity.          As a result, the market outcome is exactly that

which would arise with a fully integrated vertical structure.            Indeed, just as Bork asserts, in

equilibrium    each manufacturer       extracts a profit exactly equal to the incremental           value of its product.

        In light of our results, it is surprising that, using a model similar to ours in many respects,

Mathewson and Winter [1987] obtain strikingly different results. In their model, producers offer

wholesale contracts to the retailer on a take-it-or-leave-it         basis.   These contracts specify a wholesale

price and possibly an exclusive dealing requirement.              In Mathewson      and Winter’s model, exclusive

dealing arises as the unique equilibrium          outcome for a range of parameter         values (when it does arise,

                                                             14
exclusive dealing may either raise or lower welfare relative to the non-exclusive                     outcome).

          The key difference between our model and that of Mathewson-Winter                        concerns the set of

feasible contracts.s     In our notation, Mathewson          and Winter only allow contracts of the form

P;(xj)    ‘ w~xj and p~(xj)         = Wjcxj for constants Wje and Wjc. These restrictions                create contracting

externality ies for the manufacturers,       and Iargel y account for the differences         between our findings.         Even

the flexibility to charge fixed fees would, in a broad range of circumstances,                    restore our results.      The

importance     of fixed fees is easily understood        in the context of Bork’s argument.            If a manufacturer

insists on exclusivity, it must compensate the retailer for the loss of surplus associated with selling

other products.      If a fixed fee is not available, then the manufacturer             can only compensate        the retailer

by reducing its wholesale price.          However, this form of compensation             alters the retailer’s    incentives

on the quantity margin; its value to the retailer is therefore less than its cost to the manufacturer.

          Proposition    3.1 implies that the retailer and manufacturers            act as an integrated unit.        However,

in contrast to Bork’s assertion,        it does not follow that the equilibrium         maximizes social surplus unless

the retailer is able to extract all of consumer surplus (say, through perfect price discrimination).                       From

a social perspective,     the fully integrated solution can involve the production              of either too many or too

few products and inefficient retail pricing.’           Nevertheless,     in this model, Bork is correct in asserting

that a ban on exclusive dealing cannot promote social welfare.                  Formally,     we model this prohibition           as

the restriction   that Pjc(~j) = Pje(xj),      so that manufacturer       j is prevented    from conditioning

compensation      on the retailer’s decision to serve -j. The following result demonstrates                  that a




     There are also some differences in the timing of decisions. In MaLhewson and Winter, bolh firms first decide whether to
insist on exclusivity; if either does, then both compete in the offering of exclusive contracts (otherwise, the retailer sells the
products of both manufacturers).      However, if we were to change the timing of contract offers in our model while retaining
flexibility in the form of the contracts, the basic conclusions of our analysis would be unaltered.

     ‘For example, consider the case where demand for the products is almost completely independent. If a monopolist can only
offer simple per unit prices to consumers, then it has too little incentive to carry each product individually. In contrast, if the
monopolist can bundle multiple products, introducing a second product may increase profits by more than the consumer surplus
it generates (this would certainly be true if by bundling it could fully extract consumer surplus). S= Tirole [1988, pp. 104-5].


                                                                15
prohibition on exclusionary contracts leaves the equilibrium outcome unaffected.’0


          Proposition 3.2: Suppose that manufacturers are restricted to ofer contracts satisfying

P:(xj)    = P;(xj).         men there is an equilibrium in which the retailer accepts both manufacturers’

contracts, chooses x*”,and payofs are exactly as in proposition 3.1. Funhermore, this equilibrium

weakly dominates for the manufacturers) any other equilibrium of this game. 11


          Although propositions                3.1 and 3.2 appear to confirm much of Bork’s reasoning,                                  in one

important sense they fail to do so: exclusionary                               provisions     are superfluous          in this model.     Whether

exclusionary provisions are permissible has no effect on undominated                                            equilibrium   outcomes,      which are

always achievable through non-exclusionary                              contracts,      even when one manufacturer                 is effectively

excluded (i.e. makes no sales).                    Hence, in this model, there is no reason either to ban or not to ban

these arrangements.           Thus, the present model may provide a poor framework                                        for understanding         the

effects of the excltts~onary contracts that are observed in practice.                                     In the next two sections, we turn

our attention to models in which exclusionary                             provisions serve a meaningful                 purpose.



4. Exclusive dealing with non-coincident market effects

          One frequently           cited mot ive for exclusive dealing is the desire to create or enhance market

power.     Yet in the model of section 3, no such effect could occur:                                         The equilibrium      market outcome

always maximized            the total profits of the vertical structure,                        and it achieved effective exclusivity               (where

jointly efficient) without any explicit exclusionary                             provisions.



      10Proposition 3.2 does not follow directly from proposition 3.1, despite the fact that undo minatcd equilibria nd  never
employ exclusive contracts. As a formal matter, the prohibition on exclusionary contracts changes the nature of manufacturers’
strategies, and could in principle subtly alter their incentives.

    llO.Bnen   and Shaffer [199 I ] analyze a model (hat is                equivalent   to   this restrict~    game.   They show that in any equilibrium
of this restricted game, the quantities chosen by the retailer ( x;, x; ) must satisfy

~“ = argma~, [R(xj,   x;)     -   CJ(XJ)   -   C+( x;)]   for   j   =   A,B.    Thus, if integrated protits are strictly concave, all equilibria result
in x- being chosen.


                                                                                  16
            Thus far, however,       we have confined our attention to a single set of vertically             related parties,

considered      in isolation.    Commentators       have also expressed concern that the exclusion of competitors

from one market might enhance a firm’s power in other markets.                         In this section, we show that the

concern over what we shall call non-coincident market effects does indeed have a valid theoretical

foundation:      When such effects are introduced            into the model of section 3, exclusive dealing may arise

in an undominated        equilibrium     precisely because of its ability to etiance          market power.

            We explore the role of non-coincident            market effects for an illustrative      model in which two

retail markets develop sequentially,           and where important economies can be achieved only by serving

more than one market. tz As in section 3, effective exclusion occurs whenever                       it is jointly optimal for

the manufacturers        and the retailer in the first market.         Unlike section 3, however,       exclusion may be

jointly optimal for these pat-ties precisely because it reduces competition                  in the Iaterdeveloping     retail

market.      Moreover,     when exclusion is optimal for these parties it may be impossible to achieve this

outcome in the absence of explicit exclusionary               provisions.      In addition, we examine the effects of

banning explicit exclusion.          We demonstrate       that this does not always end effective exclusion.           Indeed,

in the presence of a ban, effective exclusion may be achieved through even less efficient practices.



            A. The model

            We suppose that initially there is a single retail market (market 1), served by a single retailer

(retailer    1). With time, however,        another retail market (market 2), again served by a single retailer

(retailer 2), becomes viable.          Manufacturers      and retailers can enter into long-term        contracts.    Thus,

prior to the emergence of market 2, manufacturers                  can enter into contracts with retailer      1 that govern

sales made after the emergence of market 2. Manufacturers                       cannot, however,    contract with retailer 2

for sales in market 2 until this second market emerges,                  The important feature of this setting is that the



    IzSimilar “on.coin~ident    market effects can arise in other contexts,     for example when an exclusive contract betw~n    a
manufacturer   and a retailer reduces competition   for the manufacturer’s   inputs.


                                                                  17
manufacturers      can contract with retailer       1 for future sales before retailer 2 comes on the scene.                  To

isolate this effect, we suppress all sales in market 1 that occur prior to the emergence of market 2 (one

can easily make earlier sales explicit at the expense of some additional notation).

           Competition    between the two manufacturers            unfolds in three phases.             In phase 1, they engage

in a contracting     game with retailer 1. As in section 3, the manufacturers                       offer contracts,   and the

retailer then chooses contracts and quantities.            Production,          however,       does not occur until phase 3.’3

Retailer     1‘s has a continuous revenue function          R,(xAl,x~,),         where        xj~ denotes manufacturer     j’s sales

to retailer n. In phase 2, each manufacturer             j has the opportunity           to make invest of fixed sum (<) in

cost reduction.      If the investment     is made, j produces output at a unit cost of cj. If j forgoes this

investment,     unit costs are instead cj + 6j, where ~j > 0. In phase 3, having observed each other’s

investment decisions,         the two manufacturers      engage in a contracting              game with retailer 2 (as in section

3). Retailer 2’s revenue function is R,(xA,,x,2 ). Finally, production                         is carried out and the retailers

make the payments required by their contracts.                As in section 3, a retailer earns zero if it accepts no

contracts,    and a manufacturer      earns zero in any market where the retailer rejects its contract.

           For the sake of simplicity,        we focus on the case where KA = 6A = O, and b~ = + m.                         In

other words, we assume that manufacturer               A has no further opportunities               to reduce cost, and that

manufacturer B cannot produce at all unless the investment is undertaken.                            These assumptions      imply

that A may be able to eliminate competition             from B in market 2 by excluding B from market 1.

However,      B does not have a symmetric          incentive to exclude A from market 1.

           It is convenient     to define for each market       n = 1,2 the profit levels


                                         ~=      max X {Rn(x)        -   CAXA     -   CBXB}     ,




and



     ‘The retailer’s choice of quantifies can also be delayed without affecting the conclusions,       but the game is somewhat easier
to solve if this decision is made immediately.

                                                                18
                                        ~   . njn =          Max   ,,{Rn(xj,O)   - Cjxj} ,


As in section 3, these would be the joint payoffs from common and exclusive outcomes,                          were only

market      n to exist.   In parallel to our notation in section 3, we denote the (unique) solutions to these

maximizations by (x~~, x~l), and            x;.   O = A,B)         respective y, and assume that these quantities are

strictly positive.    We also assume that (B2) holds in each market, so LA + ~’                      > fin for n = 1, 2.

         To focus attention on the cases of greatest interest, we define the following conditions:


 (cl)                                               0<~-H~<K,



 (C2)



 (C3)                                       ~+~-H:-ll:-K,                         >O

These conditions are easily interpreted,            Condition (C 1) states that manufacturer          B’s contribution   to

total profit in market 2 is positive, but strictly less than B’s required investment.                  Since B’s profits in

market 2 (gross of K~ and conditional upon having invested in phase 2) are given by the middle term

in expression    (Cl) (see proposition      3. 1), this condition implies that, if excluded from market 1, B will

neither invest in phase 2 nor compete against A in market 2 during phase 3; thus, (Cl) creates the

potential for a non-coincident        market effect.     Condition (C2) states that the joint payoffs for retailer 1

and the two manufacturers        are higher if B is excluded from market 1 (given B’s subsequent decision

not to participate    in market 2), than if B makes sales to retailer 1. The intuition developed                  in section

3 suggests that this condition is required to generate effectively exclusive outcomes in market 1.

Condition     (C3) indicates that, if retailer 2’s profits are also considered,              aggregate profits are

maximized      when B participates.      To the extent the retailers practice perfect price discrimination,              this

implies that B’s participation     is socially desirable,           and that B’s exclusion from market 1 is inefficient.

(B2) implies that if (C2) is violated then (C3) holds, but the converse is not true.

                                                                    19
         We assume throughout           that (C 1) and (C3) are satisfied, and we investigate the properties         of

equilibria contingent upon whether (C2) holds.



         B. Equilibrium exclusion

         To solve for equilibria,        we begin with phase 3. If B has chosen to invest in phase 2, then

phase 3 payoffs for manufacturer           j are given by ~    - ~,   i * j (see part (ii) of proposition     2. 1). If B

has chosen not to invest, then manufacturer          A faces no competition     in market 2. In that case, A

extracts all of the potential rents from retailer 2, earning ~A.

         Next consider the phase 2 investment decision of manufacturer               B. If retailer     1 has chosen a

positive quantity for B (x~l > O), manufacturer          B certainly invests (otherwise B would incur infinite

losses since its contract would require it to produce x~l at infinite costs).           If retailer 1 has an exclusive

relationship   with A or has simply chosen x~, = O, then B chooses not to invest (given (Cl) and part

(ii) of proposition   2. 1).

         Finally, consider the phase 1 contract offers by manufacturers              A and B to retailer     1. Note that

the phase 1 problem can be treated as the type of game considered              in section 2, provided that we

define payoffs appropriately       to reflect outcomes on the equilibrium       continuation   paths.     In particular,

we can solve the phase 1 contracting          problem with retailer 1 by studying an equivalent single market

model, in which the costs of manufacturers           A and B are given by


                          CA(XAI
                              XBI) !        = CAXA,- I-I; - 1(X,, > o)~          -   H: - n:)

and


                                 CB(XBL)= CBXB1- 1(x,, > 0)(~             -   n:- K,)     ,


where the indicator function           I(x~l > O) equals unity when x~l > 0, and zero otherwise.

         Note that this equivalent single market model differs from the class considered                 in section 3 in

one important respect:         A’s implicit “costs” depend upon B’s production,         as well as A’s production.

                                                              20
However, this model satisfies the assumptions needed to apply Proposition 2.1 ((A1)-(A7)),                                         with

u“ =o,         m:=rI;,7r:=o,




           The last inequality above reflects the fact that the cooperative                                 common outcome in this setting

depends on whether (C2) is satisfied.                           When (C2) holds, it involves quantities of (x~,, O) in market 1

and a joint payoff to the manufacturers                          of HA = H? + ~~,            while when (C2) is reversed (strictly),

the cooperative            common outcome involves quantities of (x~~,x~~) in market 1 and a joint payoff to

the manufacturers              of          ~      + ~    (~-   - Hi) - KB.          The maximal level of joint profits in a

noncooperative            equilibrium             of this intrinsic common agency game,                R,     is bounded above by ~.

           Note that when (C2) holds we have                            HA = fic > k,         and the cooperative        common outcome in

market 1 involves quantities of (x~l,O).                           Hence, by Proposition         2.1, any undominated        equilibrium   of

the contracting           game must involve quantities in market 1 of (x~l, O) (i.e. an undominated                               equilibrium

must either be exclusive,                      or be a common equilibrium            that implements          (X:l, O)). Exclusion of

manufacturer             B from market 1 is jointly efficient for retailer 1 and the two manufacturers                           because the

joint loss in market 1 from reduced variety,                             m; - H:),     is more than made up by the joint gain

can be attractive in this model precisely because of anticompetitive            effects in a non-coincident    market.

          In contrast,    if (C2) is reversed (strictly), then ~      > HA and the cooperative       common

outcome involves quantities of (x~~, x~~) # (x~l,O).              Moreover,   it can be verified that (x~~, x~~) is

sustainable    in this case as an intrinsic common agency game equilibrium               outcome through forcing

contracts,    and so fi    = tic.   Proposition   2.1 therefore    implies that any undominated     equilibrium    of the

contracting    model in this case is a common equilibrium           with quantities in market 1 of (x~~, xJ;),

          We summarize       these conclusions    in the following proposition:



          Proposition 4,1: Men (C2) holds, all undominated equilibria involve eflective exclusion of

manufacturer B @om markt 1 (i.e. x~l = O). Men the inequality in (C2) is (strictly) reversed, no

undominated equilibrium involves efective exclusion of manufacturer B from market 1.


          Of course, as we have emphasized          in section 3, there is an important distinction between

effective exclusion and explicit exclusion.         Indeed, for the single market setting of section 3, we found

that explicit exclusionary     provisions    were superfluous:     whenever exclusion was jointly optimal for the

retailer and the two manufacturers,         this could be achieved through a common equilibrium.           However,

the logic of that finding depended critically on the assumption that A’s costs are independent                of B’s

sales.   This assumption     permitted    the firms to support (x: , O) using “sell out” contracts that

transferred   all residual variation     in profits, without violating the restriction     that a common contract

cannot condition compensation          on the sales of a rival.    In the current context, A’s implicit “costs”

(CA(XA1,X,,))do depend upon B’s sales; thus, absent an ability to condition compensation                on B’s sales,

A cannot transfer all residual profit variation to retailer         1. This implies that contracts between retailer

1 and B may impose externalities          on A.

         In particular,    when (C2) holds, a deviation from the jointly efficient outcome,           (x~, O), may

benefit retailer 1 and manufacturer         B precisely because positive sales for B impose a negative



                                                            22
external ity on A. When will this externality               be of sufficient size to justify the deviation?              To answer

this question, we define the following set:



       D =
                (X,l    I max.,,
                             [R,(XA,
                                   ,xB,)            - CBXB,+ l(x,l          > O)@         - II:    - K,)
                                                                                                           1
                                                                                                               < R,(xA,, O)
                                                                                                                               }
                                                                                                                                     .


In other words, XA1 E D if and only if retailer 1 and manufacturer                         B cannot jointly benefit by

arranging      a deviation from (x~l,O) to (xAl,x~l) for any x~l > 0. Henceforth,                        we will refer to D as the

deterrence     set.    One would expect to observe explicit exclusionary                  practices whenever x~l @ D, since

in this case ~         < ~    = HA. This intuition is confirmed              in the following       result:



          Proportion 4.2: Men (C2) holds, undominated equilibria necessarily involve an explicit

exclusive dealing provision if and only ;~x~l @ D.


          Note the implications of this result: when (C2) holds and x~l & D, retailer                            1 agrees to an

explicitly exclusive arrangement            with manufacturer        A in order to enhance A’s market power in a non-

coincident market.        The retailer is willing to enter into this arrangement                  because the exclusive contract

provides the retailer with a sufficiently           large share of the incremental           surplus extracted in the non-

coincident market. Given (C3), this outcome is inefficient, in the sense that it fails to maximize total

retailer and producer        surplus,   Even under the assumption that retailers can perfectly price

discriminate     (which, as explained in the last section, is implicit in Bork’s analysis),                     exclusive dealing

depresses social welfare.’5         Our analysis therefore provides a theoretical                 foundation    for the concern

that market foreclosure        through exclusive dealing can be anticompetitive.              ‘d



          C. The effects of banning exclusive dealing

          The preceding       section raises the possibility that, under certain circumstances,               exclusive dealing

can be characterized       as an anticompetitive       practice with adverse consequences           for social welfare.          This

observation suggests a potential role for antitrust policy. One possibility would be to impose a ban on

exclusive dealing, which we model as in section 3. However,                     as we now show, when an inefficient

market outcome arises that involves exclusive dealing, the welfare effects of such a ban are

ambiguous;      it may make things even worse.

          To develop intuition, we begin by assuming that (C2) holds.                    Thus, in the absence of a ban on

exclusionary     practices,    the equilibrium    necessarily    involves effective exclusion.         If, in addition,

x~l ● D, then it is possible to achieve effective exclusion without an explicit contractual                       restriction.

For this case, it is natural to conjecture that a ban an explicit exclusionary                  practices would be

irrelevant.    Of greater interest is the case where x~l              @ D.   Without a ban, equilibrium          involves

explicit exclusion.      However,      it does not necessarily follow that the imposition of a ban would end

effective exclusion of manufacturer           B. Although it is impossible in this case to sustain an effectively

exclusive equilibrium         wherein A produces       x~l it may nevertheless        be possible to achieve an

exclusionary     outcome through the use of a contract that induces retailer                1 to choose some ‘*1 ~ D.

Based on the intuition developed in the preceding sections, one might expect to obtain such an

outcome as long as the joint profits for retailer            1, manufacturer      A, and manufacturer        B exceed the

joint profits received by these parties when B makes strictly positive sales in market 1.



     l~he inefficiency of [he equilibrium outcome raises the possibility that renegotiation would alter our central results. Imagine,
for example, that all retailers and manufacturers can jointly renegotiate phase 1 contracts at the beginning of phase 3, and that
after retailer 1 and manufacturer A have entered into an exclusive relation in phase 1, B has nevertheless invested in phase 2.
Retailer 1 and manufacturer A should be willing to renegotiate their contract to permit sales by B. However, B will typically
share the surplus gained through renegotiation with these parties. If B’s share is sufficiently small, even the anticipation of
renegotiation will fail to justify investment by manufacturer B once A has consummated an exclusive contract with retailer 1.
Thus, as long as B’s bargaining power is not too great, exclusive dealing emerges exactly as in proposition 4.2.

                                                                 24
          Following this intuition,         we define:


                                          iA, = argmax,,,     G D                  0) -   CAXA1
                                                                                              ]
                                                                    [ ‘I(XAI   ~




Retailer 1 and manufacturer A receive higher joint profits in market 1 from iA1 than from any other

output level in the deterrence           set D. Effective exclusion of B through selection of iAl maximizes the

total profits of retailer         1 and borh manufacturers     whenever


 (C4)



Note that when x~l G D, we have ‘*I = x~l, which implies that (C4) and (C2) are equivalent.

When x~l @ D, condition (C4) is more demanding than (C2).

          With one additional technical assumption, i’ it is possible to prove the following result:



          Proposition 4.3: men              (C4) holds and exclusive dealing is banned, there is an effectively

exclusive equilibrium with sales in markt 1 of ( ‘Al, 0).                      Fu~he~ore*          this is the only equilibrium




          The second half of proposition            4.3 requires clarification.           For previous results, we have

refined the set of equilibria by applying a payoff-dominance                        criterion.     Unfortunately,   this criterion

does not isolate a unique outcome in the current instance.lB                       However,       according   to the proposition,

any such equilibrium          necessarily has the feature that, for some out-of-equilibrium                    level(s) of x~l,

manufacturer         B’s offer,     P~l(x~l),   fails to cover the true incremental              costs that B incurs in producing

x~l. In such cases, B’s equilibrium              contract offer is weakly dominated by another contract that covers




    “Specifically,    detine D’ analogously to D, replacing   < with <.        Assume that D = CIOS(D+).


     l~ile  effectively exclusive equilibria are Pareto ranked (with first period sales of ( iAl, O) generating the dominant result),
we believe it is possible in some instances to construct common equilibria that give manufacturer B positive payoffs in market
1, in which case the payoff-dominance criterion cannot rule out some non-exclusive equilibria.


                                                                    25
incremental      costs in all instances.   The exclusive equilibrium          does not suffer from this problem.

         Note the implications        of proposition    4.3.   Suppose that condition (C2) is satisfied, and that

x~l E D.        Proposition   4,2 tells us that, when exclusive dealing is permitted,              (x~l ,0) is in fact

sustainable without explicit exclusion.            By proposition     4.3, the same outcome is sustainable once

exclusive deal ing is banned (recall that x~l ~ D implies iA1 = x~l, which in turn -- given (C2) --

implies (C4)).      Thus, as one would expect, a ban on exclusive dealing does not deter non-explicit

exclusion.      Next, suppose that (C2) is satisfied, but that x~l @ D.              Proposition     4.2 tells us that, when

exclusive dealing is permitted         (x~l ,0) will be sustained through explicitly exclusionary                  provisions.

In such cases, (C4) may or may not hold.               Proposition     4.3 tells us that, when (C4) does not hold, the

ban on exclusive dealing fails to end B’s exclusion.                Rather, it induces A to engage in non-explicit

exclusion by inducing retailer        1 to purchase enough output from A to render B’s participation

unprofitable.      That is, explicit exclusion is replaced by implicit exclusion through quantity forcing or

quantity discounts.      .The welfare consequences         of this response are ambiguous.           If retailer     1 practices

perfect price discrimination        (as assumed implicitly by Bork), social welfare declines.               If retailer 1 is

instead a conventional        non-discriminating     monopolist,     the increase in A’s output may enhance welfare

(unless deterrence      of B requires A’s output to be sufficiently          excessive from a social perspective).

         Proposition     4.3 does not imply that a ban on explicit exclusion is always ineffective.                     Indeed,

the following result identifies conditions under which the intended effect materializes.



         Proposition 4.4: When the inequality in (C4) is (strictly) reversed and exclusive dealing is

banned, there is an equilibrium in which both manufacturers’ contracts are accepted, and sales in

market 1 are (x~~ ,x~~ ) > 0. Furthermore, all undominated equilibria have x~l > 0.


         Note that, in this case, the payoff-dominance               criterion isolates equilibria    in which

manufacturer      B is not excluded from market 1. We have not established that this criterion uniquely



                                                               26
selects (x~~,x~~).       However, if one assumes that joint payoffs in market 1 are strictly concave in

(xA,,x,,)      when   x,, > 0,     it is easy to verify that this is the unique undominated           equilibrium   outcome.

            To understand      the implications    of proposition      4.4, begin by assuming that (C2) holds, but that

(C4) does not (this requires         x~, @ D).       According to proposition       4.2, explicit exclusion will emerge

when exclusive dealing is permitted.              Proposition     4.4 implies that the imposition of a ban ends

effective exclusion,     as intended.     Since (C4) implies (C2), proposition           4.4 also indicates that, in the

presence of a ban on exclusive dealing, non-exclusionary                   outcomes will emerge when (C2) fails.        This

is not very surprising,        since the failure of (C2) leads to non-exclusive          outcomes in the absence of a

ban (see proposition        4.1 ). However,       this does not mean that the ban is irrelevant        in such cases.

Indeed, in the course of proving proposition             4.4, we isolate a condition under which the imposition of

a ban on exclusive dealing shifts payoffs from retailer 1 to manufacturer                  B (see the appendix for

details).    In essence, the impossibility        of explicit exclusion may improve B’s ability to extract rents

from retailer     1, even in cases where the original equilibrium             does not involve exclusion.

            Our findings can be summarized           as follows.       If outcomes are non-exclusive    when exclusive

dealing is permitted,       they remain non-exclusive           once a ban is imposed.     However,    payoffs may shift

from retailer 1 to manufacturer          B. If non-explicit       exclusion arises when exclusive dealing is

permitted,     it will also emerge when a ban is imposed.               Finally, if explicit exclusion occurs when

exclusive dealing is permitted,         a ban can lead to either of two results.         In some cases, it ends

exclusivity,    as intended.     But in other cases, explicit exclusion is replaced by implicit exclusion,

achieved through a contract that induces the retailer to sell so much of A’s output that B’s participation

is rendered unprofitable.         In these cases, a ban on exclusive dealing may raise or lower social welfare.



5. Exclusive Dealing as a Consequence of Incentive Conflicts

            In Section 4 we saw how introducing           non-coincident      market effects into the model of Section 3

could produce exclusive dealing in equilibrium.                 A commonly expressed alternative view of exclusive

                                                                  27
dealing, however,          is that it arises in response to a manufacturer’s          fear that common representation

would subject the retailer to conflicting             incentives.    In this section, we show how exclusive dealing

can indeed arise when problems of incentive provision are introduced                       into the model of Section 3.



           A. The model

           We focus here on one possible form of incentive conflict at the retail level by considering                                a

situation in which the retailer chooses non-verifiable                   prices for each of the products he carries.lg               We

denote the retail price of product               j by pj for j = A,B.          When both products are carrid               by the

retailer, price choices of (pA, p~) lead to a stochastic realization of demand for each product                                j,

given by xj = Oqj(p., p,).             where      d c R+ is a non-negative       random variable with distribution

function    *(O).     We adopt the normalization           that E(6) = 1, so that qJ@*, p,)              represents

manufacturer        j’s    expected sales level given retail prices           (PA, p~). When only firm j is carried by

the retailer and its retail price is pj, its sales are xi = Oqj@j, m).                   Manufacturer       j‘s     production

costs are cj per unit, and for simplicity we assume that the retailer’s only costs are the costs of

acquiring products from the manufacturers.                 We also assume that ~(cj, m) > 0 for j = A,B.

           As before, each manufacturer              j is restricted to offer contracts that condition compensation                       on

sales of manufacturer          j’s    product,    but not on sales for manufacturer        -j or on the retailer’s chosen

prices.    Moreover,        we restrict these payments to be linear in own sales (actual incentive contracts

often have this relatively simple structure;             for one formal justification,      see Rey-Tirole        [1986]).          Thus,



           @~ = ~         = {pj(o):    There exist     Fj and ~j such that Pj(xj) = Fj +          ~jxj    for all     Xj   >   o).


           We assume also that the retailer maximizes expected utility and has a Bernoulli utility function



     ‘~or example, the true price charged by a new car dealer is often unverifiable bwause of trade-ins. The retailer’s price
choice in this model could also be interpreted as the choice of a non-obsewable level of service that has a monetary value to
customers equal to its cost of provision. In any case, the basic points develo@ below hold for much more general kinds of non-
observable marketing choices.


                                                                    28
of the constant “absolute risk-aversion                    form,     u(w) = 1 - e-w, where              a > 0. The constant absolute

risk aversion assumption                 makes the model conform to assumption                       (A5).m The assumption of

positive risk-aversion             (a > O) causes the provision of incentives to be costly in the model (i. e., the

first-best is not attainable) and thereby introduces the possibility of externalities                                   in incentive provision

across manufacturers.                  Final Iy, as in section 3, a manufacturer earns zero if his contract is not

accepted, and the retailer earns zero if he rejects both manufacturers’                                 offers.       With this assumption,

the model satisfies (A6) and (A7)                    (qj(cj, w ) >0           implies     ~    > O).

           Before proceeding,               we should stress that although we focus on a model of moral hazard with

risk-aversion         here, similar points could be established                     in other types of models involving costly

incentive provision,            For example,          Marvel’s [1982] (informal) explanation                    for exclusive dealing in

terms of protecting           manufacturer          quasi-rents      can be viewed formally as an example of double moral

hazard (manufacturers              advertise,      while the risk-neutral            retailer can switch consumers           among brands).

Like our model of moral hazard with risk-aversion,                              the double moral hazard model involves costly

incentive provision           and can be shown to generate similar results.2L’ n

     %iven this fact and the results below, it is surprising that Marvel [1982, pp. 3-4] argues against the view that exclusive
dealing is a device to obtain increased dealer promotional effort.


                                                                              29

(e.g., there exist retail prices                              (pA, p,)       that generate zero sales for either product, or both, with

certainty).          We make the following standard assumption:


@l)         R(”)            is twice continuously dl~erentiable and strictly concave in (~, q,),                                 and

            dR(0)/~~                      ~qB < () at afl (~,                qB) >0.



Under (D 1), the mean sales levels induced by contract terms                                              [(F:,     61), (F:, D;)]     are given by

some continuously differentiable functions                                          q~(d~, ~~j), j = A ,B,        which are nonincreasing in ~     and

nondecreasing                    in       ~~j,     and strictly so at any (d:, ~;)                  such that

  [qi(&A?          6;),               qi(~:>       6;)1       >>        0.

            If, instead, the retailer accepts on]y manufacturer j‘s contract (y, ~), similar logic implies

that it chooses                   qi to maximize                      R(qj, O; ~J, O) . Given (D 1), the solution is a non-increasing,

continuously              differentiable                 function       q;(~)       that is strictly decreasing    at any ~; at which q~@) > 0.



            B. Equilibrium behavior

            Since the model described                                 above satisfies (A 1) - (A7), Proposition          2.1 once again applies.

Recall from our discussion                               in Section 2 that ~             < ~     is a necessary condition for exclusive dealing to

arise in all undominated                           equilibria:         equilibria     in the intrinsic common agency game must involve some

inefficiency.              The next result shows that, under assumption (D 1), this condition always holds when the

cooperative          outcome involves positive expected sales levels of both products.



            Proposition 5.2: Suppose that (D 1) holds and fhar [(F;, d:), (F;, B;)] maximizes fhe

manufacturers’ joint profits in the intrinsic common agency setting with retailer reservation utility


                                                                                            30
u = O. men, -~ [GW;, B;), q:u~,                  6~)1 >>0,        [T:,     BJ,   (F;, ~~)1 is not a Nash equilibrium of

the intrinsic common agen~ game. Hence, if all cooperative contracts involve positive expected sales

for both manufacturers, then R              < ~.


            Proposition 5.1 follows because the presence of retailer risk-aversion makes incentive

provision costly and leads the cooperative contracts to involve some risk-sharing between the retailer

and each manufacturer j; that is, to have (@j* - Cj) > 0. But, as a result of the fact that ~~ - Cj)

> 0, contracting externalities are present across the manufacturers; if manufacturer                        -j lowers   ~.j,   this

causes the retailer to reduce qj and lowers manufacturer                  j’s expected profits.x

            The fact that R       < F     creates the possibility for exclusive dealing to arise in equilibrium.

Indeed, recall from Proposition           2.1 that whenever       k      < max {II*, IIB} no common equilibria exist--

all equilibria     are exclusive.     Thus, if max {HA, HE} is close to F              we can expect exclusive dealing to

arise; intuitively,     the gain from having both products available were the manufacturers                   to cooperate       in

incentive provision is small relative to the loss due to incentive conflicts.

            To see this more concretely,        consider the limiting case in which products            A and B are

perfect substitutes      with identical costs c* = cE = c. It is evident that in this case ~A = ~B = ~,

Hence, as long as fi           < 7,      exclusive dealing must arise in this case.         We cannot use Proposition

5.1 directly here because (D 1) is violated in the limiting case of perfect substitutes.                   However,     the

following result identifies general conditions under which exclusion prevails.



            Proposition 5.2: Consider the case of petfect substitutes with identical costs of production.

Assume that R( qj, O;~j, O) is twice continuously di~erentiable and strictly concave in q at all

qi ~ O. ~en in any exclusive equilibrium (as well as in the jointly optimal common contract) ~ >



       ‘When the retailer is risk-neutral, Lhe derivations in the proof of proposition 5,1 (see Lhe appendix), can be used to show
that    (BJ - Cj) = O for j = A,B. Hence, the cooperative contracts are sell-out contracts, which cr~te no externalities across
manufacturers.     In this case, we would have ~    = F.


                                                                 31
c, while in any equilibrium of the associated intrinsic common agenq game                                        min {F*, fl~ } s c.

~us, k        < fi    = nA, and ail equilibria are exclusive.


         Proposition      5.2 indicates that an optimal exclusive contract and the jointly optimal common

contract have ~ > c. This result is the standard consequence                                    of the tradwff   between risk bearing

and incentives.       In contrast,     in an equilibrium               of the intrinsic common agency game, competition

between manufacturers          drives wholesale prices @) to (or below) marginal cost.

         An interesting contrast to this case arises in the opposite limiting case in which products                                   A

and B are independent           in demand.         In that case, we can write                     Pj (qA, q~) = ~j(qj)      for j = A,B

where    ~j(0) > cj (since           qj(cj, @ ) > O). AS a result, the retailer’s optimal choice                         q~@j, ~.j)

depends only on ~j. Letting              qj(flj) denote this optimal choice, contracts                       [(F:, p;), (F;, ~~)]

maximize the manufacturers’            joint profits in the intrinsic common agency setting with retailer

reservation    utility level   U = O if they solve

However,      since there are no contracting              externalities,          any such pair of contracts must also be a Nash

assumptions     (~,   qB) >>         0 in any cooperative                  common outcome (the argument follows from the fact

that ~j(0) > cj). Hence, nj < 7                    for j = A,B.                Thus, we have the following result:



         Proposition 5.3: Suppose that products A and B are independent in demand.                                          ~en any

undominated equilibrium is a common equilibrium.


         C. The effects of banning exclusive dealing

         We now consider the effect of banning exclusive dealing.                                  For the case of perfect substitutes

                                                                             32
with identical costs of production,      the next proposition   demonstrates   that a ban always leads to an

inefficient outcome (recall from proposition       5.2 that, for efficient incentive schemes, ~ > c).



          Proposition 5.4: Consider the case of pe~ect substitutes with identical costs of production, and

let fig denote the lowest flj among accepted contracts. ~exclusive dealing is banned, then B“ = c

and Fj = O in any contract accepted by the retailer.


          In this case, the welfare consequences      of a ban are simple.     Consumers    benefit from the ban

because lower wholesale price @) leads to lower retail prices.           Manufacturers’     profits are unaffected,

since they always earn zero.       The negative consequences      of inefficient   incentive provision are borne

entirely by the retailer,    whose payoff falls as a result of the ban.

          The second case considered       in the previous subsection might at first seem entirely

straightforward.    Since exclusion does not occur with independent demand, one might well expect a

ban to be inconsequential. Caution is warranted, however; recall that in section 4.C, a ban on

exclusive dealing could alter equilibrium payoffs even if the retailer initially chose to represent both

manufacturers.     In the current instance, the effect of a ban is even more surprising:


          Proposition 5.5: Suppose that products A and B are independent in demand. If exclusive

dealing is banned, no pure strategy equilibrium exists.


          Although we have not verified the existence of mixed strategy equilibria,           we suspect that this

is general] y assured.      However,   as long as the manufacturers’   joint maximization     problem is strictly

concave, mixed strategy equilibria are not second-best          efficient. In that case, a ban on exclusive

dealing cannot yield a Pareto improvement, and may even reduce the payoff to all participants                in the

market.    Thus, by altering the structure of strategic incentives,      a ban on exclusive dealing can reduce

the efficiency of economic activity even in cases where no exclusion occurs.



                                                          33
6. Conclusions

            In this paper, we have attempted both to provide a conceptual framework               for analyzing the

phenomenon        of exclusive dealing and to explore the motivations for and effects of its use,             In our

simplest model, our analysis corroborates           some of the intuitive arguments       concerning    exclusive dealing

advanced by Robert Bork.            In that simple setting, exclusive dealing arises only when it is efficient

(abstracting     from issues concerning      imperfect extraction of consumer surplus).         However,     in that

model, explicit exclusionary         provisions are also superfluous      - banning them is inconsequential.

            By introducing      additional features, however,      we generate models in which these provisions

serve meaningful       functions.     As has been asserted by commentators          opposed to the practice, these

provisions     may be adopted as a means for increasing market power (through non-coincident                   market

effects).     However,   they may also be adopted to ameliorate the incentive conflicts that can arise when

a retailer handles the products of more than one manufacturer,                 as defenders of exclusive dealing have

argued.      These formal models also offer the advantage that they allow us to study explicitly the

implications     of a ban on the practice.      In either case, the welfare consequences       of a ban are complex,

Indeed, even when exclusive deal ing is used to augment market power, a ban on explicit exclusion

may simply lead to even less efficient forms of non-explicit              exclusion.

            The models considered       here do not exhaust the set of possible motivations       for exclusive

dealing; indeed, many others have been suggested.               However, our framework        should be useful for

studying the conditions under which other motivations               are operable,   as well as their consequences       for

behavior.      We have already suggested,       for example, that Marvel’s [1982] explanation           for exclusive

dealing (concerning      the prevention     of manufacturer     free-riding)   could be captured in our framework.

            In any particular    practical setting, it can be difficult to determine     what motivates the use of

exclusive dealing.       For example,     in his discussion of the Standard Fashion case, Marvel [1982] argues

that Standard’s     use of the practice was motivated by a desire to prevent competitors               from copying



                                                              34
patterns that had proven to be popular,        and thereby free-riding    on Standard’s      investments    in pattern

development.        (As Frasco [1991] notes, this argument depends on the absence of a competitive                 retail

sector, since exclusive dealing would not prevent copying to any appreciable                 extent otherwise).        Yet

the facts described by Marvel are also suggestive of the two motivations             that we have modelled here.

For example,       Marvel notes that Standard fared poorly after the decision.        He attributes this to a

competitor’s      new innovation and new entry, without acknowledging           that both of these developments

may have been stimulated by the court’s ban on exclusive dealing (as modelled in section 4). At the

same time, Marvel also notes that the wholesale prices charged by Standard for patterns were

significantly     above the manufacturers’    marginal costs prior to the decision,     which is consistent with

our model of retailer risk-aversion.         Mormver,    he cites evidence indicating that, following the ban on

exclusive dealing, manufacturers         increased the fixed fee component of their charges (by charging for

display equipment       and catalogs),   as our model would predict.      It appears that there is insufficient

evidence to resolve precisely what motivated Standard’s use of these provisions.

          Our models have two notable limitations.           First, we have assumed throughout         that all

manufacturers       are active bidders for contracts with retailers.     This seems to reflect reality in many,

although not all, settings.      Some recent papers studying the use of exclusivity provisions             (or their

cousin, stipulated damage provisions)         when one manufacturer      has a first mover contracting       advantage

are Aghion and Bolton [1987] and Rasmusen,              Ramseyer,   and Wiley [1991].        Second, and perhaps

more importantly,       we have restricted our focus here to markets served by a single retailer.             This is an

unrealistic     assumption   for many markets.    Exclusive dealing rarely precludes         rival manufacturers

completely      from reaching consumers      in a market.    An important area for future research is the

extension of our analysis to such circumstances.            Recent papers that make a stati in this direction

include Besanko and Perry [1993, 1994] (who follow Mathewson and Winter [1987] in restricting

attention to the simple wholesale price contracts) and Martimort            [forthcoming],

           For the sake of brevity,             many of the following proofs have been abbreviated              through the

omission of some details.              A more detailed version is available from the authors on request.


           Lem~      A.1: Suppose (A.1) - (A.4) hold. ~en, for any (P:, P: d),                           there exists (p;, P;)

such that [(P;, Pi), (P;, Pi), d] is a common equilibrium of the contracting game only it

  (a)      uc(P~, P;, u’) > U“

  (b)      ~~, P;, u’) is an equilibrium of the associated intrinsic common agency game in which the

           retailer has reservation utili~ uc(P~, P;, a’),

  (c)      my(P~, P;, d) > H~(uc(P~, P:, d)) for j = A,B.

~ (a) - (c) hold and we also have (d) m~(P~, P:, d) > ~(uc(p~,                         P;, d)), then such a (F’:, Ps) exists.

           Proof of Lemma A. 1: Necessity is easily verified.                      For suticiency, we argue that if (a) - (d)

hold for some (P;, P;, d),                  then there is a common equilibrium of the form               [@;, Pa,    (~;, P;), d]

in which       maxa,, ~ UJ(~.e        UJ)   =   uc(P~, P~, &) forj        = A,B.       Note, first, that (A4) implies that
                                 J’



exclusive contracts exist that satisfy this equality.                Now, if (a) is satisfied, the retailer is willing to

accept both manufacturers’              offers.    Moreover,   with exclusive contract           ~~i being offered,         any

deviation by manufacturer              j that results in the retailer continuing to accept manufacturer                   j’s    offer

must give the retailer a payoff of at least               UC(P;, P;, d).      Condition @) therefore        implies that there is

no profitable deviation for j that has the retailer accept both manufacturers’                          offers, while (c) implies

that there is no profitable           deviation for j that has the retailer accept only manufacturer                j’s     offer.

Finally, (d) implies that no deviation that results in the retailer rejecting manufacturer j’s offer can

raise j’s payoff either (since the retailer would then accept                       i # j’s   offer).                            QED



           Proof of Proportion 2.1: The first part of (A6) rules out no-contracting                         equilibria.         The

second part of (A6) implies that g“l(IIfl + II: - max{fi,                     HA, HB}) > U“, i.e. that the retailer’s



                                                                     37
equilibrium    payoff (as given in the statement of the proposition)                 exceeds its reservation    utility.

          (i) max {HA, H’} > fi.               The discussion in the text implies that, if manufacturer            j‘s contract

is accepted in an exclusive equilibrium,            then ~    = max{HA, H’}.            Moreover,   in the best exclusive

equilibrium    (for the manufacturers)          the retailer earns        W such that ~ - g(U’) - ~        = O (i # j),       so

UC = g-’~j - H{) = g-l@ + ~ - ~),                   manufacturer      j earns     ~ - g(U’) = ~ - ~,       and manufacturer        i

earns   @ = ~ -~j.            Part (c) of Lemma A. 1, however,             implies that manufacturer      k’s payoff

(k = A,B)      in a common equilibrium            with a retailer who earns          U is bounded above by

k(u)    - rI:(u)     = R - rr:,        where    m # k. Since         fi    < ~,    both manufacturers     must do strictly

worse in any common equilibrium                than in the best exclusive equilibrium.

         Note, moreover,         that when (A7) holds, then in any common equilibrium

 7r;(P:, P;, u=) 2 l-Ij          for    i = A,B     and j # i (otherwise i could be assured of raising its payoff

by offering no contracts).         Since in any common equilibrium                in which the retailer earns     U we must

have    T~(P~, P~, d)         > H; - g(U)         , this implies that in any such equilibrium           R - g(U) > Hi +

~ - g(U) = ~ - g(U);            this cannot hold for both manufacturers             when    max {HA, H’} > ~.

         (ii) ~      > max {IIA,HB}. From part (i) we know that each manufacturer                        j’s   payoff in any

common equilibrium            is bounded above by ~ - H! for i # j. When                    R   > max {HA,HB} this

amount dominates        j’s    payoff (for j = A,B)         in the best exclusive equilibrium          (see part (i)).     Thus,

we establish the result by showing that common equilibria exist that achieve this upper bound for both

manufacturers.       Define     U’ = g.l(TIfl + 11~ - ~)       > UO and consider any (P;, P;, d) t &(UC). This

generates an aggregate manufacturer              payoff of fi(Uc)         = fi - g(g-’~~    + H: - @)) = 2ti         - H: - II:.

Assumptions        (Al) - (A4) imply that there is a level of K t R such that (P; + K, P; - K, u’) t &(U’)

and r~(p~ + K, P; - K, u’) = ~                 - II: (i # j) for j = A,B. Since R > max {HA,HB} implies

fi - ~ > H; for j = A,B, i # j, condition (d) of Lemma A. 1 holds for the common contracts and

action choice (P; + K, P; - K, u’). Since conditions (a) - (c) hold as well (for (a), we have                              U’ >



                                                                38

                                      - ~ -- these both follow from (A6)), Lemma A. 1 tells us that there

exist exclusive contracts       (P;, P;)      such that [(P:, P; + K), (P;, P; - K), d]                is a common

equilibrium    of the contracting     game.      Note, finally, that any common equilibrium                yielding these

manufacturer     payoffs must give the retailer exactly              W.

         (iii) fi     = HA. Immediate from parts (i) and (ii).                                                              QED



         Proof of Proposition 3.2: Let ~~,H~,U~                       be the undominated      equilibrium     payoff defined in

proposition    3.1.   It is straightforward      to verify that [(~~, ~~), (~~, ~j), x“”] with              ~~(xj) = ~(xj)       =

H; + cj(xj) is an undominated         common equilibrium.              Since this equilibrium        satisfies the constraint

that P~(Xj) = ~(xj),       it continues to be an equilibrium            in the restricted game.        Suppose that there is

some other equilibrium         of the restricted game that generates profits             (TIA, ~~)     for the manufacturers,

such that for some manufacturer            j, Hj > ~.          Then it can be verified that manufacturer              -j has a

profitable deviation to the contract           P.j(xj) = ~.j    + ~) + c.j(x.j) -- a contradiction.         Thus,     no other

equilibrium    of the restricted game generates higher payoffs for either manufacturer.                                     QED



         Proof of ProposUion 4.2: The proof consists of two steps.                       (i) 1~ x:, @ D,        all   undominated

equilibria are explicitly exclusive. By Proposition 2.1, we establish the result by showing that W <

R   (recall that fic = H’        under (C2)).       Suppose      R     = R.     Then there is an equilibrium          of the

intrinsic common agency game with retailer reservation                    utility   O in which retailer      1 chooses     (x~,,O).

Suppose this retailer accepts        (P:,, P;,).     Then one can verify that, for sufficiently             small ~ > 0, B has

a profitable   deviation to ~~l(x~,)       =     P;I(0) + E + c~x~l - I(x~l > O)@: - H! - K~) -- a contradiction.

         (ii) ~ X:l e D, for any explicitly exclusionary undominated equilibrium, there is an equivalent

equilibrium without explicir exclusion. By Proposition 2.1, we establish the result by showing that

ti = fi’. It can be verified that the following are equilibrium offers in the intrinsic common agency

game with retailer reservation        utility of O, and induce the retailer to choose (x~l, O):



                                                                 39

        Proof of Proposition 4.3: The proof consists of three steps.                            (i) If (C4) holds and exclusive

dealing is banned, there is an effectively exclusive equilibrium with jirst period sales of (i*l, O). One

can verify that the following contracts and the choice                         (~*1, O) for retailer 1 constitute an equilibrium:


                                      R(~A1,O) -[H! +m+ -~~ -K~)] if XA,=iA,
              ‘A, (XA,) =
                                  {
                                      m otherwise

              PB,(XB,) =          CB,XBI   -1(x,,    > O)(~-Ht             -K,)


        (ii) ~ (C4)        holds ati exclusive dealing is banned, (iA,, O) is sustainable as an equilibrium

outcome through contracts satisfying                 PB1(xBI)   2     CBXBI -     I(xB1 > O)@; - H: - K~) On/y if iAl = iA1.

Suppose not, and let (PAI, P,,) be the equilibrium                    contract offers for market 1. Then it is easy to

verify that tAl ~ D (otherwise B has a profitable deviation).                          Recall that D+    is defined analogously

to D, with         < replacing        <.    Since (by assumption)              CIOS(D+) = D and since        R,(o)   is continuous,

for any b > 0 one can find x*l(6) t D+ such that (R(XA1, O) cAiA,) - (R(x~l(b), O) -                                 CAXA1(6))   <

        Proof of Proposition 4.4: The proof of this result has two pa~.                               (i) men     the inequaliq in

(C4) is (strictly) reversed and exclusive dealing is banned, there is an equilibrium in which both

manufacturers’ contracts are accepted and sales in market 1 are (x~;, xBl
                                                                       “~. We construct this

equilibrium    as follows.        Define, for CY> 0,



          D(a)     = {xAl I max[R, (xA1, x~l )-c,                   x,, +1(x,, > O)(~-ll$-K,            )-cr]   <R, (xA1,O)} .
                             %,

Note that D = D(0)           and D(a) ~ D(a’)                for a’ > a.           We require one additional technical

assumption     (strengthening             D = CIOS(D+)): D(u) = clos(D+(a)),                where    D+(CY) is defined

analogously    to D(cr) with               <    replacing     <.     This implies that D(a)         is a continuous

correspondence.         Next, define            ti~ as the solution to




Under our assumptions,               ti~ exists and is strictly positive.            It can be demonstrated     that the following

strategies give rise to an equilibrium                 supporting     (xl;, x;):




          PB(XB,) = aB +CBXB,-1(x,,                      > O)(~L-Hj          -K, )




        (ii) When the inequalip in (C4) is reversed and exclusive dealing is banned, all undominated

equilibria have x~, > 0. Since B earns O if xBI = O, B’s payoff is strictly higher in the non-

exclusive equilibrium        described above since                 (since ti~ > O). Now consider          A. In any equilibrium

with x~l = O, XA,t D, and the retailer’s payoff must be at M                               ~   + fi - H; - K~ (otherwise B

 where the inequality follows from the fact that (C4) is strictly reversed.                                              QED

              Remark:             As claimed in the text, banning exclusive dealing may increase                   B’s payoff, even if

the outcome is non-exclusive                   both with and without the ban.           B’s payoff in a non-exclusive

equilibrium           without a ban is          @ +~     (~A - ~~) - K, - (H; + H;)              (this is precisely      @ - H’),       in

accordance            with Proposition         2. 1), With a ban,      A’s payoff is unchanged,         and B’s payoff is




Thus, if x~, ~ D(&~), the ban leaves                     B’s payoff unchanged           (a sufficient condition is x~l t D).           If

x~[ @ D(&~), the ban strictly increases                        B’s payoff (recall that H: > @ - H!).

where the term in brackets is strictly positive       (I3 and u’(0)        are perfectly negatively correlated).

Using (DI) again, it follows that (6; - cj) # O for some j.                    (In fact, one can show that         @~ - cj)

>>     0 for j = A, B.)        Hence,    [(F;, 6:), (F;, P;)]    cannot be a Nash equilibrium.                            QED



          Proof of Proportion 5.2: Consider first the outcome of an exclusive arrangement                           between the

retailer and manufacturer      j, where the retailer’s reservation       level is O. An argument that parallels that

for Proposition    5.1 shows that, if (Fe,&)      is manufacturer        j’s    optimal contract, then since

  q~(@) >0        (which follows from       qj(cj, m) > O), we have            ~’ >    C.     Since     A and B are perfect

substitutes,   any pair of contracts     [(F:, 6;), (F:, ~;)]    that maximize the joint payoff of the two

manufacturers     in an intrinsic common agency setting must satisfy               min {D:, B:} = @ and F: + F;

= F“ for some optimal exclusive contract           ~e, 6’).     Hence,         fic = HA. However,            if [(F:, pi), (F;,

~:)]   is a Nash equilibrium     of this game, then    min {pi, ~~) < c (otherwise some manufacturer                           j

can increase his expected profit by deviating to contract           (F~,~!j       - ~) for some           ~ > O). This

implies that fi     < R    = HA. By Proposition       2.1, all contracting         equilibria are exclusive.              QED



          Proof of Propostiion 5.4: One can verify that there exists an equilibrium                       where    (Fj, ~j) =

(O,c) for j = A,B,        and the retailer accepts at least one manufacturer’s                 offer.   We now argue that, in

any equilibrium,        ~“ = c. First, suppose that ~“ < c. Without loss of generality,               suppose that O.j

= ~“, and that the retailer accepts -j’s offer. Then j must earn zero profits (the retailer would not

accept any contract that gives j positive profits). It can be verified that j has a profitable deviation

to (~j, C) where ~j = F.j + ~“ - c)q’@~ + 6 for some small ~ > 0-- a contradiction.                            Second,

suppose that 6“ > c. If the retailer accepts both contracts and ~. = d, = B“, then it can be verified

that some j can profit by deviating to (FjJ~*- t) for some small e > 0. For all other casm, it can

be verified that some j, who earns zero, can profitably deviate to (Fj,~j) = (0,6’)                   for some     6’ e

(c,min{P(0),6-}).       This contradicts      e“ > c.

           Finally, we argue that Fj = O for any accepted contract.               This is immediate    if ~j > ~-.              If

@js p“ E      C,    one must have        Fj > O; otherwise, j’s payoff would be negative.        If Fj > 0, then -j’s

payoff must be zero (either -j’s offer is not accepted, or B.j =           c   and F.j = O, or B.j >          C, F.j       =    0,



and q.j = O); hence, -j would gain by deviating to (Fj - ~, C) for some small ~ > 0.                                   QED

           Proof of Proposfiion 5.5:          The proof consists of four steps.     (i) In any equilibrium, both

contracts are accepfed and U* = UB = UAB > 0 (where Uj and UM are, respectively, the retailer’s

utility if only j‘s contract is accepted, and if both contracts are accepted). Suppose on the contrary

that j’s    contract is rejected.        Then one can verify that j has a profitable deviation to         @j,Pj)       =       (E,c)

for sufficiently small E > 0-- a contradiction.             A similar argument implies that ~j < Pj(0) for j =

A,B. Now suppose that UAB= O. Let Rj E [Pj(q,(~j)) - ~j]qj~j). Since ~j < Pj(0), Rj > 0.                                   ~US



            (1 -UA)(l      -U’)        = e“’ea”[ m e-a@RAd@(@)][

                                                 [           [

But this can hold only if U’ > 0 for some j, in which case the retailer would not accept both

offers -- a contradiction.           Hence,   U*B > 0. Finally, if   U-J < U*B, then j has a profitable

deviation involving a small increase in the value of Fj -- a contradiction.             Hence,   U* = UB = UAB.
