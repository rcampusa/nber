                                          ABSTRACT

We develop a model of the world economy as input-output relationships subject to distortions.
We then propose a methodology to solve the identification problem, common to the literature on
misallocation in input-output relationships, of separating sectoral TFPs from the sectoral
distortions. Using both the input shares and the consumption shares within the CES production
and CES consumption structure we derive simple closed-form sufficient statistics for the sectoral
distortions and for the sectoral TFPs. We then derive a closed-form solution of the elasticities of
each entry in the world input-output matrix to distortions. We compute a total of more than half a
million internal distortions and TFPs and document significant heterogeneity of those across
countries and sectors. We then calculate the whole matrix of about two million elasticities to
distortions and TFPs of the input-output matrix of the world economy. We show that internal
(within a given country) distortions significantly affect the structure of the economy of that
country and have sizeable cross effects on the input-output matrix of other countries. We then
find that the world GDP elasticity to changes in internal distortions is an order of magnitude
larger than that of the external distortions.

1       Introduction


Wassily Leontief in his Nobel Lecture (Leontief 1974) argued: The world economy, like the

economy of a single country, can be visualized as a system of interdependent processes. In

this paper, we develop a model of the world economy as input-output relationships subject

to distortions.

    We study the input-output relationships where the base unit is a country-sector pair.

Rather than considering input-output relationships within countries and trade relationships

across countries, we model the world economy as one world input-output matrix. Moreover,

the structure of the economy, that is the world input-output matrix, is endogenous as the

expenditure shares are determined by the sectoral distortions and TFPs and change with

them. Our primary interest is in identifying the distortions or wedges in these relationships,

and determining the eects of changes in the distortions on the world economy.

    The paper derives two main analytical results. First, we propose a methodology to de-

compose distortions from sectoral TFPs. Specically, we derive simple closed-form sucient

statistics for distortions and for sectoral TFPs as the functions of the small set of directly

observable sectoral input expenditure shares and the nal goods consumption shares. Prior

to describing our results, it is useful to outline the diculty that the literature encountered

with regard to separating distortions from TFPs.           Consider the input-output model with

misallocations of Jones (2011, 2013). He argues that There is a fundamental identication

problem:   we see data on observed intermediate goods shares, and we do not know how

to decompose that data into distortions and dierences in technologies.
                                                                                     1   We solve this

identication problem by considering a model with the CES production for intermediate

goods and the CES consumption structure rather than the Cobb-Douglas form considered

in Jones (2011, 2013), Acemoglu, Carvalho, Ozdaglar, Tahbaz-Salehi (2012), and Caliendo

and Parro (2015). This CES structure is precisely what denes an endogenous input-output

structure of the economy that allows us to identify the distortions and the TFPs separately.

Intuitively, the endogenous input expenditure and consumption shares are aected by the

distortions and TFPs dierently, and we can use these dierent eects to separately identify

distortions and TFPs.      The use of both the production and the consumption side of the

economy and the CES structure are important. If only the production side is used, under

the CES production, the ratio of the net (of distortion) prices needs to be observed to sepa-

    1
     Jones (2011, 2013) identify distortions as Hsieh and Klenow (2009) by relating to the undistorted
country, the United States. This, as he acknowledges, assumes that the U.S. same input-output structure
applies to other countries. Tombe and Zhu (2015) identify and evaluate importance of both internal and
external distortions in a model without the input-output structure. Bigio and La'O (2016) study labor and
eciency wedges in an input-output framework and exploit the constancy of the technological parameters
over the business cycle to identify distortions.

rate the sectoral TFPs and the distortions. The consumption side under the CES gives the

ratio of the prices in terms of the consumption shares and hence allows us to identify the

distortions and TFPs separately even if net prices are not observable.                  The intuition also

highlights the generality of the method  we can identify as many objects of interest as there

are endogenous shares. In our case, the input and the consumption shares are endogenous,

hence, we can identify both the country-sector TFPs and the distortions.
                                                                                        2

    Our second theoretical result is to analytically derive the elasticity of the changes in the

input-output shares to the changes in the distortions and TFPs in terms of the functions

of the small set of directly observable sectoral input expenditure shares. That is, we nd

an elasticity of the shares of inputs of intermediate goods of a country-sector pair (say, the

Basic Metals and Fabricated Metal sector in China) to the change in the distortions or

TFPs in another country-sector pair (say, the distortions in the Financial Intermediation

sector in the United States).         In other words, we characterize the change in the entire

world's input-output matrix structure to the change in a given country-sector pair's TFP or

distortions. Importantly, we have that the elasticity of input-output shares are non-zero and

non-constant, and depends on the interconnection of sectors in the input-output structure.

We further discuss how to decompose these elasticities into the direct eects of changes in

the distortions on expenditure shares, and the indirect eects from changes in the prices of

intermediate goods.

    We now turn to the empirical results of the paper.                 We derive all the data needed

to measure distortions and TFPs and to compute the elasticities from the World Input-

Output Database (WIOD) that traces the ow of goods and services across 35 industries,

40 countries, and a constructed rest of the world, over the period 1995-2011. Overall, we

compute more than half a million internal distortions over this period, and about 2 million

elasticities of input-output shares and world's GDP to changes in distortions.

    In our model, changes in distortions impact wages and prices in the whole world economy,

and the input-output shares across all sectors and all countries may change as a result. We

rst study how changes in the internal distortions aect the endogenous structure of the

economy of individual countries. For the U.S. and China's input-output tables we compute

how their own input-output structure change with respect to changes in their own internal

distortions. These two countries are chosen as important illustrative examples with dierent

input-output structure but, of course, we could have chosen a set of any other countries.

We show that the quantitative eects follow the analytical results from the closed-form

elasticities.   Consider the reduction in internal distortions of, for example, manufacturing


   2
     We also discuss that our methodology applies more broadly if one is interested in identifying the changes
in the distortions and TFPs  the model then can have a number of additional dimensions of heterogeneity.


                                                      3
industries. The share of manufacturing inputs by all sectors increases because of the direct

eects of the lower distortion, the indirect eects on the price of manufacturing, and the

substitution eect of other sectors becoming more expensive. We then compute the eects

on the U.S. input-output structure from changes in internal distortions in China  the cross-

elasticity of the U.S. economy structure to Chinese distortions.

   Our second exercise is to compute the global elasticity of expenditure shares and elas-

ticity of world's real GDP to changes in internal distortions. Specically, we compute the

change in expenditure shares in all countries and sectors in the world from a 10 percent

reduction in internal distortions all over the world. The main conclusion is that changing

all internal distortions at the same time results in an even more dramatic change in the

world's input-output structure, which reinforces our ndings for the individual countries.

Even more starkly, the importance of the internal distortions can by seen by ranking the

top 60 elasticities of the world's GDP to the distortions of a sector in a given country. The

largest such internal elasticity - that of China's construction sector has the same size as the

elasticity of the world's GDP to   all of the external distortions in the United States.
   We then compute the elasticity of world's GDP with respect to external distortions. The

principal result here is that the elasticity of internal distortions is an order of magnitude

larger than the elasticity of external distortions. This is connected to our ndings for the

individual countries that the domestic input-output relations tend to be more important

than cross-country input-output relations. The closest in terms of the result on the internal

versus external distortions is the work by Tombe and Zhu (2015). They show that for China,

the internal distortions play a much larger role for aggregate productivity and output.

   Next, we compute the distortions and the TFPs for all of the country-sectors in the

world economy for the period 1995-2011. Our principal nding is that there is a signicant

heterogeneity in the growth rate of the distortions and their distribution across countries.

Therefore, aggregate measures of relative distortions across countries can give only a partial

view of the degree of distortions across countries, since the country level distortions mask

the high heterogeneity at the more disaggregate level.

   We conclude with the computation of the change in global input-output shares and

world's real GDP to the actual changes in domestic distortions over the period 1995-2011.

In other words, we show how the world's input-output structure in 2011 would have changed

if internal distortions were set to their 1995 level.    As we have emphasized above, the

world input-output structure shows complex interconnections across sectors and countries,

and these interconnections respond endogenously to changes in distortions.         We observe

signicant changes in the domestic input-output relationships, that is, those would have

been more important today if distortions would have stayed at the level of 1995. We also



                                               4
see quite heterogeneous eects across countries, reinforcing our view on the importance of

seeing the world as a single input-output structure with complex interrelations. Notably,

we highlight more clearly how China would have been less connected to the rest of the

world as a supplier and seller.
                                   3    Consistent with the heterogeneity in the growth rate of

internal distortions, we nd a dierential impact on world's GDP to the actual change in

local distortions across sectors and countries.

    We now briey discuss the connection to the literature.                The closest in spirit to our

paper is the macroeconomic literature that emphasizes domestic distortions (misallocation)

across sectors and rms (e.g.
                                                         4
                                    Jones 2010, 2011) , Restuccia and Rogerson (2008, 2013),

Hsieh and Klenow (2009).        Our paper also relates to recent studies that show how local

productivity shocks or distortions spread within a country (see e.g. Caliendo, Parro, and

Rossi-Hansberg 2014, Fajgelbaum, Morales, Serrato, and Zidar 2015) and to the literature

on aggregate consequences of idiosyncratic shocks that emphasizes the departure from the

Cobb-Douglas assumptions (Atalay 2017, Baqaee and Farhi 2017, and Carvalho, Nirei, Saito,

and Tahbaz-Salehi 2017).

    The paper is organized as follows.         In Section 2 we present our model of the input-

output structure of the world economy. In Section 3 we derive our main theoretical results;

the sucient statistics to identify distortions and TFPs, and the sucient statistic for the

changes in the input-output structure to changes in the internal distortions.                       Section 4

describes the data and calibration strategy, and Section 5 presents the input-output share

elasticities, and world's GDP elasticities to changes in distortions, as well as the computed

actual changes in distortions and their impact on the world's input-output structure. Finally,

Section 6 concludes.




2       Model


The world economy consists of       N    countries (indexed by    i, n).   Each country has         J   sectors

(indexed by   j, k ).   Each country is endowed with one unit of equipped labor and the unit

mass of agents.

      The method we develop below to characterize distortions and TFPs does not depend on the size of

account for the dierence in population across countries.

call   Ïijnk    the distortion or the wedge. Note that we do not impose symmetry:                                      Ïijnk 6= Ïnkij .

    6
      To simplify the notation, we suppress the sector and country indexes for the share of value added in
gross output Î² . However, this simplication does not aect our theoretical results, and in the empirical part,
we account for the heterogeneity in the value added shares across sectors and countries observed in the data.
    7
      This assumption is also not essential as, for example, heterogenous markups represent themselves as
the sector level distortions.


                                                                   6
We also assume that there is no distortion when a sector sources materials from itself,

Ïijij = 1.
      We call the distortions that aect sectors within a country,                               Ïijik , internal distortions.
Examples of such distortions are sector-specic taxes, subsidies, or markups. We call the

distortions that aect sectors across countries,                            Ïijnk (i 6= n), external distortions.   Examples

of such distortions are trade costs, implicit subsidies or taris for imports or exports, or

dierences in contract enforcement.

sector   k.       The intermediate expenditure shares                        Î³ijnk   have a direct counterpart in the data

as they are exactly the input-output shares that can be directly computed from any world

input-output table, as we show later on.

      Denote the share of consumption of the consumption good from sector                                 j   in the aggregate

consumption of country               i   by   Î±ij .   Formally,

      Similar to the intermediate expenditure shares                              Î³ijnk , the nal expenditure shares Î±ij   are

directly observable in any world input-output matrix that contain data on nal expenditure

in a given country sourced from dierent sectors and countries.




3      Theoretical Results


3.1 Sucient Statistics for Identication of Distortions and TFPs
In this section we propose a method to separately decompose the TFPs and the distortions in

the input-output economy  this is the rst main theoretical result of the paper. The key to

the results is threefold. First, the CES structure of production of both the intermediate goods

and consumption yields the expenditure shares                                 Î³   and consumption shares      Î±   varying with

TFP and distortions. Second, TFP and distortions aect the production and consumption

shares dierently, hence allowing to separately identify these two objects. Third, using the



                                                                        7
consumption shares allows us to substitute for prices with the consumption shares                                                      Î±,   and

hence is applicable when the prices are not observable.

       First, consider the internal distortions and the sectoral TFP for country i. We start with

the production side of the economy. The share of the input of the sector                                              k   in the sector     j   is:

Dividing the input shares,           Î³ikik   and     Î³ijik ,       to cancel the sector                   k   TFP,    Aik ,   and the wage,

wi ,   and using that        Ïikik = 1,   we get the expression for the distortion as a function of the

sectoral prices:
                                                                                  1
                                                               Pij           Î³ikik        Î¸
                                             Ïijik =                                          .                                                 (2)

       Substituting for the denition of the sectoral price index, we obtain an expression for

the composite of the distortion and the ratio of the sectoral TFPs:


                                                          1                          1               1
                                                     Aij       Î²            Î³ijij       Î¸Î²        Î³ikik       Î¸
                                ÏÌijik â¡ Ïijik                     =                                              ;
                                                     Aik                    Î³ikik                 Î³ijik
       therefore,   ÏÌijik   can be identied but not the TFPs and distortions separately. In order

to separate distortions from TFPs, we now turn to the consumption side of the economy.

       The consumer's problem yields the following consumption share in country                                                 i,   sector     j:

   Dividing the shares of consumptions for sector                        j    and         k    gives the ratio of sectoral prices:

                                         Pik               Î±ik

and after substitution the expression for the distortion:

                                                          1                        1

   Another way to gain intuition is to rewrite

                                                      1                            1

                                 Ïijik                         =                                .
                                             Î±ij                          Î³ijik

   Hence, the distortion is the wedge in the rst order condition whereas the undistorted

economy equates the relative consumption shares to the input shares.                                            The analysis of

the external distortions is identical with the exception that the nal expression would also

include the ratio of the wages in countries            i   and       n.
   We summarize the results in the rst main proposition of the paper:

   The proposition above gives a very simple closed-form expression for the sucient statis-

tics formula to identify external and internal distortions separately from the TFPs. All of

the formulas are expressed in terms of the small set of directly observable empirical coun-




                                                           9
terparts from the world input-output table. Note that the TFPs are calculated up to one

reference sector for a country.

   We now discuss the generality and the limitations of the proposition. The key to the

analysis is that we use both the consumption and the production shares to separately identify

distortions and the TFPs. The generality of the result can be summarized as follows: we

can identify as many elements of the model (i.e., distortions and TFPs) as there are CES

shares of consumption and production. Otherwise, only the composite distortion               ÏÌ   can be

identied.

   However, if the additional parameters are not changing with time, one can also identify

changes in distortions and TFPs from the changes in the shares of consumption and produc-

tion. Consider, for example, the case of the consumption preferences diering by country,

or the inputs weights in the production of material being asymmetric:

                                                 n,k

The formulas for distortions in Proposition 1 would then feature the ratios of the consump-

tion   Ïij ,   and the input weights   Î¹ijnk .    At the same time, assuming that the preference

parameters       Ïij   and production parameters        Î¹ijnk   are not changing over time, they would

immediately drop out if we consider the change of the distortion across time.               The same

principle applies to other modications of the model such as, for example, adding consump-

tion distortions. If these additional elements do not change over time, one can still identify

the changes in the distortions. Consequently, in the quantitative analysis in Section 5 we

compute growth rates in distortions and TFPs, and the elasticities of input-output shares

and world's GDP to changes in distortions; and therefore, these extensions to our model do

not aect our quantitative results.

   We comment on the two key dierence with the results of the macroeconomic literature

that focuses on misallocations and distortions  the use of the CES production function,

and the use of the CES consumption to derive the ratio of the prices. In Hsieh and Klenow

(2009), the production function is Cobb-Douglas. They identify the distortions by making

reference to the undistorted country. This amounts in our context to assuming that either

the net (of distortion) as well as gross (with distortion) prices are observable or that the

country/sector pairs have the same Cobb-Douglas elasticities of inputs. Jones (2011, 2013),



                                                       10
which are the closest to our study, also use the Cobb-Douglas production in the input-output

structure and hence cannot separate the TFPs from the distortions. Besides, Cobb-Douglas

assumption implies that the expenditure and the consumption shares are exogenous and do

not change with distortions and TFPs.
                                                8

    Notice that to compute internal distortions, external distortions, or TFPs, we do not need

to solve for the general equilibrium of the model, as they can be directly computed using

data on intermediate and nal expenditure shares, conditional on values for the elasticities

Ï   and   Î¸.   As discussed above, we do not need to use price data or impose symmetry in

distortions either, dierent from common approaches followed in the trade literature to

compute external distortions.
                                    9 It is also immediately clear how to extend the analysis to

the cases of the commonly used trade models. In particular, a wide class of trade models

(e.g. Anderson and van Wincoop 2003, Eaton and Kortum 2002, Melitz 2003, among many

others) deliver a gravity equation of type of equation (1), but for the case of cross-country

ows in a given sector (that is, when           i 6= n   and   k = j ).   It immediately follows that our

sucient statistic can be directly mapped to gravity-trade models to infer trade costs.



3.2 Sucient Statistics for the Changes in the Input-Output Structure
The second set of the theoretical results that we derive is how changes in sectoral TFPs or

distortions aect the input-output structure of the economy. The main feature of our model

is that the input-output matrix is endogenous.                 That is, following the change in sectoral

TFPs or distortions, the expenditure shares (or input-output shares) change as well.                          In

this section, we analytically derive the elasticities of the input-output shares with respect

to changes in the sectoral TFPs or internal distortions.

    We rst derive an intermediate result that expresses the changes in the expenditure

shares in terms of the higher-level policy elasticities.            That is, the policy elasticities are

derived in terms of the endogenous prices rather than in terms of the primitives. If the prices

    8
      Both CES and Cobb-Douglas are subject to a similar limitation, that one cannot account for the
formation of new input-output relations, that is, input-output shares that change from zero to positive.
However, at the level of aggregation that we work in the empirical section, these cases are negligible.
    9
      Note that if sectoral prices were observable equation (2) could be used to identify the distortions. In
practice, sectoral prices across countries can be found in some existing databases such as the International
Comparison Program (ICP), or can be inferred using sectoral deators from other databases such as EU-
KLEM or the GGDC 10-Sector Database. However, there are two major issues with this approach. First,
using price data from these or other sources is always going to constraint the computation of internal
distortions due to the lack of consistent time series data or the lack of price data for non-tradable industries,
the reduced number of countries in the database, the reduced number of sectors, or due to inconsistencies
between the denition of prices in the price databases (for instance, deators or PPI indexes), and their
counterpart in the model or in the input-output data. Second, and perhaps more importantly, the measured
prices do not take into account implicit price distortions such as dierences in contract enforcement or
implicit subsidies.


                                                       11
are observable, these elasticities are easily estimated. This proposition allows us to clearly

identify the major forces aecting the endogenous change in the input-output structure of

the economy to the change in the distortions.



Proposition 2.           The elasticity of input-output share                 Î³ijnk with respect to changes in all
distortions     Ï in the world is given by

                       dlogÎ³ijnk          dlogPij            dlogPnk      dlogwn
                                 = âÎ¸ + Î¸         â Î¸(1 â Î²)         â Î¸Î²        .
                         dlogÏ             dlogÏ              dlogÏ        dlogÏ


    According this proposition, the elasticity of the expenditure share                               Î³ijnk   to changes in

distortions depends on four forces. First, there is a direct eect of a reduction in                               Ïijnk   on

Î³ijnk ,   with an elasticity of          âÎ¸.         Specically, a reduction in      Ïijnk   makes inputs purchased

by the country-sector pair             ij   from the country-sector pair         nk   cheaper, thus the expenditure

share spent on goods from              nk   increases. Second, a reduction in distortions in sector                j , either
from buying from          nk   or any other origin sector-country, will reduce the price index in the

country-sector pair        ij .   Thus the share spent on goods from sector                   j   increases and the share

spent on goods from sector                  k   (or any other sector-country) decreases.               This second eect

depends on       Î¸,   and on the elasticity of the price index in the country-sector                      ij   with respect

to changes in distortions.              The third eect captures the impact on the price index in the

destination country-sector              Pnk .    A reduction in distortions of selling goods from country                  n
sector    k   to the country-sector             ij   (or to any other country-sector) reduces the price index

in the country-sector          nk,     which increases the expenditure share on those goods. This third

eect depends on         Î¸,   the share of materials in gross output              (1 â Î²),        and on the elasticity of

the price index in the country-sector                    ij   with respect to changes in distortions. The fourth

eect, the change in wages, depends on                        Î¸,   the share of value added in gross output         Î²,   and

the wage elasticity to changes in distortions.

    We now turn to derive a closed-form expression for the input-output share elasticity

dlogÎ³ijnk     with respect to distortions or TFPs. In Appendix 1, we derive the elasticity of the

whole world's input-output structure with respect to changes in distortions and productivi-

ties in terms of the primitives of the model up to the change in the wages. Specically, the

change in the world's input-output structure to changes in distortions and productivities is

given by the following equation:



                        Î = F(Î¸, Î², Î³lsmh )A + H(Î¸, Î², Î³lsmh )Ï + O(Î¸, Î², Î³lsmh )Ï,

    where      Î, A, Ï ,   and     Ï   are vectors that contain the log changes in expenditure shares,


                                                                    12
productivities, distortions, and wages respectively.                   The matrix elasticities           F(Î¸, Î², Î³lsmh ),
H(Î¸, Î², Î³lsmh ),     and   O(Î¸, Î², Î³lsmh )   are matrices that depend on the elasticity                  Î¸   the share of

value added in gross output            Î²,   and the expenditure shares          Î³.   These matrices provide the

direct eects of distortions and productivities on the input-output shares as well as the

indirect eects through changes in prices.

      To reduce the notational burden, we derive below this elasticity under some simplifying

assumptions. Specically, we assume one country                   i,   and two sectors     j, k.   We normalize the

wage in that country to 1, and study the elasticity of the input-output share                                  Î³ijik   to a

change in the distortion        Ïijik . Totally dierentiating the expression for the prices and for the
input-output shares, we obtain the following proposition.




Proposition 3.           Consider sectors     j and k of a country i. Let

                                                              Î³isip
                                             Î³Ìisip â¡                     ,

for   s, p â {j, k}.
      The elasticities of the input-output shares with respect to distortions are given by:

                               d log Î³ijik                  1 â Î³Ìijik
                                           = âÎ¸                                   ,
                               d log Ïijik      1 â Î³Ìikij (1 â Î²) Î³Ìijik (1 â Î²)

                               d log Î³ikij         Î³Ìijik (1 â Î²) (1 â Î³Ìikij )
                                           = âÎ¸                                   .

The elasticities of the input-output shares with respect to sectoral TFPs are given by:

                 d log Î³ijik                    1
                             =Î¸                                   [Î³Ìikij Î³Ìikik (1 â Î²) â Î³Ìijij ] ,
                    dAij        1 â Î³Ìikij (1 â Î²) Î³Ìijik (1 â Î²)
                                                                                                   
      d log Î³ikij                       1
                  =Î¸ 1â                                   (â (1 â Î²) Î³Ìijij + Î³Ìikij Î³Ìikik (1 â Î²)) .
      d log Aij         1 â Î³Ìikij (1 â Î²) Î³Ìijik (1 â Î²)


      This proposition provides the closed-form solution for elasticities in terms of easily ob-

servable empirical variables. We now briey illustrate the intuition for this result on an even

simpler case. Suppose that            Î³ikij = 0,   that is, sector      k   does not purchase any inputs from

sector    j.   It is easy to show that either in the case of changing             Ïijik   or   Aij ,   the eect on the

price of sector      k   is zero,   d log Pik = 0.      The elasticity of the price in sector            j   also takes a




                                                            13
very simple form, depending only on the relevant sector's share:


                                  d log Pij              d log Pij
                                              = Î³Ìijik ;           = âÎ³Ìijij .,
                                  d log Ïijik            d log Aij

        This further leads to very simple expressions for the elasticities of the shares:


                      d log Î³ijik                      d log Î³ikij
                                  = âÎ¸ (1 â Î³Ìijik ) ;             = âÎ¸ (1 â Î²) Î³Ìijik ,
                      d log Ïijik                      d log Ïijik

        and
                        d log Î³ijik              d log Î³ikij
                                    = âÎ¸Î³Ìijij ;             = Î¸ [1 + (1 â Î²) Î³Ìijij ] .
                        d log Aij                d log Aij
                            d log Î³ijik                              d log Î³ikij
        This implies that
                            d log Ïijik is increasing in Î³ijik and d log Ïijik is decreasing in       Î³ijik ;   and
     d log Î³ijik                                 d log Î³ikij
                   is increasing in Î³ijij and
that
      d log Aij                                   d log Aij is decreasing in Î³ikik .
        With this set of theoretical results, we proceed in the next section to compute the

world's input-output elasticities to changes in distortions, to identify the actual growth rate

in distortions over time, and to study the impact of these actual changes in distortions on

the world's input-output structure. We start next section by describing the data needed for

our quantitative exercises.




4        Data and Calibration


All the data needed to measure distortions and TFPs, and to compute the empirical exercises

in the next section come from the World Input-Output Database (WIOD). The WIOD

database traces the ow of goods and services across 35 industries classied according to

the NACE classication system, 40 countries, and a constructed rest of the world, over

the period 1995-2011. This data is integrated into a world input-output table, which also

provides gross output and value added for each sector and country.                     In Appendix 2 we

provide the exact list of the sectors and the countries.

        The ow of goods and services includes domestic transactions of intermediate goods,

that is, ows across industries in a given country, as well as cross-sector and cross-country

ows. Using these ows, we are able to directly determine the bilateral expenditure shares

Î³ijnk     across all countries and sectors. The WIOD database also contains nal expenditure

across sectors and countries that we use to construct            Î±ij .   In doing so, we leave out changes

in inventories from the calculations. The shares of value added across sectors and countries,

Î²ij ,   are constructed using value added and gross output data for each sector and country.

Finally, we use the standard values of the elasticities in the literature            Î¸=Ï=4        .




                                                      14
   Figure 1 displays the heatmap of the world input-output table for the year 2011. Specif-

ically, it shows the bilateral expenditure shares across all sectors an countries in the world,

where the y-axis (rows) presents the buyer unit, and the x-axis (columns) shows the seller

unit. The colors in the gure represents dierent percentiles that are labeled on the right

hand side of the gure, and the observations are ordered rst by country and then by sector.

For instance, the 80th percentile corresponds to an expenditure share of 0.0049, that is, the

buyer unit is spending 0.0049 percent of its total expenditure on goods from that specic

seller unit. Since observations are ordered rst by country and then by sector, the rst red

square visualized in the gure displays the Australian domestic input-output coecients,

that is, expenditure share of each Australian sector on goods from every other industry in

Australia.

   We want to highlight two relevant features from the world input-output table.                     First,

the diagonal is strong, that is, the red squares along the diagonal of the gures mean that

the domestic input-output transactions tend to be stronger than the cross-country transac-

tions. However, the importance of domestic input-output linkages varies across countries.

For instance, we can see from the gure that in more open economies such as Luxembourg,




                                              15
a greater number domestic input-output shares fall below the 80th percentile than in other

countries, which indicates that domestic transactions are relatively less important in Luxem-

bourg. Second, the world is very interconnected, with countries such as China, the United

States, and Germany playing a role of the important suppliers of inputs for all countries in

the world. Later, we discuss further how these features shape the elasticities of GDP and

expenditure shares with respect to changes in distortions.

   In Figure 2, we reproduce the input-output for the U.S. economy presented as a heatmap.

The y-axis (rows) shows the buyer sectors from each seller sector in the x-axis (columns).In

the gure, for a given seller industry, we aggregated U.S. purchases from all countries in

the world in that industry.      Similar to the previous gure, the colors represents dierent

percentiles that are labeled on the right hand side of the gure.      For instance, the 80th

percentile in the gure corresponds to a U.S. sector that spends at least 3.3 percent of their

total expenditure on goods from a given seller, including purchase from the United States,

and from all other countries in the world.

   We observe from the gure that the diagonal is strong, that is, a sector tends to buy

more materials from itself rather than other sectors. Still, the interconnection across sectors


                                                16
is also relevant. In particular, some service sectors such as nance and business activities are

an important source of intermediate inputs to other sectors, as well as some manufacturing

sectors such as petroleum and paper. The same features characterize the input-output table

of China displayed in Figure 3.

    In the next section, we show the elasticities of these input-output tables in these countries

to changes in internal distortions, as well as the cross-country elasticities where distortions

in other countries change.




5    Quantitative Analysis


In this section, we discuss the empirical results of the paper.

    Before turning to the results, we show how to close the model developed in Section 2,

and describe the equilibrium conditions needed to compute the general equilibrium eects




                                               17
in the model. Specically, we impose the market clearing condition given by:


                                        J X
                                          N
                                        X   1 â Î²nk
                              wi Li =                     Î³nkij Xnk .                      (5)
                                                   Î²nk
                                        k=1 n=1

   The equilibrium of this economy is therefore dened by equations (1), (3), (4), and (5).



5.1 Elasticities and Endogenous IO
In our model, changes in distortions impact wages and prices in the whole world economy,

and the input-output shares across all sectors and all countries may change as a result. Given

this, the world's input-output structure is endogenous to changes in distortions.      In this

section, we emphasize this point by computing the elasticity of the input-output shares to

changes in internal distortions. We rst focus on the U.S. and China input-output structure,

and compute how their input-output structure change with respect to changes in their own

internal distortions. We then compute the eects on the U.S. input-output structure from

changes in internal distortions in China  the cross-elasticity of China's internal distortions

on the United States. In the next section we take a global view on the impact of internal

distortions on the world's input-output structure.

   We start by computing how the U.S. input-output structure would change with respect to

a 10 percent decline in internal (within the United States) distortions in the manufacturing

industries. The results are displayed in Figure 4.

   The upper two panels show the eects of the decline in the distortions of selling goods

to manufacturing industries from any industry.           The lower two panels show the eects

of the decline in distortions of buying goods from the manufacturing industries by any

industry. We show the change in expenditure shares to changes in internal distortions in

absolute terms on the left panels, and in percent changes on the right panels. We can see

from the gure how the U.S. input-output table is impacted by changes in distortions in

the manufacturing industries.    In particular, we observe that manufacturing sectors buy

more from other manufacturing sectors.        Since it is cheap for manufacturing industries

to buy intermediate inputs from everywhere, they will buy proportionally more from the

manufacturing industries because those industries experience a larger decline in the price

index. In the lower panels, we observe that all sectors, and especially non-manufacturing

industries, substitute inputs from non-manufacturing industries for manufacturing inputs,

as the latter are now a cheaper source of inputs after the decline in distortions.      These

two ndings are in line with the eects from the closed-form elasticities in Proposition 2

discussed in the previous section.

                These ndings conrm a common pattern across countries, in line with the predictions of

      our closed-form elasticities. However, we emphasize the fact that the input-output structure

      of the U.S. economy is dierent from the Chinese one, and therefore the eects of the

      changes in distortions at the more disaggregate level are dierent in these two economies.

      For instance, the share of manufacturing purchases in total expenditure increases by 9.3



                                                                   20
      percent in absolute terms in the United States, and 12.3 percent in China. The sectors that

      increase more the purchases of manufacturing in the United States are Leather and Textiles,

      while in China the sectors that experience the largest increase in manufacturing purchases

      are transportation equipment and metals. Overall, these exercises show how our model and

      the derived elasticities emphasize these heterogenous input-output eects from changes in

      distortions across countries.

   The nal exercise we perform in this section aims at computing the cross-country eects

of changes in internal distortions in the manufacturing sectors. Specically, we compute the

change in the U.S. input-output shares from a 10 percent reduction in the internal distortions

in China. Figure 6 shows the results.

   Similar to the previous gures 4 and 5, the upper panels show the eects of changes in

manufacturing distortions as buyers of goods from any industries, and the lower panels show

the change in internal distortions from selling to the manufacturing industries. As in the

previous gures, the left panels show absolute changes in expenditure shares and the right

panels show percent changes in expenditure shares.

   Turning to the results, Figure 6 shows two relevant facts.       First, the U.S. economy

purchases proportionally more inputs from the manufacturing industries, and also manu-

facturing industries increase their importance as suppliers for the rest of the U.S. economy.

This highlight the fact that the Chinese manufacturing is more connected to the U.S. man-

ufacturing sectors than to other industries. Second, there are also some relevant eects in

U.S. non manufacturing industries such as transport services, health, and education, which

increase their importance as suppliers.

   These two results in addition to the previous ones highlight how complex the input-

output relationships within countries and across countries are, and given this, how important

is to keep track of the endogenous changes in them as a results of changes in distortions

anywhere in the world.




5.2 World Elasticities
In this section, we take a global perspective of the input-output shares and compute the

global elasticity of expenditure shares and elasticity of world's real GDP to changes in

internal distortions. We also compute the elasticity of world's GDP with respect to external

distortions, and discuss the relative importance of the internal versus external distortions.

   In Figure 7, we start with a similar computation to the one performed in the previous

section, but taking a view at the whole world's input-output structure. To do so, we compute

the change in expenditure shares in all countries and sectors in the world from a 10 percent

reduction in internal distortions all over the world. The main conclusion we get from the

gure is that changing internal distortions at the same time has dramatic change in the

world's input-output structure, which reinforces our ndings in the previous section. From

the gure we can see that changes in domestic input-output transactions are important, but

we also see signicant changes in the whole world's input-output structure.

         In Figure 8, we compute the world's real GDP elasticities with respect to changes in

 internal distortions in each country. Specically, each unit in the gure shows the percent

 change in world's real GDP from a one percent reduction in distortions in a given industry

 and country of buying goods from all industries in that country.                               The change in world's


                                                                  23
real GDP is computed by aggregating the changes in real wages across all countries using

each country's GDP as weights. As in the previous gures, each color represents a given

percentile. For instance, the blue cells correspond to the country-sectors whose changes in

internal distortions would have a larger impact in the aggregate world's economy. This is

the case of most of the sectors in United States and China, as well as some important sectors

such as real estate, nance, business activities, and public administration in some developed

countries such as Germany, France, Italy, and Japan. Overall, the elasticity of world's real

GDP is aected by both the size of the industry and how interconnected is a given industry

in a given country with the rest of the economy, and with the rest of the world, and as a

result, the bottom line of this exercise is to shed light on how quantitatively signicant the

impact on the world's economy as a whole would be to changes in internal distortions in

specic sectors and countries.

           Even more starkly, the importance of the internal distortions can be seen in Figure 9.

       Here, we rank top 60 elasticities of the world's GDP to a sector in a given country. The

       largest such internal elasticity - that of China's construction sector (0.0436) has the same

       size as the elasticity of the world's GDP to all of the external distortions in the United

       States. More broadly, this graph shows importance of the distortions of individual sectors

       on the world economy.

                   (a) Internal distortions                                  (b) External distortions




           In Figure 10, we compute the world's real GDP elasticity to changes in internal distor-

       tions in a given country in Panel (a), and we then compare them with the world's real GDP

       elasticity to changes in external distortions.       From Panel (a), we can see that the largest

       elasticity is that of China at 0.41, followed by the United States (0.33), Japan (0.15), and

       Germany (0.08).     Panel (b) presents the calculations for the elasticity of world's GDP to

       external distortions. The largest elasticity is that of the United States at 0.042, followed by

       China (0.038 percent), Germany (0.025 percent), and Japan (0.017 percent).

           Comparing the elasticities with respect to internal versus external distortions, three facts

       arise. First, note that while the ranking of the elasticities by countries are similar, they are

       not identical.   Second, and more importantly, the elasticity with respect to the internal

       distortions is an order magnitude larger than that of external distortions.
                                                                                               10   Third, for

some countries such as Luxembourg, the elasticity to external distortions is larger than the

elasticity to internal distortions. The general nding that the elasticity of internal distortions

is larger than the elasticity of external distortions can be connected to our ndings in the

previous section that domestic input-output relations tend to be more important that cross-

country input-output relations. This dierent magnitude between internal versus external

elasticities also sheds lights on the potential impact of changes in domestic versus external

policy-related distortions.



5.3 Distortions and TFP
In this section we use the sucient statistics derived in Section 3 to compute the evolution of

internal distortions and TFPs for the period of study. Our principal nding is a signicant

heterogeneity in the growth rate of the distortions and their distribution across countries.

We conclude with the computation of the change in global input-output shares and world's

real GDP elasticity to the actual changes in domestic distortions over the period 1995-2011.



5.3.1 Internal Distortions
Turning to the analysis of the internal distortions, Figure 11 shows the distribution of the

annual rate of growth of internal distortions for the world, and for selected countries. This

is an important graph as it shows several notable features. First, there is large heterogeneity

in terms of the growth rate of distortions across sectors. For each country there are sectors

in which the distortions grew and in which distortions decreased. Second, the heterogene-

ity diers across countries. The United States and Japan have relatively small dispersion

compared to Europe, and all of these countries have much smaller dispersion compared to

China.

    The main bottom line of these histograms is that, to a greater or lesser extent, there

is heterogeneity in the changes in internal distortions in all countries, and some sectors

have become more distorted and other less distorted in some countries relative to others.

Therefore, aggregate measures of relative distortions across countries can give only a partial

view of the degree of distortions across countries, since they hide this high heterogeneity at

the more disaggregate level.




internal elasticities remains.

5.3.2 TFP
We now turn to our TFP calculations.                                           As it was clear in Section 4, with our sucient

statistics we can compute TFPs relative to a reference sector in each country. Therefore,

in all calculations below we present our TFP calculations relative to the agriculture sector.

We start by describing the change in sectoral TFP in the world over the period 1995-2011.

   The upper panel in Figure 12 shows the evolution of the TFP in the manufacturing sector

and the service sector, using gross output weights to aggregate TFP across industries and

countries. The lower panels show the annual growth in TFP in the world across dierent

manufacturing and non-manufacturing sectors.                                   A clear fact from the gure is the higher

growth rate in the service sectors than in the manufacturing sectors. Among service sectors,

we nd that telecommunications, education, and water transport experienced the highest

growth rate in TFP in the world, while retail sales slightly contracted. In the manufacturing

industries, petroleum, plastics, and metals are the sectors with the highest growth rate.

   As a way of validating our TFP measure, in Figure 13 we compare our constructed TFP

series for the United States, where we recover the aggregate TFP by using TFP estimates

from the agricultural sector from the U.S. Department of Agriculture and from EU_Klems,

with the BLS multi-factor productivity.                           We see that our model-implied aggregate TFP

series is in line with that from the BLS, although it is somehow more volatile. Overall, the

correlation between both is very high. We also computed the annual growth in TFP across

countries, and nd, similar to the changes in internal distortions, signicant heterogeneity

across sectors and across countries.

5.3.3 Eects of Actual Changes in Internal Distortions
In this section, we combine the elasticities of the input-output shares and world's GDP with

respect to changes in internal distortions, and our computed internal distortions using the

sucient statistics derived in Section 4. We then compute the change in the input-output

shares across all sectors and countries in the world and the world's GDP elasticities to the

actual changes in distortions over the period 1995-2011.




                                                                     29
         We start with Figure 14 that shows the change (absolute and percent) in global expen-

diture shares with respect to the actual changes in internal distortions. In other words, the

gure shows how the world's input-output structure would have changed if internal distor-

tions were back to their 1995 level. As we have emphasized above, the world input-output

structure shows complex interconnections across sectors and countries, and these intercon-

nections respond endogenously to changes in distortions. As a result, we see how the actual

changes in distortions have changed the world's input-output structure near all over the

units. We can see more signicant changes in the domestic input-output relationships, that

is, the stronger diagonal of the matrix means that domestic input-output relationships would

have been more important today if distortions would have stayed at the level of 1995. We

also see quite heterogeneous eects across countries, reinforcing our view on the importance

of seeing the world as a single input-output structure with complex interrelations. Notably,

the right panel highlights more clearly how China would have been less connected to the

rest of the world as a supplier and seller.

      The very large percentage changes at the top percentile on the right panel correspond in general to
cases with a very small (close to zero) initial input-output share that experienced signicant changes in
distortions over 1995-2011. Examples of these outliers are purchases from the metal sector by a number of
manufacturing industries in Malta, purchases from textiles by the nance and transport service industries
in Cyprus, and purchases from mining by construction in India.

    Finally, Figure 15 displays the change in world's GDP with respect to the actual changes

in internal distortions. We compute the change in world's GDP by aggregating the change in

real wages across countries using each country's GDP as weights. The gure shows that the

growth rate in world's GDP to a change in local distortion has been very heterogeneous across

dierent sectors and countries in the world. This nding is consistent with the heterogeneity

in the growth rate in internal distortions discussed in Section 5.3.1, and also with the fact

that some sectors have become more distorted and other less distorted in some countries

relative to others.       For instance, lower distortions in China in sectors such as education,

health, construction, and electrical equipment contributed to a positive global GDP growth,

while sectors such as plastics and metals had a negative impact on world's GDP.




6    Conclusion


Our paper achieves several goals.         First, we argue that it is fruitful to study the world

economy as one interconnected input-output table with the country-sector pair as the base

unit of analysis.    Second, we show that the endogeneity of the input-output table due to

the CES structure of production and consumption is important. This endogeneity allows

us to resolve an important issue in the analysis of economies with distortions, namely,

how to analytically and empirically separately identify distortions and TFPs in the cases

when the input-output relationships may dier across countries. Our nding of signicant

heterogeneity in distortions within and across countries implies that the analysis of the



                                                  31
aggregate distortions at the country level may be masking the eects of the the disaggregated

distortions. Even more importantly, we show how to analytically compute the elasticities of

distortions in a given country on the endogenous structure of the input-output relationships

in that country, on other countries, and on the world's economy.      We nd that internal

distortions play an important role in determining the structure of the economies of the

individual countries and of the world economy. The elasticities of the internal distortions

are an order of magnitude larger than those of the external distortions. Finally, we show how

the world economy changed due to the evolution of the internal distortions in 1995-2011.

We see how the world became more interconnected and how China's rise aected the world

economy. After all, the world economy, like the economy of a single country, can be thought

of as a system of interdependent processes.
