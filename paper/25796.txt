                                         ABSTRACT

Can schools that boost student outcomes reproduce their success at new campuses? We study a
policy reform that allowed effective charter schools in Boston, Massachusetts to replicate their
school models at new locations. Estimates based on randomized admission lotteries show that
replication charter schools generate large achievement gains on par with those produced by their
parent campuses. The average effectiveness of Boston’s charter middle school sector increased
after the reform despite a doubling of charter market share. An exploration of mechanisms shows
that Boston charter schools reduce the returns to teacher experience and compress the distribution
of teacher effectiveness, suggesting the highly standardized practices in place at charter schools
may facilitate replicability.

1       Introduction

    The feasibility of scaling up eﬀective programs is a perennial problem in social policy. Successful

demonstration projects often fail to reproduce their eﬀects at scale. In the education sphere, for

example, recent large-scale studies of early childhood programs, class size reductions, and the Success

For All curriculum show eﬀects that fall short of the impressive gains seen in smaller-scale evaluations

of similar interventions (Heckman et al., 2010; Heckman, Pinto, and Savelyev, 2013; Puma, Bell, and

Heid, 2012; Krueger, 1999; Jepsen and Rivkin, 2009; Borman et al., 2007; Quint et al., 2015). This

suggests that in some cases the success of programs may be driven by unique inputs or population

characteristics such as special teachers, school leaders, peer environments, or other factors that

cannot be easily replicated (see Banerjee et al. (2017) on the challenges of scaling up demonstration

programs, including general equilibrium and spillover eﬀects and Davis et al. (2017) on the role of

labor supply in scale-up).

    The potential for sustained success at scale is of particular interest for “No Excuses” charter

schools, a recent educational innovation that has demonstrated promise for low-income urban stu-

dents. These schools share a set of practices that includes high expectations, strict discipline,

increased time in school, frequent teacher feedback, high-intensity tutoring, and data-driven in-

struction. Evidence based on randomized admission lotteries shows that No Excuses charter schools

generate test score gains large enough to close racial and socioeconomic achievement gaps in a short

time, as well as improvements in longer-run outcomes like teen pregnancy and four-year college

attendance (Abdulkadiroğlu et al., 2011, 2017; Angrist, Pathak, and Walters, 2013; Angrist et al.,

2012, 2016; Dobbie and Fryer, 2011, 2013, 2015; Tuttle et al., 2013; Walters, 2018). Other recent

studies demonstrate positive eﬀects of No Excuses policies when implemented in traditional public

schools or in low-performing schools converted to charter status (Fryer, 2014; Abdulkadiroğlu et al.,

2016). No school district has adopted these policies on a wide scale, however, and No Excuses char-

ters serve small shares of students in many of the cities where they operate. It therefore remains

an open question whether the eﬀects documented in previous research can be replicated at a larger

scale. Replicability is of particular interest in the context of charter schools, which by design are

intended to serve as laboratories of innovation and spread successful educational practices.1
    1
     Massachusetts charters are required by law to disseminate their “best                practices,”   see:
http://www.doe.mass.edu/charter/bestpractices/ for details on the Massachusetts policy.



                                                    2
    We address this question using a recent policy change that expanded the charter school sector

in Boston, Massachusetts, a city where most charter schools operate according to No Excuses

principles. In 2010, Massachusetts passed a comprehensive education reform law that raised the

state’s cap on the fraction of funding dedicated to charter school tuition payments in low-performing

districts. Charter operators that the state deemed “proven providers” with track records of success

were permitted to expand existing campuses or open new schools in these districts. As a result, the

number of charter schools in Boston increased from 16 to 32 between 2010 and 2014, with most of

these new campuses linked to existing No Excuses charter schools. This expansion led to dramatic

growth in charter market share in Boston: the fraction of sixth grade students attending charter

schools increased from 15 to 31 percent between 2010 and 2015.

    This increase in charter share is equivalent from going from the 100th ranked school district in

terms of charter sector share to the 15th ranked school district (rankings from 2016-17, see David,

Hesla, and Pendergrass 2017).2 Boston’s charter expansion is therefore a large, policy relevant

change in charter share. The closest studied analog is the expansion of the Knowledge is Power

Program (KIPP) network of charter schools (Tuttle et al., 2015). Between 2010 and 2015, the KIPP

network doubled the number of students served, from about 27,000 to 55,000 students. Observational

estimates comparing KIPP students to matched comparisons showed that the network continued

to boost student achievement over this period of expansion, but that these gains were smaller in

the years of greater expansion. The KIPP setting is in contrast to our city-speciﬁc study, as the

expansion of KIPP schools was diﬀuse, over many cities, and may not have had a great inﬂuence

on the share of students in charters in a given locality.

    Other localities are facing the potential for charter expansion similar to the policy change we

study here. New York City reached its cap on the number of charter schools in the city in winter

2019 with 10 percent of students enrolled in charter schools. A policy change permitting more

charters could result in an inﬂux of charter schools, and would follow similar cap increases in 2007

and 2010 (New York State Department of Education, 2019). Massachusetts voters faced a decision

about a referendum for another, similar charter school cap raise in 2016, which did not pass. Boston

has again reached the cap on charter schools and thus the state may face future legislation about

   2
     School district rankings are for all grade levels, and the charter share we focus on here is for middle schools. The
leap for all grade levels is a move from approximately 208th to 63rd.



                                                           3
changing the cap. Several states have also reached their overall cap on charter schools or have

limited remaining growth, including Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts (as previously discussed),

and Rhode Island, setting these states up for policy decisions around further growth (Ziebarth and

Palmer, 2018). The federal government also supports charter school replication, with several charter

school networks receiving very large grants to replicate their models, including 2019 awards of over

$100 million to IDEA Public Schools and over $85 million to KIPP.3

   We use records from randomized charter school admission lotteries to study changes in the

eﬀectiveness of Boston’s charter middle school sector during this period of rapid expansion. By

comparing the outcomes of students who receive lottery oﬀers to those that do not, we remove

selection bias and therefore generate reliable estimates of the causal eﬀects of charter school at-

tendance. The lottery records studied here cover 14 of the 15 charter schools admitting students

in ﬁfth or sixth grade during the time period of our study. This is important in light of evidence

that schools with more readily available lottery records tend to be more eﬀective (Abdulkadiroğlu

et al., 2011). Unlike previous studies that focus on subsets of oversubscribed charter schools, our

estimates provide a representative picture of the eﬀectiveness of the Boston charter middle school

sector before and after expansion.

   Consistent with past work, our estimates for cohorts applying before 2010 show large positive

impacts of charter attendance on test scores. Speciﬁcally, a year of attendance at a Boston charter

middle school boosted math achievement by between 0.18 and 0.32 standard deviations (σ) and

increased English achievement by about 0.1σ during this period. Our results also indicate that

policymakers selected more eﬀective schools for expansion: proven providers produced larger eﬀects

than other charter schools before the reform.

   Estimates for the post-reform period reveal that Boston’s charter sector remained eﬀective while

doubling in size. Proven providers and other existing charters maintained their eﬀectiveness after

the reform, while expansion charters generate achievement gains comparable to those of their par-

ent schools. Moreover, expansion charters produce these large impacts while enrolling students that

appear more representative of the general Boston population than students at other charters. To-

gether, the estimates for new and existing schools imply an increase in overall charter eﬀectiveness

despite the substantial growth in charter market share after the 2010 reform.

    We explore the roles of student composition, public school alternatives, and school practices in

mediating the eﬀectiveness of expansion charter schools. Though changes in demographic compo-

sition contributed modestly to the positive impacts of new charters, neither changes in the student

body nor the quality of applicants’ fallback traditional public schools explain the pattern of results.

Instead, it appears that proven providers successfully transmitted hiring and pedagogical practices

to new campuses. An analysis of teacher value-added indicates that charter schools reduce returns to

experience and compress the distribution of teacher eﬀectiveness while also employing a large share

of new and inexperienced teachers. These ﬁndings are consistent with the possibility that Boston’s

charter schools use a highly standardized school model that limits teacher discretion, which may

facilitate replicability in new contexts.

    The next section provides background on charter schools in Boston and the charter expansion

reform. Section 3 describes the data and Section 4 details the empirical framework used to analyze

it. Section 5 presents lottery-based estimates of charter school eﬀects before and after the reform.

Section 6 explores the role of student composition and fallback schools, and Section 7 discusses

charter management practices and teacher productivity. Section 8 oﬀers concluding thoughts.

2       Background

2.1     Charter Schools in Boston

    The ﬁrst charter schools in Boston opened in 1994. Boston charters oﬀer a diﬀerent educational

experience than traditional public schools operating in the Boston Public Schools (BPS) district.

Table 1 compares inputs and practices of BPS schools and the 14 charter middle schools in our

analysis sample (described in more detail later on). Columns (1) and (5) of Panel A show that

charter students spend more days per year and hours per day in school than BPS students. Charter

teachers tend to be younger and less experienced than BPS teachers; as a result, they are much

less likely to be licensed or designated highly-qualiﬁed.4 Charter schools and BPS have similar

student/teacher ratios, but charters spend somewhat less money per pupil ($18,766 vs. $17,041), a

diﬀerence driven by lower salaries and retirement costs for their less-experienced teachers (Setren,
    4
     In the time period of our study teachers were designated highly qualified if they possessed a Massachusetts
teaching license and a bachelor’s degree, and passed a state examination or held a degree in their subject area. The
highly qualified label was discontinued with the passage of the federal Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) in 2015.

2016).

    Boston charter schools commonly subscribe to No Excuses pedagogy, an approach that uti-

lizes strict discipline, extended instructional time, selective teacher hiring, frequent testing, high

expectations, teacher feedback, data-driven instruction, and tutoring (Carter, 2000; Thernstrom

and Thernstrom, 2003). Panel B of Table 1 reports the mean of an index of No Excuses policies,

constructed as an equally-weighted average of features typically associated with the No Excuses

model.5 On average, Boston charter schools implement 90 percent of these policies. Charters also

commonly oﬀer Saturday school and school break programming for homework help and tutoring.

These practices diﬀer markedly from practices at BPS schools and at non-urban charter schools in

Massachusetts (Angrist, Pathak, and Walters, 2013).

    Previous research has documented that Boston charters boost math and English standardized

test scores (Abdulkadiroğlu et al., 2011; Cohodes et al., 2013; Walters, 2018). This ﬁnding is

consistent with studies showing positive test score eﬀects for urban No Excuses charters elsewhere

(Dobbie and Fryer, 2011, 2013; Angrist et al., 2010, 2012; Chabrier, Cohodes, and Oreopoulos, 2016;

Abdulkadiroğlu et al., 2017). Recent evidence shows that Boston charter high schools also increase

longer-term outcomes, including SAT scores, Advanced Placement (AP) credit, and enrollment in

four-year college (Angrist et al., 2016).

    Funding for Massachusetts public school students follows their school enrollment. Speciﬁcally,

charter schools receive tuition payments from their students’ home districts equal to district per-

pupil expenditure. The state partially reimburses districts for charter school payments during a

transition period, but these reimbursements have not been fully funded in recent years. Prior to

2010, Massachusetts law capped the overall number of charter schools at 120 and limited total

charter school tuition to 9 percent of a district’s spending. Charter expenditure in Boston reached

this cap in fall 2009 (Boston Municipal Research Bureau, 2008). As a result, the charter cap limited

the expansion of charter schools in Boston before 2010.




    5
      The No Excuses index is an average of indicators equal to one if the following items are mentioned in a school’s
annual report: high expectations for academics, high expectations for behavior, strict behavior code, college prepara-
tory curriculum, core values in school culture, selective teacher hiring or incentive pay, emphasis on math and reading,
uniforms, hires Teach For America teachers, Teaching Fellows, or AmeriCorps members, affiliated with Teach For
America alumni, data driven instruction, and regular teacher feedback.

2.2    Charter Expansion

In January 2010, Governor Deval Patrick signed An Act Relative to the Achievement Gap into law.

This reform relaxed Massachusetts’ charter cap to allow the charter sector to double for districts in

the lowest decile of performance according to a measure derived from test score levels and growth.

The law also included provisions for school turnarounds and the creation of “innovation” schools

(Massachusetts State Legislature, 2010).

    For Boston and other aﬀected districts, the 2010 reform increased the limit on charter spending

from 9 percent to 18 percent of district funds between 2010 and 2017. “Proven providers” – existing

schools or school models the Massachusetts Board of Elementary and Secondary Education deemed

eﬀective – could apply to open new schools or expand enrollment. The law also allowed school

districts to create up to 14 “in-district” charter schools without prior approval from the local teachers’

union or proven provider status. Concurrent with the increased supply of charter seats, the law

required charters to increase recruitment and retention eﬀorts for high need students and allowed

charters to send advertising mailers to all students in the district.6

    The state received 71 initial applications (some of which it solicited) for new charter schools

or expansions from August 2010 to August 2012, and invited 60 percent of applicants to submit

ﬁnal round proposals. To determine whether a school model qualiﬁed for proven provider status,

the Massachusetts Board of Elementary and Secondary Education compared existing schools using

the model to other charters and traditional public schools. Criteria for this evaluation included

enrollment of high-need students, attrition, grade retention, dropout, graduation, attendance, sus-

pensions, and performance on state achievement tests (Massachusetts Department of Elementary

and Secondary Education, 2015). The state granted proven provider status to four of seven Boston

charter middle schools, as well as to the KIPP organization, which operated a charter school in

Lynn, Massachusetts, but had not yet entered Boston. Together, the provisions of the 2010 reform

led to the establishment of 27 new charter campuses between 2011 and 2013, as well as expansions of

17 existing charter schools, typically to new grade levels (Massachusetts Department of Elementary

and Secondary Education, 2016).


   6
     The state’s definition of high need students includes those with special education or English language learner
status, eligibility for subsidized lunch, or low scores on state achievement tests, as well as students deemed to be at
risk of dropping out of school.



                                                          7
   Charter enrollment in Boston expanded rapidly after 2010. This can be seen in Figure 1, which

plots shares of kindergarten, sixth, and ninth grade students attending charter schools. These

statistics are calculated using the administrative enrollment data described below. Sixth grade

charter enrollment doubled after the reform, expanding from 15 to 31 percent between 2010 and

2015. Charter enrollment also grew substantially in elementary and high school, though not as

dramatically as in middle school. The share of Boston students in charter schools increased from

5 percent to 13 percent in kindergarten and from 9 percent to 15 percent in ninth grade over the

same time period.

   The characteristics and practices of Boston’s new expansion charter schools are broadly similar

to those of their proven provider parent schools. This is shown in columns (2) through (4) of Table

1, which describe proven providers, other charters operating before 2010, and new expansions. Like

proven providers, expansion schools have longer school days and years than BPS schools, and rate

highly on the index of No Excuses practices. Per-pupil expenditure is similar at proven provider

and expansion schools, and lower at other charters. New campuses located an average of 3.1 miles

from their parent campuses, often expanding into diﬀerent Boston neighborhoods (see Figure 2).

   Expansion charter schools are primarily staﬀed by young teachers with little teaching experience.

Table 2 reports that 78 percent of teachers at proven providers in the year before expansion were

less than 32 years old, while 87 percent of expansion charter teachers were below this threshold

in the year after expansion. These and other teacher characteristics come from an administrative

database of Massachusetts public school employees (see the Data Appendix). Columns (4) and

(7) show that proven providers transferred some teachers from parent campuses to help staﬀ their

expansions: 12 percent of parent campus teachers moved to expansion campuses, accounting for 25

percent of the teaching workforce at these new schools. Transferred teachers were less experienced

than teachers who remained at parent campuses (2.2 years vs. 3.3 years). Most of the remaining

expansion teachers had not previously taught in a Massachusetts school (66 percent), though a few

transferred from other schools (9 percent). As a result, the average teacher at an expansion charter

had only 1.4 years of teaching experience, compared to 2.9 years for teachers at parent campuses

and 11.5 years for BPS teachers.




                                                 8
3       Data

3.1     Data Sources and Sample Construction

We study the eﬀectiveness of Boston charter middle schools using records from randomized admission

lotteries conducted between 2004 and 2013. Some charters serving middle school grades (ﬁfth

through eighth) accept students prior to ﬁfth grade, mostly in kindergarten; we focus on schools

with ﬁfth or sixth grade entry because their lotteried students are old enough to take achievement

tests within our data window. Our sample includes 14 of the 15 Boston charter schools with ﬁfth

or sixth grade entry, accounting for 94 percent of enrollment for schools in this category during the

2013-2014 school year.7

    Lottery records typically list applicant names along with application grades, dates of birth, towns

of residence and sibling statuses. Our analysis excludes sibling applicants, out-of-area applicants,

and students who applied to non-entry grades (siblings are guaranteed admission, while out-of-

area applicants are typically ineligible). The lottery records also indicate which students received

admission oﬀers. We distinguish between immediate oﬀers received on the day of the lottery and later

oﬀers received from the waitlist; in some lotteries all students eventually receive waitlist oﬀers. All

oﬀers are coded as waitlist oﬀers in a few lotteries where we cannot distinguish between immediate

and waitlist oﬀers. Further information on school coverage and lottery records appears in Appendix

Tables A1 and A2. We use the “proven provider” label to refer to the four middle school charters

in Boston that were granted permission to expand. The seven new campuses opened in the 2011-12

and 2012-13 school years are labeled “expansion charters,” and the three remaining charter middle

schools are “other charters.” 8

    We match the lottery records to state administrative data based on name, date of birth, town

of residence and application cohort. The administrative data cover all students enrolled in Mas-


    7
      Two charter middle schools that closed before 2010 are excluded from this calculation. The one missing school
declined to provide lottery records.
    8
      We categorize MATCH Middle School as a proven provider, as MATCH obtained that categorization from
the state. MATCH’s expansion campus opened at the elementary level, however. We categorize KIPP: Boston as
an expansion campus, but this school does not have a direct parent campus in Boston as KIPP’s only previous
Massachusetts campus was in Lynn. We classify UP Academy as an expansion charter even though it opened under
a different provision of the charter school law. To check whether our results are sensitive to these classification
decisions, Appendix Table A4 reports an alternative version of our main results with these three schools categorized
as “other charters.” The findings here remain generally the same, with other charters demonstrating slightly larger
effects and proven providers and expansion schools showing smaller gains than in our preferred specification.

sachusetts public schools between 2002 and 2014. As shown in Appendix Table A3, we ﬁnd matches

for 95 percent of lottery applicants in this database. Administrative records include school en-

rollment, gender, race, special education status, English language learner status, subsidized lunch

status, and test scores on Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System (MCAS) achievement

tests. We standardize MCAS scores to have mean zero and standard deviation one for Boston

students by subject, grade and year. In addition to information on charter lottery applicants, we

use administrative data on other Boston students to describe changes in charter application and

enrollment patterns after the 2010 reform. The Data Appendix provides more details regarding

data processing and sample construction.




3.2    Descriptive Statistics

Charter application and enrollment patterns in our analysis sample mirror the large increases in

charter market share displayed in Figure 1. As shown in Table 3, 15 percent of eligible Boston

students applied to charter schools with ﬁfth or sixth grade entry before the 2010 reform, 12 percent

received oﬀers from these schools, and 10 percent enrolled. This implies roughly 1.5 applicants for

each available charter seat. The application rate increased to 35 percent in 2013, and attendance

reached 17 percent.9 The increase in applications therefore outpaced enrollment growth, boosting

the number of applicants per seat to 2. This increase in demand was particularly pronounced at

other charter schools (neither proven providers nor expansions), which saw their applications per

seat rise from 1.9 to 4.10 After the expansion, half of charter school sixth grade students attended

new expansion campuses.

    Table 4 describes the characteristics of Boston middle school students in BPS, charter schools,

and our randomized lottery applicant sample. Charter applicants and enrollees are consistently

more likely to be black than BPS students. Both before and after 2010, students attending proven

providers were less disadvantaged than other Boston students as measured by special education

status, limited English proﬁciency, and fourth grade test scores. Past achievement and other char-

   9
      These attendance percentages are lower than the percentages in Figure 1, since they exclude charter schools that
enroll students at earlier entry grade levels.
   10
      The number of applicants per seat is larger for each individual charter type than for the sector as a whole because
some students apply to more than one school.



                                                           10
acteristics of students enrolled at proven providers and randomized applicants were similar before

the reform, but diverged somewhat afterward. This is due to the fact that one proven provider

campus transitioned to a K - 8 structure in 2010-11 by grandfathering students from its elementary

school instead of ﬁlling its entire ﬁfth grade via random lottery.

    As shown in columns (11) and (12) of Table 4, the characteristics of students enrolled at expan-

sion charters diﬀer markedly from those of other charter students. Special education and limited

English proﬁciency rates are similar at expansion charters and in the BPS population. Expansion

charter students also score below the BPS average on 4th grade math and English tests, and are

more likely than BPS students to be eligible for subsidized lunches. These facts indicate that expan-

sion charters attract a more disadvantaged, lower-achieving population than their proven provider

parent schools. This pattern may reﬂect the changes in recruitment practices resulting from the

2010 Achievement Gap Act, which mandated that charter schools take steps to enroll higher-need

students and allowed charters to advertise directly to all students in the district by mail.



4    Empirical Framework

    We use charter lottery oﬀers as instruments for charter school attendance in a causal model

with multiple endogenous variables, each representing enrollment in a type of charter school. The

structural equation links charter attendance with outcomes as follows:

                                         K
                                         X                J
                                                          X
                                                   k
                            Yig = αg +         βk Cig +         δj Rij + Xi′ γ + ǫig ,              (1)
                                         k=1              j=1

                                                                  k measures years of enrollment in
where Yig is a test score for charter applicant i in grade g and Cig

charter school type k through grade g. Charter types include parent campuses, expansion campuses,

and other charters; we also distinguish between enrollment before and after the charter expansion

law. The parameters of interest, βk , represent causal eﬀects of an additional year of attendance at

each charter type relative to traditional public schools. The key control variables in equation (1)

are a set of indicators, Rij , for all combinations of charter lottery applications present in the data.

Lottery oﬀers are randomly assigned within these “risk sets.” A vector of baseline demographic char-

acteristics, Xi , is also included to increase precision. These characteristics, which are measured in



                                                     11
the year prior to a student’s lottery application, include gender, race, a female-minority interaction,

subsidized lunch status, English language learner status, and special education status.

     The ﬁrst stage equations for each charter enrollment type are given by:

                              K 
                              X                       XJ

                                                                                 ; k = 1...K.                     (2)

      k denotes a dummy variable equal to one if applicant i received an immediate oﬀer to attend
Here Zi1
                                             k equals one if the applicant later received an oﬀer

from the waitlist. Like equation (1), the ﬁrst stage also controls for lottery risk set indicators and

baseline student characteristics. Two-stage least squares (2SLS) estimates are obtained by ordinary

least squares (OLS) estimation of equation (1) after substituting predicted values from (2) for the

charter attendance variables. The estimation sample stacks all post-lottery test scores in grades ﬁve

through eight for randomized charter applicants, and standard errors are clustered by student to

account for correlation in outcomes across grades.

     Our empirical strategy is motivated by the fact that charter lottery oﬀers are randomly assigned

within lottery risk sets and are therefore independent of ability, family background, and all other pre-

determined student attributes. Appendix Table A5 presents a check on this by comparing baseline

characteristics for oﬀered and non-oﬀered applicants within lottery risk sets. These comparisons

show that lottery winners and losers are similar for all charter school types and time periods,

indicating that random assignment was successful.11

5        Lottery Estimates

     We begin by reporting a pooled set of 2SLS impact estimates for all Boston charter middle

schools across our full sample period. These estimates, which appear in Table 5, come from a

version of equations (1) and (2) that uses a single instrument (any charter oﬀer) to instrument for

a single endogenous variable (total years in charter). The ﬁrst stage estimate in column (1) shows

that a charter school oﬀer increases charter attendance by an average of one year. Column (2)
    11
     Even with random assignment, selective attrition may lead to bias in comparisons of lottery winners and losers.
Appendix Tables A3 and A6 show that the attrition rate from our sample is low: we match 95 percent of applicants
to the administrative data, and find roughly 85 percent of post-lottery test scores that should be observed in our
sample window for matched students. The match rate is 4 percent higher for students offered charter seats, and we
are 3 percent more likely to find scores for students with lottery offers at non-proven-provider charters before 2010.
This modest differential attrition seems unlikely to meaningfully affect the results reported below.

reports reduced form diﬀerences in test scores between lottery winners and losers. The results here

show that lottery winners outscore losers by 0.22σ in math and 0.12σ in ELA. Because the ﬁrst

stage is roughly one, the 2SLS estimates in column (3) are similar to the reduced form, implying

that a year of charter attendance boosts math and ELA scores by 0.22σ and 0.12σ on average.

These results, which represent the most precise and representative estimates of the eﬀectiveness of

Boston’s charter sector to date, are similar to the eﬀects reported by Abdulkadiroğlu et al. (2011)

in a subsample of the schools and cohorts studied here.

    Proven provider charter schools generated larger achievement gains than other charter schools

in Boston prior to the 2010 expansion. This can be seen in Table 6, which reports second-stage

estimates of equation (1).12 Columns (2) and (3) demonstrate that a year of charter attendance

at a proven provider increased math and English scores by 0.32σ and 0.12σ prior to the reform,

estimates that are highly statistically signiﬁcant. Corresponding math and English eﬀects for other

Boston charters equal 0.18σ and 0.08σ. The diﬀerence in eﬀects for proven providers and other

charters is statistically signiﬁcant in math (p = 0.00), though not in English. This ﬁnding indicates

that policymakers selected more eﬀective charter schools to be eligible for expansion.

    Proven providers and other charters maintained their eﬀectiveness after the charter expansion

reform. As shown in columns (5) and (7) of Table 6, proven providers boost math and English

scores by 0.37σ and 0.19σ per year of attendance after 2010, while other charters increase scores

by 0.19σ and 0.13σ in this period. These estimates are slightly larger than estimates for earlier

cohorts, though the diﬀerences between pre- and post-reform eﬀects are not statistically signiﬁcant

for either group. As in the pre-reform period, the diﬀerence in eﬀects between proven providers and

other charters is signiﬁcant in math (p = 0.03). These results indicate that expanding to operate

new campuses did not dilute the eﬀectiveness of proven provider charters at their original campuses.

    Proven providers also successfully replicated their impacts at expansion schools. Column (6)

of Table 6 demonstrates that a year of attendance at an expansion charter school increases math

and English test scores by 0.32σ and 0.23σ. These estimates are comparable to estimates for

parent campuses, and the hypothesis that expansion and proven provider eﬀects are equal cannot
   12
      Appendix Table A7 reports first stage estimates separately by charter type. The first stage coefficients are
generally smaller in the post-expansion period for all charter types. This reflects the fact that less time has elapsed in
our data for cohorts applying after 2010, resulting in fewer years of potential charter enrollment between lottery and
test dates. Reduced form estimates are reported in Appendix Table A8 and OLS estimates of charter school effects
that control for prior test scores and baseline characteristics are in Appendix Table A9.



                                                           13
be rejected at conventional levels (p = 0.63 and 0.62 in math and English). Estimated eﬀects

for expansion charters are larger than corresponding estimates for other charters during the same

time period, though these diﬀerences are only marginally statistically signiﬁcant for math and not

statistically signiﬁcant for English. Combined with the consistent eﬀects for proven providers and

other charters over time, these results indicate that Boston’s charter middle school sector slightly

increased its average eﬀectiveness despite the growth in charter market share over this period.

6     Exploring Effect Heterogeneity

The impacts of expansion charters are particularly striking in view of the changes in selection

documented in Table 4: new charter campuses continue to generate large eﬀects despite serving

more typical students. This suggests that positive charter eﬀects are not an artifact of a positively-

selected peer environment. This ﬁnding is also consistent with results reported by Walters (2018),

which suggest that charter eﬀects are larger for the average Boston student than for the average

charter applicant, as well as estimates in Abdulkadiroğlu et al. (2016), which indicate that charter

eﬀects are larger for students passively enrolled in charters through school conversion than for

students who voluntarily apply through lotteries. We further investigate the impact of changes in

the charter population on the eﬀects of charter expansion by studying eﬀect heterogeneity across

subgroups and changes in the quality of the fallback traditional public schools available to charter

applicants.


6.1   Student Characteristics

The 2010 charter expansion law encourages charter schools to recruit and retain students with

higher needs, as measured by criteria including English proﬁciency, special education status and

past achievement. Appendix Table A10 summarizes eﬀect heterogeneity as a function of these

characteristics.

    The estimates show consistent positive impacts across most subgroups, charter school types,

time periods and subjects. Eﬀects are similar for English language learners and students without

this designation, though estimates for the former group are often imprecise due to small sample

sizes. All estimates are positive for students with and without special education status; eﬀects

for special education students appear to be somewhat smaller at proven providers and larger at


                                                 14
expansion charters, but these diﬀerences may be a chance ﬁnding due to the many splits examined.

As in previous studies (e.g., Walters, 2018), we ﬁnd that eﬀects tend to be larger for students with

lower previous test scores. The large estimated eﬀects for high-need subgroups at expansion charters

are noteworthy: expansion schools continue to generate substantial gains for these groups despite

serving larger shares of such students than other Boston charters.

   We analyze the role of this heterogeneity in the eﬀectiveness of charter expansion via a Oaxaca-

Blinder (1973)-style decomposition, which splits charter school treatment eﬀects into components

explained and unexplained by student characteristics. This decomposition is based on 2SLS models

of the form:
                                  K
                                  X                                       J
                                                                          X
                                    !                       
                     Yig = αg +         βk0   +   Xi′ β x        k
                                                                Cig   +         δj Rij + Xi′ γ + ǫig .   (3)
                                  k=1                                     j=1

Equation (3) allows a separate main eﬀect for attendance at each charter type (βk0 ) as well as an

interaction with student characteristics common across charter types (β x ). Charter exposure Cig
                                                                                               k


and its interactions with Xi are treated as endogenous. The immediate and waitlist oﬀer variables

   Let X̄k denote the average characteristics of students attending charter k, and let µx ≡ E[Xi ]

denote the mean of Xi for the Boston population. The eﬀect of charter type k for students enrolled

at k (the eﬀect of treatment on the treated, T OTk ) can be represented:

                                          T OTk = βk0 + X̄k′ β x

                                   !              !        ′
                                  = βk0 + µx′ β x + X̄k − µx β x .                                       (4)

                                          AT Ek                       M atchk


This expression decomposes the TOT for charter type k into an average treatment eﬀect for the

Boston population, AT Ek , and a deviation from the average treatment eﬀect due to the charac-

teristics of type k’s students, M atchk . We quantify the contribution of student characteristics to

charter school eﬀectiveness by studying estimates of AT Ek and M atchk for each school type and

time period.

   Table 7 reports estimates of the components of the decomposition in equation (4), using gender,

race, ethnicity, English language learner status, subsidized lunch, special education, and baseline

test scores as interaction variables. Two-stage least squares estimates appear in panel A, and panel


                                                            15
B displays corresponding OLS estimates for comparison. As with the treatment eﬀect estimates in

Table A9, the OLS decomposition results tend to be qualitatively similar and more precise than

the 2SLS results. Estimated match components are close to zero for proven providers in both time

periods, while match components for other charters are negative in both periods. This indicates that

the demographic composition of other charters reduces their eﬀectiveness, a result that is consistent

with Walters’ (2018) ﬁnding that disadvantaged students were less likely to apply to Boston charter

schools despite experiencing larger achievement beneﬁts in data prior to the reform.

    In contrast, column (4) reveals positive match eﬀects for expansion charter schools. This pattern

is due to the fact that expansion charters enroll a lower-achieving set of students compared to other

charters (see Table 4). Since achievement gains are larger for this group, the match eﬀect reinforces

the eﬀectiveness of expansion charters. The magnitudes of these match eﬀects are relatively small,

however, accounting for roughly 4 percent and 8 percent of the TOT in math and ELA. Evidently,

changes in student characteristics increased the eﬀectiveness of new charter campuses but were not

the primary driver of the eﬀectiveness of expansion schools.


6.2    Fallback Schools

One potential explanation for the success of Boston charter school expansion, where other eﬀorts at

program replication have been less successful, is that students in expansion campuses face particu-

larly poor alternatives if they do not attend a charter school. Chabrier, Cohodes, and Oreopolous

(2016) ﬁnd that poor fallback school options are one of the strongest predictors of charter school

eﬀectiveness. It also is possible that charter schools inﬂuence the counterfactual by diverting re-

sources from district schools, as is the case in Arsen and Ni (2012); Bifulco and Reback (2014); Cook

(2018); Ladd and Singleton (2018). However Ridley and Terrier (2018) ﬁnd small gains in district

school ﬁnances (and test scores) in Massachusetts using the same charter expansion law.13 Expan-

sion campuses in Boston may have located in areas where students’ counterfactual schools were

lower-performing. To see if low-quality fallback schools explain the success of expansion campuses,

we compare fallback school conditions across charter school types, both before and after charter
   13
      Other studies of competitive effects of charter schools on nearby district schools’ test scores generally find no
or small positive impacts (Booker et al., 2008; Cordes, 2018; Jinnai, 2014; Davis, 2013; Sass, 2006; Shin, Fuller, and
Dauter, 2017; Winters, 2012; Zimmer et al., 2009; Zimmer and Buddin, 2009). One exception is Imberman (2011)
which found a mix of neutral and negative effects. For reviews of this literature, see: Betts (2009); Gill and Booker
(2008); Gill (2016); Epple, Romano, and Zimmer (2016).



                                                          16
school expansion.

     Table 8 shows average school-level value-added estimates for traditional public schools attended

by students that enroll in district schools as a result of losing a charter lottery (untreated com-

pliers).14 Value-added estimates are OLS coeﬃcients from regressions of test scores on school

indicators, with controls for lagged test scores and demographics. Speciﬁcation tests reported by

Angrist et al. (2017) indicate that estimates from models of this type provide a reasonable proxy

for school eﬀectiveness. In both math and ELA, estimated value-added of the traditional public

school fallback alternatives attended by charter applicants does not diﬀer by charter school type,

and these fallback schools appear to be of roughly average quality among schools in BPS. Students’

fallback options therefore do not seem to be an important component of variation in eﬀects across

charter types or time periods.



7        School Practices

Our results so far show that changes in student characteristics and the quality of applicants’ fall-

back schools do not explain the eﬀectiveness of expansion charters. This suggests that successful

replication of the Boston charter model may be driven by attributes of the expansion schools them-

selves. We explore this hypothesis by providing a more detailed account of organizational practices

at parent and expansion charter schools in Boston. This portion of our analysis includes a quali-

tative overview of the mechanics of charter expansion based on interviews with school leaders (S.

Dunn, J. Clark, W. Austin, A. Hall, and D. Lehman, personal communication, May 2017), as well

as a quantitative assessment of teacher value-added that gives an indication of how heterogeneity

in teacher quality is managed in traditional public and charter schools.


7.1        Standardized School Models and Leadership

Proven provider charter schools sought to maintain ﬁdelity of their school models during expansion

by emphasizing adherence to the same educational practices at new campuses. Table 1 shows a

comparison of practices at parent and expansion charters based on information drawn from charter



    14
         We estimate untreated complier outcomes using methods from Abadie (2002).



                                                         17
school annual reports.15 Expansion schools typically have the same amount of instructional time

as their parent campuses, including identical length of the school day, time devoted to math and

reading instruction, and days in the school year.16 Expansion schools similarly implemented their

parent campuses’ No Excuses practices, tutoring, homework help, and Saturday school programs.

    Expanding charter networks also tried to maintain similar pedagogical practices at old and new

campuses. Teachers co-planned curricula and teachers judged to be eﬀective were encouraged to

share their lesson plans across the network. This model of shared teaching resources was aimed at

supporting new, inexperienced teachers, who comprised two thirds of the new schools’ staﬀ. Survey

evidence from Boston charters indicates that such collaboration is common within the sector, with

59 percent of new teachers reporting co-planning the curriculum with their peers (Gabbianelli,

McGovern, and Wu, 2014). Recent evidence from other contexts shows that such collaboration can

increase student achievement (Jackson and Bruegmann, 2009; Ronfeldt et al., 2015; Papay et al.,

2016; Sun, Loeb, and Grissom, 2017) and that access to high quality lesson plans also boosts student

achievement (Jackson and Makarin 2018). Fryer (2014) found that charter practices, similar to those

used in Boston charters, can be successfully transfered to traditional public schools.

    High teacher turnover rates are the norm at Boston charter schools. This is shown in Table 9,

which summarizes teacher mobility patterns at charter and traditional public schools. As a result,

some practices aimed at quickly training new teachers were in place prior to the 2010 reform. This

may have aided schools’ eﬀorts to bring inexperienced teachers at new campuses up to speed on

key practices. Two charter networks run their own teacher training programs and hired some of the

graduates as full-time teachers. Charter networks also centralized teacher recruitment and profes-

sional development, potentially saving on search costs and resulting in similar types of teachers hired

at new and old schools. Each network reported conducting some share of professional development

at the network level.

    Growing charter networks had stable leadership throughout the scaling up process. Principals

in the new and original campuses did not change throughout the expansion period in this study.17
  15
       The Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education provided the 2012-13 annual reports
for each of the Boston charter middle schools at our request. The state requires charter schools to submit annual
reports and uses the reports when considering schools’ charter renewal applications.
    16
       Edward Brooke’s replication campus in East Boston is an exception, with six more days in its school year than
its parent campus.
    17
       We verified this in Education Personnel Information Management Systems (EPIMS), the educator database
available from the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, which contains yearly staff level data for all



                                                        18
Furthermore, principals were trained internally: all of the principals at expansion campuses were

former teachers from the original campus. School leaders who oversaw their network’s expansion

stressed the value of selecting principals from within the network because they are familiar with

core school practices. Columns (3) and (6) of Table 9 show that roughly 4 percent of charter school

teachers were promoted to a leadership position from 2011 to 2014, compared to less than 1 percent

of BPS teachers.


7.2    Evidence on Teacher Productivity

The qualitative evidence above suggests that Boston charter schools limit teacher discretion by

emphasizing a standard set of pedagogical practices, which may facilitate eﬀorts to implement

similar school models at new campuses. We assess this quantitatively by studying variation in

teacher value-added at charter and district schools. Teacher value-added estimates come from the

following model for achievement of student i in grade g in calendar year t:


                                        ′
                      Yigt = αg + λt + Xigt γ + βs(i,g) + θj(i,g)t + δc(i,g,t) + ξi + ǫigt .         (5)


The control vector Xigt includes student demographic characteristics and lagged test scores, as well

as classroom-level averages of these variables. We also include grade (αg ) and calendar year (λt )

ﬁxed eﬀects. The function s(i, g) labels the school that student i attends for grade g, j(i, g) describes

the identity of her grade g teacher, and c(i, g, t) denotes a speciﬁc classroom. Because classroom-

level averages of the observables are included as controls, (5) describes a “correlated random eﬀects”

model in which the mean of the teacher eﬀect distribution may depend on the characteristics of

students in the classroom (Mundlak, 1978; Chamberlain, 1982). In other words, we are not imposing

independence of teacher quality from student observables.

    We also allow school and teacher eﬀects to depend on observed school and teacher characteristics.

The mean of the distribution ofschool eﬀects βs diﬀers for charter and traditional public schools.

The teacher eﬀects (which measure variation in teacher eﬀectiveness within school) are in turn

written:

                                              θjt = θj0 + Wjt′ θw ,

employees in Massachusetts public schools.



                                                       19
where Wjt includes teacher j’s experience as of year t in one of three experience groups (novice, 1

to 4 years of experience, and greater than ﬁve years of experience) as well as interactions of charter

status with experience. Given the small number of charter teachers in the sample, we do not

separate teachers at proven providers, expansions, and other charters for the purposes of the value-

added model, nor do we estimate experience premia for each year.18 We model the school eﬀects βs ,

within-school teacher eﬀects θj0 , and classroom eﬀects δc as normally distributed conditional on Xigt ,

with variances that diﬀer in charter and traditional public schools. The student random eﬀect ξi

and idiosyncratic error ǫigt are also modeled as normally distributed. Random eﬀects speciﬁcations

of this sort are common in the literature on teacher value-added, and previous studies have argued

that such models generate estimates of teacher eﬀectiveness that exhibit little selection bias (Kane,

Rockoﬀ, and Staiger, 2008; Chetty, Friedman, and Rockoﬀ, 2014).19

    As can be seen in Table 10, maximum likelihood estimation of model (5) produces two notable

ﬁndings. First, returns to teacher experience seem to beless pronounced in charter schools than

in BPS. Comparing teachers with 1 to 4 years of experience and teachers with 5 or more years

of experience to novices shows that more experienced teachers generally outperform new teachers.

However, the experience premium is larger in BPS (though the diﬀerences are not statistically

signiﬁcant), with teachers with 1 to 4 years of experience outperforming novice teachers in BPS by

about 0.09σ in both math and English. The corresponding experience premia for teachers in charter

schools equal 0.06σ and 0.04σ. For teachers with more than 5 years of experience, BPS teachers

maintain their edge relative to novices, but any premium for charter school teachers is small and not

statistically signiﬁcant. In short, either through selection of teachers or through training, charter

schools dampen one of the most persistent ﬁndings in the literature on teacher eﬀectiveness (Harris

2011; Papay and Kraft 2015; Clotfelter, Ladd, and Vigdor 2007; Rockoﬀ 2004) – that teachers make

signiﬁcant gains in their ﬁrst few years of teaching. Evidently, teachers at charter schools deliver

eﬀective education despite the high proportion of novice teachers and substantial teacher turnover.

We caution, however, that while our estimates of the diﬀerence in experience proﬁles between the

      Data for the value-added model are from 2011-2015, the years in which it is possible to link students, teachers,
and classrooms in the state data.
   19
      Our findings are robust to variants of this model. We estimated versions where we used teacher random effects,
teacher and school random effects, teacher fixed effects, and school and teacher fixed effects. We also ran versions
that added student random effects, phased in controls, restricted to the sample to exclude students who attended
both Charter and BPS during middle school, and used finer years of experience indicators to similar findings.

two sectors are quantitatively large, we cannot reject the hypothesis that these parameters are equal

due to a lack of statistical precision.

     The second notable ﬁnding from the value-added analysis is revealed by comparing variation in

school, teacher, and class eﬀects across the charter and traditional sectors. Both charter and district

schools have similar variation in school-level eﬀectiveness. At the teacher and classroom levels, we

ﬁnd less variation in eﬀectiveness in the charter sector. In math, the standard deviation of the

teacher random eﬀect θj0 is 0.12σ compared to 0.19σ in BPS, while the standard deviation of the

class eﬀect δc is 0.08σ compared to 0.15σ.20 This suggests that the charter sector reduces variation

in teacher eﬀectiveness within schools, which may be due to charters’ centralized management of

teachers and standardized instructional practices.21 Additionally, the charter hiring practices could

select teachers with less variation in their practices, though this would also be part of a management

strategy. The reduction in variation at the classroom level (which is typically attributed to random

events like construction noise on test day) suggests some of this variation is systematic and can be

reduced through standardized practices as well. Both conclusions from the value-added analysis are

consistent with the hypothesis that highly standardized management practices may contribute to

the successful replication of charter school eﬀects.



8        Conclusion

The replication and expansion of successful schools is one strategy to address persistent achievement

gaps in the United States. The eﬃcacy of this strategy requires schools selected for expansion

to maintain their success at new locations and with new student populations. Previous research

has shown that urban No Excuses charter schools boost test scores markedly for small groups of

applicants, suggesting the potential for transformational eﬀects on urban achievement if these gains

can be maintained at larger scales. We examine a recent policy change in Massachusetts that

doubled Boston’s charter sector over a short time period, allowing us to evaluate changes in the
    20
      The results found here—that charter value-added standard deviations are around 0.11 and district about 0.18—
indicate that charter schools in Boston are toward the minimum known range of teacher, value-added whereas Boston
district schools are in the middle of the distribution. Hanushek and Rivkin (2010) review the dispersion of teacher
value-added in 10 localities, and find that the standard deviation of teacher effects ranges between 0.11 and 0.36σ in
math and 0.10 and 0.26σ in reading.
   21
      Taylor (2018) and Jackson and Makarin (2018) also show a compression of the teacher value-added distribu-
tion when there are standardized instructional practices. In Taylor (2018), standardization comes from the use of
computer-aided instruction; in Jackson and Makarin (2018) from access to high-quality instructional materials.

eﬀects of No Excuses charters as these schools expanded to serve a larger share of the population.

   Our results demonstrate that Boston’s No Excuses charters reproduced their eﬀectiveness at

new campuses. Lottery-based estimates show that schools selected for expansion produced larger

gains than other charters in the pre-reform period, indicating that Massachusetts’ accountability

regime successfully identiﬁed more successful schools. New expansion campuses generate test score

gains similar to those of their parent campuses despite a doubling of charter market share in middle

school.

   The demographics of students served by expansion charters are similar to those of the Boston

population as a whole, suggesting that charter eﬀectiveness is not driven by unique peer environ-

ments. We ﬁnd that changing student populations and the quality of fallback traditional public

schools play only a small role in the eﬀectiveness of charter expansion, however. Both a qualita-

tive analysis of organizational practices during expansion and a quantitative analysis of variation

in teacher value-added indicate that charter schools use a highly standardized model that limits

variation in practices across schools and classrooms. This standardized approach may facilitate

the portability of charter eﬀectiveness to new campuses. More broadly, the role of these and other

organizational practices in explaining successful replication of social programs is an important area

for future work.

   This paper also brings evidence to bear on the best agent for replicating social programs. When

a program is successful, policymakers face the decision of whether to have the original implementer

continue to provide the program, or whether governments or other agencies should take over the

program at a larger scale. This paper shows that, in the charter school context, replicating existing

charters may be a better option than allowing new providers to enter the sector. This is consistent

with the ﬁndings of Bold et al. (2018), which shows that the successful Kenyan contract teacher

program evaluated in Duﬂo et al. 2011; 2015 was replicated with provision by the original provider,

but not with the government (despite an identical contract). The “proven provider” design of the

Massachusetts 2010 charter law is unique among the states with charter school laws, and it remains

to be seen if other states or charter authorizers adopt such policies. However, the share of charter

schools managed by charter school management organizations (independent, non-proﬁt organiza-

tions that manage two or more charter schools) has grown from 16 percent in 2009 (Furgeson et al.,

2011) to 23 percent in 2017 (David, 2018), indicating that the market may institute a replication

strategy even if authorizors do not.

Data Appendix

    We use lottery records, student demographic and enrollment data, state standardized test scores,

and school personnel ﬁles in this article. Lottery records collected from individual schools contain

the list of applicants, oﬀer status, and factors that aﬀect an applicant’s lottery odds, including

sibling status, disqualiﬁcations, late applications, and applying from outside of Boston. The Student

Information Management Systems (SIMS) dataset contains enrollment and demographic data for

all public school students in Massachusetts. Student standardized test scores come from the state

database for the Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System (MCAS). The Massachusetts

Education Personnel Information Management Systems (EPIMS) database provides school staﬀ

information. Next we describe these datasets, the matching process, and sample construction.

Lottery records

    Massachusetts legally requires charters to admit students via lottery when more students apply

to a charter school than the number of available seats for a given grade. Our paper uses records

from charter lotteries conducted between spring 2004 to spring 2013 for 14 charter schools accepting

students in 5th or 6th grade. Each of the 14 schools contributes oversubscribed lottery data.22

Schools vary in the grades they serve and in years of operation. Table A1 lists this information and

the years each school contributes to the analysis. We exclude one school that did not provide lottery

records (Smith Leadership Academy) and two schools that closed before the charter expansion

(Uphams Corner Charter School in 2009 and Fredrick Douglas Charter School in 2005). Lottery

data typically includes applicants’ names, dates of birth, and lottery and waitlist oﬀer status. Oﬀers

to attend charter schools either occur on the day of the lottery (referred to as immediate of f er)

or after the day of the lottery when students receive oﬀers from the randomly sequenced waitlist as

seats become available. In three out of the 65 lotteries in the study, the schools gave all applicants

oﬀers or did not give waitlist oﬀers to non-siblings. Four lotteries did not distinguish the timing of

the oﬀers so we code the immediate oﬀer variable to equal zero for these cohorts.

    The Uncommon Schools/Roxbury Preparatory charter network held a single lottery for its three


  22
     We do not have Spring 2004 lottery records for Brooke Roslindale, Boston Prep, and Academy of the Pacific Rim
or Spring 2005 records for Brooke Roslindale. Brooke Roslindale does not have lotteries in after charter expansion
because their elementary school students filled the middle school seat. All other schools and years have oversubscribed
lottery data.

campuses in the Spring 2012 and Spring 2013 lotteries. When the school called a students lottery

number, the student could pick from the campuses that still had open seats. Our lottery records

show which campus they picked at the time of the lottery. We ﬁnd the last lottery number for each

campus and code all students with better lottery numbers as having oﬀers from that campus.

   Uncommon Schools oﬀered seats from the waitlist as they became available for individual cam-

puses. Parents chose to accept or decline waitlist oﬀers for single schools. If they declined, they

were taken oﬀ the waitlist and would not be considered for seats at the other campuses.

Enrollment and demographics

   The SIMS data contains individual level data for students enrolled in public schools in Mas-

sachusetts from 2003-2004 through 2013-2014. The data contains snapshots from October and the

end of the school year. Each student has only one observation in each time period, except when

students switch grades or schools within year. Fields include a unique student identiﬁer, grade level,

year, name, date of birth, gender, ethnicity, special education status, limited English proﬁciency

status, free or reduced price lunch status, school attended, suspensions, attendance rates, and days

truant.

   We code students as charter attendees in a school year if they attended a charter at any point

during a year. Students who attend more than one charter school in a year are assigned to the

charter they attended the longest. Students who attend more than one traditional public school

and no charter schools in a year are assigned to the school they attended the longest. We randomly

choose between schools if students have attendance ties between the most attended schools.

Test scores

   This paper uses individual student math and English Language Arts (ELA) Massachusetts

Comprehensive Assessment System (MCAS) test scores from 2003-2004 through 2013-2014. Mas-

sachusetts public school students take the exam each year in grades grades 5 through 8. Data

includes the unique student identiﬁer. We standardize the raw scores to to have a mean of zero

within subject-grade-year in Boston.

Staff records

   The Education Personnel Information Management Systems (EPIMS) contains yearly staﬀ level

data for all employees in Massachusetts public schools. We use data collected in October of the


                                                 43
2007-08 through the 2013-14 school years. Data includes job position, school, full time equivalency,

date of birth, date of hire for ﬁrst public school job in Massachusetts, license status, and highly

qualiﬁed status. We use the full time equivalency of all staﬀ and teachers. If one school has two

half time teachers, they are counted as one full time equivalent teacher. A teacher who teaches at

multiple schools counts towards the staﬀ statistics at each school.

Matching data

   We use applicants’ names, date of birth, grade, and year to match their lottery records to the

state enrollment data. The applicants who uniquely and exactly match the grade, year, name,

and date of birth (if available) in the state records are assigned to the matched unique student id.

After this initial match, we strip names in the lottery and enrollment data of spaces, surnames,

hyphens, and apostrophes. Unique matches after this cleaning are assigned to the matched unique

student id. Then, we use reclink, a fuzzy matching STATA program, to suggest potential matches

for the remaining students. This matches students with slight spelling diﬀerences and those who

appear in one grade older or younger than the charter application grade. We hand check these

suggested matches for accuracy. We search for the remaining unmatched students by hand in the

data. Typically this last group contains name truncations, name misspellings, or ﬁrst and last

names in the wrong ﬁeld.

   The matching process assigns 95 percent of applicants to the state administrative records (see

Table A3). Students who do not match either enroll in private, parochial, or out-of-state schools,

have names and birthdates too common to match, or have spelling errors too extreme to match with

conﬁdence. Receiving a charter oﬀer makes students 3.8 more likely to match to the data, as shown

in Table A3. As a result, our ﬁndings show causal estimates for the set of students who enroll in

Massachusetts Public Schools.

   We match the enrollment and demographic data to the student test scores using the unique

student identiﬁer. Students who attend out of state, private, or parochial schools do not have test

score outcomes for their years outside of Massachusetts public schools.

Sample restrictions

   We exclude applicants who receive higher or lower preference in the lottery. Late applicants,

those who apply to the wrong grade, out-of-area applicants, and siblings fall into these categories



                                                 44
and typically have no variation in oﬀer status. When students have duplicate applications within

an individual school’s lottery, we keep only one application. If students apply to charter schools in

diﬀerent years, we use only the ﬁrst application year. We restrict the sample to students with base-

line demographics data, excluding students applying from outside of Massachusetts public schools.

With these restrictions imposed, the original raw sample of applications narrows from 20,981 to

8,473.
