           This paper tests the existence and the extent of a politically
      induced business cycle in the U.S. in the post—World War II period. The
      cycle described in this paper is different from the traditional
      "political business cycle" of Nordhaus. It is based on a systematic
      difference between the monetary policies of the two parties in a model
      with labor contracts. From an explicit optimization problem we derive a
      system of equations for output and money growth. Then we successfully
      test the non-linear restriction imposed by the theory on the parameters
      of the system of equations. We cannot reject the hypothesis that money
      growth has been systematically different under the two types of
      administration and that this difference contributes to explain output
      fluctuations.

1 .   Introduction


       The most famous attempt to model the relationship between political

and economic cycles is the "political business cycle" theory formulated

by Nordhaus (1915) and McRae (1971). Three crucial assumptions underly

this approach: (i) the parties are "office motivated," in the sense

that they care only about winning the elections, as in Downs (1957);

(ii) voters are not forward—looking and have short memories, so that

they can be systematically fooled;1 and (iii) the economy is described

by an exploitable Phillips curve and the rational expectations critique

is not taken into account.

       The results derived by Nordhaus on the basis of these assumptions

are well—known. The incumbent stimulates the economy and reduces

unemployment close to election time in order to increase Its chances of

reelection. At the beginning of the new term, the inflationary effects

of the pre-electoral expansion are eliminated with a recession. The

behavior of the two parties is identical, and a cycle results in

equilibrium.

       The empirical evidence in support of the "political business cycle"

theory is rather weak for the U.S. ease; in fact this theory has been

rejected by several authors using post—Second World War U.S. data.

        Given these rejections, an increasing number of empirical studies

have moved toward a "partisan theory" of macroeconomic policy. The

original proponent of this view was Hibbs (1917). This author argued

that the Democratic Party in the U.S. and socialist parties in Europe

have been more averse to unemployment and less averse to inflation than

the Republican party in the U.S. and conservative parties in Europe.
This theory has been tested empirically by Hibbs and others, using

models based on an exploitable Phillips curve with no consideration for

the rational expectations critique.

     In this paper a model closely related to that of Alesina (1985a) is

presented and tested on post—Second World War U.S. data. The model is

based on a "partisan view" of political parties but, contrary to

literature on the subject, it accounts for rational and forward—looking

expectations. In this model only "unexpected policy" matters; the

economy would exhibit policy neutrality features in a one-party system

with no elections. However, the elections create an important source of

uncertainty about the future: the economic agents do not know which

party will win the following election. If the relevant expectations

about monetary policy and inflation have to be formed before elections,

they are based on the averages of the policies that the two parties are

expected to follow once elected. If these policies are different the

elected party creates a surprise, in the sense that its policy was not

correctly predicted, since expectations accounted for the possibility of

the election of the other party. The model, then, predicts that at the

beginning of the term in office of the more expansionary party one

should observe an output expansion above trend with high money growth.

Instead, when the less expansionary party is elected, a recession with

low money growth should be observed. There are no electoral surprises

 in the second part of any administration; henoe, the model predicts

policy neutrality. Then, in the second part of both types of

administrations real variables should exhibit the same behavior

 (ceteris paribus). However, it will be shown that even in the second
                                                                          5



part of the term in office the rate of money creation should be

different depending on the party in office.

     Starting from an explicit maximization problem, we derive the

reaction functions of the two parties and their time consistent policies

and test the nonlinear restrictions on the parameters imposed by the

theory. This procedure makes it possible to estimate directly the

parameters of the objective functions of the two parties. The sample

used covers the nine completed administrations of the post—World War II

period, from President Truman through the first term of President

Reagan.

     The data do not reject the assumption that there is a difference

between the objective functions of the two parties. The Democratic

administrations have been relatively more concerned about the output

target rather than the inflation/money creation target than the

Republican administrations. Furthermore, the empirical results do not

reject the hypothesis that systematic differences in output growth have

occurred in the first half of the administrations and not in the second,

in accordance with the theory. Thus, these results support a partisan

view of monetary policy (and in general of macropolicy) rather than a

political business cycle view. The only exception to this conclusion is

perhaps the first Nixon administration, the behavior of which is

probably better explained by a "political business cycle" view.

     The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly reviews some

of the recent empirical literature on the subject. Section 3 presents

the model and derives the empirical implications of it. Section 4

provides empirical evidence in accordance with the qualitative

implications of the model. In Section 5 the empirical estimates of the
                                                                         6



parameters of the model are presented and discussed. The concluding

section summarizes briefly the major findings and identifies several

open questions.



2. Political Business Cycle Theory and Partisan Theory



     In his seminal article, Nordhaus (1975) provides suggestive

empirical evidence in favor of the "political business cycle" hypothesis

(henceforth PBC). This evidence appears favorable for the U.S. but

rather mixed for several other countries.2 In particular, Nordhaus

writes that the first Nixon administration is a "textbook example" of

PBC because of the inflationary expansion skillfully placed close to the

elections of 1972. However, the empirical work that has followed has

led to the conclusion that the first Nixon administration was probably

the only clear case of PBC in the post-Second World War period in the

U.S. NcCallum (1978), Golden—Foterba (1980), Beck (1982 and 19810,

Abrams—Froyen—Waud (1983), Hibbs (1977 and 1985), Chapell—Keech (1986),

and Havrileski (1985) all reject directly or indirectly the PBC

hypothesis. Hibbs (1985), for example, concludes that there is "no

persuasive evidence that presidential election years, viewed together,

generally have been occasions of unusual monetary and fiscal expansions

or of short run surges in output, real incomes, and employment." The

lack of strong empirical support for the PBC has led Alt—Chrystal (1983)

to conclude that "no one could read the political business cycle

literature without being struck by the lack of supporting evidence."3

     On the other hand, Tufte (1978) finds some support for the PBC.

This author finds evidence of short run increases in transfers in
                                                                           7



electoral years. Hibbs (1985) confirms these findings, but nonetheless

they rail to provide convincing support for the general implications of

the PBC for the cycle of inflation and unemployment or output.

     The lack of empirical support for the PBC has led to an increasing

amount of work directed toward testing a "partisan theory" (henceforth

PT) of macroeconomic policy and, in particular, of monetary policy.

This view was formulated in the seminal contribution of Hibbs (1977).

This author argued that leftist parties in Europe and the Democratic

party in the U.S. have been more likely to choose a point on the

Phillips curve with higher inflation and less unemployment than

conservative parties in Europe and the Republican party in the U.S.

Hibbs claims that the lower middle class and the working class benefit

from a policy of low unemployment and relatively high inflation and

these social groups tend to support the left. This view is clearly

summarized by Paul Samuelson, who wrote in 1977: "We tend to get our

recessions during Republican administrations.... The difference between

the Democrats and the Republicans is the difference in their

constituencies. It's a class difference ...   the   Democrats constitute

the people, by and large, who are around the median incomes or below.

They are the ones whom the Republicans want to pay the price of fighting

inflation. The Democrats [are] willing to run with some inflation

the Republicans are not" (Samuelson (1977)). The events that followed

1977 hardly could have changed Samuelson's view of the subject. Very

similar views are expressed by Okun (1973), in disagreement with Stigler

(1973). Stein (1985) stresses that employment and growth were always

top priority for Democratic administrations after the Second World War,

while inflation was the first priority for Republican administrations.
                                                                          8



Kiewiet (1985) tests the hypothesis that voters in the U.S. did in fact

recognize the Democratic party as the one that tights unemployment and

the Republican party as the one that fights inflation. The author finds

that this hypothesis is supported by the empirical evidence.

     Beck (19814) finds virtually no evidence in favor of the FBC and

concludes that monetary policy has been looser under Democratic

presidents than under Republican presidents; however, he finds that the

Kennedy and first Nixon administrations do not fit this pattern. On the

basis of these two exceptions he raises a word of caution with respect

to the PT as formulated by Hibbs. Beck claims that different

administrations of the same party have behaved differently; therefore,

"administrations" more than parties are what really count.

Nevertheless, despite this important consideration the PT is not

rejected by Beck's results. Furthermore, note that only the Nixon

exception is really problematic for the PT; this administration probably

behaved in a way more consistent with the FEC than with the PT.    In the

case of the Kennedy administration the crucial fact is that the economy

was stimulated through fiscal rather than monetary expansion; this does

not imply that the FEC approach would fit the Kennedy administration

better than the PT.

     Havrileski (1985) finds that changes of administrations from

Republican to Democratic have been asssociated with upward jumps in

money growth; conversely, downward jumps are observed when a Republican

administration is elected after a Democratic one.5

     Chapell—Keech (1986) refer to results on unemployment that are

"quite similar in magnitude to those reported by Hibbs." The authors

also suggest that differences in the rates of unemployment under the
                                                                          9



administrations of the two parties tend to become smaller in the latter

part of the term. The explanation given for this phenomenon is very

similar to that suggested in this paper but the authors do not present

an explicit formalization of this problem.

     Finally, note that systematically different monetary policies

between parties should imply a systematically different behavior of the

exchange rate. Preliminary results of Hansson (1985) show that since

the beginning of the floating regime, the U.S. dollar has shown a

tendency toward appreciation during Republican administrations and

toward depreciation during the Democratic administration of President

Carter.

     Virtually all the empirical literature on policy choices on a

Phillips curve utilize models in which little attention, if any, is

devoted to incorporating rational expectations.6 The presumption of

many authors was that in models characterized by policy neutrality most

of the interest for the PT or for the PBC is lost. Secondly, almost no

attempt has been made to estimate the parameters of the policymakers'

objective functions. In fact, an explicit maximization problem of

parties' objective functions generally is not solved in order to derive

testable reduced forms.7 The model presented in the next section

incorporates both features: rational, forward—looking agents and an

explicit solution of the policymakers' maximization problem.



3. The Model



     There are two parties, denoted with obvious reference party D and

party R. The two parties assign different weights to two policy
                                                                                             10



targets: an inflation rate or money growth target and an output growth

target. The policy instrument controlled by the policymaker is the rate

of money creation. A quadratic specification for the objective

functions of the two parties is adopted so that the loss function of the

two parties can be written as (the superscripts characterize the party):




                       t [ (m - (t)]2                                                    (1)
                                                                  -
           zD                                        +
                                                            (yt       •)2]

                       qt              —   tp(t))2   +
                                                            (yt
                                                                  —                      (2)
                =
                            [.-
                                (nit                                     ]

where m =       rate   of money growth; y =          rate    of growth of GNP; a, 5, c, •,

and a are non—negative parameters; and q is the discount factor,

positive but less than one.

          The economy is described by the following equation for output

growth:



                    y(t) + Y(mt —



Equation (3) incorporates the basic properties of a Lucas supply
function in which only unexpected nominal shocks affect real variables.

In (3) we indicated with (t) the rate of growth generated by the

economy in the absence of monetary shocks; this rate is not assumed

constant. Also, m is the rational expectation of rnformed in period

t -   1    on the basis of the information available at that time. The

objective functions (1) and (2) are in the information set of the

agents.
                                                                         •11




     The objective functions could have been written with an inflation

target instead of the money growth target, and the supply equation

could have been written as a function of unexpected inflation. This

alternative specification could have been closed by a simple money

demand equation such as



       mt = Ut +                                                        (14)




where 11 is the inflation rate and a is a constant. The shortcut adopted

here keeps the algebra simpler, saves degrees of freedom, and it should

not affect qualitatively the empirical results. The choice of a target

in terms of rate of growth of output instead of a level of GNP (or of

unemployment) is imposed by theoretical and empirical considerations.

If a target in level of output were chosen, one would have needed a more

complex dynamic structure for the supply equations, involving one or

more lags, for example. This procedure would have reduced the already

scarce degrees of freedom. Furthermore, the solution of the model and

the computation of the Nash equilibrium would have been much more

problematic and difficult to test empirically. This is an open question

to be addressed in future research

     The targets on money growth and output growth are assumed identical

for the two parties: the difference in the objective functions is

constrained to be in the relative weights attributed to identical

targets. This restriction, imposed to conserve degrees of freedom,

should not affect the nature of the results. Finally, the targeted

level of money growth, 4'(t), is allowed to change over time, to reflect

velocity shifts in ('T).
                                                                                     12



     In this paper, no distinction is made between the "administration"

and the Central Bank. The implicit assumption, shared with most of the

literature on the PBC versus the PT, is that the administration has some

control over monetary policy, despite the relative independence of the

Central Bank. Weintraub (1978) argues that this is, in fact, a

realistic assumption. Stein (1985) provides several examples of cases

in which the Fed has accommodated the "desire" of the President. Grier

(1985) discusses and tests the degree of effective independence of the

Federal Reserve from both the Congress and the President. The degree cf

independence of the Federal Reserve from the administration is an

important and open question that would probably deserve a separate

treatment. Here it is assumed that the Federal Reserve cannot choose a

monetary pclicy independently from the administration.

     As long as p > (t) and b and d are positive, both parties face the

problem of dynamic inconsistency of optimal monetary policy, as pointed

out originally by Kydland—Prescott (1977). If the targeted level of

output growth, ,     is   higher than the growth rate generated by the

market, (t), the policymaker has an incentive to generate policy

surprises in order to approach the target. In fact, by substituting

(3) into (1) and (2), one gets:

It is more convenient to rewrite (5) and (6) as:

where b = 5y2, d = ay2, and k(t) =                                - 7(t))/i.           In order to identify

the problem of' dynamic inconsistency, consider, for example, party D

acting as "dictator," with no elections. If this party could make a

binding commitment it would choose to commit to the rule:



         tnt =   'pR)                                                                                     (9)


This   rule is obtained by minimizing (5), taking account of' the

rationality of expectations, i.e., mt =                              m.       However, binding

commitments are hardly available: the policymaker can always change

both its mind and the law. Then the time consistent rate of money

growth has to be found by minimizing (5) taking expectations as given.

This procedure leads to:




            =
                 a        b
                               *(t) +
                                          a        b (m +        k(t)J                                   (10)




Solving for rational expectations, one gets:

In (11) the term b/a k(t) is the inflationary bias introduced into the

economy by the absence of binding commitments. Note that this bias

would be zero if and only if either b = 0 and/or 37(t) =     (that is,

k(t) =   0).   The bias is higher the higher is the targeted rate of growth

of GNP relative to the rate of growth generated by the economy, and the

higher the weight attributed by the policymaker to the output target

relative to the money growth target. Note that, irrespective of the

level of the time-consistent rate of money growth, output growth is at

the level determined by the economy without policy intervention, because

money creation is perfectly anticipated. Furthermore, a fall in the

rate of growth of output generated by the market implies a higher rate

of inflation. In fact, a fall in 37(t) implies an increase in k(t). The

implication is that a negative trend of output growth could be

associated with an increasing trend of inflation, if the preferences of

the policymakers do not change.

     Let us now consider the interaction of the two parties. It is

assumed that elections take place every two periods and are held at the

beginning of the period. After the elections of, say, time t, the

elected party chooses its policy for period t (i.e., mt). The electoral

outcomes are uncertain. Party D is elected with probability P and

party R with probability 1 — P.     The probability P is taken as an

exogenous parameter and it is "common knowledge"; thus, it is in the

information set of agents. Alesina (1985b) shows how this assumption

could be generalized to the case of rational and forward—looking voters.

The crucial assumption is that, if voters are forward—looking (as they

should be!) and they know the objective functions of the two parties,

the policy chosen by the elected party at time t does not influence its
                                                                                         15



chances of reelection at time t +                 2.     In fact, the probability of

electing a party is a function of the expected future policies of the

two parties. If voters know the objective functions of the two parties,

they do not need the information of today's policy to form expectations

about tomorrow's policies.

      If party D is elected, it minimizes (6). The first order condition

is:




            = (1   —
                       g)p(t)          g(m +     k(t))                                 (12)




where g =   b/(b   +   a).        If party R is elected, it minimizes (7). The

corresponding first order condition is:



       m =    (1   —
                       h)p(t)      +
                                       h[m   ÷   k(t))                                 (13)




where h =   d/(c   +   d).        Expectations are given by:



            = Pm       ÷ (1   —                  if t is an election year;
       14                         P)m                                                  (111)


              =                                  if party D is elected at time t;
                   m÷1
        rn!41 =    m1                            if party B is elected at time t.



Equation (110 underscores the idea that there is uncertainty in

expectation formation only in the first period of an administration.

      The assumption that administrations last two periods implies for

the U.S. that a period is of two years. This assumption is consistent,

for example, with the existence of overlapping labor contracts of an

average length of two years (see Taylor, 1980, or Fischer, 1977). In
                                                                                                           16



more general terms, this assumption requires some form of stickiness in

the price system such that the economy does not adjust "too quickly" to

an unexpected monetary shock.8

     For the empirical estimation of the model it is assumed that both

(t) and ip(t)     are     linear trends:



       iji(t) =   ill +   at                                                                              (15)

       (t) =            —t                                                                                (16)




The assumption that the optimal rate of money growth is not constant,

but increasing over time, captures the positive time trend in this

variable. Then, given (12), (13), (i'D, (15), and (16), some algebra

establishes that:

where k          (t   — S)/i and    /y. The superscripts Dl , D2,    Hi ,   and R2

stand for the first and second periods of D and H administrations.

Equations (17) to (211) embody several empirical implications:



1     In the second half of both administrations there are no policy

      surprises; therefore, output growth is at the level determined by the

      market without policy intervention, S?       — t.
2. If g > h there is a recession in the first half of an H

      administration and an expansion above trend in the first half of a

      D administration (equations (17) and (19)). The deviations of output

      growth from trend, 7 —       t,   are bigger the more different are g and h,

      i.e., the greater the difference in the relative weights attributed

      by the two parties to the two targets.

3.    The more unexpected the electoral outcome, the bigger is the

      deviation of output growth from trend. For example, if P is high and

      party H is elected, the model predicts a deep recession. The reverse

      holds if party D is elected and P is low. The more surprising is the

      electoral result, the greater the discrepancy between the expected m

      and its actual value.

1L If g > h the time consistent rate of money growth is higher for party

      D than for party H in both periods (equations (21) to (211)).

    5. If g > h ) 0, in a D administration the rate of money creation

      deviates from trend more in the seoond period than in the first; the

      opposite holds for the administrations of party H (equations (21) to

       (211)).    If   h = 0 there are no deviations from trend in both periods

       of a Republican administration. The intuition is that in a D

       administration expectations are adjusted upward in the second period,
                                                                         18



   when there is certainty that the more expansionary party is in

   office. Therefore, the time consistent rate of money creation is

   higher: the policyrnaker is forced to accommodate these expectations,

   in order to avoid a recession. The opposite holds for the less

   expansionary party. If ii =   0,   party R is not affected by the problem

   of dynamic inconsistency of monetary policy, because this party would

   have no incentive to generate policy surprises. In this ease the

   optimal monetary policy is time—oonsistent for this party.

          The outcome characterized by equations (17) to (21) is the one—

   shot discretionary equilibrium without binding commitments. This

   equilibrium could be improved upon if reputational strategies were

   used in the repeated game. This issue is extensively explored by

   Alesina (1985a). In this paper only the one—shot Nash case is

   considered.



'I. Preliminary Evidence



     This section shows that the qualitative empirical implications of

the model are consistent with U.S. data for the post—Second World War

period.



a. GNP Growth



     Table 1 displays the average rate of growth of GNP at 1972 prices

per year for the first and second half of the administration of the two

parties. The averages are taken over the period 19'9—198'T, thus

including nine administrations.(21 Democratic and 5 Republican). In the
                                                                 19

second half of the administrations of both parties the average rate of

growth is almost identical, around   percent. The rate of growth in the

first half of Democratic administrations has been higher than in the

second half, while the rate of growth in the first half of Republican

administrations has been much lower than that of the second half.

     An even more suggestive piece of evidence is presented in Tables 2

and 3. Table 2 shows the rate of growth of GNP for each year considered

in the sample. If one assumes that after a new administration takes

office there is a lag of a few months between the implementation of the

new policies and their full effect on GNP growth, then in the second

year, more than in the first, the results of the policies of the new

administration should become apparent. The difference in the

performance of the two types of administrations in the second year is

rather striking. The same observation is reinforced by Table 3 which

compares the rate of growth of the second year with the average rate of

growth of the third and fourth years. These tables are self—

explanatory. In the second years of all the Republican administrations

there has been a negative GNP growth. The only two other years of

negative growth in the period examined have been 1971 and 1980, both

years affected by the oil shocks (Table 2). On the contrary, the second

years of Democratic administrations show sustained growth well above the

second half of the term.

     The following simple regression accounts for the preceding

observations. The average GNP growth per—year is regressed over the

four dummies for the four periods considered, first and second half of

Democratic administrations, first and second half of Republican

administrations, and a time trend. The variable Dl is a dummy assuming
                                                                               21

the value of 1 in the first half of a Democratic administration and zero

otherwise, and Hi (R2) are dummies assuming the value of 1 in the first

(second) half of a Republican administration. The result is the

following (the t—statistics are in parentheses):

          =   0.65,     D.W. = 2.39



The coefficient on the second half Republican (R2) is clearly

insignificant, confirming that the data do not show any difference

between the second halves of both administrations. The dummy for the

first half of Republican administrations has, instead, a strongly

significant negative coefficient, as predicted by the theory. The dummy

for the first half of Democrat administrations (Di) has the right sign

even though is not statistically strongly significant. There is a

negative but not statistically significant trend.

     Analogous results are obtained by the following additional test.

The quarterly GNP at constant 1972 prices has been regressed on eight

lagged values, a time trend, a dummy for the oil shocks, and two dummies

for the first half of the administrations of the two parties. In

Table 4 the results are displayed. The dummy REL assumes the value of 1

in the first eight quarters of each Republican administration and zero

otherwise. The coefficient of this variable is negative and significant

at the 1 percent level. The dummy DEL assumes the value of 1 in the

first eight quarters of each Democratic administration and zero

otherwise. The coefficient of this variable is positive as predicted by

the theory but it is not strongly significant. The variable OILSH

accounts for the effects of the two oil shocks.9

     An additional important empirical observation along these lines is

shown in Table 5. This table displays the timing of the beginning of

all the recessions in relation to the preceding elections. A few months

after the election of every Republican administration a recession

started. There have been no recessions in the first half of a

Democratic administration. A recession started the same month of the

election of Truman in November 19118, and, therefore, two months before

this administration took office. The other two recessions started in

the second half of the Carter administration, at the time of the second

oil shock and in the last year of the second administration of

Eisenhower. Leaving aside the Truman recession, of dubious origin, five

of the seven recessions fit the theory and two do not. Note that the

two that do not fit also contradict the PBC approach because they occur

in the second halves of two administrations. The crucial fact that

discriminates in favor of the approach of this paper rather than the

PBC is that none of the Democratic administrations had recessions at the

beginning of their terms, as the PEC theory predicts.



b. Money Growth



     The model implies that the time consistent rate of money creation

of Republican administrations is lower than that or Democratic

administrations, in both periods (first and second half). The following

regression allowing for a linear trend in money growth does not reject

this implication:

     The dummy variable for Republican administrations, R, assumes the

value of 1 during Republican administrations and zero otherwise. The

coefficient of this varaible is negative, as predicted by the theory,

and statistically significant at the 5 percent level. As expected there

is a highly significant trend. Beck (19810 pointed out that two

administrations do not quite fit the partisan theory of monetary policy:

the Kennedy administration and the first Nixon administration, beoause

of the tight monetary policy of the former and the 1971—1972 monetary

expansion of the latter. This is indeed the case. By introducing in

the regression (26) a dummy, KN, that assumes the value of —1 in the two

periods of the Kennedy administration and 1 in the second period of the

Nixon administration, one obtains:



          =   2.13     —     1.82    R +   2.03 KN + 0.37 t            (27)
              (3.61)       (—3.30)         (3.00)       (7.70)

          =   0.8J1,       D.W. = 2.56



The coefficient of H becomes bigger in absolute value and more

significant; the coefficient of KN is also very signifioant. Thus,

equation (27) identifies the two outliers of the regression (26).

     The second empirical implication for money growth is that one

should observe a larger deviation from trend in the second halt of a

Democratic administration than in the first. In a Republican
                                                                                 28



administration, instead, the opposite should hold if h > 0. The

following regression tests these implications:



       mt =   0.95    +   1.18 02 — 0.71      Ri —   0.36 R2 + 0.38     t       (28)
              (1.19) (1.28)         (—0.82)      (—0.110)     (6.311)


       H2 =   0.77,        D.W. =   1   .81




02 is a dummy assuming the value of 1 in the second halves of Democratic

administrations and zero otherwise. As predicted by the theory, there

is more money creation in the second part of a Democratic administration

than in the first: the coefficient of 02 is in fact positive and large,

although statistically not strongly significant. For the Republican

administration the implications of the theory are rejected: the

relative magnitude of the two coefficients is opposite from what the

theory predicts and the two coefficients are not significant. The

reason for this imperfect fit is, again, to be attributed to the Kennedy

and first Nixon administrations. In fact, by introducing the dummy KN

into the preceding regression we obtain:



       mt = 1.58 + 1.19 02 — 1.20 Ri — 1.23 R2 + 2.0'l KN + 0.37            t   (29)
           (2.38) (1.66)   (—1.71)   (—1.611)   (3.04)     (7.77)

       H2      0.81,       D.W. = 2.117



The fit of the regression greatly improves. There is virtually no

difference between the coefficients of Ri and H2. This result is

consistent with the prediction of the model for the case of h = 0 (see

equations (17) to (211)). Again, there is more money creation, on
                                                                           29


average, in the second half of Democratic administrations than in the

first.

     Given that the model attributes so much emphasis to unexpected

monetary shocks, the unexpected money variable, 0MB, constructed by

Barro (1978) has been analyzed. This variable is obtained by Barro from

the residual of a regression of the rate of money growth, Ml   ,   on several

lagged variables assumed to be in the relevant information set of the

economic agents.10 Biannual averages of this variable (DMR) are

reported in Table 6 (this variable is not available after 1976).

Eleven observations have the expected sign, negative for Republican and

positive for Democratic administrations. Only three observations do not

fit. According to the following simple regression we can reject the

hypothesis of no significant difference in the "money surprises" under

the two types of administration:



         DMRt = O.13      —     1.00 R                                   (30)
                 (1J11)       (—2.'i7)

            =   0.75,     D.W. =     2.16



Table 5 does not suggest that "surprises" have occurred only in the

first half of the term in office. However, given the different approach

followed by Barro in modeling expectations, the data do not have to

conform necessarily to this pattern.



5. Estimation of the Model



     The empirical evidence in the preceding section suggests that the

model is broadly in accordance with the data. In fact, the cross—

equation restrictions imposed by the model cannot be rejected. The

system of equations (114) to (21) has been estamated using LSQ and

testing the nonlinear restrictions on the parameters imposed by the

theory. The only modification from equations (17) to (214) is given by

the introduction of a dummy variable in the output growth equation to

account for the two oil shocks.11

     For reasons that will become immediately clear, two results of the

estimation are presented. Table 7 reports the results obtained by

estimating all the parameters of the model except k, fixed at the value

of 1 312 The log likelihood test does not reject the restrictions

imposed by the theory at the 5 percent confidence level.

     The estimated values of the parameters are consistent with the

theory. In particular, h =      312/(c   +   d) is insignificantly different
from zero, while g =   £12/(a   +   b) is positive and significant (0.51).

Note that the regressions (28) and (29) were also consistent with the

assumption of h = 0 in the cost function of party H.          The relative

magnitude of g and h does not reject the hypothesis that the Democratic

administrations have attributed more weight to the output target than

the Republican administrations, that instead have been concerned mainly

(or only, strictly speaking) with the money growth target. This is the

crucial result that discriminates the approach followed in this paper

from the PBC. The latter approach would predict that one should not

observe any difference between the behavior of the two administrations.

     The estimated value of I (the effect of unanticipated money on

output growth) is rather high (3.08). This value is, however, not

inconsistent with the findings of Barro (1978). His results cannot be

directly compared with the results of this paper because of the

different specification of the output equation, but the two estimates

have the same order of magnitude.13 The estimated values of I and ,

respectively    3.08 and 11.26, and the value of k, fixed at 1.3, imply that

the targeted level of GNP growth (q) is about 8 peroent. This value is

reasonable given that it is a "bliss point" in the objective functions

of the two parties. The trend in output growth is negative but

insignificant, implying that the "natural" rate of GNP growth is around

11 percent per year.

     The estimated value of P, the probability of electing a Democratic

administration, is high, 0.71, implying that Republican administrations

have always been elected with a certain amount of "surprise." The value

of this parameter is due to the fact that the deviation from trend of

output growth at the beginning of Republican administrations has been on

average bigger (in absolute value) than the same deviations at the

beginning of Democratic administrations. This observation was already

apparent from the result of the simple regressions (25) and (26) and

from Table 14    In the simple model used this asymmetry can only be

captured by a high F, implying, oeteris paribus, more surprise when a

Republican president is elected, and, therefore, stronger effects on

output of monetary policy. However, the same phenomenon could be

explained by an asymmetric effect of negative versus positive monetary

shocks due, for example, to different degrees of price flexibility

upward or downward. The issue of the relation between poll predictions

about electoral outcomes and effects of policies needs further

investigation. Needless to say, the probability P is, in general,

different in every election.

    The remaining parameters have the expected sign and order of

magnitude. In particular, there is a positive and significant trend in
                                                                        the oil shocks have
the money growth (a is positive and significant);

affected negatively output growth in a significant way (the parameter a

is referred to the dummy variable for the oil shocks).

     Let us now consider the results obtained by estimating all the

parameters, including k. The results are reported in Table 8. The most

important difference in the two sets of results (Tables 7 and 8) is in

the value of I that is much higher and, probably, nrealistica1ly high

in the new estimations (4.97). Instead, the estimated value of k is

much lower than 1.3, the value to which it was fixed in the preceding

estimation. Furthermore, the t—statistics for I and k are very low; on

the contrary, I was highly significant where k was exogenously fixed

 (Table 7). Note, also, that the value of the log likelihood function is

virtually identical in the two regressions, implying that the log

 likelihood test is also accepted at the 5 percent level.                             This result is

 probably an indication of weak identification for the parameters I and

 k. Consider, in fact, the output growth equations, here reproduced for

In these equations the parameter k always enters multiplied by Y. The

parameter I also appears multiplied by ,   but   is insignificantly

different from zero. Therefore, the identification of I and k is left

exclusively to the money growth equation. Due to the lack of degrees of

freedom, this identification is probably weak.



6. Summary and Extensions



     This paper has provided empirical support to the "partisan view" of

monetary policy. First of all, we could reject the hypothesis that

macroeconomic outcomes have been the same under Democratic and

Republication administrations in the post-Second World War period in the

U.S. We also could not reject the hypothesis that deviation of output

growth from trend occurred mostly in the first halves of the term, as

predicted by the theory; the rate of growth of money, instead, has been

systematically different for the entire term, also as predicted by the

theory. The conclusions that have been inferred from these results are

essentially two. In the first place, Democratic administrations seemed

relatively more concerned with an output target than with a money

growth/inflation target. Second, the real effects of new policies are

stronger in the first halves of new administrations. If a more

expansionary administration is elected, it can take advantage of a short

run Phillips curve. However, once the economy has fully adjusted to the

new regime, the same expansionary policy has little if any effect on

real variables, i.e., the Phillips curve is more (or completely)

vertical. Conversely, there are short run output losses when an

administration more concerned with inflation is elected. These results,
                                                                         37

then,    reject Nordhaus' formulation of the "political business cycle" and

support a partisan view of maoropolicy.

        The analysis of this paper could be extended in several directions.

First, the dynamic structure of the model could be enriched, although

problems of degrees of freedom would arise. Second, attention could be

devoted to the issue of predictability of electoral results. The model

identifies a relation between degree or "surprise" in electoral results

and real effects of monetary policy. This issue could be addressed

directly by using data on prediction polls. Third, systematic

difference in policies of the two parties could be analyzed by looking

at different variables. For example, the stock market and the financial

markets may react to electoral results. Fourth, different countries

could be analyzed using the framework of this paper. Some complications

would arise for parliamentary systems in which the timing of elections

is an endogenous variable.

1. Nordhaus (1975) and McRae (1977) assume irrational voting behavior
   in the sense that voters can be systematically fooled by the
   incumbent party. Rogoff—Sibert (1985) have obtained some results in
   the same spirit as those of Nordhaus—Mcflae in a model with rational
   but imperfectly informed voters. This point is also addressed by
   Cukierman—Metzler (1985).

2. The empirical evidence presented by Nordhaus is rather weak for
   Australia, Canada, the United Kingdon, Sweden, France, and Japan.
   More favorable observations for the PBC were found in Germany and
   New Zealand, besides the U.S.

3.   The same passage is quoted by Beck (198L0.

14 Beck (1982) also questions the magnitude of J-Jibbs' (1977) results;
   nevertheless, the two authors agree on the qualitative features of
   them.

5. Havrileski (1983) considers these effects on M2.

6. Important exceptions are McCallum (1978) and Havrileski (1985).

7. A notable exception is Abrams—Froyen—Waud (1983). These authors,
   however, address issues related to budget deficits and their
   response to economic conditions.

8. Barro (1978) finds that lagged values of unexpected monetary shocks
   affect the current level of output.

9. This variable assumes the value of 1 in 197'—1975, and in 1980, zero
   otherwise. The results of this regression are not sensitive to
   alternative specifications of the dummy accounting for the oil
   shocks.

10. These variables are lagged money growth, lagged unemployment, and a
    measure of federal budget deficit (Barro, 1978, equation (1),
     p. 551).

11. This variable takes the values of 1 in 1973-197', 1975—1976, and
    1979—1980, zero otherwise.

12. The estimates are non—sensitive to small variations of this value.

13. Barro (1978) presents the following regression:

      lg    =   2.95 ÷ 1.01 DMRt + 1.21 DMRt_1 + O.l'1    DMRt...2 +   0.26     DMRt_3
