                                        ABSTRACT

This paper uses the Euler equation and novel data from Berea College students on their
consumption expenditures during and after college, desired borrowing amounts, beliefs about
post-college earnings, and elicited risk-aversion and time preference parameters to determine
their consumption value of college attendance. Estimates suggest an average annual consumption
value of college as high as $11,600, with considerable heterogeneity across students.
Incorporating these benefits raises the average expected return to college by as much as 14%.

1         Introduction
A growing number of studies estimate that factors beyond traditionally measured costs
(tuition and foregone earnings) and earnings benefits of education play an important role
in college attendance and field-of-study decisions. These factors are often referred to as
"psychic", "utility", or "consumption" costs/benefits of schooling, yet there is little, if
any, direct evidence on their nature or values. Instead, these factors are generally unob-
served with their values typically inferred from choices that deviate from what is expected
based on measured costs and returns (e.g., someone who attends college despite negative
predicted net returns is estimated to have a positive "psychic/utility/consumption" value
of college). Commonly observed differences in behavior among individuals with the same
measured costs and returns are further taken to imply considerable heterogeneity in these
factors.1
        By measuring the amenities provided by institutions, Jacob, et al. (2018) provide
some of the most direct evidence suggesting a non-trivial consumption value of college
attendance. They show that, on average, colleges spend about half as much on amenities
as on academics and that these amenities influence students' decisions about which college
to attend. However, as they note, these amenities may influence choices, in part, by
improving the earnings prospects of students.2 Additionally, they may not capture all of
the consumption-related benefits associated with attending college.
        This paper represents the first attempt to quantify the full consumption benefits
of college that are directly substitutable with other goods, services, and activities that
students would otherwise purchase. For example, students have easy access to athletic
and entertainment facilities on campus. They may also have many free or inexpensive
leisure and entertainment opportunities available to them that are unavailable (or much
less attractive) to non-students. Students may benefit greatly from these opportunities,
allowing them to achieve high levels of effective consumption with much lower levels of
actual expenditures. We refer to the "consumption value" of college as the difference
between effective consumption and measured consumption expenditures.
        It is important to quantify these consumption benefits of college for at least two rea-
sons. First, the "consumption value" of college may be an important factor determining
    1
     Lazear (1977) provides an early analysis of the consumption vs. investment value of education.
See, e.g., Keane and Wolpin (1997), Cunha, et al. (2005), Heckman, et al. (2006), and Abbott, et al.
(forthcoming) for estimates of the importance of "psychic/utility/consumption" factors in explaining
schooling attendance decisions. See, e.g., Arcidiacono (2004), Rask (2010), Zafar (2013), Gemici and
Wiswall (2014), and Wiswall and Zafar (2015) for evidence on the importance of tastes in college major
decisions.
   2
     Several expenditure categories in their amenity measure could improve post-schooling earnings,
including spending on student activities, student organizations, student health services, cultural events,
etc.


                                                    2
the total return to college; a failure to incorporate it could lead to an under-valuation
of post-secondary education. Second, a large consumption value of college would lead
to low levels of observed consumption expenditures during school, which could easily
be misinterpreted as evidence of binding credit constraints.3 In this case, policymak-
ers might overstate the amounts students need to borrow in order to smooth (effective)
consumption during and after college.
       We take an innovative approach made possible by unique data from the Berea Panel
Study (BPS), which follows students from Berea College, a four-year liberal arts college
in central Kentucky. We exploit BPS data to identify individual-specific consumption
values of college based on the Euler equation for consumption during and after college.
Under perfect credit markets, a comparison of observed consumption expenditures during
college to the amount that students (expect to) spend on consumption after college would
be directly informative about the consumption value of college. Intuitively, if individuals
desire smooth consumption profiles, a large jump in consumption expenditures upon
leaving college indicates a sizable consumption value of college.
       Two important challenges arise due to credit market frictions. First, limited bor-
rowing opportunities during school could lead to a jump in consumption spending after
college. We address this concern using a BPS survey question that identifies whether
individuals are currently credit constrained, and if so, how much they would choose to
borrow if the constraint were eliminated. This allows us to identify desired consumption
expenditures (during college) for everyone in our sample, regardless of whether they are
borrowing constrained.
       Second, when students face uninsurable post-college earnings risk, a jump in consump-
tion spending after college could also reflect the resolution of that risk and a reduction
in precautionary savings motives. To address this concern, it is necessary to characterize
the full distribution of beliefs about post-college consumption. We take two different
approaches for calculating this distribution. Both approaches take advantage of survey
questions in the BPS that elicit beliefs during college about the distribution of future
earnings, but they differ in the way that the distribution of post-college consumption
beliefs are determined.
       The BPS data also enable us to consider other factors that could lead to a jump
in consumption upon college graduation. First, debt-averse students may not wish to
borrow more despite low levels of in-school consumption. We sidestep this concern by
   3
    Many studies exploit measures of assets during and/or after school to identify borrowing limits and
the role of borrowing constraints (e.g., Keane and Wolpin 2001, Johnson 2013). This implicitly assumes
that consumption expenditures reflect total effective consumption, thereby ignoring the "consumption"
benefits of college we study.



                                                  3
focusing on the majority of students that show no indication of debt-aversion when asked
why they would not prefer to borrow more. Second, Aguiar and Hurst (2005, 2007)
show that older individuals can maintain high levels of effective consumption despite
reduced expenditure levels by devoting more time to home production and shopping.
The notion that students may have more time available for `home production' during
school is unlikely to explain important changes in consumption upon graduation for our
sample, since the combined amount of time Berea students spent studying and working is
similar to the amount of time spent working after school (Stinebrickner and Stinebrickner
2003, 2008a; Stinebrickner et al. 2019). Third, one might worry that there are fewer
consumption opportunities in Berea than wherever graduates move after college; however,
this seems unlikely since Berea's population density is similar to that of the places its
students lived two years after graduation.4 Fourth, graduating students may purchase a
new car or other durables, leading to artificially high levels of measured consumption after
school. As discussed below, we conclude that this is not an important factor by examining
consumption patterns in the first two years after college. Fifth, desired consumption
levels might jump for students that get married and/or have children. Our main analysis
focuses on the 75% of students who remain single and childless during and immediately
after college; however, results for the full sample that account for change in marital status
are quite similar.
        Overall, our results suggest that a substantial consumption value of college exists
among Berea students, with the average annual value ranging from $9,900 to $11,600,
depending on the approach used to estimate beliefs about the distribution of post-school
consumption. These sizeable benefits are consistent with other survey responses in which
roughly 80% of Berea freshman indicate that they enjoy college more than they think they
would enjoy not being in college. Incorporating these additional consumption benefits
of college increases average rates of return to college by 12-14%. We also document
considerable heterogeneity in the consumption value across students.


2         Measuring the Consumption Value of College
Our approach to measuring the consumption value of college is based on the Euler equa-
tion that equates the marginal utility of consumption during the first year of college
with the discounted expected marginal utility of consumption during the first year after
leaving school G years later. Letting U (Ct ) (with U (·) > 0, U (·) < 0) reflect utility
    4
    The fact that roughly 80% of students report that they enjoy their life in school more than if they
were not enrolled further suggests that low levels of in-school consumption are not driven by a lack of
consumption opportunities. We explore differential prices for goods/services during and after school in
Section 4.5.


                                                  4
from "effective consumption" Ct each period,  > 0 the rate of time preference, and
r > 0 the market interest rate, the relevant Euler equation (in the absence of borrowing
constraints) is
                                U (C1 ) = [ (1 + r)]G E [U (CG+1 )],                                  (1)

where t = 1 reflects the first year of college.
       While enrolled in college, we assume that "effective consumption" Ct reflects the sum
of consumption expenditures Ctex and any additional "consumption value of college", V :

                                Ct = Ctex + V      for all t = 1, ..., G.                             (2)

This assumes that the consumption value V enters in a "lump sum" fashion (e.g. free
access to athletic facilities, leisure, and entertainment opportunities). In Section 4.5, we
examine whether college also provides goods/services at a discounted price. Once individ-
uals leave school, we assume that effective consumption is fully reflected in expenditures
(i.e., Ct = Ctex for all t  G + 1).5
       A natural approach for estimating V exploits the Euler equation (1), which implies

                           V = U -1 [ (1 + r)]G E [U (CG+1 )] - C1
                                                                 ex
                                                                    .                                 (3)

This approach presents two distinct challenges. The first challenge is one of data avail-
ability: equation (3) requires information about preferences ( and U (·)), consumption
                              ex
expenditures during college (C1  ), and the distribution describing beliefs (at the begin-
ning of college) about post-college consumption. We address this challenge through a
combination of rich data and economic modeling.
       The second challenge is conceptual: Equations (1) and (3) only hold in the absence
of binding borrowing constraints. When some students are borrowing constrained, as
suggested by much of the literature (Lochner and Monge-Naranjo, 2012), it is impossible
to distinguish between binding constraints and a positive consumption value of college
using only information on preferences and consumption behavior. We address this critical
problem using a novel survey question that identifies whether students are borrowing
constrained during college and the amount that constrained students would like to borrow
if they could.6
    Let ^  0 reflect the amount of additional resources a student would like to borrow
during college, to be repaid after leaving college. Notice ^ > 0 for those that are con-
strained, while ^ = 0 for those that are not. Letting C
                                                      ^G+1 reflect "optimal" post-college
   5
     Below, we address the possibility that youth may live with family after leaving school, in which case
reported consumption expenditures may understate actual consumption.

     The introduction discusses other factors related to the Euler equation and our approach (e.g., debt
aversion, home production, durable goods, etc.)

consumption in the hypothetical borrowing scenario, equation (3) can be modified to
account for constrained students wishing to borrow ^:

                                                                    ^

                        V = U -1 [ (1 + r)]G E [U (C                                                  (4)
                                                              1


When students are unconstrained, ^ = 0 and C
                                           ^G+1 = CG+1 , so equation (4) reduces to
equation (3).
                                     ex
       Our data contain measures of C1  and ^. We assume r is known and that preferences
have the standard CRRA form,
                                                        C 1-
                                            U (C ) =         .
                                                        1-
A battery of survey questions about risk and intertemporal tradeoffs are used to obtain
estimates of relative risk aversion  and time preference  for each respondent.
    Finally, we need to determine the expected marginal utility of post-college consump-
tion E [U (C^G+1 )], which requires knowledge of the distribution describing beliefs about
^G+1 . Although the BPS does not directly elicit this distribution, it does contain mea-
C
sures of student debt and beliefs about post-college earnings that enable us to characterize
the distribution and E [U (C^G+1 )].7 With this in mind, write post-college consumption,
CG+1 = C~ (DG+1 , WG+1 ), as a function of observed post-college debt DG+1 and earn-
ings WG+1 .8 Given the modest values for   ^ in our sample, we assume that students'
post-school earnings would be unaffected by borrowing this additional amount. As such,
additional (hypothetical) debt ^ should affect future consumption in the same way as
does existing debt. Given CRRA preferences, this implies that

                                                                       -     -1/
            V=               G
                   [ (1 + r)] E C                 ^ WG+1
                                ~ DG+1 + (1 + r)G ,                                   ex
                                                                                   - C1    ^
                                                                                         - .          (5)

Assuming that DG+1 is fully anticipated when students enter college, expectations need
only be taken over post-college earnings possibilities.9 We use our subjective belief mea-
sures, elicited during students' first year of college, for this expectation.
       We adopt two different approaches to identify the distribution describing beliefs about
post-college consumption and, therefore, V . First, we take a data-driven approach un-
der the assumption that all students have the same post-college consumption function
   7
     If unconstrained students all faced the same distribution of post-college consumption and held ra-
tional expectations about future consumption, then we could estimate E [U (C    ^G+1 )] for those students
using their observed post-college consumption. As shown below, first-year students are considerably
optimistic about their future earnings, raising serious concerns about this approach.
   8
     This consumption function may also (implicitly) depend on credit market frictions, preferences, and
beliefs about future earnings (conditional on DG+1 and WG+1 ), all of which could vary across individuals.
   9
     Known DG+1 is consistent with the fact that over 80% of end-of-college debt comes from college
loans, which are likely anticipated early in college.

C                                                   ~ (DG+1 , WG+1 ) using survey data on
CG+1 , DG+1 , and WG+1 . Second, we take a model-based approach in which the consump-
tion function is obtained as the solution to a standard lifecycle consumption allocation
problem under uncertainty and limited borrowing opportunities.11 Sections 4.1 and 4.2
describe these approaches.


3        Data and Descriptive Statistics
3.1       Berea College and the Berea Panel Study (BPS)
Conducted by Todd Stinebrickner and Ralph Stinebrickner, the BPS is a longitudinal
survey that followed two cohorts of students at Berea College from the time they entered
college, in 2000 and 2001, until 2014.
       Berea is a liberal arts college in central Kentucky that focuses on providing educational
opportunities to students from relatively low-income backgrounds, offering full-tuition
scholarships to all students. Despite these unique features, Berea offers a standard lib-
eral arts curriculum, and its students are similar in academic quality to those at nearby
University of Kentucky (Stinebrickner and Stinebrickner, 2008b). Furthermore, the Berea
campus is similar to that of other quality liberal arts colleges. For example, consistent
with recent trends, Berea constructed a 10.5 million dollar recreational/wellness center
and entirely revamped its dining facilities within the last two decades. Berea College's
per student expenditures on student amenities in 2004 were at roughly the 65th per-
centile among U.S. private bachelor's degree-granting institutions.12 With a population
of approximately 10,000, the city of Berea has a similar population density as the places
students live two years after graduation (specifically, 40th percentile based on zip code).

3.2       Borrowing, Consumption, and Earnings
Figure 1 shows the question used to characterize a student's preferred additional bor-
rowing level ^. We set ^ = 0 for students who would not accept a loan and set ^ to the
desired amount reported in Q.1.A for those who would.13
       Also important for our analysis are BPS questions eliciting students' beliefs about the
distribution of future period t earnings, FtW , asked during the first year of college. (These
  10
     This would be the case if individuals faced identical credit markets and were homogeneous in their
preferences and beliefs about future earnings conditional on period G + 1 earnings and debt. This
approach also assumes that individuals know this post-college consumption function when they attend
college.

     Student amenities as defined in Jacob, et al. (2018).
  13
     Given that, on average, students believe the probability of graduating is greater than 80%, we assume
that leaving Berea is equivalent to graduating, setting G = 4 years.

       The BPS also elicits student expenditures during the first year of college, excluding
                                                       oth 14
room and board charges and textbooks, which we denote C1  . The value of room and

    This is obtained from a question designed to elicit all expenditures by the student and family on the
student's consumption with an explicit follow-up question on parental contributions.

board for the academic year at Berea is $4,760 (in 2001 dollars).15 We further assume
that the quality of food and housing that students receive in-kind from parents during
the three-month summer break is similar to the quality of accommodations received at
Berea during the school year. We, therefore, inflate Berea's room and board costs by the
factor 12/9 to obtain a total annual value for food and housing of C f h = $6,350. Total
                                                   ex    oth
expenditures during the first year of college are C1  = C1   + C f h.
    Our analysis is based on students from the 2001 cohort who answered question Q.1, as
well as questions eliciting beliefs about future earnings (FtW ) and about their consumption
                              oth
expenditures during college (C1   ). Because the Euler equation underlying our approach
abstracts from debt-aversion, our main sample (177 students) drops all students who
indicate that they would reject the loan for a reason other than consumption smoothing
(answer 1 in Q.1.B). Conclusions about V are very similar when including these students
(Appendix C).
    The BPS also collects information on consumption CG+1 and earnings WG+1 during
the first year after college. One concern is that reported post-college consumption ex-
penditures understate actual post-college consumption when individuals receive transfers
in-kind from parents or other family members, especially for those who live with family
after graduation (Kaplan, 2012). To address this, we assume that the "actual" amount
of post-college consumption CG+1 is the greater of reported consumption expenditures
and the relevant poverty level, $8,590.16
    Another concern is that students may spend a lot on durable goods (e.g. a new
car) during their first year out of college. In Appendix C, we identify two expenditure
categories that may contain durable goods purchases and compare expenditures within
these categories over the first two years after college. These patterns suggest very modest
spending on durables and an effort to remove them has little impact on our estimates of
V . Our main analysis includes all expenditures.
    Table 1 summarizes BPS data on college consumption, desired borrowing, and beliefs
about post-college earnings elicited during the first year of college.17 On average, stu-
dents at Berea College spend only $910/year on consumption, excluding room and board
charges and textbooks. Based on Question Q.1, two-thirds report that they would not
like to borrow more (^ = 0), while the rest report average desired borrowing ^ of $890.
   15
      This is similar to that of other comparable four-year colleges in the Appalachian region of Kentucky
($5,800).
   16
      47 students in our sample report post-college consumption expenditures less than the poverty level.
In Appendix C, we consider an alternative in which a student's "actual" annual post-college consumption
from housing and groceries is no less than the annual cost of food and housing during college. This yields
a slightly larger V .

Combining these figures with C f h , average preferred annual consumption expenditure
during college (C ex + ^) is $7, 560. The median of individual-specific subjective earnings

distributions for the first year out of school (Q2
                                                 G+1 ) has a sample average of $43,620,

while the reported minimum value (W G+1 ) has a sample average of $28,890. There is
considerable sample variation in both.
       Table 1 also describes our data on post-college consumption and realized earnings. To
avoid issues with intra-family consumption allocations, we limit our analysis of CG+1 and
WG+1 to the 151 BPS respondents who were single and childless at the time of their post-
college survey.18 During the first year after college, average consumption expenditure
for these individuals was $13,300 while actual earnings averaged $21,540. The latter
is substantially less than what they had anticipated during their first year of college.
This optimism among new students is consistent with other recent evidence from studies
using expectations data.19 The evolution of expectations in the BPS suggests that this
initial optimism fades as students progress through college and systematically revise
their beliefs about post-college earnings downward. By the end of college, the sample
average of Q2
            G+1 falls to roughly $27,000, much closer to, though still higher than, average

actual post-college earnings. The fact that post-college consumption and earnings (both
anticipated and realized) are all substantially greater than preferred consumption during
school strongly indicates a non-trivial consumption value of college.
       Finally, the BPS contains information about student debt at the end of college, DG+1 ,
for 195 sample respondents.20 Among these students, average accumulated debt was
$6,120 with a standard deviation of $7,240. We impute missing values of post-college
  18
     These measures are not available for everyone in our main sample but are available for others who
are not. Below, we discuss additional sampling frames when using these measures.
  19
     Stinebrickner and Stinebrickner (2012) find that students at Berea also overestimated their grade
performance at the time of college entrance. Combining survey and administrative data from Chile,
Hastings et al. (2016) document that, on average, college applicants substantially overestimate earnings
of college graduates.
  20
     Some of these students are not in our main sample, because they did not answer questions about
earnings expectations during their freshman year.

3.3       Risk Aversion and Time Preference
We utilize an approach based on Barsky et al. (1997) to estimate students' rate of time
preference,  , and degree of risk aversion, . This approach exploits survey questions
asking students about preferred consumption growth (determining  ) and to rank job
offers differing in expected income and risk (determining ). The estimated sample
averages for  and  are 1.02 and 2.54, respectively. Figure 2 depicts the (kernel density-
smoothed) joint distribution for  and , revealing considerable variation in  but little
heterogeneity in  . See Appendix A for details. Our main analysis uses these elicited
values in calculating V ; however, Appendix C shows that results are similar for other
reasonable parameterizations (e.g.  = 0.95,  = 2).

4        Results
This section provides estimated distributions of V based on equation (5), assuming the
interest rate is r = 5%. We use two distinct approaches to obtain the post-college
consumption function.

4.1       Data-Driven Approach
Our first approach relies on the assumption that all students have the same post-college
consumption function C  ~ (DG+1 , WG+1 ). In principle, one could non-parametrically es-
timate this function with cross-sectional data on CG+1 , DG+1 , and WG+1 . Due to our
relatively small sample size, we estimate a second order polynomial in DG+1 and WG+1
under the constraints that CG+1 is decreasing in DG+1 and increasing in WG+1 at all data
                                                   ~ (·, ·) with respect to WG+1 and DG+1
points.22 The average derivatives of the estimated C
are 0.283 and -0.078, respectively.
       The assumption that all students have the same consumption function is consistent
with homogeneity in preferences and beliefs about lifecycle earnings, interest rates, and
borrowing opportunities conditional on student debt and earnings during the first year
following college. Hence, we set  and  to their respective sample averages. In applying
equation (5), individual heterogeneity in computed values of V comes only from differ-
ences in beliefs F W , preferred consumption in college C ex + ^, and preferred student
                     G+1                                               1

debt DG+1 + (1 + r)G ^.
       The "+" curve in Figure 3 shows the cdf for V estimated using this Data-Driven (DD)
Approach. The average consumption value across the students in our sample is $11,570.
Dispersion of V is moderate with an interquartile range of $7,070 ($6,320 to $13,390).23

4.2       Model-Based Approach
Our Model-Based (MB) Approach assumes that each student has her own post-college
consumption function determined as the solution to a standard lifecycle consumption
allocation problem (with uncertainty and borrowing constraints) from period G + 1 to
  22
     Estimation of the post-college consumption function is based on 151 respondents with data on WG+1
and CG+1 who were single and childless at the time of the survey (DG+1 is imputed for 33 observations
using the sample average debt level). We then calculate the expected marginal utility of post-college
consumption in equation (5) using the estimated consumption function, preferred post-college debt, and
                                                                           W
the distribution of beliefs about post-college earnings (integrating over FG +1 ) to calculate V for all 177
students in our main sample. Appendix C explores including those who are married when estimating
the consumption function, assuming that individual earnings and consumption are each half of family
earnings and consumption. This produces very similar estimated distributions of V .
  23
     Appendix C discusses the fact that the empirical support for post-college earnings does not cover
the top end of the support for students' subjective earnings beliefs. Conservative assumptions used to
extrapolate consumption at these high earnings levels produce similar average V .

taking initial post-college debt and earnings (DG+1 , WG+1 ) as given and assuming all
debts must be repaid eventually D ¯ T +1 = 0. The function  (·) determines after-tax earn-
ings based on federal and Kentucky tax code in 2001 (see Appendix D). This maximiza-
tion problem requires information on preferences (,  ), as well as the perceived earnings
process and borrowing limits for all post-college periods. We use elicited individual-
specific preferences as discussed in Section 3.3.
    We assume that earnings follow a shifted log-normal distribution with dynamics de-
termined by an autoregressive process: log(Wt - W t ) = µt + t t , where           G+1    N (0, 1),
                                                                2
t   =   t-1   + t for t = G + 2, ..., T , and t  N (0, 1 -  ) for all t. Section 3.2 describes
how we obtain parameters (W t , µt , t ) for the post-college year G + 1, age 28, and age
38 from students' responses to the income beliefs question using equation (6). Following
Stinebrickner and Stinebrickner (2014), we assume that W t , µt , and t grow linearly
between the observed ages and remain constant after age 38 (until retirement at age 65).

                                                   13
       The only remaining parameter to be determined is the degree of autocorrelation in
earnings shocks, . Using the autocovariance structure for annual earnings from the
unbalanced panel of about 10 years post-graduation in the BPS, we estimate  = 0.62
via Minimum Distance estimation (see Appendix B). We assume that subjective beliefs
about  match the "actual" autocorrelation in realized earnings for the post-college
period; however, results are similar for other values of  (Appendix C).
       Finally, we assume that students cannot take on any new debt after college; however,
they can continue to roll over some of their student debt. Specifically, we assume that
they must repay at least their minimum (perceived) earnings each year, imposing the
following borrowing limit:24
                                                                t
              ¯ t+1 = max 0, (1 + r)t-(G+1) DG+1 -
              D                                                        (1 + r)t+1-t  (W t ) .            (8)
                                                              t =G+1

Only 9% of students in our sample ever face non-zero borrowing limits. This only arises
during the first several years after college, and the limits are quite modest.
       With parameters for the earnings process estimated and borrowing limits specified,
we numerically solve for the post-college consumption function and calculate V for each
student. The solid line in Figure 3 shows the cdf for V computed using this MB Ap-
proach. The average consumption value is $9,900, similar to that obtained using the
DD Approach; however, the interquartile range is notably larger here, $16,130 ($960 to
$17,090). This greater heterogeneity in V is partly explained by the incorporation of
heterogeneity in  and  . It is also consistent with the fact that students with low expec-
tations about earnings immediately after school also tend to have low expectations about
subsequent earnings. This implies less consumption conditional on post-college debt and
earnings due to precautionary motives, which is not captured by a homogeneous con-
sumption function that only depends on (DG+1 , WG+1 ).

4.3       Variation in Consumption Values
Our two approaches yield considerable heterogeneity in college consumption values. We
briefly explore the predictability of this heterogeneity by regressing V DD (V from DD
approach), V MB (V from MB approach), C ex , C ex +  ^, C ex + ^ + V DD , and C ex + ^ + V MB
                                                    1     1            1                     1

on gender, race, final high school grade point average (GPA), and total family income
(in the first year of college).25
  24
     This constraint is very tight, yielding conservative estimates for V , but it ensures that borrowers can
always cover their required payments. Assuming students face (more relaxed) Aiyagari (1994) `natural'
borrowing limits (i.e. borrowing can never exceed the perceived minimum discounted present value of
future income) implies much larger consumption values of college. See Appendix C.
  25
     Similar regressions for time and risk preferences ( and ) reveal that little of the variation in these
preferences can be explained by these characteristics.

                                                     14
   As shown in the first row of Table 2, the only statistically significant predictor of
 ex
C1  is race. Black students spent roughly $400 less per year during college. However,
the second row of Table 2 shows that black Berea students did not have statistically
lower total desired consumption (C ex + ^) than non-black students, suggesting that black
                                     1

students may be more credit constrained.
   Turning to results for the consumption value of college, we again find some differences
by race. The consumption value of college is estimated to be about $4,000 higher for black
students than non-black students, which could explain why Stinebrickner and Stinebrick-
ner (2014) find that black Berea students are more likely to remain in college conditional
on grade performance. Finally, the DD Approach suggests that the consumption value
of college is $3,200 higher for males than females. Altogether, the characteristics we con-
sider explain less than 5% of the variation in all of the consumption measures reported
in Table 2.

              size is 177.



4.4    Consumption Value and the Expected Return to College
One concrete way to view the quantitative importance of the consumption value V is
to consider its effect on the return to college. To do this, we take advantage of BPS
survey questions eliciting students' subjective beliefs about future income in both college
and non-college scenarios for the 170 students (out of 177) with valid responses to these
questions.


                                             15
       The average expected lifetime income of the college and non-college options (evaluated
at age 18) are $852,000 and $544,000, respectively. Ignoring the college consumption
value (as is typical of the literature), these figures imply a monetary return to college
of 56.6 percent. Taking into account four years of the average consumption value of
college raises the total return to college by 13.8% (7.8 percentage points) based on the
DD Approach and 12.0% (6.8 percentage points) based on the MB Approach.26 Indeed,
these numbers likely understate the full importance of the consumption value, since the
marginal utility of consumption during college generally exceeds the discounted expected
marginal utility after graduation for constrained students. This understatement is likely
to be quite modest, however, given that only one-third of Berea students wanted to
borrow more and the amounts they wanted to borrower were small.

4.5       Lump-Sum Consumption Value and Price Discounts
Our focus on the lump-sum consumption value specified in equation (2) is natural since
many benefits associated with college (e.g. recreational facilities or friends living in close
proximity) are effectively free. At the same time, students may receive discounted prices
on many other goods and services (e.g. student discounts at nearby establishments).
       Assuming any price discounts during college apply to all expenditures besides food and
housing, the mapping from consumption expenditures to effective consumption becomes
                                             oth

where  > 0 is the price of purchased goods in college (relative to the price of goods
purchased after college, normalized to one). In Appendix E, we show how  and V can
be identified from the (appropriate) Euler equation (using the MB Approach) when these
two parameters are homogeneous across students.
       We obtain an estimate for  of 0.69, suggesting that Berea students receive a discount
of about 30% on the goods they purchase. The estimated V is $12,810, which is about
$2,900 higher than the average value obtained from the MB Approach of Section 4.2
that abstracts from price discounts. The total consumption value of college is given by
      ex        1- oth                        ex
C1 - C1  =       
                  C1     + V . Using average C1  and estimated (, V ), students receive an
average annual total consumption value from college of $13,220. Because spending during
college is so low, the price discount channel accounts for less than 5% of this value.
  26
    These calculations assume a 5% interest rate in discounting lifetime earnings and the consumption
value flows from college.

5     Conclusions
Our results indicate that the students we study, on average, receive $10,000+ in con-
sumption benefits from each year of college attendance. Factoring in four years of these
benefits raises the total anticipated return to college by as much as 14%, on average.
We also document considerable heterogeneity in these benefits across students, which
suggests that the consumption value of college is likely a major factor in determining
who attends college in addition to overall attendance rates. Accounting for these ben-
efits (or at least recognizing their existence) is, therefore, critical for higher education
policy. Most notably, many students may not need financial aid to cover much more than
their tuition, room, and board costs to attain high levels of effective consumption during
college. Our results also have important implications for empirical studies of credit con-
straints, since low levels of consumption expenditures during college do not necessarily
imply binding constraints.
    While caution is appropriate when studying a single school, for reasons described in
Section 3.1, it is likely that the college experience at Berea is similar to that at many
other institutions. In terms of future work, it would be informative to know whether
consumption values differ systematically across schools in easily observed ways (e.g. by
school size or type, city size, local weather). This may be of great interest to policymakers,
who are likely to be more interested in subsidizing the investment component of higher
education rather than its consumption benefits. From a methodological standpoint, there
is nothing to preclude the survey questions needed for our approach from being added
to general longitudinal surveys in the future.

Appendices
A         Risk Aversion and Time Preference: Details
This appendix describes our method for estimating a student's degree of risk aversion 
and time preference  . The method we use is a slightly modified version of that proposed
in Barsky, et al. (1997).
       We determine  from a survey question that asks each person to compare the option
of a risk-free wage with three options that all have a 50% chance of paying twice the risk-
free wage and a 50% chance of paying either (1) one-half the risk-free wage, (2) two-thirds
the risk-free wage, or (3) four-fifths the risk-free wage. For each person, the comparisons
reveal whether  falls in (-, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3.76), or (3.76, ). For simplicity, our main
analysis assigns values of 1, 1.5, 2.88, and 3.76 to these four categories, respectively.
(Appendix C explores the robustness of our results to assigning  = 5 for the highest
category.)
       The estimation of time preference relies on a survey question about a student's pre-
ferred growth rate for consumption. Combined with knowledge of , their choice identifies
their discount rate  . Specifically, students are asked to choose from different lifecycle
consumption profiles that vary in initial consumption and its growth rate gC such that
they all yield the same (undiscounted) sum of total consumption. Assuming individuals
choose the consumption profile to solve the following maximization problem:
                                      -
                                   c1
                                   tt
                        max                    subject to             ct = C,
                         ct
                              t
                                   1-                             t
                                                                                             
yields the Euler equation  t+1 c-     t -
                                t+1 =  ct , which directly identifies  =
                                                                                      ct+1
                                                                                       ct
                                                                                                   
                                                                                                = gC .
The BPS asks students to decide between six potential growth rates: 0.96, 0.98, 1.02,
1.04, and 1.06.
       The estimated joint distribution for  and  in Figure 2 is based on a kernel density
estimator with a normal kernel function and optimal bandwidth. There is considerable
variation in  with an interquartile range of 1.5 to 3.76. By comparison, there is little
heterogeneity in  , with an interquartile range of 0.98 to 1.06.27


B         Estimating the Autocorrelation in Log Wage Shocks
In this appendix, we estimate the autocorrelation parameter for wage shocks, , using
data on the students' realized annual earnings in the post-college periods.
  27
    For the 15% of students who did not answer questions related to  and/or  , we impute this missing
information using the sample average values for  and/or  .

                                                 20
   Since realized cross-sectional earnings distributions differ markedly from anticipated
distributions, it is necessary to determine (µt , t , W t ) for actual earnings. Given a limited
number of observations per student, we assume that t and W t do not vary across
individuals in our estimation of . Since we always observe some respondents with
zero earnings in our sample, we set W t = 0 for this analysis. Allowing for observable
and unobservable heterogeneity in mean log earnings, we assume that µit = xi  + i +
gt for individual i in year t. Observed characteristics are reflected in the vector xi ,
which includes gender, race, high school GPA, and ACT scores. Unobserved individual
differences are captured by i  xi , while year dummies gt capture both time and
age/experience effects. These assumptions yield the following log wage equation:

                  log(Wit ) = xi  + gt + i + t       it         i and t  G + 1,

where   it   has zero mean, unit variance, and is uncorrelated with (xi , gt , i ).
                            2
   To estimate  (as well as    V ar(i ) and all t ), we first regress log(Wit ) on xi
and gt to obtain residuals: yit  i + t it . Next, we use the Minimum Distance (MD)
estimator that minimizes the distance between empirical and theoretical second moments
for yit , where the covariance between yit and yit+k is

                                                       2
                                 cov (yi,t , yit+k ) =   + t t+k k .

                                                  2   2        2
   Collect all parameters to be estimated in   (,   , 5 , ..., 12 ). Denote the theo-
retical co-variance matrix implied by  as M (), and define m  vech(M ), the stacked
vector of unique moments in M (). Given that our panel consists of 8 periods, we have
10 parameters and 36 unique moments.
   In order to handle missing observations (for some person-years), we adopt the notation
used in Blundell, et al. (2008). Denote

                      yi =                       and      di =               ,
                                 ...                             ...

   The MD estimator   ^ is defined as follows:

                              ^ = min (m
                                       ^ - m()) (m
                                                 ^ - m()),
                                    


                                                   21
where  is the weighting matrix. We use the identity matrix instead of the estimated
`optimal' weighting matrix, since the latter tends to create significant small sample bias
(Altonji and Segal, 1996). We estimate  = 0.6165.

    Recall that our main estimates of V reported in the paper average $11,570 and $9,900
for the DD and MB Approaches, respectively. Table 3 reports the distribution for esti-
mated V under a variety of alternative assumptions. All of these results suggest substan-
tial and heterogeneous consumption values of college.
    Panel A of Table 3 shows that expanding our sample to include all students who
answered survey question Q.1 (including those who would reject an additional loan due
to reasons other than consumption smoothing) yields average consumption values V of
$11,880 for the data-driven approach and $10,070 for the model-based approach.
    As discussed in Appendix A, our main analysis assigns  = 3.76 for students whose
self-reported risk preference places their value of  in the range of (3.76, ). This could

                                           22
lead to over-estimates of V for these students. To examine the sensitivity of our results to
this assumption, we consider an alternative in which we assign  = 5 for these students.
The first two rows of Panel B in Table 3 show that the sample distributions for V
estimated under this alternative are very similar to their baseline counterparts reported
in Sections 4.1 and 4.2.
   Our estimates of  are higher than values typically assumed in the consumption
literature. For example, the average  exceeds 1, which implies that the average student
prefers positive consumption growth over the lifecycle. Given the inherent challenges in
eliciting time and risk preferences for individuals, we also calculate V using "standard"
assumptions for these parameters, setting  = 0.95 and  = 2 for all students. The last
two rows of Panel B show that using these "standard" values produces estimates of V
that are, on average, $3,000-6,000 higher than our baseline estimates.
   Our conclusions about V also depend on student perceptions about interest rate r and
autocorrelation parameter . Our main analysis assigns r = 5% for all students. Taking
into account the possibility that college students believe borrowing is more costly, we
consider an alternative imposing r = 8%. As shown in the first two rows of Panel C,
the sample averages for V estimated under this alternative are slightly lower ($830 for
the DD Approach and $1,700 for the MB Approach) than their baseline counterparts
reported in Sections 4.1 and 4.2.
   Our main analysis using the MB Approach assumes that students' perceived value
of  is equal to 0.62, as estimated from realized earnings reported in the post-college
portion of the BPS. This value is somewhat smaller than what researchers typically find
using national datasets like the PSID. The third row of Panel C shows that setting 
to 0.9, a more "standard" value in the literature, produces a slightly lower V than its
counterpart reported in Section 4.2.
                                                                   ~ (DG+1 , WG+1 )
   The DD Approach estimates the post-college consumption function C
using data on CG+1 , DG+1 , and WG+1 . One practical concern is that students' ex-
pectations about post-college earnings often exceed their actual post-college earnings.
The empirical support of post-college earnings does not cover roughly 30% of the high
end of the support of students' subjective earnings distribution, requiring extrapola-
tion of the post-college consumption function at these earnings realizations. To exam-
ine the sensitivity of our results to this extrapolation, we calculate V assuming that
C~ (D, W ) = C
             ~ (D, max{WG+1 }) for all W  max{WG+1 }. This assumption yields the
                                                           ~ (DG+1 , WG+1 ) is increas-
most conservative estimates of V under the assumption that C
ing in WG+1 . As shown in the first row of Panel D, the average consumption value
computed under this conservative assumption is $8,930, roughly $2,600 lower than the

average value of V reported in Section 4.1.
                                                ~ (DG+1 , WG+1 ) for the DD Approach, be-
   Additional challenges arise in estimation of C
cause (1) some students are married at t = G + 1 while our key Euler equation character-
izes the trade-off faced by single individuals; (2) among the 151 unmarried students who
reported WG+1 and CG+1 , only 118 also reported DG+1 ; and (3) post-college consump-
tion expenditures may understate CG+1 due to in-kind parental transfers after college.
In the paper, we address these issues by (1) only including unmarried students in our
sample, (2) imputing the missing values of DG+1 using the sample average of DG+1 , and
(3) assuming CG+1 is the greater of reported consumption expenditures and the relevant
poverty level, $8,590. Here, we explore a few alternative approaches.
  The second row of Panel D shows the distribution of V calculated using the DD
                                                           ~ (·, ·), assuming that their

individual earnings and consumption are half of their family earnings and consumption,
respectively. In this case, we have 194 observations for estimation of C~ (·, ·). Average
               ~ (·, ·) with respect to WG+1 and DG+1 are 0.250 and -0.084, respectively.
derivatives of C
The average value of V is $10,760, and the interquartile range of V is $6,560.
   The third row of Panel D shows the distribution of V calculated using the DD Ap-
proach when we exclude the students who did not report DG+1 from our sample when
           ~ (·, ·). In this case, we have 118 observations for estimation of C
estimating C                                                                  ~ (·, ·). Average
               ~ (·, ·) with respect to WG+1 and DG+1 are 0.302 and -0.079, respectively.
derivatives of C
The average value of V is $11,610, and the interquartile range of V is $7,320.
   Next, instead of assuming that students' "actual" consumption cannot fall below
the poverty line, we consider an alternative in which a student's "actual" post-college
consumption from housing and groceries is no less than the cost of food and housing
                                         ~ (DG+1 , WG+1 ) with respect to WG+1 and DG+1
while in college. Average derivatives of C
are 0.292 and -0.092, respectively. Recall that, since we only restrict the derivative
with respect to WG+1 to be positive within the empirical support of WG+1 and DG+1
when estimating C~ (DG+1 , WG+1 ), the estimated function can be decreasing in WG+1 for
realizations of WG+1 that are much larger than the maximum value of observed WG+1 ,
max{WG+1 }. We find this is the case under this alternative. To deal with this issue, we
                 ~ (D, W ) = C
also assume that C           ~ (D, max{WG+1 }) for all W  max{WG+1 }. As shown in
the fourth row of Panel D, the average value of V is $9,590.
   Another concern about our measure of CG+1 is that it might contain expenditures on
durable goods such as cars, which could potentially lead to artificially high levels of mea-
sured consumption after school. To address this concern, we take advantage of the fact
that our measure of CG+1 is obtained by summing over students' reported consumption


                                              24
expenditures on 10 categories of consumption goods. Among the categories listed, two
plausibly include spending on durable goods: "car and other travel expenses including
gas, car payments, and car insurance" and "Music, computer equipment, TV and stereo
equipment, and other electronic equipment". The inclusion of durable goods may inflate
our measure of CG+1 if the price paid covers utility flows beyond that year. This also
means that such expenditures should not appear repeatedly within a short time horizon.
For example, a student who buys a car at t = G + 1 is likely to benefit from that car
for several years and is, therefore, unlikely to buy another car over the next few years.
This suggests that the lesser of a student's reported expenditures (within each of these
two categories) in 2006 (t = G + 1) and 2007 (t = G + 2) should represent a conservative
measure of their non-durable expenditures in t = G + 1. Based on this, we create an al-
ternative measure of CG+1 by replacing students' reported consumption expenditures on
these two categories with this conservative measure. The sample average of this alterna-
tive measure is roughly $710 lower than the sample average of our baseline measure. We
then estimate C~ (·, ·) using these alternative measures of CG+1 and estimate V using the
DD Approach. Average derivatives of C      ~ (DG+1 , WG+1 ) with respect to WG+1 and DG+1
are 0.238 and -0.069, respectively. As shown in the last row of Panel D, the average value
of V is $10,530, and the interquartile range of V is $6,600.
    The MB Approach requires a specification for borrowing limits faced by students.
Here, we consider the natural borrowing limit of Aiyagari (1994) based on the perceived
lower bound on earnings reported by students:
                                         T
                             ¯ t+1 =              1 t -t
                             D               (       )  (Wt ).
                                       t =t+1
                                                 1+r

    Panel E shows that Aiyagari-type borrowing constraints imply a much higher average
V ($19,020) than the much more restricted borrowing environment assumed in the paper.
This is because the Aiyagari-type constraint is fairly loose for most of the students in our
sample ­ even the most constrained student is allowed to borrow up to around $16,400
during the first year after college. Due to the greater access to credit, youth behave
roughly as if they are unconstrained. There is little incentive for precautionary savings,
resulting in higher levels of consumption immediately after college.


D      After-tax Earnings
After-tax earnings are computed using federal and state tax schedules for Kentucky circa
2001 for single individuals without children. An individual with before-tax earnings w
needs to pay FICA, F ICA(w), federal tax, F T (w), and state tax, ST (w), and receives

                                                 25
state income credit SIC (w). Formally, after-tax earnings  (w) is given by:

                     (w) = w - F ICA(w) - F T (w) - ST (w) + SIC (w),

where F ICA(w) = 0.062 · min(w, $80400) and other taxes/credits are determined as
follows. To compute federal and state taxes, we first subtract deductions and exemptions
from w to obtain taxable earnings. The federal standard deduction and exemption are
$4,550 and $2,900 in 2001. The state standard deduction for Kentucky is $1,700. We
then apply the income tax brackets shown in Table 4 to taxable earnings to compute
F T (w) and ST (w). The state income credit for Kentucky is $20.

E      Estimation of  and V
When college enrollment not only provides some consumption benefits for free but also re-
duces the price for all purchased goods/services (not including food and housing provided
by the college), the modified Euler equation analogous to equation (4) is
                                         -1/        1                       1

where  > 0 reflects the price of goods purchased in college relative to the price of goods
purchased after college (normalized to one). Note that we already compute  for each
student using the DD and MB Approaches. If  and V are common across students,
their values can be estimated by exploiting cross-sectional variation in (C oth + ^) (and
                                                                                        1

                                                                   ( C1     +^),  and  (calculated
from the MB Approach), we use non-linear least squares to estimate  and V .28

    Letting i subscripts denote values for student i, the following regression can be estimated via non-
linear least squares:

precise estimates in this case.

   We obtain an estimate for  of 0.69 with a standard error of 0.15, suggesting that Berea
students receive a discount of about 30% on the goods they purchase. The estimated V
is $12,810 with a standard error $1,910.
