     COLLATERAL, RATIONING AND GOVERNMENT INTERVENTION IN CREDIT MARKETS




    This   paper analyzes the effects of government intervention in credit

markets when lenders use collateral, interest, and the probability of

granting a loan as potential screening devices. Equilibria with and without

rationing are examined. The principal theme is that credit policies operate

through their effect on the incentive compatibility constraint, which

inhibits high-risk borrowers from mimicking the behavior of low-risk

borrowers. Any policy that loosens (tightens) the constraint raises

(reduces) efficiency.

     Most government credit programs explicitly attempt to fund investors

that cannot obtain private financing. In the model presented here, these

subsidies increase the extent of rationing and reduce efficiency. In

contrast, policies that subsidize the nonrationed borrowers, or all

borrowers, are efficiency enhancing, and reduce the extent of rationing.

1. Introduction

     The federal government is the largest single lender in the country. As

of the end of 1988, direct loans outstanding exceeded $222 billion, while

outstanding loan guarantees were approximately $550 billion (Office of Man-

agement and Budget 1989). Federal credit assists borrowers across a wide

variety of sectors, including housing, agriculture, small business1 and

education, in a bewildering array of over 100 programs.1

     In order to analyze the effects of these policies, this paper focuses

on two salient characteristics of virtually all credit programs. First,

federal credit is usually intended for those who could not obtain private

financing. For example, "a direct loan is best justified when the federal

objective could not be met with financing from private sources" (Office of

Management and Budget 1988. p. F-IS). Other programs, such as Small

Business Administration loan guaranteee, recuire applicants to prove that

they could not obtain private financing.

     Second federal credit is provided on easier terms than comparable

private credit. These tens can include reduced interest or collateral,

longer maturities, grace periods, etc. These provisions are estimated to

reduce the discounted value of borrower payments by amounts that vary widely

across programs, but typically range between 10% and 25% (Office of

Management and Budget 1989).

     This paper analyzes the effects of policies with these characteristics

in a modal where rationing arises endogenously.2 The underlying model is
described in Section 2 and is closely related to Rothschild and Stiglitz

(1976) and Besanko arid Thakor (1987). Investors are divided into two

groups, high-risk and low-risk, and have a choice of investing in a safe

project, or borrowing to invest in a risky project. For each group, lenders

specify a probability of issuing a loan, an interest rate, and a collateral

requirement.

     Any given amount of collateral is assumed to be worth less to lenders

than to borrowers. This feature implies that the use of collateral will

generate an efficiency loss. In addition, all projects have expected gross

returns greater than their social opportunity cost. Therefore, any amount

of rationing represents an additional efficiency loss. The full information

equilibrium arises when borrower type is known ax ante, and implies no

rationing and no collateral, and is thus efficient.

     section 3 analyzes situations where each borrower's type is private

information. Now, lenders must collectively offer sets of contracts that

induce borrowers to self-select into the appropriate contract. In equilib-

rium, high-risks choose a contract with a relatively high interest rate and

a zero collateral requirement. Low-risks signal their type by choosing to

pay high collateral in exchange for a lower interest rate. As long as low-

risks have sufficient wealth to post as collateral, the equilibrium involves

no rationing. Newertheless, because of the efficiency loss created by the

use of collateral, there is a potential role for government.

     The principal result of this section is to show that credit policies

operate through their effects on the incentive compatibility constraint,

which constrains the set of adaissable contracts such that high-risk

borrowers do not apply for the low-risk contract. For example, a guarantee

to low-risk borrowers reduces their interest rate. Since the high-risk
                                      3




contract has not changed, the low-risk collateral requirement must X1}I    in
order to restore incentive compatibility. The increase in collateral means

that guarantees to low-risks reduce efficiency.

     In contrast, a guarantee to high-risk borrowers makes the high-risk

loan more attractive, thereby allowing lenders to reduce the collateral

requirement on low-risk loans. Consequently, guarantees to high-risks raise

efficiency. Equal guarantees to both groups have similar negative effects

on the collateral requirement and positive effects on efficiency.

     The major results of the paper are presented in Section 4, where it is

assumed that borrower wealth is too low to support the collateral require-

ment in Section 3.   because the high-risk contract involves no collateral,

it does not change. However, since low-risks can only post a small amount

of collateral, the low-risk contract must somehow be sade less desirable in

order to restore incentive compatibility. The only option is to reduce the

probability of granting a low-risk loan; that is, to introduce rationing of

low-risk borrowers

     With the existence of rationing, it ia now possible to analyze credit

policies with the two salient features described above. Suppose the govern-

ment agrees to offer subaidized credit (either direct or guaranteed loans)

to some proportion of the (low-risk) borrowers who are turned down by the

private market. The key point is that in the absence of any further

changes, these subsidies make the low-risk contract more attractive to high-

risk borrowers. Therefore, some other aspect of the low-risk contract must

become less desirable to restore incentive compatibility, Since the

collateral requirement cannot rise, the only alternative is for the overall

(public and private) probability of obtaining a loan to fall. That is,

increased subsidies to the rationed borrowers aas the extent of rationing.
                                          4




Private lending is crowded out on a more than one-to-one basis. It should

be emphasized that this is an equilibrium response, and is due to the

existence of the incentive compatibility constraint.

     Although the subsidies increase the extent of rationing, they raise the

ex ante expected utility of low-risk borrowers. This occurs because the

benefits of the added cheap government loans outweigh the costa of the in-

creased probability of being rationed, Thus, subsidies to low-risks make

the representative low-risk borrower better off cx ante? but actually reduce

the utility of some low-risk borrowers cx post. Since they increase the

extent of rationing, the subsidies to low-risk borrowers reduce overall

efficiency.

        In contrast, subsidies to high-risk borrowers loosen the incentive

compatibility constraint. As a consequence, the extent of rationing of low-

risk borrowers falls and efficiency rises.

        Section 5 is a short conclusion. The Appendix provides derivation of

the various equilibria and proofs of the propositions.


2, The Basic Model

A. Descrjotjori

        The model describes &   competitive   credit market with many investors,

but even more lenders. All agents are assumed to be risk-neutral, thus

eliminating any insurance role for federal credit, and there is no aggregate

risk.

        Investors can invest their initial endowment in a safe project that

yields a gross return of Z.4 Alternatively, each investor can borrow $1

and invest that and the initial endowment in a risky project. Investors

fall into two categories, which differ according to the probability of
                                               5




having a risky project succeed, w., and the gross return to that project

if it is successful, R. I assume                   >
                                                         r,     so that type l's are low-

risk borrowers. Projects that do not succeed yield a gross return of zero.

The expected gross return to all projacts are equaL pt —                        k,   i —   1,2,
where k is a constant. Investors have a certain end-of-period endowment

W. I assume the existence of a sufficient enforcement technology such that

Id is acceptable to lenders as collateral. The proportion of borrowers that

are low-risk is given by .

         Lenders have an alternstive safe investment that earns p. They offer

loans charscterized by en interest rate Cr),                    a collateral requirement

Cc), and a probability of issuing the loan to any particular applicant

Cp). Following sevaral authors,5 I assume there is a cost to collateraliza-

tion. Specifically, the lenders' valuation of $1 in collateral is given by

$,   0   S fi   < I.   Therefore, 1 -    fi > 0    represents the social cost of

transferring the collateral or realizing its value. Competition among

lenders generates the following zero profit condition on loans to each

group:6

                       —
                           5ji + (lri)ci           i —   1,2.

Investors are assumed to be able to apply for only one loan. The expected

utility of an investor in group i applying for a loan contract meant for

group j is

                           —                                     i,j —   1,2.
                               PjOri(Ri_rj)_(l_Ri)cj_Z)1
         Lenders always know the value of .              In   the full information

equilibrium described below, lenders also know each borrower's type. In the

asymmetric information equilibria, information on borrower type is

unavailable to banks on an ex ante basis.
                                          6




       The Nash equilibrium concept is used throughout this paper. A set of

contracts is a Nash equilibrium if no contract in the set earns negative

profits, and there is no additional contract which, if offered, would sake

positive profits, holding the current set of contracts fixed (Rothschild and

Stiglitz 1976)

B. Full InfGrmation Eouilibrium

       Although subsequent analysis will focus on markets with asymmetric

information, the full, information equilibrium is presented first as a

benchmark. Because the types are identifishle ex ante, lenders face two

distinct loan markets, In each suhmarket, optimal contracts maximize

expected borrower utility U1,, given in (2), subject to (1).

Eauilibriua I: The full information equilibrium is characterized hy


(3a)             p — 1,      i —   1,2,       (No rationing)

                     — 0,    i —   1,2
(3b)             4                            (No collateral)


(3c)             r —   s—,    —    1,2,

       With full information, all borrowers receive loans. In addition, since

borrowers are indifferent between committing to a dollar of expected

interest payments and a dollar of expected collateral, while lenders prefer

the former, equilibrium involves complete elimination of collateral.

Formally, from (I), the slope of isoprofit curves in r-c space is given by

                 dci

                dci

Indifference curves (U and U') and zero profit curves (II and Iz)

for each group are shown in Figure 1. For each group, p        'C 1   implies that

the isoprofit curve is flatter than the indifference curve. Curves for

high-risk borrowers are steeper than those for low-risk borrowers. The full

information equilibrium is given by contracts 4        and   a2, along with



      Suhstituting (3a)-(3c) into (2) yields

                tJii_wiRi - p    -
                                     Z,   i— 1,2.

Since p +   Z   is the social opportunity cost of investment, (4) shows that

investments are made (Uii > 0)        if and only if the expected total return

exceeds the expected social cost. Therefore, equilibrium is efficient.


3.   Asyetric Information and Unconstrained Collateral
A. Private Equilibrium
     When individual investors' types are private information, lenders must

design sets of loan contracts that generate self-selection of each borrower

type into the appropriate contract. Thus, lenders operate subject to (1)

and a pair of incentive compatibility constraints:


                U11 a U12, and

                U22   U21,

where U is defined in (2) .          It can be directly verified that the full
information equilibrium is not incentive compatible, because both types

would prafer the low-risk contract,

    Equilibrium with Unconstrained Collateral
       Instead, with asymmetric information, collateral is used as a sorting

device! High-risk borrowers have a stronger preference not to post

collateral, because they have a larger probability of having to pay it.

      Whether collateral can induce complete separation depends crucially on

¶4,   the level of borrower wealth. This section examines equilibria and

government policy when borrower wealth is sufficiently large to allow

complete separation. Section 4 examines markets characcerired by insuffic-

ient wealth.

                           'l l 1
       With imperfect information, high-risk borrowers obtain the same loan

contract, and therefore the same utility, as in the full information

equilibrium. Low-risk borrowers are not rationed, but their loan tens have

changed. Specifically, low-risk borrowars indicate their type by posting

collateral. In return, they pay a lower interest rate than in the full

information equilibrium.

       Substituting (Ga)-(6c) into (2) for type l's yields

                  II                                        II

Comparing (4) and (7). low-risk borrowers are worse off relative to the full

information equilibrium by (l-w1)(l-fl)cf'. The magnitude of the welfare

loss increases with c1.

     The equilibrium with asymmetric information and unconstrained

collateral is shown in Figure 1 as (a1,a2). High-risks obtain a2, as

before. However, any contract offered to low-risks must be incentive

compatible with a. Of all such contracts, ml is the most desirable

contract for type l's that also earns nonnegative profits when extended ro

type l's. The reduction in low-risk borrowers' utility to                    from

is shown by the shift from          to a1, Note that (5b) is binding in this

equilibrium.

B, Government Credit

     Although there is no rationing in the above model, there is still a

role for government policy due to the efficiency losses created by the use

of collsteral Because all investors receive loans in the private equilib-

riuni, it seems natural to focus on loan guarantees (rather than direct

loans) in this contextY

     Loan guarantees ensure the lender of receiving an amount -y., where

o          s p.   The government can set '1 —
                                                2       -y,   or   choose the y.

separately. In return for the guarantee, the lender passes on any collater-

al collected to the government. The net cost to the government of a
                              III              III
defaulted loan is -y -
                            flc     where c1           is the collateral requirement

in the presence of the guarantee, and is discussed further below. The

government is subject to the same information constraints that private

lenders face.

     With the guarantees in place, expected borrower utility is still given

by (2) ,    but the zero profit condition for lenders is now given by

                      —     + (l-wp-r    i —    1,2.

This result is contrary to standard intuition, which would suggest that as

r1 falls, and the low-risk contract becomes more desirable to high-risk

borrowers. Since (Sb) binds, c1 isust rise to eliminate the possibility of

having high-risks masquerade as low-risks.

        Similar arguments show that 411 falls with increases in                               As

shown in Figure 3, a rise in                          shifts the zero profit line for lending

to high-risk borrowers from 12 to l, which raises low-risk utility to

       from U2. The equilibrium thus shifts from (a11a2) to (a?+4).                             At
the latter points, k2sh groups are better off and the collateral requirement

has fallen.

        Since the use of collateral creates efficiency losses, these results

will have important welfare implications. Substituting (9a)-(9c) into (2)

yields expected utilities:

                      in   —          -p      -   1    -   ______________

                                                                si(l1rz)

                               w2R2

        Increases in l raise U11 even though they raise c1. For any
   > flc, low-risk borrowers are better off than in the private equilib-

rium. Increases in                raise both U11 and U22. Thus, both types of

borrowers are better off with guarantees.

        Welfare calculations are based on total expected borrowers' utility

minus    expected    government costs of funding the guarantees. Define overall

welfare as


(12)                V — #U11 + (l-*)U22 -                                    -

The first two terms represent utility of each borrower type, weighted by

their population proportion; the last two terms represent net expected

government costs of providing guarantees to low-risks and high-risks
                10
respectively.

                             >0.


        The main result from Proposition I is that the effects of government

intervention depend on how the incentive compatibility constraint, and in

particular the collateral requirement, ia affected.

        Equation (13) states that increases in l' holding 2 constant,

reduce welfare, From (10). the guarantee raises U11 by ((l-w1)(r1-r2))/

                However, from (12), the marginal cost per low-risk borrower of

raising I is (l-r1).         It is easy to show that the marginal costs exceed

the marginal benefits. This occurs because the rise in          raises c1
which creates an efficiency loss.

        The second result states that subaidiztng the high-risk group is

welfare-improving. Using (11) and (12), the governments costs equal the

benefits to high-risk borrowers. Since low-risk borrowers are also made

better off, there is a welfare gain. The rise in          increases the

attractiveness of the high-risk contract, so that low-risk borrowers can be

offered more attractive terms. The fall in c1 allows for an efficiency

gain.

     Equation (15) states that raising the guarantee rate on all loans is

welfare-improving, From (9b), setting l —         —1   yields c'/3y <0,
so that collateral falls as the overall guarantee rate rises. Therefore,

the net effect of universal guarantees is to weaken the incentive

compatibility constraint and raise welfare.


4. Aryretric Infornatiqn and. Constrained Collateral

A. Private Equilibrium

     The effectiveness of collateral as a sorting device depends crucially

on the existence of eufficient end-of-period borrower wealth. For example

if tJ —   0,   collateral cannot be used as a sorting device. More generally,

suppose ti C c, given in (6b); then the low-risk contract offered in

Equilibrium II cannot be fulfilled by borrowers. Lenders, knowing this,

will not offer the contract. Moreover, because (Sb) is binding in

equilibrium, if lenders simply reduced c1 to W, the contracts offered

would not be incentive compatible; both groups would prefer the contract

meant for low-risk borrowers.

     Lenders can resolve this problem only by making the Low-risk contract

less attractive to high-risk borrowers. Raising r1 would discourage

low-risk borrowers more than high-risk borrowers, since the latter have a

smaller probability of actually having to pay the higher rate. The only

alternative is to reduce p1. This adjustment will diacouraga.high-risks

more? and restore incentive compatibility. Therefore, when borrower wealth

is insufficient to permit collateral alone to act as a sorting device,

rationing of low-risk borrowere (p1<l) is required to restore equilibrium.

The intuition presented above is summarized in

guaranteed loan given that one can not obtain private credit, and

defined as before. Although the analysis will focus on subsidized loan

guarantees, analogous results can be shown to hold for subsidized direct

loans as well.

        The interest rate charged on guaranteed loans gives lenders zero

profits and is given by

The first term on the right side of (19) represents the probability of

obtaining a private loan p. multiplied by X11,                         the expected payoff to

low-risk borrowers of obtaining a private loan meant for low-risk borrowers.

The second term represents the probability of obtaining a government-

guaranteed loan,            (l-p1)p0, multiplied by X10, the expected payoff to

low-risk borrowers from that loan. If 11 —                          then     —        and there

Appendix.)

These private loans are, of course, supplemented by government-guaranteed

loans to some low-risk borrowers described by (p0, r0, W) .                      High-risk
borrowers obtain the same contract and utility as in Equilibria II and IV.

Low-risk utility is given by (19) with appropriate substitutions for V11

and V10.

       Define the probability of low-risks obtaining any Loan as


(22)                —
                        l   +


Then a proportion l-p* of low-risks will be rationed.

Proposition 2: When the initial allocation is given by Equilibrium U,

increases in p or               increase the extent of rationing (reduce p*)

       Proposition 2 establishes that government subsidies to borrowers who

cannot obtain private financing increases the number of borrowers who canroc

obtain any financing, public or private. That is, private credit is crowded

out on a more than one-to-one baais, Although this result may appear

surprising, it is based on the equilibrium response of lenders to the shift

in the incentive compatibility constraint.

       For example, in the equilibrium with W > c, an increase in

raised c1 in order to restore incentive compatibility. Now, however,

collateral is constrained to equal W, which is assumed to be less than c.

As a consequence, increases in           (which reduce r1) requite that p1

fall. From (22), a reduction in Pt, holding p0 constant, reduces p*.

Therefore, raising the guarantee rate to low-risk borrowers increases the

extent of rationing.

       Similarly, consider a small increase in PC, holding 11 constant.

If        were held constant, all borrowers would have an increased chance of

obtaining a cheap government loan, which would induce high-risks to

masquerade as low-risks. If p1 fell such that p* were unchanged from

its previous level, high-risks would still prefer masquerading as low-risks

to taking the high-risk contract. To show this, rewrite (20) as


(23)             U22 t p*X21 + (l-p1)p0(X20-X21).
                                       17




Recall that this constraint is binding in Equilibrium V. If          rises and

pt is held constant, (23) is violated. Therefore, in equilibrium,

incentive cosipatibility requires p1 to fall enough to make p* fall in

response to the rise in p. That is, increases in            raise the extent of

rationing.

        Although they increase the likelihood of any given low-risk borrower

being rationed, guarantees raise the ax post utility of those who do obtain

government credit, because of the reduced interest rate r on guaranteed

loans. The effects of these guarantees on the ex ante expected utility of

low-risk borrowers and on welfare is given in

Proo_aition 3: When the initial allocation is given by Equilibrium V, the

        Equations (24a) and (24b) show that guaranteed loans raise the cx ante

expected utility of the tsrgeted group. This occurs even though the overall

probability of obtaining a loan falls. Therefore, the targeted group

prefers to have the policy, even though fewer lower-risk borrowers obtain

credit when the subsidy is in place.
                                       18




     Equations (25a) and (25b) show that, as in Proposition 1. guarantees to

low-risk borrowers reduce overall welfare. This occurs because the increase

in rationing represents an overall efficiency loss. Following the approach

taken in Section III, it is straightforward to show that guarantees to the

high-risk group reduce the extent of rationing. Intuitively, these

guarantees make the high-risk contract CU22) more attrsctive, and through

(2la) raise         Because of the reduction in rationing, these guarantees

raise efficiency.

5. Cixoclusion

     This paper analyzes the effects of credit subsidies in markets

characterized by adverse selection. The principal result is that the

effects of credit subsidies depend on how eligibility is determined.

Programs that subsidize the unrationed contract will reduce the extent of

rationing and raise overall efficiency. In contrast, progrsnis that target

borrowers who cannot obtain private financing raise the extent of rationing

and reduce efficiency. The distinction is important precisely because most

government credit is designed to provide funds to those who do not receive

private loans. In the model presented. here, such policies raise the extent

of rationing and create inherent tradeoffs among members of the same target

group: fewer of them obtain any type of credit, but those that receive

government loans are better off.

     Two   concluding   comments should be made. First, the effects described

above represent equilibrium responses. In particular, they take into

account the need to deter high-risks from pretending to be low-risks. As a

consequence of this incentive compatibility constraint, whenever the

government eases some of the terms on low-risk contracts, the others must be

adversely affected in equilibrium.
                                    19




     Second the paper has focused on a fairly standard adverse selection

model, based on Rothschild and Stiglitz (1976). Numerous extensions of that

and other models have shown that the nature of equilibrium can be affected

by incentive effects (Stiglitz and Weiss 1986) project characteristics, the

set of available financial instruments (DeMeza and Webb 1987), alternative

projects (Chan and Thakor 1987) information sharing (Yotsuzuka 1987)   the

shape of the production function (Milde and Riley 1988), and other

characteristics. The effects of credit policies in such alternative models

deserve further exploration.

on Gale (1987, Appendix C). Some of the results are closely related to

independent work by Smith and Stutrer (1988).

     3. As described in Section 4, raising the interest rate on the low-

risk loan cannot restore incentive compatibility, because low riska are more

averse to accepting a higher interest rate than high risks are.

effects induced by collateral.

     8. The existence of a separating equilibrium can be ensured by

assuming there is a sufficiently large proportion of high-risk borrowers, or

that the difference between            is large enough. See Rothschild and

Stiglitz   (1976) or Besanko and Thakor (1987). There are no pooling

equilibria under the assumptions in this section.

     9. Gale (1987) also examines government policies in which low-risk

loans are taxed and high risk loans are subsidized. These policies operate

through the same channels as guarantees and will be ignored here.

     10. Therefore, the welfare criterion is total surplus, rather than a

Pareto measure. In addition, (12) assumes that taxes are raised in a lump-

sum manner.
     11. It is impossible to make the high-risk contract more attractive to

high-risk borrowers without losing money on high-risk contracts, Due to the

Nash assumption, cross-subsidization of contracts will not occur in this

model, although it could in other contexts. See Stiglitz arid Weiss 1989.

     12. Besanko and Thakor (1987) show that under these circumstances (5a)

requires that W 2, (w1-,r2)/(#1(r2R-p) -         Zff2((l-c1)+flw1]).   Loosely

speaking, this requires that Z is small relative to W.

     13. In order to rule out a pooling equilibrium at p —             l,   c —   W,   it

is necessary to assume that ft C (w*(l-w1))/(ic1(l-,c*)), where w* —

            It may be thought that the allocation in Equilibrium V could he
broken by an offer that raises p1 and r1, holding c at W. Such an

offer would earn positive profits if it attracted only low-risks, However,

from (2), dr/dp —    (k-c-Z)/pw   -
                                      (r-c)/p.   Since this expression is

decreasing in a, any offer that raised p1 and r1 relative to

Equilibrium V would attract both types and thus would not be offered.

     14. Reducing the collateral requirement on government loans has the

same qualitative effects as rsising p0 or

loans to accept publit ones, I assume            >

Egj4ibrium II: The remaining equilibria follow a common pattern.

Therefore, Equilibrium II is derived in some detail, while the derivations

of Equilibria Ill-V are shorter.

     With asymmetric information, equilibrium is obtained by maximizing the

population-weighted average of borrowers' expected utility, given by

                               +

subject to (1), (5a) and (5h). Following Besanko and Thakor (1987), the

strategy employed is initially to ignore (5a) and assume                         —   I.   1tter it

will be shown that the optimal solution does satisfy (Sa) and p —

aL/3c2 < 0, which implies                      — 0.       Substituting for c n (Sb) and

solving (Sb) for c1 yields the expression in (6b). Given c ,                                can

        It remains to be shown that (5a) is satisfied_at the solution presented

that U11 t U12 if

(A-4)             r1(r-rf')

Using (1) and (6b) and some algebra, it can be shown that (A-4) holds for

the values given in Proposition 11. U11 > U12 can also be seen by

examining Figure 1.

        It is also straightforward to show that oL/&p2 > 0, which implies

p2 — 1.      Finally,

condition captures the idea that high-risks have a higher aversion to post-

ing collateral because they have a larger probability of having to pay it.

That is, the same condition implies, from (2), that dc/dp rises with ir.

Eouilibrium III: Guarantees shift the zero profit condition to (8) from

(I). Otherwise, the maximization follows as in Equilibrium II. That is,

substitute (8) into (2) into (A-l) and maximize subject to (5a), ignoring

(5b) and setting     —   I    for now. The problem is to

Setting aL1/&c1 — 0          implies that A > 0, which implies that (Sb) binds.

Given A > 0, it is easy to show that                       — 0.   Solving (Sb) for ct
yields the expression in (9b). Showing that (Ss) is satisfied and that

        1 follow in the same way as in Equilibrium II.

Proposition 1.: Expected borrower utilities are given in (10) and (II). The

government cost of providi.ng guarantee 'y is (l-wi)(-rj-flct'1) for each

borrower in group i. The effects ofraising l only or '2 only are
                                                 25




described in the text. The effects of raising                              are as follows.

      If   -v C            the only effect of raising                  occurs through raising
                  18cr,
      so the increase in -i          is welfare improving. When y                             further

increases introduce opposing welfare effects. However, the net effect is

always welfare-improving Note that, for each high-risk borrower, the

benefits of raising y equal (lw2)&Y2 which equals the cost of

providing guarantees per high-risk borrowers. The velfare effects thus

depend on comparing a14t'/3-v and the coat of providing guarantees to low-

risks,     (1-if1). From (10),

                                    (1-n1)
                                —                         +            >

Therefore, increases in 1             are welfare-improving.

Eouilibriua_IV: The problem is now to maximize (A-2) subject to (1), (Sb)

and a wealth constraint W C
                                       ct'.     As before, taking derivatives with

                                                   — 1        and cr — 0, and the latter
respect to c2 and p2 yields
result implies rr — p/n2.              The wealth constraint implies that ct'7 — w.

The zero profits condition determines rt". Only p1 remains to be

determined. Optimizing with respect to p1 implies that A > 0                                 so that

(Sb) is binding. Solving (Sb) for p1 yields the expression in (16a)

        To show the welfare effects of changing 1,                    note   that the expression

in (A-6) Is less than                        the    marginal costs of raising            per low-

risk borrower. Thus, increases in                         reduce efficiency. Similar results

hold for p0.
