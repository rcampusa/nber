                                          ABSTRACT

We study a newly-designed survey administered to a large panel of wealthy retail investors. The
survey elicits beliefs that are important for macroeconomics and finance, and matches
respondents with administrative data on their portfolio composition, their trading activity, and
their log-in behavior. We establish five facts in this data: (1) Beliefs are reflected in portfolio
allocations. The sensitivity of portfolios to beliefs is small on average, but varies significantly
with investor wealth, attention, trading frequency, and confidence. (2) Belief changes do not
predict when investors trade, but conditional on trading, they affect both the direction and the
magnitude of trades. (3) Beliefs are mostly characterized by large and persistent individual
heterogeneity. Demographic characteristics explain only a small part of why some individuals are
optimistic and some are pessimistic. (4) Expected cash flow growth and expected returns are
positively related, both within and across investors. (5) Expected returns and the subjective
probability of rare disasters are negatively related, both within and across investors. These five
facts provide useful guidance for the design of macro-finance models.

      We study a newly-designed survey administered to a large panel of wealthy retail investors.
      The survey elicits beliefs that are important for macroeconomics and finance, and matches
      respondents with administrative data on their portfolio composition, their trading activity, and
      their log-in behavior. We establish five facts in this data: (1) Beliefs are reflected in portfolio
      allocations. The sensitivity of portfolios to beliefs is small on average, but varies significantly
      with investor wealth, attention, trading frequency, and confidence. (2) Belief changes do not
      predict when investors trade, but conditional on trading, they affect both the direction and the
      magnitude of trades. (3) Beliefs are mostly characterized by large and persistent individual
      heterogeneity. Demographic characteristics explain only a small part of why some individuals
      are optimistic and some are pessimistic. (4) Expected cash flow growth and expected returns
      are positively related, both within and across investors. (5) Expected returns and the subjective
      probability of rare disasters are negatively related, both within and across investors. These five
      facts provide useful guidance for the design of macro-finance models.

    Researchers are increasingly turning to survey data to calibrate and test macro-finance mod-
els. The unique benefit of survey data is that it can provide direct evidence on the beliefs of dif-
ferent agents about future economic outcomes such as stock returns and economic growth. These
beliefs play a central role in both rational expectation models and behavioral models of macroeco-
nomics and finance. Despite the potential for survey data to shed light on previously unobservable
elements of macro-finance theories, its use has been criticized on many fronts. Critics have argued
that survey data is often based on small and unrepresentative samples, that it is ridden with mea-
surement error, that it asks qualitative questions that are not informative for models, and that it
may not reveal those beliefs on which agents actually base their actions.
    In this paper, we provide new evidence on the link between beliefs elicited through surveys
and actions taken by survey respondents. To do this, we study a newly-designed online expec-
tations survey of a large panel of individual retail investors with substantial wealth invested in
financial markets. The survey elicits the investors’ beliefs about future stock returns, GDP growth,
and bond returns, and was designed to address prevailing criticisms of existing survey data. The
survey design trades off asking quantitative questions about moments that are crucial for macro-
finance theory with keeping the questions sufficiently simple that they can be answered by non-
specialists. The survey is also short, in order to not discourage respondents from participating
repeatedly over time.
    The survey was administered by Vanguard, one of the world’s largest asset management
firms, to an almost random sample of its U.S.-based clients. About 80% of the investors in the sam-
ple have retail trading accounts at Vanguard, while the remaining 20% have employer-sponsored
retirement accounts. The respondents are individuals relevant for macro-finance models: they
participate in financial markets and they have substantial wealth, with the average respondent
holding more than half a million dollars of assets at Vanguard. The survey has been conducted
every two months since February 2017. In this paper, we study the first 21 survey waves — cov-
ering the period February 2017 to June 2020 — which generated a total of 46,419 responses. Many
individuals responded to multiple survey waves, providing a substantial panel component to the
data. We link survey responses to anonymized administrative data on the respondents’ invest-
ment holdings and transactions at Vanguard. This allows us to explore the relationship between
the elicited beliefs and real-world high-stakes investment behavior. Since Vanguard clients are
potentially more likely to be buy-and-hold investors, whenever possible we confirm that the pat-
terns in our survey data are consistent with the corresponding patterns in other surveys covering
different investor populations.
    Our most general finding is that survey data is highly informative about individuals’ portfolio
decisions. Specifically, we find a robust relationship between beliefs and portfolio allocations, both
across individuals and within individuals over time. In this sense, we conclude that survey-based
evidence is “here to stay,” and that theoretical work has to continue to confront such evidence.
We organize our findings around five facts that highlight empirical patterns about beliefs as well
as their relationships with portfolios. We believe that these facts, which are robust to including
or excluding the period around the March 2020 stock market decline induced by the COVID-19
crisis, can guide future empirical and theoretical work in macro-finance.


                                                  1
    Fact 1 summarizes our main findings on the relationship between beliefs and portfolios. We
first document a statistically strong relationship between beliefs and portfolio composition. How-
ever, the average sensitivity of an investor’s equity share to that investor’s subjective expected
stock return is substantially lower than predicted by benchmark frictionless macro-finance mod-
els. More specifically, we find that a one-percentage-point increase in expected stock returns over
the next year is associated with a 0.7 percentage points higher equity share, which is one order of
magnitude smaller than implied by standard calibrations of the frictionless Merton (1969) model.
We rule out that this relatively low magnitude is primarily the result of attenuation bias from clas-
sical measurement error in beliefs. We also find that the perceived variance of stock returns has
both an economically and statistically weak relationship with portfolios, and that a better measure
of risk is the subjective probability of a large stock market drop (a rare disaster).
    This relatively small response of equity shares to beliefs about stock returns is consistent with
evidence documented across several other studies that link retail investors’ equity market partic-
ipation and equity shares to expected stock returns (e.g., Vissing-Jorgensen, 2003; Dominitz and
Manski, 2007; Kézdi and Willis, 2011; Amromin and Sharpe, 2013; Ameriks et al., 2016). Our con-
tribution to this literature is twofold. First, we use administrative data to confirm this fact for a
large sample of wealthy investors, while accounting for key dimensions of measurement error.
Second, we show that investors are heterogeneous in their sensitivity alongs several economi-
cally interesting dimensions. The sensitivity of portfolios to beliefs is increasing in wealth; it is
also higher in tax-advantaged retail accounts, and increasing in investors’ trading frequency, in-
vestors’ attention to their portfolios, and investors’ confidence in their own beliefs. We find that
an idealized investor who holds a tax-advantaged retail account, pays attention to her portfolio,
trades often, and is confident in her beliefs has a sensitivity that is about three times larger than the
average sensitivity, and gets close to the sensitivities generated by frictionless benchmark models.
    We next investigate the role of belief changes in explaining trading activity. Fact 2 establishes
that an individual’s belief changes have little or no explanatory power for predicting when trading
occurs (the extensive margin), but help explain both the direction and magnitude of trading con-
ditional on a trade occurring (the intensive margin). Our findings are thus consistent with models
of infrequent trading that generate a flat hazard function of trading based on belief changes, with
heterogeneous trading probabilities across people.
    These first two facts are informative about a central element of both rational and behavioral
macro-finance models: the transmission channel from beliefs to portfolio choices. Our results
show that for the average investor, this passthrough is positive but weak, which might dampen
the effects of belief changes on equilibrium prices and quantities in theoretical models. This cau-
tions against commonly used calibrations of many representative agent behavioral models that
use variation in survey-based beliefs to explain asset price movements. Specifically, the variation
in asset demand implied by these models — many of which are based on Mertonian portfolio
demand — is far too high relative to the passthrough from beliefs to portfolios observed in the
data. At the same time, we show that this passthrough is heterogeneous across investors along
economically interesting dimensions. Incorporating this heterogeneity into macro-finance models
should help these models to jointly match data on beliefs, quantities, and asset prices.


                                                   2
    We next decompose the variation in beliefs across individuals and over time. Fact 3 estab-
lishes that individual beliefs are mostly characterized by heterogeneous and persistent individual
fixed effects: some individuals are optimistic and some are pessimistic, and their beliefs are per-
sistent and far apart. While there is some co-movement in beliefs across individuals over time, the
time variation in average beliefs only accounts for about 5% of the total variation in beliefs in the
panel. Instead, between 40% and 60% of all panel variation in beliefs is captured by individual
fixed effects, while the rest is due to idiosyncratic individual variation and measurement error. We
also find that the heterogeneity in beliefs is not well explained by observable respondent charac-
teristics such as gender, age, wealth, attention, confidence, past returns, and geographic location.
These characteristics sometimes have strong statistical relationships with beliefs, but their joint
explanatory power is limited. We provide evidence that this is not the result of measurement er-
ror in eliciting beliefs. Instead, a likely explanation is that individual beliefs reflect a combination
of many demographic characteristics and experiences, without a single dominant explanation.
    Fact 3 provides a simple but powerful description of the panel variation of investor beliefs:
investors disagree strongly and persistently about expected cash flows and returns. This con-
trasts with much of the existing literature that builds on survey evidence on beliefs, which has
focused on representative agent models disciplined by matching the time-series behavior of aver-
age beliefs. This approach misses a more prominent feature of the data, the persistent individual
heterogeneity. As a result, models that explicitly feature heterogenous agents with different beliefs
are likely to offer a fruitful starting point for future work. Indeed, incorporating persistent belief
heterogeneity into macro-finance models is not only a way to better match the survey evidence,
but might also allow for interesting model dynamics, for example coming from the redistribution
of wealth between optimists and pessimists as shocks are realized.
    We next explore how beliefs about different objects correlate. Fact 4 establishes that higher
expectations of GDP growth are associated with higher expectations of future stock returns, at
both short and long horizons. In the cross-section, investors who expect higher cash flow growth
also tend to expect higher returns. In the time series, when an investor becomes more optimistic
about cash flow growth, she also becomes more optimistic about expected returns. The correla-
tion between expected returns and cash flow growth is an informative moment for macro-finance
analysis. Indeed, the Campbell and Shiller (1988) decomposition shows that expected cash-flow
growth and expected returns have opposite effects on current valuations. Models that specify
belief dynamics for one process (either cash flows or returns) imply equilibrium beliefs about the
other process, and our work can be used to verify whether the resulting joint distribution of beliefs
is qualitatively and quantitatively consistent with the data.
    Fact 5 establishes that when individuals perceive large stock market declines to be more likely,
they also expect stock returns to be lower. This relationship holds both across individuals and
within individuals over time. This finding relates to an important strand of the macro-finance
literature, which has emphasized that expectations of rare but potentially catastrophic events, so-
called rare disasters, can help explain portfolio holdings and asset prices (see Rietz, 1988; Barro,
2006; Gabaix, 2012). Our results are consistent with versions of the rare disaster framework, like
the model by Chen, Joslin and Tran (2012), that allow for heterogeneous beliefs about disaster

probabilities and a willingness of investors to “agree to disagree.”
    We conclude this introduction by summarizing the desired characteristics of a model that
would be consistent with our five facts. This represents just one way one could write such a
model, based on our evidence, rather than the only possible model. The proposed model would
have three key ingredients: (i) large and highly persistent heterogeneity in beliefs about both
expected returns and cash flows, with the two beliefs positively related, (ii) a willingness to “agree
to disagree” that allows for trading based on disagreement, and (iii) infrequent trading with an
exogenous probability of trading that differs across agents. It is an interesting open question how
well such a model would perform in quantitatively matching aggregate asset prices in addition to
the main features of beliefs and portfolios documented in this paper.
    Related Literature. Our paper contributes to a growing literature that focuses on exploring
the role of beliefs in explaining a large number of economic outcomes (see DellaVigna, 2009; Ben-
jamin, 2018, for a review). In this literature, Manski (2004) was among the first and most prominent
to argue for using survey data about expected equity returns and risks to better understand indi-
viduals’ investment behaviors. Over time, a series of papers has connected survey expectations
to the behavior of respondents. For example, Ameriks et al. (2015a,b, 2016, 2017, 2018) have pro-
vided recent advances by linking survey evidence to retirement choices. As part of this agenda,
Ameriks et al. (2016) find a low sensitivity of retail investors’ equity investment to stock market
expectations, a fact also documented by Vissing-Jorgensen (2003), Dominitz and Manski (2007),
Kézdi and Willis (2009, 2011), Amromin and Sharpe (2013), Arrondel, Calvo Pardo and Tas (2014),
Merkle and Weber (2014), Choi and Robertson (2018) and Drerup, Enke and Von Gaudecker (2017),
with related work by Hurd, Van Rooij and Winter (2011), Hudomiet, Kézdi and Willis (2011) and
De Marco, Macchiavelli and Valchev (2018). Our work builds on this literature by exploring a
quantitative survey of a large panel of wealthy investors, which is matched to administrative data
on these investors’ portfolios and trading behaviors. Our survey, which was designed to inform
theoretical models, allows us to discover new facts and deepen our understanding of existing
patterns, both quantitatively and in terms of their variation across individuals and over time.
    We also contribute to a macro-finance literature that has debated the tradeoffs between behav-
ioral and rational modeling approaches, with survey evidence providing an important input (see
Cochrane, 2011, 2017; Greenwood and Shleifer, 2014; Adam, Matveev and Nagel, 2018). Among
the many proposed equilibrium models, the most relevant for our work are those that directly
incorporate survey evidence (e.g., Barberis et al., 2015; Adam, Marcet and Beutel, 2017; Bhandari,
Borovička and Ho, 2016) and those that feature heterogeneous belief (e.g., Scheinkman and Xiong,
2003; Geanakoplos, 2010; Caballero and Simsek, 2017; Martin and Papadimitriou, 2019).
    Our work also relates to a literature that has explored the role of beliefs in other settings. For
example, in the housing market (e.g., Piazzesi and Schneider, 2009; Case, Shiller and Thompson,
2012; Cheng, Raina and Xiong, 2014; Kuchler and Zafar, 2015; Burnside, Eichenbaum and Rebelo,
2016; Glaeser and Nathanson, 2017; Adelino, Schoar and Severino, 2018) as well as the role of firm
expectations (e.g., Cummins, Hassett and Oliner, 2006; Bacchetta, Mertens and Van Wincoop, 2009;
Coibion and Gorodnichenko, 2012; Gennaioli, Ma and Shleifer, 2016; Landier, Ma and Thesmar,
2017; Bachmann et al., 2018; Bordalo et al., 2018; García-Schmidt and Woodford, 2019; Fuhrer,


                                                  4
2018). A further related literature has explored how individuals with different political convictions
respond to political events (see Mian, Sufi and Khoshkhou, 2015; Kempf and Tsoutsoura, 2018;
Meeuwis et al., 2018).


                                       I    S URVEY D ESCRIPTION
To explore the structure of investors’ beliefs and their relationship with investors’ portfolio allo-
cations, we study a new online survey of U.S.-based individual investors who hold accounts at
Vanguard, one of the world’s largest asset management firms with more than $6 trillion in assets
under management. We refer to this survey as the GMSU-Vanguard survey in the rest of this
paper. We first provide a high-level overview of the survey questions (we report the exact phras-
ing and the survey interface in the Appendix). We then explore the survey sample, the response
rates, and the demographics of respondents and non-respondents, which allow us to analyze the
dimensions of selection into responding.

I.A    Survey Design
The survey includes questions on three broad topics: expected stock market returns, expected
GDP growth rates, and expected bond returns. The survey implementation randomizes whether
individuals were first asked about their expectations of stock returns or their expectations of GDP
growth rates. The questions on bond returns are always asked last.

Expected Stock Market Returns. The survey asks respondents about their expectations for the
return of the U.S. stock market. It elicits point estimates for the expected annualized returns over
the coming year and the coming ten years. It also elicits subjective probabilities that the return over
the next year would fall into one of five buckets: less than -30%, between -30% and -10%, between
-10% and 30%, between 30% and 40%, and more than 40%.1 The ordering of the buckets (i.e.,
lowest to highest or highest to lowest) is randomized across survey respondents, and the survey
enforces that the assigned probabilities add up to 100%. As shown in the Appendix, the survey
interface also presents real-time histograms of the survey responses as they are entered, which
helps individuals visualize the probability distributions implied by their numerical answers.

Expected Real GDP Growth Rates. The survey also asks respondents about their expectations
for the annualized growth rate of real GDP. It elicits point estimates for the expected growth rates
over the coming three years and the coming ten years. It also elicites subjective probabilities that
the annualized GDP growth rate over the coming three years would fall into one of five buckets:
less than -3%, between -3% and 0%, between 0% and 3%, between 3% and 9%, and more than
9%.2 The ordering of buckets (i.e., lowest to highest or highest to lowest) is randomized across
respondents.
    1 These buckets were chosen such that the tails correspond to extreme events that still have substantial probability

mass based on historical frequency. Between 1927 and 2014, the share of 1-year stock returns in each bucket was: 3.7%
(lowest bucket), 11.6% (second bucket), 65.9% (third bucket), 13.8% (fourth bucket), and 5% (highest bucket).
    2 Between 1929 and 2015, the share of annualized U.S. real three-year GDP growth in each bucket was: 4.2% (lowest

bucket), 5.4% (second bucket), 33.3% (third bucket), 50.8% (fourth bucket), and 6.3% (highest bucket).




                                                           5
Expected Bond Returns. The final block of questions elicits respondents’ expectations about the
1-year return of a 10-year U.S. government zero coupon bond.3

Difficulty and Confidence. At the end of every block of questions (i.e., about expected stock
returns, expected GDP growth, and expected bond returns), the survey asks individuals how con-
fident they are about their answers (on a five-point scale from “not at all confident” to “extremely
confident”), and how difficult they found the questions (on a five-point scale from “not at all
difficult” to “extremely difficult”).

I.B    Survey Sample and Response Rate
The online survey is conducted every two months by Vanguard among its U.S.-based individual
customers. In this paper, we explore the first 21 waves of the survey, covering February 2017 to
June 2020. In the first wave, 40, 000 clients were invited by email to participate in the survey. These
clients were randomly selected such that 80% of the sample were retail investors and 20% were
investors in defined contribution plans.4 Overall, the sample of individuals who are potentially
contacted represents about $2 trillion in assets. If individuals respond to the survey in any wave,
they are recontacted in each subsequent wave. Individuals who do not respond to the first wave
in which they are contacted are recontacted for two subsequent waves. If they respond in neither
of these waves, they are dropped from the sample. Individuals can opt out of the study at any
point and are, in this case, never contacted again. In the second wave, an additional 25, 000 clients
were invited to participate (in addition to those carried over from wave 1). Waves 3 to 5 invited
13, 000 new clients each; from wave 6 onward, the number of new clients contacted in each wave
increased to 14, 500.

Response Rates. The left panel of Figure I shows the response rates for the first 21 waves, where
we count only fully completed surveys as “responses.” The orange-circle line shows that the
response rates among individuals contacted for the first time were relatively stable at 2.5%-4%
across waves. The response rates among individuals who were previously contacted but had not
yet responded, given by the blue-diamond line, were between 1% and 2% across waves. The
green-square line shows the response rates among individuals who had responded to at least one
previous survey. The steady-state re-response rate of these individuals is between 10% and 15%.
It declines somewhat over time, though much of this decline is driven by compositional effects: in
later survey waves, the average time since the last response of individuals who have previously
responded is higher. These response rates translate into more than 2, 000 survey responses on
average per wave. Across the 21 waves, we received 46, 419 total responses.
      The right panel of Figure I shows the number of responses in each wave, split out by how
many overall survey waves the respondents participated in. Overall, about 25% of responses
come from individuals who have responded to one survey only (though some of these may end
up responding to future survey waves). Over 40% of responses come from individuals who have
responded to at least four survey waves, and more than 25% come from individuals who have
    3 A last question also elicits expectations about future yield curves;
                                                                         we do not use this question in the current paper.
    4 Additional
               requirements to be potentially invited to take the survey are that clients: (i) had opted into receiving
account statements via email, (ii) were older than 21 years, and (iii) had total Vanguard assets of at least $10,000.

Note: Figure shows the responses to the GMSU-Vanguard Survey in each of the 21 waves between February 2017 and
June 2020. The left panel shows response rates. The orange line (circles) shows the response rates for individuals
contacted for the first time. The blue line (diamonds) shows the response rates for individuals that were contacted in
previous waves, but who had not yet responded. The green line (squares) shows the response rates for individuals
who had previously responded. The right panel shows the number of responses per wave. It splits out responses that
come from individuals who only respond to one of the waves, from individuals who respond to two or three waves,
and from individuals who respond to at least four waves.


Demographics of Respondents. Table I presents summary statistics on the demographics, portfo-
lio composition, and trading behavior of the survey respondents as well as the non-respondents.
The average survey respondent is about 60 years old, while 69% of respondents are male. Respon-
dents hold assets with an average value of $520k at Vanguard, while the 10-90 percentile range of
assets held at Vanguard is $23k to $1.3m. The average respondent logs into her Vanguard account
about 3.7 times a month, has 1.5 active trades per month, and turns over 2.3% of her portfolio ev-
ery month. Activity on the Vanguard site, both in terms of log-ins and in terms of trading activity,
varies across survey respondents. At the 10th percentile of the distribution, respondents spend es-
sentially no time on the Vanguard site, while at the 90th percentile of the distribution, respondents
log in every third day. The average respondent has 7.2 unique assets in her portfolio, and holds
67.5% of her portfolio in equity, 20.9% in fixed income assets, and 10.1% in cash.5 There are sub-
stantial differences in portfolio allocations across our survey respondents. At the 10th percentile
of the distribution, the equity share is 30.8%, while at the 90th percentile, it is 99.9%.

Sample Selection. Like in all surveys, the sample of respondents is likely selected on a number of
dimensions. We explore two types of selection: (i) selection into who is a Vanguard client, and (ii)
selection into which Vanguard clients answer the survey.
                We first compare the characteristics of respondents and non-respondents. Table I shows that
survey respondents are older and more likely to be male than non-respondents. Respondents
    5 The CUSIP-level information on individual security holdings is matched with information from Morningstar for

mutual funds to calculate the portfolio share held in equities, fixed income instruments, cash, and other investments.
Investments in mutual funds are apportioned depending on the portfolio composition of each fund (e.g., 60% equity
and 40% fixed income). Cash includes cash-equivalent investments such as money-market funds. The category "other
investments" includes alternative investments such as commodities, real estate, and derivatives.

Note: Table shows summary statistics on both the survey respondents and non-respondents. Age, gender, location,

variables are presented as monthly averages between January 2017 and June 2019.


are also substantially wealthier, with average wealth held at Vanguard of $520k for respondents
relative to $254k for non-respondents. Respondents trade more frequently and their monthly
portfolio turnover is larger; they also log into their Vanguard accounts more frequently than non-
respondents.6 Portfolio allocations of respondents and non-respondents are relatively similar,
though the average respondent holds more unique assets. Overall, our sample over-represents
individuals who are wealthier and who trade more often, and whose beliefs are thus more likely
to affect asset prices.
     We also analyze whether Vanguard clients are similar to the overall pool of retail investors.
One concern is that Vanguard’s investment philosophy of focusing on passive and low-fee in-
vestments attracts a selected sample of investors. Indeed, there are some differences between
Vanguard clients and other retail investors. For example, Cogent Wealth Reports (2018) compared
Vanguard retail clients to a representative sample of investors with at least $100k in investable
assets. Vanguard clients were more likely to be older and richer than the comparison sample; they
also held a larger portfolio share in risky assets and a larger share in passive-like instruments.
These differences, however, do not mean that our sample is uninteresting or not quantitatively rel-
   6 Responding to the survey does not involve respondents logging into their Vanguard accounts; the process of

answering the survey does therefore not lead to a mechanical increase in log-ins.

evant. Vanguard manages more than $6trn in investments (with the potential survey respondents
holding around $2trn), so the investors targeted in our study own a non-trivial fraction of global
investable wealth. With the rising popularity of low-fee investment strategies, our sample is also
likely to become even more relevant to understanding investments and asset prices. In addition,
while there are some notable differences in characteristics between Vanguard investors and retail
investors more generally, the two investor groups are similar on other important dimensions.
      First, we compare the trading intensity of the survey respondents to the trading intensity
observed in other investor samples studied in the literature. A recent paper by Meeuwis et al.
(2018) analyzes typical retirement investors at a “large U.S. financial institution” that is not Van-
guard; they report that 29.5% of those investors made an active trade in the past year.7 In our
sample, which comprises both retail and retirement accounts, 67% of non-respondents and 78% of
respondents made at least one active trade in the year 2017. We conclude that despite Vanguard’s
focus on passive buy-and-hold strategies, individuals in our sample do not appear to trade less
frequently than representative retail investors at other firms.8
      Second, we explore whether Vanguard investors are less likely than other investors to fol-
low a “flow-performance” pattern, whereby they increase their positions in mutual funds that
just experienced high returns (see Coval and Stafford, 2007). Appendix A.2 shows that the flow-
performance sensitivity in the population of all investors in Vanguard funds as well as in the pop-
ulation of investors that respond to our survey is very similar to the flow-performance sensitivity
documented in the literature.
      Third, Appendix A.3 shows that the level and time-series variation in our survey responses
are similar to those from other surveys that target different investor populations during the same
period. Ultimately, it is a worthy pursuit for the future literature to extend our results to other
contexts and investors populations to explore possible sources of interesting heterogeneity.

I.C    Survey Responses: Summary Statistics
Table II shows summary statistics across the 46, 419 survey responses; Appendix A.4 presents the
full distribution of the responses to the key questions.9 The average respondent takes about 8.5
   7 Meeuwis    et al. (2018) report that their data “contains the characteristics and individual portfolio holdings of
millions of anonymized households covering trillions of dollars in investable wealth.” Their research focuses on a
sub-sample that is “representative of ‘typical’ American investors with retirement saving”, a group that holds 41% of
household investable wealth in the United States.
    8 On the other hand, we would expect that some of our results might not generalize to a broader set of investors.

For example, clients at brokerage firms that target day-traders or professional hedge funds are likely to have higher
portfolio turnover. Indeed, Barber and Odean (2000) document the trading behavior of about 80,000 investors at a
“large discount brokerage firm” in the United States, and find that the median person in their sample has a portfolio
turnover of about 2.7% per month, relative to 0.91% in our sample.
    9 Even among the respondents who completed the entire survey flow, some respondents skipped a few questions.

We verified that restricting our analysis to the sample of respondents who provided answers to every question does
not affect our conclusions. We also explored the presence of extreme outlier responses, such as individuals reporting
that the expected return on the U.S. stock market over the coming year was 400% or -100%. Since such outliers have
extreme effects on the analysis, in our baseline analysis we set extreme outlier answers (below the bottom percentile,
and above the top percentile) for each unbounded expectation question equal to missing. It is often the case that the
same individuals report multiple answers outside the accepted ranges. Naturally, there are some critical judgment
calls with selecting these cutoffs, which involve trading off retaining true extreme beliefs with excluding answers from
individuals who probably misunderstood the question or the units. We have done extensive sensitivity analysis to
confirm that our results are robust to a wide range of choices for the cutoff values. We also confirmed that the results



                                                           9
minutes to answer all survey questions. The 10-90 percentile range for the total time to respond is
3.9 minutes to 13.5 minutes. Therefore, all respondents spend a sizable amount of time answering
the questions, rather than carelessly clicking through the survey; this is consistent with the non-
compensated nature of the survey requiring a certain intrinsic interest from participants.

Note: Table shows summary statistics of the answers across responses to the first 21 waves of the GMSU-Vanguard
survey. The possible answers for "difficulty" are 1 = "Not at all difficult", 2 = "Not very difficult", 3 = "Somewhat
difficult", 4 = "Very difficult", 5 = "Extremely difficult." The possible answers for confidence are 1 = "Not at all confident",
2 = "Not very confident", 3 = "Somewhat confident", 4 = "Very confident", and 5 = "Extremely confident."


     The average expected 1-year stock market return is 4.64%, while the average annualized ex-
pected 10-year stock market return is 6.64%. There is substantial heterogeneity in the expected
1-year stock market return across responses. At the 10th percentile of the distribution, individuals
reported a 1-year expected stock return of -1%, while at the 90th percentile, they expected a return
of 10%. The across-responses standard deviation of expected 1-year returns is 6.08%, much larger
are robust to winsorizing extreme answers rather than setting them equal to missing, and to dropping all answers of
individuals who report extreme answers to at least one question.

than the standard deviation of expectations of annualized 10-year returns, which is 3.85%. This
suggests that individuals anticipate some medium-run mean reversion in stock returns. When
we ask individuals about their expectations of annualized GDP growth, the means for the next
three years and the next ten years are quite similar at 2.77% and 3.15%, respectively. The average
respondent expected 1-year returns of 10-year U.S. Treasury zero coupon bonds to be 1.74%, with
a 10-90 percentile range across respondents of -1% to 4%.
      Table II also shows that respondents put substantial probabilities on relatively large short-run
stock market declines and GDP declines. The average individual assigns a 5.3% chance to the
1-year return of the stock market being less than -30%, while the median respondent assigns a 3%
chance to such an event. As with the other answers, there is substantial across-answer heterogene-
ity. Answers at the 25th percentile of the distribution correspond to a 0% chance of returns lower
than -30%, while those at the 90th percentile of the distribution correspond to a 10% probability of
such events. Similarly, in the case of GDP growth, individuals assign an average probability of an
annualized decline in GDP of more than 3% over the coming three years of 4.9%.
      Most individuals report finding the survey questions relatively easy to understand, though
the questions on bond returns were perceived to be more difficult than the questions on expected
stock market returns and expected GDP growth. There also appears to be a relatively wide range
of confidence that individuals have in their answers. For each of the three survey blocks, individ-
uals at the 10th percentile of the distribution report being “not very confident” in their answers,
while individuals at the 90th percentile reported being “very confident.”


                                  II    B ELIEFS AND P ORTFOLIOS
In this section, we analyze the relationship between respondents’ beliefs and their portfolio alloca-
tions. In the main body of the paper, we explore the role of expectations about 1-year stock returns
in determining equity shares. In Appendix A.6, we analyze the role of other moments of the belief
distribution (e.g., beliefs about the probability of large stock market declines), the role of stock
market expectations over longer horizons, and the role of beliefs about bond returns and GDP
growth. To estimate the sensitivity of equity shares to beliefs, we run the following regression:

(1)                         EquitySharei,t = α + β Ei,t [ R1y ] + γXi,t + ψt + ei,t .

The unit of observation is a survey response by individual i in wave t. The dependent variable is
the equity share in the individual’s Vanguard portfolio at time t. Since most Vanguard investors
find it hard to short-sell or obtain leverage, the equity share is essentially censored at both 0% and
100%. We thus estimate regression 1 using tobit models. The coefficient β captures the increase in
an individual’s equity share for each percentage point increase in the expected 1-year stock return.
      Column 1 of Table III shows estimates from this regression without controlling for any addi-
tional covariates. An extra percentage point of expected 1-year stock returns is associated with a
0.67 percentage point increase in respondents’ equity shares.10 In column 2 of Table III, we control
  10 Appendix A.6 shows that about half of the increase in equity shares of individuals who expect higher stock market

returns comes from substituting away from cash rather than substituting away from fixed income securities.

Note: Table shows results from regression 1. The unit of observation is a survey response. The dependent variable

wave. For the interaction specifications in columns 4, 7, and 8, we also include dummy variables for the respondent

for demographic characteristics such as age, gender, wealth, and region of residence, as well as
survey-wave fixed effects. Figure II shows a conditional binscatter plot of the resulting relation-
ship between expected returns and equity shares. The estimated sensitivity of portfolio shares
to beliefs is similar to that in column 1.11 Given the wide heterogeneity in beliefs across indi-
viduals, our estimates imply substantial belief-driven variation in equity shares: quantitatively, a
one-standard-deviation increase in expected 1-year stock returns is associated with a 0.16 standard
deviation increase in equity shares.12
       Figure II suggests that the estimated relationship between beliefs and portfolios might be sen-
sitive to beliefs at the two extremes. Therefore, we next run regression 1 on a sample of respon-
dents that report expected returns between 0% and 15%. This drops about 10% of our responses.
Column 3 of Table III shows that the sensitivity estimate in this restricted specification is almost
70% higher, suggesting that outliers have some effect on the relationship.
    11 Whilethe estimates of β are the primary object of interest, the coefficients on the control variables are also inter-
esting. Males and females do not have significantly different equity shares. Equity shares are strongly declining in age,
with individuals above 70 years of age having about 20 percentage points lower equity share than individuals below
the age of 40. Equity shares also do not differ significantly across regions, and are only weakly declining with wealth.
   12 In Appendix A.6 we explore the effect of other moments of the belief distribution on equity shares. We find that

the subjective risk of large stock market declines has a more significant effect on portfolio allocations than the subjective
variance. We also show that long-run stock market beliefs matter in addition to short-run beliefs, and highlight that
beliefs about other investments, including fixed income investments, also influence the optimal equity share. Expected

      To highlight the economic magnitude of the estimated β-coefficient, we perform a back-of-the-
envelope calculation using the Merton (1969) model, which shows that for power-utility investors:


                                                                                     1 Ei [ R] − R f
(2)                                                       EquitySharei,t =                           .
                                                                                     γ Vari [ R]

Here, γ is the individual’s coefficient of relative risk aversion, Ei [ R] is the individual’s expected
stock return, R f is the risk-free rate, and Vari [ R] is the individual’s subjective variance of equity
returns. We measure EquitySharei,t in the Vanguard data, and Ei [ R] with the survey answer to 1-
year expected stock returns. For the back-of-the-envelope calculation, we assume that individuals
have a common measure of the variance Vari [ R] = Var [ R].13 Similarly, we assume a common and
constant coefficient of relative risk aversion. In this simplified setting, the β estimated in Table III
                                       1
corresponds to β =                   γVar [ R]
                                               .   The historical standard deviation of stock market returns is around
20% a year. The simple model thus implies that a β of 0.69 requires a coefficient of relative risk
aversion of γ = 36. This is considerably higher than most estimates in the experimental literature,
which usually finds values of γ between 3 and 10. To obtain a realistic coefficient of relative risk
aversion, let us say around 4, we would need an estimate of β of around 6.25; for γ = 6, we would
require β = 4.2. In other words, the sensitivity estimated in column 2 is an order of magnitude
too small to align with the simplest frictionless model.14 This relatively small response of equity

GDP growth does not appear to significantly affect the equity share once we control for expected stock returns.
   13 In Appendix A.6, we relax this assumption and measure the variance of 1-year expected stock returns that is

implied by the distribution question; this does not affect the estimated effect of changes in expected equity returns
on equity shares. We find the simple calculation with a common variance across individuals parameterized to the
historical variance to be appealing for several reasons: (i) in many models, it is easy to learn the variance of returns
but hard to learn the mean; (ii) equation 2 is particularly sensitive to measurement errors in the denominator; and (iii)
model misspecification is likely and other moments (e.g., tail event probabilities) may also be important.
   14 Note that in this model, γ drives both the sensitivity of the equity portfolio share to changes in expected returns




                                                                                13
shares to beliefs about stock returns is consistent with evidence documented across a number of
other studies that link measures of equity market participation and equity shares to expected stock
market returns (e.g., Vissing-Jorgensen, 2003; Dominitz and Manski, 2007; Kézdi and Willis, 2011;
Amromin and Sharpe, 2013; Ameriks et al., 2016; Drerup, Enke and Von Gaudecker, 2017).
     In many models, asset prices are driven by wealth-weighted beliefs, rather than beliefs that
are equally weighted across all investors. We thus explore whether the sensitivity of portfolios to
beliefs is different for wealthier individuals. Column 4 of Table III shows that respondents with
more than $225k in assets — which corresponds to our sample median — have a sensitivity that is
marginally larger than that of individuals with lower wealth; in unreported results, we find that
the sensitivity does not increase substantially for even higher levels of wealth. These results show
that even the wealth-weighted sensitivity would not be large enough to generate the quantity
movements implied by Mertonian portfolio demand.
     One natural question concerns the extent to which our findings are driven by the large drop
and subsequent recovery of the stock market resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic in the first
half of 2020.15 As we show below, following the stock market crash of March 2020, average beliefs
in the April 2020 wave fell dramatically, and had only partially recovered by the June 2020 wave.
In column 5 of Table III, we restrict our analysis to the first 19 waves of the GMSU-Vanguard
survey, ending near the all-time high of the S&P 500 in February 2020. The estimated sensitivity of
portfolios to beliefs over this period, which generally saw rising stock prices, is somewhat higher,
with a β ≈ 0.82. This finding suggests that the substantial decline in expected returns following
the crash was associated with only a modest active reduction in equity shares (see also Giglio
et al., 2020). However, even the somewhat higher elasticity during the relatively calm period
in the stock market between February 2017 and February 2020 remains substantially below that
implied by the frictionless model. This results highlights that the weak estimated relationship
between beliefs and portfolios is not primarily the result of the large stock market crash during
our sample. Indeed, Appendix A.12 highlights that all results in this paper are robust to both
including and excluding the COVID-19 stock market crash in the sample.
     There are a number of possible explanations for this relatively low estimated average sensitiv-
ity of equity shares to expected stock returns. The first set of explanations involves measurement
error in the key measure of beliefs, Ei,t [ R1y ], and the associated attenuation bias that such mea-
surement error would entail. The second set of explanations centers around possible frictions in
the transmission of beliefs to portfolios. Indeed, the Merton (1969) model is based on a number of
strong assumptions, including that investors continuously pay attention to their portfolios, that
they continuously rebalance them, that they are confident in their beliefs, and that there are no
other frictions to trading, such as the tax implications from realizing capital gains.16 Any devia-
as well as the unconditional level of the equity share. In particular, for γ = 4, an average risk premium of 6%, and a
standard deviation of 20%, we obtain an average equity share of 38%. When γ = 30, the equity share drops to 5%. This
means that high risk aversion can explain the low sensitivity of portfolios to beliefs, but at the cost of grossly missing
the average level of the equity portfolio share.
   15 After one of the longest and most pronounced stock market booms on record during 2009-2019, the U.S. stock

market experienced a sudden crash starting on Monday, February 24th, following increasingly negative news about
the COVID-19 pandemic. On March 23, the S&P 500 reached its lowest point at 34% below the February peak, before
recovering to about 8% below the peak by the time of the June 2020 wave of the GMSU-Vanguard survey.
   16 Another possible set of alternative explanations falls under the category of “optimists take risks outside of Van-



                                                           14
tion of investor behavior from these assumptions suggests that the high sensitivity in the Merton
(1969) model is likely to be an upper bound for real world applications.

II.A    Possible Explanation I: Measurement Error
We start by exploring whether measurement error can account for the relatively low estimated
average sensitivity of portfolio allocations to beliefs. A first possible explanation is that classical
measurement error in beliefs may induce attenuation bias in our estimates of β.17 To deal with
such measurement error, we exploit the fact that, from each survey response, we obtain two sepa-
rate estimates of the same explanatory variable, Ei,t [ R1y ]. The first measure is the expected return
as reported directly by the survey respondents. The second measure is the implied mean of the
distribution over possible returns reported by each respondent.18 The correlation across the two
measures is 0.49, and the different elicitation methods likely have measurement errors that are not
perfectly correlated. This setting thus allows us to exploit recent advances from the econometrics
literature on instrumental variables (IV) approaches to reduce the bias from measurement error.
     In principle, the attenuation bias from classical measurement error could be addressed by
instrumenting for one of the estimates of expected return with the other, though there is no the-
oretical guidance as to which estimate should be the instrumented variable and which should be
the instrument. Our approach follows the Obviously Related Instrumental Variables (ORIV) strat-
egy proposed by Gillen, Snowberg and Yariv (2019), which consolidates the information from
these different formulations to provide an estimator that is more efficient than either of the two IV
strategies alone. Column 6 of Table III shows that this ORIV approach increases the estimated sen-
sitivity by more than 70% relative to column 2, to β = 1.18. Classical measurement error, therefore,
accounts for a non-trivial component of the low sensitivity. This finding highlights the value for
future surveys to include various ways of eliciting the same beliefs, thereby allowing researchers
to use ORIV techniques to reduce the attenuation bias associated with measurement error that is
imperfectly correlated across elicitation methods.
     Nevertheless, even the sensitivity obtained by using ORIV techniques remains far below that
implied by the frictionless Merton (1969) model. In this light, it is important to emphasize that if
measurement error is positively correlated across the two elicitations, something that is not un-
likely in our setting, then instrumented coefficients will still be biased downward, although less so
than without instrumenting. We next take a number of steps to determine whether such correlated
guard portfolios.” For example, more optimistic respondents might have other accounts, at a different firm, and pre-
dominantly take risks in those accounts. Such an explanation is inconsistent with the evidence in Ameriks et al. (2016),
who field a survey to show that equity shares observed in the Vanguard data are quite representative of equity shares
across Vanguard users’ wider range of accounts. The same study also helps mitigate the concern that more optimistic re-
spondents might be more risk averse: that survey observes one cross-section of both expected returns and risk-aversion
(elicited via lottery-type questions) and concludes that risk-aversion heterogeneity is not sufficient to explain the low
estimated average sensitivity of portfolios to beliefs.
    17 We refer to classical measurement error as the concern that the reported belief is a noisy measure of individuals’

true beliefs, Ei,t [ R1y ] = Ei,t [ R1y ] True + ei,t , where ei,t represents i.i.d. and mean zero measurement error.
    18 To construct the implied mean from the distribution, we first compute, for each bucket, the average historical

return conditional on the return being in that bucket, and then we weight these estimates by the subjective probabilities
of each bucket reported by the respondent. Our results are unchanged if we take the mid-points of the buckets, and
assign a value of -40% for the lowest open-ended bucket (expected 1-year stock returns ≤ −30%) and a value of 50%
for the highest open-ended bucket (expected 1-year stock returns ≥ 40%).

measurement error explains a substantial part of the remaining gap between our estimates and the
predictions from frictionless models. In the end, we find it unlikely that correlated measurement
error is an important contributor to the low estimated sensitivity. Instead, we find that frictions in
the transmission of beliefs to portfolios explain much of the remaining gap between our estimates
and the quantitative predictions of the frictionless benchmark model.
    To further explore the role of measurement error, we next analyze the hypothesis that the time
spent by individuals to answer the questions may allow us to identify individuals who are more
or less subject to various types of measurement error. Column 7 of Table III shows that we obtain
similar estimates of the sensitivity among people in the top and bottom halves of the time-spent
distribution. Similarly, in unreported results we find that cutting out the top and bottom 10% of
the time-spent distribution has little effect on the estimated sensitivity.
    We also investigate whether beliefs that are elicited close to when people trade are less noisy
and, therefore, more closely related to respondents’ portfolios. This test is motivated by the model
of Azeredo da Silveira and Woodford (2019), which predicts that beliefs should be most closely
aligned with portfolios just before an agent trades. Column 8 of Table III shows that respondents
who traded in the four weeks around the survey date have a higher sensitivity of beliefs to portfo-
lios, a feature we will explore more extensively in the following section. However, the coefficients
are estimated with substantial measurement error and do not allow us to determine with any pre-
cision whether individuals who traded the week before versus the week after the survey have a
differential sensitivity of portfolios to beliefs.19

II.B      Possible Explanation II: Heterogeneous Frictions
We next show that deviations from the frictionless benchmark model of Merton (1969) can help
us account for much of the remaining difference between our estimates and the predictions from
that model.
Capital Gains Taxes. A first friction that can reduce the passthrough from changes in beliefs to
portfolios is the presence of capital gains taxes that can arise in the rebalancing process. To test for
the importance of this friction, we exploit that some survey respondents have both standard and
tax-advantaged individually-managed accounts. Columns 1 and 2 of Table IV focus on these indi-
viduals, thus controlling for potential differences in individuals’ preferences such as their aversion
to realize gains and losses. In column 1, we study the equity share in their standard retail accounts,
while in column 2, we focus on the equity share in their tax-advantaged retail accounts (usually
IRAs). We find that, for the same individuals, the equity share in the tax-advantaged accounts
is more aligned with the individuals’ beliefs than the equity share in the standard brokerage ac-
counts. This evidence suggests that capital gains taxes can be an important friction that inhibits
the transmission of beliefs to portfolios relative to the predictions from frictionless models.
Default Options in Defined Contribution Plans. As described in Section I, our survey sam-
ple includes investors holding two types of tax-advantaged accounts: individually-managed tax-
advantaged retirement accounts and employer-sponsored retirement accounts such as defined
contribution plans (though very few investors hold both types of accounts). Investments in the
  19 We   also do not find evidence of an increase in the probability of trading following the survey.

Note: Table shows results from regression 1, estimated using ORIV. The dependent variable is the equity share. In
column 1 it is the equity share in individually-managed retail accounts, in column 2 it is the equity share in individually-
managed tax-advantaged retail accounts, and in column 3 it is the equity share in institutionally-managed retirement
plans (defined contribution plans). In columns 5-6, it is pooled across the three types of accounts, while column 4
uses data from both types of retail accounts only. The sample in columns 1 and 2 is restricted to respondents holding
both types of retail accounts. In column 6, ”low confidence” corresponds to individuals who reported being ”not at all
confident” or ”not very confident” in their answers about expected stock returns; ”medium confidence” corresponds to
individuals who report being ”somewhat confident” or ”very confident” about their answers; and ”high confidence”
corresponds to individuals who report being ”extremely confident.” ”Idealized" respondents in column 7 are those
whose behavior most closely corresponds to that of the assumptions in the frictionless model: they have average
monthly portfolio turnover of at least 4%, they have at least seven log-ins a month, and they report to be extremely
confident in their beliefs. For the interaction specifications in columns 4, 5, and 6, we also include dummy variables for
the respondent characteristics that we estimate the sensitivity for. Standard errors are clustered at the respondent level.

first account usually represent an active decision of the investor. Within defined contribution
plans, it is increasingly common to automatically enroll employees at prespecified contribution
rates and into prespecified assets.20 A robust empirical finding is that these default investments
are very sticky (e.g., Madrian and Shea, 2001; Beshears et al., 2009). Among Vanguard investors,
Clark, Utkus and Young (2015) found that 89% of participants under automatic enrollment re-
mained 100% invested in the default option after 12 months. Many investors in defined contribu-
tion plans thus appear to make relatively few active portfolio allocation decisions that could reflect
their beliefs. Consistent with this, comparing columns 2 and 3 of Table IV shows that the average
sensitivity of portfolios to beliefs in institutionally-managed defined contribution plans is some-
what smaller than it is in individually-managed tax-advantaged accounts, though the differences
are not statistically significant. This suggests a role for another deviation from the assumption of
the frictionless benchmark model, namely that a substantial amount of wealth is invested through
sticky default options rather than through active allocations.

Infrequent Trading. Another plausible contributor to the low estimated sensitivity of portfolios
to beliefs is that even those investors that actively choose their portfolios only adjust them infre-
quently (e.g., Duffie, Sun et al., 1990; Gabaix and Laibson, 2001; Agnew, Balduzzi and Sunden,
2003; Peng and Xiong, 2006; Abel, Eberly and Panageas, 2007; Alvarez, Guiso and Lippi, 2012;
Adam et al., 2015). To the extent that investors change their beliefs over time and report their
current beliefs in the survey, the contemporaneous portfolios may thus not be fully reflective of
current beliefs. Prior research has focused on several complementary explanations for infrequent
portfolio adjustments. The first explanation is the cost of monitoring portfolio allocations, which
can cause investors to only infrequently pay attention to their portfolios. The second explanation
is that even after paying attention to their portfolios, a number of additional costs may prevent
investors from trading; these can include physical transaction costs from brokerage commissions
and capital gains taxes (see above), and mental costs from the need to determine optimal behavior
based on beliefs and current portfolios.
     We next explore whether infrequent trading can help explain the low sensitivity of portfolio
allocations to beliefs. We first split respondents with retail accounts into three groups depending
on their trading behavior during the sample period. Specifically, we classify individuals by the
average monthly turnover in their portfolios, but our results are robust to other definitions of
“infrequent trading,” such as the average monthly number of trades. Column 4 of Table IV shows
that individuals with a monthly portfolio turnover of at least 4% have a sensitivity of equity shares
to beliefs that is more than twice as large as that of individuals with a monthly portfolio turnover
of less than 0.5%. These findings suggest that trading intensity is an important determinant of
how strongly (and quickly) beliefs are reflected in portfolio holdings.
     We also analyze the role of a specific motivation behind infrequent trading, namely investor
attention, in explaining this relationship (see DellaVigna and Pollet, 2009; Barber and Odean, 2013;
Ouimet and Tate, 2017; Arnold, Pelster and Subrahmanyam, 2018, for discussions of investor at-
tention). We measure investor attention as the average frequency with which investors log into
    20 Indeed, by the end of 2017, 46% of Vanguard plans had adopted automatic enrollment (about half of those enrolled

all eligible employees, and the other half enrolled newly eligible employees only).

their Vanguard accounts during our sample period. Appendix Figure A.3 shows that this mea-
sure is correlated with, but different from actual trading activity. Column 5 of Table IV shows
that individuals who log into their Vanguard accounts more frequently have a higher sensitivity
of equity shares to beliefs: individuals who log in more than seven times per month have a 56%
higher sensitivity than individuals who log in less than once per month.21 This result suggests
that investor attention is an important driver of the attenuated relationship between beliefs and
portfolios.

Confidence. A further mechanism that is potentially important in understanding how differences
in beliefs translate into portfolio holdings is the confidence that individuals have in their own
beliefs. Indeed, a large literature suggests that individuals who are more confident in their own
beliefs are more likely to trade on them (e.g., De Long et al., 1990; Kyle and Wang, 1997; Daniel,
Hirshleifer and Subrahmanyam, 1998; Odean, 1999; Gervais and Odean, 2001; Barber and Odean,
2001; Grinblatt and Keloharju, 2009; Hoffmann and Post, 2016; Drerup, Enke and Von Gaudecker,
2017). To explore the effect of investor confidence on the extent to which beliefs are reflected
in portfolios, we exploit the fact that the survey directly elicits how confident individuals are
about their answers.22 While individuals who are more confident log in or trade slightly more
often, most of the variation in trading and attention is within individuals with the same reported
confidence (see Appendix Figure A.3). This means that any variation in sensitivity by confidence
is picking up a conceptually different object than variation in sensitivity by trading frequency or
attention. Column 6 of Table IV shows that individuals who report being “extremely confident” in
their stock market beliefs have an almost two times higher sensitivity of portfolio shares to beliefs
than individuals who report being “not at all confident” or “not very confident.”

The Idealized Frictionless Investor. There is substantial heterogeneity across individuals in the
sensitivity of portfolios to beliefs, and those individuals who are most similar to the frictionless
benchmark on a number of dimensions have the highest sensitivities. In column 7 of Table IV, we
explore the sensitivity of those respondents whose behavior comes closest to the frictionless model
on all four dimensions jointly: individuals who are actively investing in tax-advantaged retail
accounts, who are very confident in their beliefs, who pay substantial attention, and whose trading
volume is significant. For respondents in that group, we estimate a β of 3.6, though the standard
error around this estimate is quite large. This estimate gets quite close to the benchmark of β =
6.25 implied by the frictionless Merton (1969) model with γ = 4, and matches the predictions
from that model with a γ ≈ 7, a value squarely within the range considered in the asset pricing
literature. This powerful result shows the importance of frictions for quantitatively explaining the
deviations of observed average sensitivities from the benchmark Merton (1969) model.
   21 Note  that while the frequency of trading and log-ins strongly affects the relationship between beliefs and portfo-
lios, they are not strongly correlated with either the level of beliefs or the equity share themselves.
    22 Mapping confidence as reported in the survey to economic theory is not straightforward. One possibility is that

confidence captures the degree of certainty that individuals have about the entire distribution of outcomes. Individuals
who are less confident think that there is a higher probability that the outcomes will be drawn from a distribution
different from the one that they report in the survey. One possibility that we ruled out is that confidence simply reflects
individuals’ uncertainty about the expected outcome. While confidence is inversely related to the standard deviation of
outcomes implied by the distribution questions, the relation is far from perfect, and the effect of confidence on actions
such as portfolio risk-taking goes well beyond the effect induced by the standard deviation.

II.C    Summary of Explanations for Low Sensitivity, and their Implications.
This section documents that investors’ portfolios systematically vary with their beliefs. However,
the average sensitivity is smaller than that predicted by frictionless models. Some of the low
estimated sensitivity can be attributed to various forms of measurement error, but this accounts
for only a small part of the observed gap. Instead, we identified a number of frictions that can help
explain the low average sensitivity. Overall, our findings suggest that heterogeneous investor
attention, adjustment costs, capital gains taxes, and confidence are important mediators of the
transmission from beliefs to portfolio allocations, and should therefore play a more prominent role
in the design of macro-finance models going forward. We sum up these findings in the following
fact:

Fact 1. Portfolio shares vary systematically with individuals’ beliefs. However, the average sensitivity of an
investor’s portfolio share in equity to that investor’s expected stock market returns is lower than predicted
by simple and frictionless asset pricing models. This sensitivity is higher in tax-advantaged retail accounts
and is increasing in wealth, investor trading frequency, investor attention, and investor confidence.

Our results on the relatively low average sensitivity of portfolios to beliefs speak to a large class of
both rational and behavioral macro-finance models that explicitly account for survey evidence on
beliefs. These models’ predictions for asset prices usually rest on two modeling blocks: (i) beliefs
that change over time in a way that is consistent with survey data, and (ii) individual portfolios
that react strongly to changes in these beliefs, often by building on modifications of Mertonian
portfolio demand in CARA-normal setups. In contrast to this assumption, we find that for the
majority of investors in our sample, infrequent trading, inattention, and lack of confidence in
beliefs reduce the passthrough from beliefs to portfolios relative to the frictionless benchmark.
    It is an open question whether a model in which agents have a lower sensitivity of portfolio
demand to beliefs can match asset prices without further adjustments; our research suggests that
successful models should match expectations and portfolio dynamics together with asset prices.
Motivated by our finding of strong heterogeneity in investor behavior, one possibility for ad-
justments to current models is to explicitly account for the heterogeneity in terms of wealth and
sensitivity of portfolios to beliefs. For example, behavioral models such as those reviewed by
Barberis (2018) often feature two types of investors — such as behavioral investors and rational
arbitrageurs — each modeled with its own demand for stocks similar to equation 2. Asset prices
are then determined by the dynamics of expectations of the behavioral agents, modulated by the
relative wealth shares of the two agents and their relative demand sensitivities. In the context of
these models, equilibrium prices might still be significantly driven by the behavioral investors’
beliefs if these investors tend to have higher sensitivity of their portfolios to their beliefs com-
pared to the other investors. This suggests how the models could be modified to match these
new moments. Indeed, several factors can amplify the equilibrium price effects of these changes
in expectations: a larger wealth share owned by the behavioral investors; a lower elasticity of the
remaining investors to demand shocks, as studied for institutional investors by Gabaix and Koijen
(2020); or other frictions, as in Adam et al. (2015).

      III     T RADING AND THE PASSTHROUGH OF B ELIEFS T O P ORTFOLIOS
Fact 1 highlights that low portfolio turnover reduces the measured sensitivity of portfolios to
beliefs in the cross-section of survey respondents. In this section, we explore the relationship
between trading activity and time-series variation in beliefs. We establish that active trades are not
only infrequent, as is apparent from the summary statistics presented in Table I, but also do not
appear to be prompted by changes in beliefs. The way that belief changes translate into changes
in portfolios is through the direction and magnitude of trading conditional on a trade occurring.
      Before presenting the analysis, we briefly discuss how we measure trading; Appendix A.7
provides additional details. We observe information on all transactions for clients with a retail
account. These transactions include money being moved in and out of the Vanguard accounts,
purchases and sales of securities, and purchases, sales, and exchanges of shares in mutual funds.
We aggregate all trades by asset class: equity, fixed income, cash and cash-equivalents, and other
investments. Since we observe beliefs only when an investor answers the survey, we also aggre-
gate all trades that occur between two consecutive survey responses; these time windows differ
across investors who respond to different survey waves.23 This approach allows us to focus on
changes in portfolio shares over a given time window that are induced by active trading, filtering
out any changes resulting from market movements. We then regress the change in the equity share
due to trading for individual i over time window w, given as ∆EquitySharei,w , on the expected 1-
year stock return at the beginning of the window, Ei,w− [ R1y ], the change in this expectation during
the window, ∆Ei,w [ R1y ], and the equity share at the beginning of the window, EquitySharei,w− :

(3)         ∆EquitySharei,w = α + βEi,w− [ R1y ] + γ∆Ei,w [ R1y ] + δEquitySharei,w− + φXi,w + ei,w .

The vector Xi,w includes a set of time-window-length fixed effects, as well as controls for age,
gender, region of residence, wealth, wave fixed effects, and dummies for initial equity shares
of 0% and 100%. Column 1 of Table V reports the main coefficients; in Appendix A.7, we also
report the coefficients on the control variables as well as estimates with the sample restricted to
the pre-COVID-19 period. A one-percentage-point increase in expected returns at the beginning
of the window predicts a 0.13 percentage point increase in the equity share due to trading over
the following window; a one-percentage-point change in beliefs over the window predicts a 0.23
percentage point change in the equity share. While these sensitivities are statistically significant,
they are smaller than what we obtained from the cross-sectional analysis in Section II.24 Column 1
also shows that investors with high equity shares at the beginning of the window tend to actively
reduce their equity exposures, potentially a sign of rebalancing of their positions.
      The low sensitivity in column 1 could reflect two different mechanisms. First, it could simply
result from the fact that individuals trade infrequently, so that the average sensitivity to beliefs
   23 For example, if an investor has answered waves 1, 2 and 5 of the survey, we would identify two time windows:        the
2-month period between wave 1 and wave 2, and the 6-month period between wave 2 and wave 5. Each time window
would appear as a separate observation in regression 3.
    24 Since these regressions are analyzing changes over time in portfolio choice, rather than levels as in Section II, they

make use of a different source of variation; while one would expect these two approaches to produce similar results in
a frictionless world, this is not necessarily the case if trading frictions are present.

Note: Table shows results from regression 3. The unit of observation is a window between two consecutive survey
responses by the same individual. The dependent variable in columns 1 and 5 is the change in the equity share due to
active trading between the two survey waves. The dependent variable in columns 2 and 3 is an indicator for whether
there was any active trading between the two survey waves, defined as an active change in the equity share of at least
one percentage point. The dependent variable in column 4 is an indicator of whether the individual actively increased
her portfolio share in equity by at least one percentage point during the window as a result of trading between the
two survey waves. All columns control for the length of time between two consecutive answers, and for dummies
capturing extreme start-of-period equity shares of 0% or 100%. All columns, except column 3, also control for the
respondents’ age, gender, region of residence, wealth, and the survey wave. Columns 4 and 5 condition the sample on
windows with active trades. All results are obtained using ORIV. The R−Squared is computed from OLS specifications.
Standard errors are clustered at the respondent level. Significance levels: ∗ (p<0.10), ∗∗ (p<0.05), ∗∗∗ (p<0.01).


appears low (extensive margin). Alternatively, it could reflect a low sensitivity of trading to beliefs
even when investors trade actively (intensive margin). We next explore these explanations.

The Extensive Margin of Trading. A large literature aims to explain trading volume in financial
markets via a mix of changes in beliefs and overconfidence (e.g., Harrison and Kreps, 1978; Hong
and Stein, 1999; Scheinkman and Xiong, 2003; Hong and Stein, 2007). A related literature has stud-
ied the optimal frequency and size of trading in the presence of limited information and transac-
tion costs (e.g., Duffie, Sun et al., 1990; Gabaix and Laibson, 2001; Abel, Eberly and Panageas, 2007;
Alvarez, Guiso and Lippi, 2012). A natural question in our setup, therefore, is whether changes in
beliefs are associated with trading activity.
      Column 2 of Table V shows results from a regression similar to equation 3, except that the
dependent variable is an indicator of whether the investor has actively traded during the time
window (defined as an active change in the equity share of at least one percentage point), and
the change in expected returns over the window is replaced with its absolute value. The ability
of belief changes to predict trading is statistically and economically small, with both beginning-
of-window expected returns and changes over the window having no effect on the probability of
trade. While the R2 of the regression appears high at 38%, column 3 of Table V, which does not
include controls for beliefs, portfolio shares, and demographics, displays a similarly high R2 of

                                                                22
36%. The high R2 in columns 2 and 3 are thus due to the window-length fixed effects: trading is
mechanically more likely to occur over longer time windows. The incremental explanatory power
of beliefs, portfolios, and demographics in predicting the extensive margin of trading is small.

The Intensive Margin of Trading. In our next analysis, we condition on time windows during
which individuals trade actively, and ask whether the direction and the magnitude of the trade
can be explained by beliefs. We start by predicting the direction of trading. Column 4 of Table
V reports the results of a regression similar to equation 3, except that the dependent variable is
now an indicator of whether the investor has actively increased her equity share by at least one
percentage point during the window. Beliefs predict the direction of trading conditional on a
trade actually occurring: an investor who expects future returns at the beginning of the wave
to be one percentage point higher is around 1.5 percentage points more likely to buy equities
in a given window. The fact that beginning-of-wave beliefs affect subsequent trading activity is
consistent with our earlier findings of infrequent trading: if trading occurs infrequently, one’s
current portfolio does not always capture one’s current beliefs. A one percentage point increase
in expected returns over the wave is also associated with a 1 percentage point higher probability
of actively increasing the equity share (conditional on trading).
     Column 5 of Table V explores the magnitude of trading conditional on a trade occurring. The
dependent variable is the change in the equity share due to active trading: that is, the regression is
the same as for column 1, but the results are conditional on trading taking place (again, measured
by the equity share changing by at least 1% in any direction due to active trading). Conditional on
trading, the sensitivity of trading to beliefs increases by a factor of three compared to the uncon-
ditional results: a one-percentage-point increase in investors’ expected 1-year stock returns corre-
sponds to a 0.4 percentage point increase in the equity share due to trading. When we condition
on larger trades (at least a 5% change in the equity share) the magnitudes increase considerably
with estimates around 0.92% for the change in beliefs and 0.77% for the level of beliefs.25
     Appendix Table A.13 presents the same analysis as Table V but restricts the sample to end in
February 2019, just before the COVID-19 crisis. It shows broadly similar patterns with a stronger
quantitative relationship on the intensive margin between beliefs and trading. During the COVID-
19 crisis, particularly during the stock market crash in March 2020, beliefs became substantially
more pessimistic while portfolios change only by a small amount. Those who became more pes-
simistic do tend to trade out of equity conditional on trading, confirming the association of beliefs
and trading even during a major turmoil.
     Our analysis in this section confirms that trading patterns play a central role in reducing the
passthrough of beliefs into asset demand. We summarize the key results in the following fact:

   25 We also investigate how the allocation of “new funds” across different asset classes depends on individuals’ beliefs.

We consider all cases in which, during a window, we see a net inflow of outside cash into the Vanguard account that
is at least 20% of the existing Vanguard assets. Of course, we do not observe whether these are new funds, such as
labor income, or proceeds from other asset sales outside of Vanguard. Since investors devote some time to deciding
an allocation for funds when they first transfer them to their trading account, this represents a particularly informative
window to observe how beliefs affect portfolio composition. We repeat the regression of Column 5 of Table V, but
also condition on a large inflow occurring during the window. We find that when investors actually trade during that
window (that is, they actively allocate the new money), the sensitivity of equity shares to beliefs increases significantly,
to 0.92 for belief changes and to 0.68 for belief levels.


                                                            23
Fact 2. While belief dynamics have little to no explanatory power for predicting when trading occurs (ex-
tensive margin of trading), they explain both the direction and magnitude of trading conditional on a trade
occurring (intensive margin of trading).

As we discussed above, one promising path for future theoretical work hoping to generate the
relatively low average sensitivity of portfolios to beliefs is to explicitly account for infrequent
trading. The results in this section suggest that one parsimonious way to model such behavior
is to introduce infrequent random trading, whereby an agent is selected at random based on a
memory-less distribution to have the possibility of trading in a given period. This approach would
be reminiscent of the Calvo (1983) adjustment model for firm pricing decisions, and would be
consistent with both the fact that the only observable variable that predicts whether an individual
trades is the window length, as well as with the low average passthrough of beliefs to portfolios
established in Fact 1. Researchers who want to match the cross-sectional heterogeneity in trading
frequency in addition to the low average trading frequency could explicitly model different arrival
rates of trading opportunities for different individuals.26


                      IV      VARIANCE D ECOMPOSITION OF B ELIEFS
Section I documented substantial heterogeneity in investors’ beliefs. In this section, we further
explore this heterogeneity by decomposing the panel variation of beliefs into three components:
fixed individual characteristics, common variation in individual beliefs over time, and a residual
component that captures both idiosyncratic individual time variation and measurement error.
    To motivate this variance decomposition, Panel A of Figure III shows the time-series of aver-
age 1-year expected returns in the GMSU-Vanguard survey. The average expected return displays
meaningful time-series variation, with a range of over 4 percentage points over our sample pe-
riod. The largest month-to-month change was in March 2020, when average expected returns
fell by over four percentage points after the stock market crash induced by the COVID-19 crisis.
Panel B of Figure III shows the same time series of average expected returns as in Panel A, but
also includes the 10th and 90th percentiles of the cross-sectional distribution of answers in each
wave. The cross-sectional variation in expected returns dwarfs the time-series variation, not only
in ”normal times,” but also during the COVID-19 crisis.
    This pattern is not unique to our survey or our sample period. For example, the bottom row
of Figure III shows similar plots for the RAND survey, which covers the period from November
2008 to January 2016 and thus includes part of the financial crisis and the following stock market
recovery (see Appendix A.3 for more details on the RAND survey). Unfortunately, the RAND
survey does not directly elicit beliefs about expected returns, so we focus on beliefs about the
probability of a stock market increase over the coming year. We find that the RAND survey also
features cross-sectional dispersion in beliefs that is much larger than the time-series variation.
    There are two potential interpretations consistent with the substantial cross-sectional disper-
sion in beliefs. At one extreme, individual responses might display substantial idiosyncratic varia-
   26 The correlation between age, wealth, and trading frequency established in Appendix A.4, as well as the analysis

presented in Appendix Table A.6, can provide further guidance to researchers hoping to incorporate heterogeneous
infrequent trading into richer life-cycle models.

tion over time, with the same individual reporting very different beliefs at different points in time.
At the other extreme, the observed cross-sectional variation could be due to persistent heterogene-
ity in beliefs; that is, the same investors are always optimistic or always pessimistic. Since these
interpretations have substantially different implications for theoretical models of asset pricing, we
next exploit the panel dimension of our survey to determine their quantitative relevance.

The Dominance of Individual Fixed Effects. We denote the belief expressed by individual i at

(6)                                                                                     Bi,t = φ3,i + χ3,t + e3,i,t .




                                                                                                             25
Equation 4 estimates a set of time (i.e., survey wave) fixed effects, χt , that absorb the common
time-series variation of respondents’ beliefs. Equation 5 estimates a set of individual fixed effects,
φi , that absorb the average belief over time of each respondent. Equation 6 jointly estimates both
individual and time fixed effects. In our baseline analysis, we estimate these regressions including
all responses from individuals who have responded to at least five waves.

Note: Table reports the R2 s corresponding to the three regressions 4, 5, and 6, and the number of individual respondents
N. We only include respondents that have responded to at least five waves. Each row corresponds to a different survey
question that is used as the dependent variable.


     Table VI reports the R2 of the three regressions for a subset of survey questions. Most of
the panel variation in beliefs is absorbed by individual fixed effects. Consider, for example, the
first row, which decomposes the panel variation in 1-year expected stock returns. Time fixed
effects capture 5% of the total panel variation, whereas individual fixed effects capture 47.5%
of the total variation. The remaining variation is a combination of idiosyncratic belief changes
within individuals over time, as well as measurement error in beliefs.27 This large difference in
explanatory power of time fixed effects and individual fixed effects is common across all beliefs.
The same patterns hold when we decompose the heterogeneity in individuals’ confidence in their
beliefs: most of the variation is across individuals rather than over time.28
     There are two possible concerns with this analysis. First, the relatively short time period over
which we observe survey responses might make the fixed effects appear more important than
they truly are. Second, the large COVID-19 shock might overstate the importance of time-series
variation, since shocks of that magnitude are historically rare.
     On the concern that our analysis may be overfitting the fixed effects in sample, especially for
investors that reply only a few times, we find that when we increase the minimum number of
   27 These findings echo results in Dominitz and Manski (2011), who show that individuals’ responses for the prob-

ability of a positive equity return over the coming twelve months were correlated across two waves of the Michigan
Survey of Consumers. The authors also found substantial heterogeneity in this probability across individuals.
   28 In Appendix A.10, we apply the same variance decomposition to portfolios and find that individual fixed effects

explain 87% of the panel variation in equity shares during our sample period. When we relate the individual fixed
effects extracted from beliefs to those extracted from portfolios, we recover a sensitivity very similar to our benchmark
estimates in Section II.

waves that an individual has to answer to be included in the analysis, results are very similar.
In particular, Table VII shows how the R2 of the individual fixed effects changes as we increase
the minimum number of responses per individual.29 We find at most a modest deterioration in
the importance of individual fixed effects as we increase the minimum number of answers. This
finding suggests that our results are not driven by overfitting the fixed effects for people who have
responded only a few times.30

Note: The left panel reports the R2 s corresponding to regression 5. The right panel reports the number of individuals
that responded the required number of times. Across columns, we increase the minimum number of responses for an
individual to be included in the sample from five to eight. Each row corresponds to a different survey question that is
used as the dependent variable.


     We also perform the variance decomposition presented above on the RAND survey, which
also has a panel structure. As discussed above, the RAND survey ran for more than seven years
and covered much of the Great Recession and subsequent recovery; overall, there are 61 survey
waves. A total of 4,734 individuals participated in the survey, 3,166 of whom responded at least
10 times, 1,780 at least 30 times, and 1,032 at least 50 times. When we perform the same variance
decomposition for the RAND survey, we find quantitatively similar results (see Appendix A.9 for
details). Indeed, across all questions in the RAND survey that relate to expected stock returns,
time fixed effects explain around 1% of the panel variation, while individual fixed effects explain
50-60% of the variation. Importantly, the results are robust to increasing the minimum number of
waves that an individual has to respond to in order to be included from three all the way to fifty.
   29 The  table also reports the number of individuals who respond a certain number of times. The number of observa-
tions is of course greater since each individual has answered multiple times.
    30 Another possibility is that the fixed effects capture what in reality is a stationary but extremely persistent process

of beliefs, even though there is no difference in the permanent component of beliefs. Since the economic interpretation
of permanent versus extremely persistent differences in beliefs is not one that is crucial to most theories, we do not
aim to definitively distinguish between these interpretations. Instead, we view our results as emphasizing that there
is large and persistent cross-sectional dispersion of beliefs and the fixed-effects analysis is simply a transparent way
to document this pattern. Nevertheless, one can try to statistically disentangle the two interpretations by estimating a
panel model for beliefs that features both fixed effects and an AR(1) component and use a statistical test to distinguish
between the two explanations. When we estimate this model using the Arellano and Bond (1991) estimator for dynamic
panel data, we find that the autoregressive component is small in absolute value and statistically insignificant (for
example, it is -0.03 for 1-year expected returns), providing suggestive evidence against the AR(1) interpretation of our
results.


                                                              27
These results highlight that our findings are robust to different economic environments as well as
to observing substantially more responses per individual.31
      To explore the concern that our results might overstate the importance of time-series variation
once the COVID-19 shock is included, Appendix Table A.14 reports an analysis similar to Table
VI, but restricting the sample to end in February 2020, before the COVID-19 crisis. Naturally, the
importance of the time-series variation decreases, and the results are, if anything, strengthened:
individual fixed effects are even more important to explain the panel variation in beliefs. While a
reader might want to informally think of the period before and the period including the COVID-
19 shock as upper and lower bounds for the relative importance of individual fixed effects and
time series variation, the economic conclusions are very similar.
      The importance of persistent cross-sectional dispersion in beliefs provides useful insights for
the design of macro-finance models. In particular, much of the existing literature that builds on
survey evidence of beliefs has focused on representative agent models disciplined by matching
the time-series behavior of average beliefs (e.g., Barberis et al., 2015). This literature misses a
crucial feature of the data: individual heterogeneity. Our results offer a new set of moments that
can be used to enrich the models in this under-explored dimension. In this direction, models that
explicitly feature heterogeneous agents with different beliefs, such as the model of Geanakoplos
(2010), are likely to offer a fruitful starting point for further exploration.

Beliefs and Demographics. Having established the importance of individual fixed effects in ex-
plaining the panel variation in beliefs, it is natural to ask whether observable characteristics can
explain why some individuals are permanently optimistic and others are permanently pessimistic.
We find that observable individual characteristics have little explanatory power for beliefs, even
though some of these characteristics are related to beliefs in statistically significant ways. To es-
tablish this finding, we run the following regression:

(7)                                              φ3,i = α + ΓXi + ei ,

where φ3,i are the individual fixed effects estimated in regression 6, and Xi are the following in-
dividual characteristics: dummy variables for age groups, wealth quintiles, region of residence,
gender, confidence, and quintiles for the number of days with Vanguard log-ins in an average
month.32 In addition, motivated by recent evidence that investors’ past experiences influence
their beliefs (e.g., Malmendier and Nagel, 2011), we also include the average return on the equity
and fixed income components of the investors’ portfolios since 2011 as controls in Xi . Table VIII
shows the R2 s from these regressions, which capture the share of variation in the fixed effects that
is explained by the demographics.
   31 While the pattern of persistent and large belief differences across retail investors appears consistent across surveys

covering different time horizons and investor populations, it would be interesting to study the same relationship among
institutional investors or professional forecasters. However, such analyses need to carefully account for the various
incentives of the respondents, which is less of a concern in non-public surveys of retail investor beliefs. For example,
Ottaviani and Sørensen (2006) discuss various aspects of professional forecasters’ strategic behavior, highlighting the
presence of incentives to herd (see also Graham, 1999; Rangvid, Schmeling and Schrimpf, 2013).
   32 For dynamic variables such as age and wealth, we take the average over the sample. For geographic location and

gender, we take the value of the most recent observation.

Note: The table reports the R2 statistics corresponding to regression 7. In each column, going from left to right, we
increase from 1 to 5 the minimum number of responses for an individual to be included in the sample. Each row
corresponds to a different question in the survey.


The observed characteristics have only small explanatory power, with values for the R2 between
2% and 7% depending on the question (using our complete sample in the analysis). When we
restrict the analysis to explaining fixed effects that are estimated on more observations, and which
should therefore be more precise, there is only a modest increase in the R2 . We thus conclude that
classical measurement error in beliefs cannot explain the low predictive power of demographics
for beliefs.
    Appendix A.8 reports the coefficients on the various demographic characteristics from regres-
sion 7. Despite the low overall explanatory power of demographics for beliefs, some of these
characteristics have statistically significant relationships with beliefs. For example, we find that
older individuals are more optimistic, while wealthier respondents are more pessimistic. In ad-
dition, we find that individuals who experienced higher past equity returns are more optimistic
about future stock returns, while individuals who experienced higher past fixed income returns
are more optimistic about future bond returns.
    These results relate to the literature that explores the relationship between expectations and
demographic characteristics and personal experiences. It is common in this literature to find
strong statistical relationships but low explanatory power for expectations using variables such
as wealth, gender, IQ, place of birth, current location, own past experience, or friends’ past expe-
riences (see, for example, Malmendier and Nagel, 2011; Kuchler and Zafar, 2015; Armona, Fuster
and Zafar, 2016; Das, Kuhnen and Nagel, 2017; Bailey et al., 2017, 2018; Ben-David et al., 2018;
Coibion, Gorodnichenko and Kamdar, 2018; D’Acunto et al., 2019). The low predictive power sug-
gests that these individual fixed effects reflect complex combinations of individual characteristics
and experiences, some of which economic research has yet to discover. We collect the findings
from this section in the following fact.

Fact 3. Variation in individual beliefs is mostly characterized by heterogeneous individual fixed effects:
between 40% and 60% of the panel variation in responses is due to individual fixed effects, and 5% is
due to common time series variation. The remaining variation is accounted for by idiosyncratic individual
variation over time and measurement error. Only a small part of the persistent heterogeneity in individual
beliefs is explained by observable demographic characteristics.

Asset prices are determined by expectations of future returns and cash flows. It is therefore natural
to investigate how expectations of returns and economic growth are related both across individu-
als and within each individual over time.
      Figure IV presents conditional binscatter plots of the relationship between short-run and long-
run expectations of stock returns and GDP growth. Panel A shows that expectations about short-
run and long-run stock returns are positively correlated, with an unconditional correlation coef-
ficient of 0.30. Interestingly, even those respondents who expect negative returns over the next
year expect long-run returns to be positive. Similarly, short-run and long-run GDP growth are
positively correlated, with an unconditional correlation coefficient of 0.65 (see Panel B of Figure
IV). The bottom row of Figure IV shows that expectations of stock returns and economic growth
are positively correlated, both at the short horizon (Panel C, unconditional correlation coefficient
of 0.26) and at the long horizon (Panel D, unconditional correlation coefficient of 0.27).

      Table IX presents these results in regression form, both with and without including individ-
ual fixed effects. While these regressions are restricted to linear specifications, and therefore miss
some of the interesting nonlinearities in Figure IV, the findings confirm the strong link between
expectations about different objects, both across horizons as well as across domains. Importantly,

                                                                                                             30
we see these patterns in both the cross-section and the time series (when we control for individ-
ual fixed effects). In the cross-section, individuals who are more optimistic about stock returns
tend to also be more optimistic about GDP growth. In the time series, we find that when an in-
vestor becomes more optimistic about stock returns, she also becomes more optimistic about GDP
growth.33 Appendix A.12 shows that these patterns also hold when excluding the period of the
stock market crash in March 2020. We summarize these results in the following fact:

Note: Table shows results from regressing answers to different expectation questions onto each other; Panel A relates
short-run and long-run beliefs within the same domain, while Panel B relates beliefs across domains over similar time
horizons. The unit of observation is a survey response. All specifications control for the respondents’ age, gender,
region of residence, wealth, and the survey wave. Columns 2 and 4 also control for respondent fixed effects. Standard
errors are clustered at the respondent level. Significance levels: ∗ (p<0.10), ∗∗ (p<0.05), ∗∗∗ (p<0.01).



Fact 4. Higher expectations of stock returns are associated with higher expectations of GDP growth, and
higher short-run expectations are associated with higher long-run expectations (for both stock returns and
GDP growth), both across and within individuals.

The correlation between expected returns and cash flow growth is an informative moment for
macro-finance models. To see why, it is useful to refer to the Campbell and Shiller (1988) decom-
position, which shows how prices, expected cash flows, and expected returns are linked:
   33 While Table IX shows the results in a linear setting, a similar conclusion can be reached in a nonlinear setting

as well, by building binscatter plots that relate the fixed effects of beliefs across domains (thus isolating the cross-
sectional component) and by plotting the residual components after taking out fixed effects (thus focusing on the
within-individual time variation). We report these plots in Appendix A.11. The conclusions are identical to those
in this section: the panel-correlation of beliefs across different domains and across different horizons reflects similar
correlations in the persistent and transient components of beliefs.




                                                           31
                                                ∞                       ∞
                                   pdt ≈ Ei,t ∑ ρ j ∆dt+1+ j − Ei,t ∑ ρ j rt+1+ j .
                                               j =0                    j =0

In this equation, pdt is the logarithm of the price-dividend ratio of an asset, ∆dt+1 is the growth of
cash flows between t and t + 1, and rt+1 is the return of the asset between between t and t + 1. For
expositional convenience, we assume that this equation holds approximately under each investor
i’s expectations Ei,t . If we take our GDP growth responses to proxy for cash flow growth, then we
can use this equation to interpret our empirical results.
     One immediate implication of Fact 4 is in the time-series dimension (see De la O and Myers,
2017). As the Campbell-Shiller decomposition shows, cash flow expectations and expected returns
have opposite effects on current valuations. All else equal, when investors become more optimistic
about cash flows, asset prices rise; but if expected returns simultaneously increase, as they do
in the data, prices will be lower through a discount-rate effect. Therefore, accounting for the
joint variation of expected returns and expected cash flow growth is important to understand the
movement of asset prices. For example, models that match survey variation in expected cash-flow
growth, but ignore the correlated variation in expected returns, are likely to overstate the power
of the variation in cash flow expectations for explaining time-series variation in asset prices (e.g.,
Bordalo et al., 2020).
     The implications of our results for the cross-section (disagreement among investors at each
point in time) are more subtle. While investors might disagree about future cash flows or about
future expected returns, they all face the same current price pdt . Assuming that the Campbell-
Shiller identity holds for each individual, whether they are an optimist or a pessimist, this implies
that expectations of cash flows and expectations of returns need to be positively correlated in the
cross-section.34 For example, consider two investors, one optimistic and one pessimistic about
future cash flow growth. Given that they both face the same price, the optimistic investor has to
expect higher returns than the pessimistic one.35 However, the Campbell-Shiller decomposition
is silent about the exact horizon at which this correlation will occur. For example, it does not tell
us whether disagreement about short-term cash flows is matched by disagreement about short-
term expected returns or by disagreement about long-term expected returns. This is where our
empirical results add value to this decomposition: the results provide evidence on the correlations
of cash flow and returns at specific horizons, thereby guiding the calibration of the term structure of
disagreement in asset pricing models.

In the previous sections, we explored a number of moments of the belief distribution that have
been of central interest to the asset pricing literature, such as average expected returns and aver-
age expected GDP growth rates. In addition, an important strand of the macro-finance literature
    34 The equation is an identity and thus only imposes mild restrictions on expectations. Nonetheless, agents’ expec-

tations might violate the identity, e.g., because they have imperfect knowledge of the current price-dividend ratio.
    35 The Campbell-Shiller decomposition as written assumes that investors believe that all mispricing will be corrected

eventually; if that was not the case, the equation would feature an extra term, containing the limit of pdt+n for n → ∞.

has emphasized that expectations of rare but potentially catastrophic events, sometimes called
rare disasters, can help explain expected returns, portfolio holdings, and asset prices (Rietz, 1988;
Barro, 2006; Gabaix, 2012).36 To further understand these relationships, we exploit that our survey
directly elicits expectations of disaster probabilities for both stock returns (i.e., 1-year stock returns
of less then −30%) and GDP growth (i.e., annualized 3-year GDP growth of less than −3%).37
                                           We first explore the relationship between individuals’ expectations of the probabilities of stock
market disasters and GDP disasters. The left panel of Figure V shows that expectations of the two
types of disasters are positively related at the individual level (the slope of the regression line
is 0.39); in unreported results, we find that this is also true within individuals over time. These
findings suggest that expectations of rare stock market disasters come with expectations of lower
cash flows and are not just purely the result of expecting higher future returns (i.e., beliefs about
stock market disasters are not purely due to beliefs about discount rate variation).

Note: The left panel shows a conditional binned scatter plot of survey respondents’ subjective probabilities that the
1-year stock returns are below −30% and their expectations that annualized average GDP growth over the next three
years is below −3%. The right panel shows a conditional binned scatter plot of survey respondents’ subjective proba-
bilities that the 1-year stock returns are below −30% and their expected 1-year stock returns. Both panels condition on
the respondents’ age, gender, region, wealth, and the survey wave.


                                           We also analyze the relationship between expected returns and expected disaster probabilities.
The right panel of Figure V shows that individuals who report a higher subjective probability of a
stock-market disaster also report lower expected stock returns. To explore this relationship more
formally, we run the following regression:

(8)                                                                   Ei,t [ R1y ] = α + β Probi,t [ R1y < −30%] + γXi,t + ψt + ei,t ,

where the coefficient of interest is β. We additionally control for demographic characteristics such
as age, gender, wealth, and region of residence, as well as survey-wave fixed effects.
                                           The specification in column 1 of Table X corresponds to the right panel of Figure V. The esti-
mate of β implies that a 5 percentage point increase in an individual’s subjective probability of a

the mean, respondents with a higher perceived probability of stock market disasters also had lower equity shares.

Note: Table shows results from regression 8. The unit of observation is a survey response; the dependent variable is the
expected one year stock return. Columns 1 to 4 control for the respondents’ age, gender, region of residence, wealth,
and the survey wave. Columns 5 and 6 include individual fixed effects, survey wave fixed effects, and a dummy for
the randomization order of the buckets in the distribution question. Columns 3 and 6 restrict the sample to individuals
who report expected probabilities of a stock market disaster between 0.1% and 10%. Standard errors are clustered at
the respondent level. Significance levels: ∗ (p<0.10), ∗∗ (p<0.05), ∗∗∗ (p<0.01).


stock market disaster is associated with a one-percentage-point decline in her subjective expected
returns. Column 2 shows that a similar negative relationship occurs when we consider the prob-
ability of less extreme outcomes, i.e., returns below −10%. Column 3 restricts the data to those
answers that report the probability of a stock market return of less than −30% to be between 0.1%
and 10%. We find that excluding extreme responses increases the magnitude of the sensitivity
from −0.21 to −0.27. Column 4 shows that the results are not meaningfully affected by the order
in which the buckets are presented to the respondent in the distribution question (high-to-low vs.
low-to-high). Column 5 includes individual fixed effects, and column 6 does the same but restricts
the probabilities to be in the same range as in column 3. These latter columns show that the neg-
ative relationship between expected returns and subjective disaster probabilities also holds in the
time series for each individual. Appendix A.12 shows that these patterns also hold when exclud-
ing the period of the stock market crash in March 2020. We collect the findings in this section in
the following fact.

Fact 5. Higher subjective probabilities of stock market disasters are associated with lower expected stock
market returns, both across and within individuals.

Our cross-sectional results in Columns 1-4 of Table X map most closely to models in which agents
disagree about the probability of disasters and are overconfident in their beliefs (i.e., they "agree
to disagree"). For example, in the model of Chen, Joslin and Tran (2012), agents differ in their
subjective beliefs about the probability of cash flow disasters. Since all agents observe the current

                                                            34
stock price, those agents who think that disasters are more likely also tend to expect lower returns.
Our findings support the Chen, Joslin and Tran (2012) model prediction that the optimists expect
both high returns and a lower probability of disaster relative to the pessimists.
    Our results on the within-individual time-series relationship between disaster beliefs and ex-
pected returns in columns 5 and 6 of Table X relate to the literature on time-varying rare-disasters
with representative agents (e.g., Gabaix, 2012; Wachter, 2013). In these models, a representative
agent with rational expectations prices assets in an economy affected by time-varying rare dis-
asters. In equilibrium, expected returns and the disaster probability are positively related in the
time series. The intuition is that a higher disaster probability induces individuals to demand
higher compensation for holding the stock market, which increases equilibrium expected returns.
The relationship in the data at the individual level appears with an opposite sign relative to
the theory. Mapping our individual-level partial-equilibrium results into a general equilibrium
representative-agent model is beyond the scope of this paper, but offers an interesting avenue to
further develop the rare disaster paradigm (see Jin, 2015, for a behavioral model in this direction).

                                     VII    C ONCLUSION
In this paper we analyzed a new survey of investor beliefs. We combined the survey responses
with administrative data on respondents’ portfolio holdings and trading activity to establish five
facts about the relationship between investor beliefs and portfolios. These facts provide guidance
on the construction of macro-finance models. In particular, we highlight three ingredients for new
models that the future literature could develop: (i) large and highly persistent heterogeneity in
beliefs about both expected returns and cash flows, with the two beliefs positively related, (ii) a
willingness to ”agree to disagree” that allows for trading based on disagreement, and (iii) infre-
quent trading with an exogenous probability of trading that differs across agents. An interesting
open question is how well such a model would perform in quantitatively matching asset prices in
addition to the main features of beliefs and portfolios documented in this paper.

In this Appendix, we further explore the response rates to the GMSU-Vanguard Survey. The top
panel of Figure A.1 reports the number of responses in each wave, with different colors tracking
the first wave to which an individual responded. Starting in wave 5, we received more responses
from individuals who are re-respondents than from individuals who are responding for the first
time. The bottom panel shows that only about 25% of responses come from individuals who have
responded to one survey only (and some of these may end up responding to future survey waves).
About 42% of responses come from individuals who have responded to at least four survey waves,
and more than 25% come from individuals who have responded to at least six survey waves.

  A.2       F LOW-P ERFORMANCE R ELATIONSHIP IN THE VANGUARD D ATA
The mutual fund literature has established that funds generally experience inflows after a positive
return and that these inflows persist for several months after the high returns. In this Appendix,
we document that similar patterns exist for the sample of Vanguard funds and among the sample
of Vanguard investors.
     We take the work of Coval and Stafford (2007) as the benchmark for our analysis. In partic-
ular, Coval and Stafford (2007) regress each fund’s current inflows (measured as a percentage of
beginning-of-period total net assets) on twelve monthly lags of the funds’ past returns and twelve
monthly lags of flows into the funds. For convenience, we report the estimates from column 4 of
Table 1 of Coval and Stafford (2007) in column 5 of Table A.1 below. In the interest of readability,
we do not report the coefficients on the 12 monthly lags of inflows and focus on the coefficients
on past returns, which are at the heart of the flow-performance relationship. As is clear from
the table, Coval and Stafford (2007) found that lagged returns indeed positively affect current in-
flows, with the strongest effects for the returns in the most recent months. This is the standard
flow-performance result referenced in the literature, which also includes contributions by Sirri
and Tufano (1998) and Del Guercio and Tkac (2002).
     Columns 1 and 2 of Table A.1 report estimates using the same regression specification as in
Coval and Stafford (2007), but focusing only on Vanguard data. We follow Coval and Stafford
(2007) in imposing thresholds on funds’ assets under management (AUM) and the size of AUM
changes for inclusion in the regression. These restrictions avoid giving weight in the results to
large flows into funds very early in their operation. Specifically, we only use funds after they
reach the minimum threshold of $10m assets under management.1 Columns 3 and 4 of Table A.1
repeat the same analysis but restrict the sample to be pre-COVID-19, thus ending in February
2020. The pre-COVID-19 period is perhaps more comparable with the earlier estimates of Coval
and Stafford (2007).
     In columns 1 and 3 of Table A.1, we explore aggregate flows into the universe of Vanguard
mutual funds. The coefficients are very similar to those from Coval and Stafford (2007) reported
in column 5, in particular for the first few lags of returns that are of central interest in the flow-
performance literature. In columns 2 and 4, we perform the analysis using only the flows into
Vanguard funds coming from our survey respondents. Here we only include funds that are well
represented in our sample. In particular, we focus on funds where our respondents collectively
hold at least 0.04% of the total assets under management. This restriction ensures that our estimate
of the flow-performance relationship is not dominated by noise for those funds that are held by
only a small fraction of our respondents. Overall, these restrictions imply that the sample used to
produce the results in columns 2 and 4 include 75% of the funds that were used to produce the
results in columns 1 and 2 (and an even larger share of the AUM). Again, the coefficients in those
specifications are very close to those in the existing literature.
    1 We also impose additional filters. In particular, we drop observations in which the total fund flows are more than

200% or less than -50% in a month, or in which the reported fund return differs by more than 20 percentage points
from the return implied by combining fund flows and AUMs. These filters mostly exclude a few months at the very
beginning of the life of a fund.



                                                         A.3
    These results highlight that investors in Vanguard funds exhibit the same qualitative and
quantitative flow-performance patterns documented in the previous literature for mutual funds
more generally. We also find that the specific sample of investors that respond to our survey
behaves similarly in this respect to the broader population of investors.

   Note: Table reports results from regressions of mutual fund flows on lagged fund flows and lagged fund
   returns. Columns 1 and 2 report full sample estimates, columns 3 and 4 report pre-COVID-19 estimates, and
   column 5 reports the estimates from Coval and Stafford (2007). Mutual fund flows are measured as a percentage
   of beginning-of-period total net assets (TNA). In columns 1 and 3, mutual fund flows are reported directly by
   each Vanguard fund and exclude valuation movements of existing assets. In columns 2, 4, and 5, mutual fund
   flows are estimated as the percentage change in TNA over the month, controlling for capital gains and losses
   of the initial holdings: [ TN At − TN At−1 × (1 + Rt−1 )]/TN At−1 . The pooled regression results are based on
   OLS coefficients, where the mean of each variable has been subtracted. In columns 1 to 4, we report standard
   errors and significance levels: ∗ (p<0.10), ∗∗ (p<0.05), ∗∗∗ (p<0.01). In column 5, we follow Coval and Stafford
   (2007) original paper and report t-statistics.

In this Appendix, we compare the time-series variation of average beliefs in the GMSU-Vanguard
survey with similar measures in other surveys. By comparing patterns of beliefs across different
surveys over the same time period, we can explore the extent to which the various surveys capture
similar belief movements, despite differences in their samples and survey designs.
    Specifically, for each wave, we average our survey responses across individuals, focusing on
the question about expected 1-year stock returns. We then compare the time-series dynamics of
this average expected return to similar ones from four existing surveys: Robert Shiller’s investor
survey, the Duke (Graham-Harvey) CFO survey, the American Association of Individual Investors
survey (AAII), and the RAND American Life Panel Survey (Financial Crisis). The Duke CFO
survey asks explicitly about expected 1-year stock returns and is therefore directly comparable
with our survey, but the last available response is December 2019. All other surveys ask questions
that are related to expected returns, but cannot be directly mapped to them. In those cases, we
use the survey questions that are most closely related to 1-year expected stock returns. For the
Shiller survey, we use the share of respondents that report expecting an increase in stock market
valuations over the next year; for the RAND survey, we calculate the average (across respondents)
probability of a stock market increase over the next year; and for the AAII survey, we compute the
difference between the percentage of bullish and bearish investors. Figure A.2 plots the time series
of the GMSU-Vanguard survey together with the other surveys. For readability, we separate the
plots into different panels that focus on comparisons between the GMSU-Vanguard survey and at
most two other surveys (Panel A: AAII; Panel B Duke CFO and RAND; Panel C: Shiller).
    Since the beginning of the GMSU-Vanguard survey in February 2017, there has been signifi-
cant variation in average 1-year expected stock returns. Expected returns in the first survey wave
were just above 5%. They reached above 6% by February 2020, before abruptly decreasing to just
above 2% after the COVID-19 crash in March 2020. We also observe a drop and recovery in the last
quarter of 2018, a pattern that mirrors the dynamics of the S&P 500 index over that same period.
    During the pre-COVID-19 period, the patterns are broadly shared across surveys. First, quan-
titatively, Panel B of Figure A.2 shows that both the level and the variation of average beliefs
during our sample period is quite similar to those in the Duke CFO survey (the RAND survey
ended before the start of our sample). Second, qualitatively, the peak in optimism in our survey
at the end of 2017 is shared by most other surveys, despite differences in elicitation methods and
target populations. Similarly, all surveys experience a drop in positive sentiment around the last
quarter of 2018. During the COVID-19 period — that is, our April and June 2020 surveys — our
survey reports a drop in expectations. This drop is closely matched by the AAII survey; the Shiller
survey shows instead an increase in optimism.2 We conclude that over the COVID-19 crisis, exist-
ing surveys have diverged somewhat, with some reporting a turn to pessimistic beliefs and others
an increase in optimism. What drives the differential behavior remains an open question.

   2 Over   this period we also investigated the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers ("probability of stock
market increases in next year") and the New York Fed Survey of Consumer Expectations ("probability that U.S. stock
prices will be higher one year from now"). The Michigan survey reports a drop in expectations while the New York Fed
survey reports an increase in expectations over this period.

Note: Figure compares average beliefs about the 1-year stock market return in the GMSU-Vanguard survey with ques-
tions from other surveys. Panel A shows the bull-bear spread from the AAII survey. Panel B shows the average 1-year
expected stock returns from the Duke CFO survey, and the average probability of a 1-year stock market increase from
the RAND survey. Panel C reports the share of investors expecting an increase in market values in one year from
Shiller’s investor survey.

In this Appendix, we present additional summary statistics on the sample of respondents and the
survey responses. We first describe the correlations between a number of investor characteristics.
We then explore the distribution of survey responses, as well as their within-response correlations.

Respondent Characteristics. Table A.2 explores average characteristics across various percentiles
of the age and wealth distributions. Specifically, in columns 1, 2, and 3, we show summary statis-
tics for individuals whose age is within one year of the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles of the
sample age distribution, respectively. In columns 4, 5, and 6, we show summary statistics for
individuals who are within $10k of the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles of the sample wealth dis-
tribution, respectively.

Note: Table shows summary statistics on our survey respondents, similar to Table I. Columns 1, 2, and 3 show sum-
mary statistics for individuals whose age is within one year of the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentile of the sample age
distribution. Columns 4, 5, and 6 show summary statistics for individuals who are within $10k of the 25th, 50th, and
75th percentiles of the sample wealth distribution.


Table A.2 highlights several interesting correlations across different demographic characteristics
of our respondents. Age and wealth are strongly positively correlated. Older people pay more at-
tention to their portfolios, but they trade less frequently. Richer clients pay more attention and are
more likely to trade. Older and richer clients both hold less equity and more fixed income assets
and cash. While wealthier respondents are more likely to be male, we find no strong differences
in the gender composition of respondents by age.

In Section II of the paper, we show heterogeneities in the sensitivity of portfolio allocations to
beliefs along a number of observable investor characteristics: investor trading volume (measured
as the average monthly turnover as a share of portfolio value), investor attention (measured as
the average number of days per month on which investors log into the Vanguard website), and
investor confidence (expressed as the confidence in their beliefs about stock returns). Figure A.3
shows that these characteristics are relatively uncorrelated across individuals, and, as a result, that
the various splits of the investor sample do capture distinct characteristics.

Distribution of Survey Responses. Figure A.4 presents histograms showing the full distribu-
tions of answers for six central questions from the GMSU-Vanguard survey. These figures rein-
force our conclusion that there is very substantial heterogeneity in reported beliefs. We also find
that the distribution of beliefs over 1-year expected returns is substantially wider than the distri-
bution of beliefs over expected annualized 10-year returns.

Note: Table shows within-survey correlations across questions eliciting beliefs about different objects.


Table A.3 shows the correlations across responses to different belief questions in the GMSU-
Vanguard survey. These correlations echo a number of findings in the main body of the paper.
Short-run and long-run beliefs about different objects are positively correlated. Consistent with
Fact 4, beliefs about GDP growth and expected stock returns are also positively correlated. Con-
sistent with Fact 5, individuals who report a higher probability of a stock market crash also re-
port lower expected stock returns and a higher probability of a GDP disaster. Beliefs about ex-
pected bond returns are weakly positively correlated with expected stock returns and expected
GDP growth, and uncorrelated with the probability of either a stock market disaster or a GDP
disaster.

              A.5      B ASELINE R EGRESSIONS : R E - WEIGHTED S AMPLE
In Section I, we discussed how the sample of survey respondents differs from the sample of non-
respondents on several dimensions. In this Appendix, we repeat our baseline analysis in Section
II on a sample of respondents designed to match the sample of non-respondents on a number of
demographic characteristics. In this approach, we first pool the sample of respondents and non-
respondents, and regress an indicator of whether a person responded on a number of observable
characteristics such as age, gender, and wealth. The fitted values from this regression provide,
for each individual who received the invitation to take a survey, the corresponding propensity to
respond to the survey.
    We then create a new regression sample that includes, for each non-respondent, the respon-
dent with the closest propensity score. Since we have more non-respondents than respondents,
we match to the distribution of respondents with replacement. We then run our baseline regres-
sion 1 on this new sample. The results, based on samples that are re-weighted across different
dimensions, are shown in Table A.4.
    Column 1 shows the baseline specification corresponding to column 6 in Table III. Column 2
shows the same regression on a sample of non-respondents that match our sample of respondents
on the age and wealth dimensions. The average sensitivity in that sample is somewhat lower,
consistent with the fact that wealthier people are both more sensitive and more likely to respond to
the survey. In the following columns, we construct regression samples based on propensity scores
built on age, gender, and wealth (column 3), and age, gender, wealth, and length of Vanguard
relationship (column 4). The sensitivities in these samples are marginally smaller than in column
2. Overall, these results highlight that individuals who are more likely to respond to the survey
have a somewhat higher sensitivity of portfolio shares to beliefs.

In the main body of the paper, we explored the role of an individual’s expectations of 1-year stock
returns on her portfolio allocation. In this Appendix, we explore how beliefs about other moments
of stock returns as well as beliefs about bond returns and GDP growth affect these portfolio allo-
cations. Since we are not able to instrument for most of these other beliefs, we return to estimating
basic tobit models instead of ORIV models.
       In column 1 of Table A.5, we control for the subjective standard deviation of 1-year stock
returns, in addition to the point estimate for expected returns.3 This completes our analysis of
the Merton (1969) model by allowing individual-level variation in both the level and the standard
deviation of expected returns. A higher standard deviation of returns has a statistically significant
negative effect on the equity share. The estimated sensitivity of portfolio shares to 1-year expected
stock returns is unchanged when controlling for the standard deviation.

The dependent variable in columns 1 to 6 is the equity share; in column 7, it is the fixed income share, and in column
8, it is the cash share. Standard errors are clustered at the respondent level. Significance levels: ∗ (p<0.10), ∗∗ (p<0.05),

       Once we move away from the first and second moment of expected returns, or when we
      3 To
        construct the implied standard deviation from the distribution question, we first split each bucket into ranges
of 5 percentage points. For each of these ranges, we compute the historical probability of being in that range. We then
weight these probabilities by the subjective probability of each bucket reported by the respondent. We finally calculate
the standard deviation based on the mid-points of the narrower ranges, and their associated subjective probabilities.

consider beliefs about long-run stock returns, we lose the benchmark of a simple asset pricing
model that can be used to assess the quantitative relationship between beliefs and portfolios. We
therefore view the estimates presented in the rest of this section as guidance for future asset pricing
theories wanting to focus on the relevant moments of the belief distribution.
    In column 2 of Table A.5, we control for the probability that individuals assign to a stock
market decline of more than 30%. As discussed in Section VI, the probability of these rare disasters
plays a prominent role in many macro-finance theories of portfolio formation and, in general
equilibrium, of asset returns. Indeed, we find that a higher subjective probability of a rare disaster
is associated with declines in the equity portfolio share. A one-standard-deviation increase in
the perceived stock market disaster probability is associated with about a one percentage point
lower equity share. In addition, after including controls for the perceived disaster probability,
differences in the perceived standard deviation of expected returns is no longer associated with
significant differences in equity shares.
    In column 3, we separately include the probabilities that individuals assign to each of the
five buckets of possible realizations of equity returns. Since these probabilities add up to 100%,
we drop the middle bucket. Shifting subjective probability mass from the middle bucket to the
low-outcome buckets is associated with substantial declines in the equity share, while shifts to
high-outcome buckets lead to much smaller increases in the equity share. This is consistent with
concavity in the utility function, so that moving mass to negative states in which marginal utility
is high has disproportionately large effects on portfolio choice. It is also reminiscent of models
of loss aversion and downside-risk in which agents are disproportionally worried about returns
below a certain cutoff point.
    In column 4, we include an individual’s beliefs about the annualized stock return over the
coming ten years in addition to the beliefs about the expected stock returns over the coming year.
Short-horizon and long-horizon stock-market return expectations are positively correlated (see
the discussion of Fact 4 in Section V), but long-run expectations matter for portfolio allocation
even after controlling for short-run expectations. Interestingly, the magnitudes of the effects are
similar for long-run and short-run expectations. These results suggest that individuals choose
their portfolio for the long-run, particularly since they do not adjust it frequently, and do not
behave myopically by only focusing on their short-run expectations.4
    In column 5, we also include controls for a respondent’s beliefs about the 1-year return of
a 10-year risk-free bond. Holding fixed beliefs about equity returns, increased optimism about
bond returns is associated with a lower equity share. Finally, column 6 also includes controls for
GDP growth expectations, but these do not have an effect on portfolio shares over and above the
stock market and bond market expectations. This is consistent with the vast majority of models
in which expectations of cash flows contribute to the level of asset prices, but only expectations
about returns influence portfolio choice.
    Overall, the findings in this section suggest that the relationship between beliefs and portfolio
allocations is more complex than suggested by the simple Merton (1969) model. First, the subjec-
   4A  large literature has studied the investment problem of a long-run investor; see for example Merton (1975);
Barberis (2000); Brennan, Schwartz and Lagnado (1997); Campbell and Viceira (1999, 2001); Campbell et al. (2002).

tive risk of large stock market declines has larger effects on portfolio allocations than the subjective
variance. Second, long-run stock market beliefs matter in addition to short-run beliefs. Third, be-
liefs about other investments, including fixed income investments, also influence the optimal eq-
uity share. We hope that these findings can help guide the development of future macro-finance
models that explore the relationship between beliefs, portfolios, and ultimately asset prices.

Substitution Patterns. The previous discussion explored the relationship between various be-
liefs (about stock returns, bond returns, and GDP growth) and the equity share in investors’ port-
folios. In columns 7 and 8 of Table A.5, we instead use the fixed income share and the cash share
as the dependent variables, allowing us to explore the substitution between stocks, bonds, and
cash. About half of the increase in equity shares of individuals who expect higher stock market
returns comes from individuals substituting away from cash rather than individuals substituting
away from fixed income securities. This is despite the fact that the average fixed income share
is substantially larger than the average cash share. Similarly, we find that increases in expected
bond returns are associated with increases in the fixed income share, with much of the adjustment
coming from reductions in the cash share instead of the equity share. The sensitivity of the bond
portfolio shares to bond expected returns is even lower than the corresponding one for equities.
Indeed, a back-of-the-envelope calculation is again very illustrative. We can apply the Merton
(1969) formula in equation 2 by replacing equities with bonds and using the historical standard
deviation of long-term Treasury-bond returns of around 5%. The estimate of β = 0.680 from col-
umn 7 of Table A.5 implies a coefficient of relative risk aversion above 500. We conclude that fixed
income offers a similar picture as equities: portfolios co-move with beliefs, but substantially less
so than implied by frictionless benchmark models.

                  A.7     T RADING : D ATA AND F URTHER R ESULTS
In this Appendix, we provide more details on the data construction for our trading analysis, as
well as some additional results from our analysis of investor trading behavior. For investors with
retail accounts (which are 80% of the investors we contacted), we observe transaction-level data
since January 2011.
    For each trade by an investor in our sample, we observe the day of the trade, the amount
traded, and the CUSIP and/or ticker of the traded security. We also observe the asset class com-
position of each security (individual security or fund) as the percentage invested in equity, fixed
income, cash, other, and unknown (we group other and unknown together). The classification
is provided to us directly by Vanguard. For individual securities, the classification is relatively
obvious: equity securities are classified as 100% equity, bonds as 100% fixed income. For mutual
funds and ETFs, Vanguard relies on both internal data (for Vanguard operated funds) and external
data (from Morningstar) to apportion the investment of the funds into the various asset classes.
Our data also contains a code that describes the type of transaction: whether it is a purchase of
an asset with cash, a sale, an exchange of two different stocks, a purchase with cash from outside
Vanguard, and so on. We use this information to compute, for each trade, how the portfolio allo-
cation into equity, fixed income, cash, and other investments (as well as outside money) changes
as a result of the trade. We do so by combining the information about the type of trade, the dollar
amount of the trade, and the allocation of the asset traded into asset classes.
    We divide our sample period into two-week “intervals” (for each month, from the 1st to the
15th of the month, and from the 16th to the end of the month). We chose these two-week in-
crements because our survey is administered around the 15th of the month. Each trade is then
assigned to the corresponding interval, and all trades are aggregated by interval. This procedure
yields, for each interval, the total increase and decrease for equity, fixed income, cash, and other
and unknown in the portfolio as a result of an active trade during the interval. We also obtain the
total inflow/outflow of money from Vanguard and the total volume of trade during the interval.
    We then merge this transaction data with the portfolio data, which provides snapshots of the
portfolios held at the end of each month. We can then compute the change during the interval in
the fraction of the portfolio allocated to equity, fixed income, cash, and other due to trading. For
intervals starting on the 16th of the month (for which we do not observe the snapshot of the market
value of the portfolio at that point in time), we use instead the imputed value of the portfolio
combining the beginning-of-month portfolio value and the change in value due to trading during
the first two weeks. The analysis in the main body of the paper focuses on "windows" between
any two consecutive surveys answered by each individual. For example, an individual might
have answered waves 1 and 3 of the survey, so that a four-month window has passed between the
two answers. For the analysis in the paper, we aggregate all the 15-day intervals over those four
months to focus on trading that occurred during the window.
    Table A.6 is the same as Table V in the paper, but additionally reports the coefficients on
the control variables. Younger, wealthier, and male respondents are all more likely to trade in any
given period. There does not seem to be substantial variation in trading propensity across regions.

                             A.8       B ELIEFS AND D EMOGRAPHICS
In Section IV, we documented that individual fixed effects are the most important component for
explaining the panel variation in beliefs: optimists are persistently optimistic, and pessimists are
persistently pessimistic. We also highlighted that demographic characteristics struggle to explain
which individuals are optimistic and which ones are pessimistic. To show this fact, the main body
of the paper focused on documenting the relatively low R2 s from regressions of the individual
fixed effects on demographic characteristics.
     Table A.7 shows the coefficients on the control variables from these regressions. Despite the
low R2 s, a number of systematic patterns emerge. First, in our sample, older individuals are some-
what more optimistic about expected stock returns and about 3-year GDP growth; their subjective
distribution over future stock returns also has a lower standard deviation, and they assign smaller
probabilities to extreme events such as large stock market declines. There is no large difference
between men and women in terms of their stock market expectations, but men expect both GDP
growth and bond returns to be lower.
     We also find that wealthier individuals are substantially more pessimistic across most of their
beliefs. Individuals who log into their Vanguard accounts more frequently are somewhat more
optimistic about stock returns. Across Census regions, there is some evidence that residents from
the Western region are somewhat more pessimistic, both in terms of expected stock returns and
expected GDP growth. Individuals from the Western region also assign larger probabilities to
extreme negative realizations of stock market returns and GDP growth.
     We also find that individuals who have experienced higher equity returns since 2011 are more
optimistic about future stock market returns (and perceive a lower probability of a stock market
disaster), while respondents who experienced a higher return on their fixed income assets per-
ceive higher future bond returns.5 These results mirror findings from a large literature that has
documented how individuals extrapolate from their own experience when forecasting future eco-
nomic outcomes. Prominent contributions to that literature include Amromin and Sharpe (2009),
Greenwood and Shleifer (2014), Malmendier and Nagel (2011), Malmendier and Nagel (2016),
Malmendier, Nagel and Yan (2017), and Kuchler and Zafar (2015).6




   5 We  measure these past returns as the geometric average of the monthly equity returns in the portfolios of those
individuals between January 2011 and January 2017, expressed in percentage points. For individuals for whom we
do not observe such a long portfolio history, we replace this value with “999”, while adding a dummy variable that
captures these observations. See Dickens and Katz (1987) and Giglio, Maggiori and Stroebel (2015) for a description of
this procedure and a discussion of different approaches to dealing with missing characteristics.
    6 Note that the time-series of average beliefs presented in Appendix A.3 also provides suggestive evidence for

extrapolative behavior in the belief formation of the average individual: for example, the biggest drop in expected
returns occurred in the December 2018 wave, just following a substantial decline in U.S. stock markets. However,
given the short time-series of our survey, we do not focus on these patterns.

In this Appendix, we repeat the variance decomposition of beliefs from Section IV using the
RAND survey. The RAND survey covers a smaller cross-section (4,734 individuals) but a longer
time series than the GMSU-Vanguard survey, with 1,032 individuals responding at least 50 times.

In Table A.8, we repeat the analysis from Table VI in the main body, and report the share of total
variance that is explained by time fixed effects, individual fixed effects, and both. We require that
individuals have responded at least three times, consistent with Table VI that uses the GMSU-
Vanguard survey. We perform the analysis using six different questions asked in the RAND
survey: the probability that the 1-year return is above 0%, above 20%, or below -20%, and the
probability that the cumulative 10-year return is above 0%, above 20%, or below -20%. Table A.9
repeats the robustness exercise from Table VII, and increases the number of responses required
to be included in the analysis from 3 to 50. Both tables show results qualitatively and quantita-
tively similar to the ones in the GMSU-Vanguard survey. In particular, the individual fixed effects
explain about 45-70% of the total variation, while the time fixed effects explain only 1-4%.

Our main analysis explores the relationship between beliefs and portfolios in our panel of respon-
dents. Since individual beliefs are extremely persistent, we next study the persistence of portfolio
shares and examine the relationship between the persistent components of beliefs and portfolios.
       We begin by performing a variance decomposition of the equity share similar to the one in
Section IV, restricting to respondents for which we observe at least 12 months of portfolio data.
We find even more extreme results than we do for beliefs: month fixed effects explain about 0.2%
of the total variation in equity shares, whereas individual fixed effects explain 87% of the variation.
       We next compute individual-level fixed effects for the equity share and for the belief about
1-year expected stock returns. Column 1 of Table A.10 reports the results of a cross-sectional tobit
regression of the equity share fixed effect onto the expected return fixed effects, for respondents
that answer our survey at least three times. The slope of the regression, 1.19, is similar in mag-
nitude to the one from our panel analysis in Table III, confirming that our main empirical results
are mostly driven by persistent cross-sectional differences across individuals. Column 4 restricts
the sample to fixed effects estimated off at least 5 responses, and finds even larger responses,
consistent with us obtaining more precise estimates of the fixed effects.

Note: Table shows the results of different specifications for the regression of equity share on beliefs, focusing on the
persistent components. The independent variables are individual fixed effects of beliefs and the residual component,
computed using at least 3 responses (columns 1-3) or at least 5 responses (columns 4-6). Columns 1 and 4 regress
equity share fixed effects onto individual belief fixed effects. Columns 2 and 5 regress the 2011 portfolio share onto the
belief fixed effects. Columns 3 and 6 regress the equity share onto the individual belief fixed effects and the residual
component in the panel. All regressions are tobit regressions. Significance levels: ∗ (p<0.10), ∗∗ (p<0.05), ∗∗∗ (p<0.01).


Since beliefs and portfolios are persistent, one would expect that current beliefs should relate
strongly not only to the current equity share, but also to equity shares measured outside our
sample. In column 2, we regress the equity share of our respondents in January 2011 onto the belief
fixed effects computed from our survey sample (2017-2019). The relationship is somewhat weaker
at around 0.72, but still of a similar magnitude. This confirms the importance of the persistent
component of beliefs in explaining portfolio choices. Column 3 reverts to our panel analysis (as
in our baseline results), but decomposes the panel variation in beliefs into the individual fixed
effects and the residual (transitory) components. A tobit regression of portfolio shares onto the
two components shows that it is the persistent component that quantitatively dominates. The
smaller role played by the transitory component of beliefs could partly reflect measurement error,
and partly a slow adjustment of portfolios to beliefs due to infrequent trading, which would cause
transitory variation in beliefs to not be fully incorporated into portfolios within our sample.

In Section V, we showed that beliefs correlate across domains and horizons: beliefs about stock
returns correlate with beliefs about GDP growth, and short-term beliefs correlate with long-term
beliefs about the same object. In this Appendix, we explore these relationships in greater detail,
by repeating the analysis separately for the persistent and the transitory components of beliefs.
      More specifically, for each of the questions, we compute the individual fixed effects (capturing
the persistent component of beliefs) and the residual (capturing the transitory component). We
then repeat our analysis relating only the fixed effects across questions (Figure A.5) as well as only
the transitory component (Figure A.6).
      Figure A.5 focuses on the persistent component only. It looks strikingly similar to Figure IV,
emphasizing the importance of the persistent component of beliefs in our panel variation.

Note: Same as Figure IV, but using only individual fixed effects.


Figure A.6 resembles Figure IV less strongly, but it still confirms a positive correlation of answers
across domains, even for the transitory component.
      Overall, our results in this section establish that the pattern of correlation across domains
documented in the text comes partly from the persistent component of beliefs, and partly from
the transitory component, albeit more strongly for the former.

In the main body of the paper, we use survey data between February 2017 and June 2020 to estab-
lish a number of facts about the relationship between beliefs and portfolios as well as the relation-
ships between different beliefs. One natural and relevant question is how robust these facts are
to variations in the market environment, and, specifically, to what extent these facts are driven by
the large stock market crash in March 2020.
       In this Appendix, we document that our analysis is, in fact, remarkably robust to variations
in the market environment. To highlight this point, we present versions of the main tables in our
paper using only the first 19 waves of the GMSU-Vanguard survey, ending in February 2020, near
the all-time high of the S&P 500 index. For all five facts we establish in the paper, the patterns do
not change substantially when we exclude the period covering the COVID-19 crash.
       Tables A.11 and A.12 highlight that the findings of Fact 1 are robust to focusing on the pre-
COVID-19 period. In particular, as discussed in the main body of the paper, the average sensitivity
in the pre-COVID-19 period was somewhat higher, but still substantially below the predictions of
the frictionless model. All heterogeneities across accounts and individuals highlighted in the main
body of the paper also survive the exclusion of the COVID-19 period.

Note: Table shows results from regression 1, estimated using ORIV and using the first 19 waves of the GMSU-Vanguard
survey (up to February 2020). The dependent variable is the equity share. In column 1 it is the equity share in
institutionally-managed retirement plans (defined contribution plans); in column 2 it is the equity share in individually-
managed retail accounts; and in columns 3 and 7, it is the equity share in individually-managed tax-advantaged retail
accounts. In columns 4-6, it is pooled across the three types of accounts. In column 6, “low confidence” corresponds
to individuals who reported being “not at all confident” or “not very confident” in their answers about expected stock
returns; “medium confidence” corresponds to individuals who report being “somewhat confident” or “very confident”
about their answers; and “high confidence” corresponds to individuals who report being “extremely confident.” “Ide-
alized" respondents in column 7 are those whose behavior most closely corresponds to that of the assumptions in the
frictionless model: they have average monthly portfolio turnover of at least 4%, they have at least seven log-ins a
month, and they report to be extremely confident in their beliefs. For the interaction specifications in columns 4, 5, and
6, we also include dummy variables for the respondent characteristics that we estimate the sensitivity for. Standard
errors are clustered at the respondent level. Significance levels: ∗ (p<0.10), ∗∗ (p<0.05), ∗∗∗ (p<0.01).

Table A.13 is the same as Table V in the paper — the table establishing Fact 2 — but restricts the
analysis to the pre-COVID-19 period. As discussed in the main body of the paper, the results are
broadly unchanged in terms of economic conclusions. In the pre-COVID-19 period, the intensive
margin effect of beliefs on trading (i.e., the relationship conditional on a trade occurring) is some-
what bigger in magnitude. This largely reflects the fact that, during the COVID-19 crises, beliefs
changed substantially, but portfolio reactions were relatively muted.

Note: Table shows results from regression 3 using the first 19 waves of the GMSU-Vanguard survey (up to February
2020). The unit of observation is a window between two consecutive survey responses by the same individual. The
dependent variable in columns 1 and 5 is the change in the equity share due to active trading between the two survey
waves. The dependent variable in columns 2 and 3 is an indicator for whether there was any active trading between
the two survey waves, defined as an active change in the equity share of at least one percentage point. The dependent
variable in column 4 is an indicator of whether the individual actively increased her portfolio share in equity by at least
one percentage point during the window as a result of trading between the two survey waves. All columns control for
the length of time between two consecutive answers, and for dummies capturing extreme start-of-period equity shares
of 0% or 100%. All columns, except column 3, also control for the respondents’ age, gender, region of residence, wealth,
and the survey wave. Columns 4 and 5 condition the sample on windows with active trades. All results are obtained
using ORIV. The R−Squared is computed from OLS specifications. Standard errors are clustered at the respondent
level. Significance levels: ∗ (p<0.10), ∗∗ (p<0.05), ∗∗∗ (p<0.01).


Similarly, consider Fact 3, which explores the relative importance of individual fixed effects and
common time-series movements in explaining the panel variation in beliefs. Table A.14 shows
that the inclusion of the crash period — a period in which average expected 1-year returns fell
from around 6% to around 2% — has somewhat increased the contribution of common time-series
variation, but only from about 3.5% to about 5%, while reducing the contribution of individual
fixed effects from 54.2% to 47.5%. As before, the contribution of individual fixed effects is an
order or magnitude larger than the contribution of common time-series variation in beliefs. This
is consistent with the findings in Appendix A.10, which also documented that individual fixed
effects were dominant in other surveys that covered longer time periods.

Note: Table shows results from regressing answers to different expectation questions onto each other using the first
19 waves of the GMSU-Vanguard survey (up to February 2020); Panel A relates short-run and long-run beliefs within
the same domain, while Panel B relates beliefs across domains over similar time horizons. The unit of observation is a
survey response. All specifications control for the respondents’ age, gender, region of residence, wealth, and the survey
wave. Columns 2 and 4 also control for respondent fixed effects. Standard errors are clustered at the respondent level.
Significance levels: ∗ (p<0.10), ∗∗ (p<0.05), ∗∗∗ (p<0.01).

Tables A.15 and A.16 show that the patterns underlying Facts 4 and 5 do not vary substantially
when we exclude the pre-COVID-19 period. In both samples, short-run and long-run beliefs about
GDP growth and stock returns were positively related, both within and across individuals. Sim-
ilarly, expected stock returns and expected GDP growth were positively related at all horizons.
And expected returns and expected stock market disaster probabilities were negatively related
across all samples, both within and across individuals.

columns control for the respondents’ age, gender, region of residence, wealth, and the survey wave. Columns 5 and
6 include individual fixed effects, wave fixed effects, and a dummy for the randomization order of the buckets in the
distribution question. Columns 3 and 6 restrict the sample to individuals who report expected probabilities of a stock
market disaster between 0.1% and 10%. Standard errors are clustered at the respondent level. Significance levels: ∗

                                    Dear Jane Doe:

                                    Vanguard is conducting a study to understand how investors are thinking about the future
                                    of the stock market, the economy and interest rates.

                                    We are inviting you to provide us with your thoughts by completing a short survey. This
                                    survey should take less than ten minutes to complete.

                                    This survey is not a test of your knowledge. Rather, it asks only about your beliefs and
                                    expectations. Importantly, it does not ask for any personal financial information.

                                    The results of the survey will be used for research purposes only. This survey is not
                                    sales-related in any way. Your responses will be reported in aggregate with other
                                    responses. We plan to publish the results in an article or research report on
                                    vanguard.com.

                                    To participate in the survey, please click here.

                                    We'd also like to send you this survey up to six times in the coming year, to see if your
                                    beliefs are changing. If you want to be removed from this study, you have the option to
