            Post-War Changes in the American Financial Markets


                                ABSTRACT


     This essay surveys developments in the American financial markets

since World War .11, with particular attention to    ch~ges     that have

occurred either between the   pre~war   and post-war years or within the last

several decades.   The primary emphasis is on the interaction between the

financial markets and the.uonfinancia1 economy, in the sense of the demands

that the nonfinancial economy has placed on the financial markets and the

ways in which the financial markets have responded to these demands.         In

addition, much of this essay focuses on the evolving     ro~e   of government

in the financial markets, and on changes that it has     bro~ght   about.

     Three major trends emerge as predominant during the post-war years.

First, a sustained rise of private debt financing, including the borrowing

of both businesses and individuals, has almost exactly matched the decline

of outstanding federal government debt relative to nonfinancial economic

activity.   Second, the economy's reliance on financial intermediaries has

continued to increase; together with a series of innovations, the further

advance of intermediaries has reduced barriers and frictions interfering with

efficient capital allocation.   Third, in contrast to the sharp relative

decline of its role as a direct borrower, the federal government has widely

expanded its activities in guaranteeing and intermediating the private sector's

debt, as well as in regulating private £inancia1 transactions.

              POST-WAR CHANGES IN THE AMERICAN   FINM~CIAL   MARKETS

      Financial markets are an integral part of the modern economy.        The many

and varied activities of financial markets both mirror and induce events in

the economic system at large.    Only rarely, however, do they serve as ends in

themselves.    Instead, they facilitate earning and spending, saving and investing,

accumulating and retiring, transferring and bequeathing -- all activities at

the core of economic life.     In principle people could do all of these thinS"::

without financial markets.     In practice well functioning financial markets

enable people to do them more efficiently, and few economic events take

place without their financial counterparts.       ~inancial   markets in fact

constitute an essential vehicle through which the millions of different

participants ill the nonfinancial economy continually interact with one

another.

      The needs and resources, and the objectives and concerns, that people

bring to financial transactions are always changing.         Greater preferences

for horne ownership, reduced concerns for providing for one's own or one's

children's future, or the desire to take advantage of a new production

technology, will change what people seek from the financial markets and

hence will change what takes place there.        New initiatives of public policy,

and the persistent advance in the technology (especially communications

technology) on which the financial markets rely in conducting their own
                                      -2-



business, can also be the source of financial market change.      Moreover,

because every transaction has two sides -- a buyer and a seller, or a

borrower and a lender -- changes in what some people bring to the financial

markets necessarily imply changes in what others find there.      Hence

financial markets act to transmit, not just absorb, the chain of events

that origi.nates in the nonfinancial economy, and in so doing they also

importantly influence these eveDts.     Observing the financial   ~arkets


therefore provides an additional perspective for understanding nonfinancial

developments, even if the more basic origin of those developments is itself

entirely nonfinancial.

      The experience of the American financial markets in the era since

World War II, when compared to the corresponding pre-war experience,

presents both continuities and contrasts.      A time traveller from 1940, or

even 1900, would probably feel more nearly at home on first disembarking in

the financial markets than in most other major arenas of 1980      &~erican


economic activity.   He would   i~~ediately   recognize major classes of

financial market participants and their chief activities, including banks

taking deposits and making loans, insurance companies spreading risk        ~~d


investing in securities, corporations borrowing to finance capital spending,

and indi.viduals both saving for their retirement and borrowing to buy

houses.   The chief items issued and exchanged in these markets are

still currency and deposits, stocks and bonds, bills and IOU's.      Even

the principal financial events that are news today -- a large government

financing, or an episode of tight money, or a stock market rally, or a bulge

in the corporate underwriting calendar -- are happenings that attracted

attention forty and in some cases eighty years ago.

      Much of this immediate familiarity, however, would pertain to the

surface only.    Behind tbe sameness of the players and their working vocabulary,

in many respects the American financial markets are performing (or

misperforming) thei.r various funct.ions differently today t..'1an they did

years ago.     Some changes have reflected the changing requirements placed on

the financial markets by the nonfinancial economy, while others have

reflected government actions, and in a feVI cases the primary ir:\petus to

change has been innovation withi.n the financial markets themselves.        The

pace of change has not been uniform either.      Some differences between

today's financial markets and those of forty years ago represent a contrast

between the pre-war years and the   post-~ar   period as a whole, but others

represent instead the ongoing process of change that has occurred throughout

the post-war era.

      The object of this essay is to gain an overview of developments in the

American financial markets since World War II, with particular attention to

changes that have occurred either between the pre-war and post-war years or

within the past several decades.     Inevitably such an effort must be selective.

The primary emphasis here is on the interaction between the financial         ~~rkets


and the nonfinancial economy, in the senSe of the demands that the nonfinancial

economy has placed on the financial markets and the ways in which the financial

markets have responded to these demands.     In addition, much of this essay

focuses on the evolving role of government in the financial markets, and on

the changes that it has brought about.      Questions pertaining to the internal

organization of financial markets and financial institutions, and to financial

innovations per se , are also important; but they receive less attention here

nonetheless.

      Section I   briefly sets the background for this analysis by reviewing

some significant tlifferences in the underlying economic climate between the

pre-war and post-war periods.     Section II examines in detail the changes

that have taken place in the    fin~~cing   of theeconony's nonfinancial activity.

Here the dominant trend of the post-war period has been the increasing

tendency toward an economy financed by private rather than public debt.

Section III explores changes in the ways in which financial markets have met

these needs, with particular attention to the role of financial intermediaries

and changes in patterns of intermediation.       The dominant trend of post-war

developments in this regard has been a continui.ng increase in the economy's

reliance on financial intermediation which, together with a series of

innovations, has reduced barriers and frictions interfering with efficient

capital allocation.    Section IV focuses on changes in the role of governr.-cc,llt

in the financial markets.     The major expansion of the federal government's

financial activities during the    I~st-war   years. has been in guaranteeing and

intermediating the private sector's debt, as well as in regulating private

financial transactions.     In addition, Section IV provides a brief qualit.ative

account of the ways in which both the conduct of monetary policy and its

perception by financial market participants have evolved during the       l~st-war


period.   Finally, Section V summarizes the principal conclusions of this

survey and re-emphasizes the interconnections among them.

I.   Changes in the Underlying Economic Climate

       Although the focus of this essay is on changes in financial markets,

it is helpful to begin by noting briefly a few of the major changes that

have taken place in the underlying climate of nonfinancial economic

    " "ty. 1
actJ.vJ.       Three such changes are of particular relevance for understanding

what has happened in the financial markets.

       First, the moerican economy in the post-war era has enjoyed much

greater stability and prosperity than in the earlier decades of this century.

Despite widespread early fears that "secular stagnation" would follow the

country's demobilization after World War II, real output and incomes in the

American economy in the post-war era turned out to be both stronger and

steadier than in the corresponding pre-war experience.      As the first two

columns of Table 1 show, the post-war years -- especially the

1960s -- have displayed not only greater economic growth on average (as

measured by real gross national product) but also a smaller variability of
               2
that growth.       The pattern of the business cycle, indicated in Table 2 by

the peak-to-trough decline in real gross national product for the thirteen

cycles that occurred during the past sixty years, also highlights      ~le


increased stability of the post-war period.     On the whole, tl1e economy's
                                                   3
downturns have been both shorter and shallower.        Furthermore, not only has

the economy during the post-war period experienced less severe recessions

on average, but until 1973 the trend appeared to be toward progressively

less severity.     After the recessions of 1953-54 and 1957-58, a decade and a

half elapsed before another downturn amounted to as much as half of their

fairly modest magnitudes.

       This enhanced stability of tile real economy has both affected and been

reflected by financial values.   As   the next two columns of Table 1 show,

equity prices in the post-war period, especially until the 19705, have

been less variable than in the pre-war period.     There have also been

fewer nonfinancial corporate bankruptcies since World War II.        There have

been far fewer bank failures, and -- until 1974 -- essentially no failures

at all of large banks.

      The realization that the post-war JI.rr.erican economy had entered an era

of stability and prosperity, instead of returning to the years of chaos and

depression, gradually altered both business and    conSlli~er   thinking in

important ways.   In addition, the emergence of the United States as the

world's dominant military superpower, with attendent responsibilities and

privileges in the political and economic spheres, only contributed further

to the sense of confidence and expanding horizons.     The resulting new

perceptions of growth opportunities and new attitudes toward risk bearing

in turn played a major role in bringing about the changing patterns of

corporate finance and personal saving that are the subject of section II

below, as well as some aspects of the changing patterns of financial inter-

mediation that are the subject of Section III.

      A second major feature of the post-\var American economy that has

importantly affected developments in the financial markets has been price

inflation.   Whether by cause or by accident, the economy's newfound real

prosperity and stability did not come without costs, and among these costs

the most readily apparent to almost all of the economy's participants has

been the acceleration and increasing volatility of inflation during the

second half of the post-war period (see the next two columns of Table 1).

The post-war period at first brought an improvement in     L~e    stability of
                                    -7-



prices as well as real incomes, as the rapid and volatile inflation of the

imnlediate post-war years gave way to price movements that were on balance

both slower and steadier, especially in the early 1960s.       The improvement,

however, proved only t.emporary.   Beginning in the mid 19605 prices (and

wages) rose more rapidly, leading in time to two episodes' of double-digit

inflation in the 1970s.   Moreover, the faster average rate of price increase

during the most recent decade has itself been more volatile.

      It is not the purpose of this essay to analyze the reasons for the

accelerating post-war American inflation.      The focus here is rather on the

effects of this new development on the financial markets.        Because the

greatest acceleration of inflation has come only     wi~~in   the past decade,

many key substantive questions about the effects of inflation remain

unresolved.   Even so, it seems clear already that    sc~e   of the important

financial changes discussed in Sections II and III below have been due at

least in part to individuals' and businesses'·increasing awareness of

inflation per se, as well as to the rising average interest rate levels

that inflation has brought.    In addition, several changes in the role

of government discussed in Section IV have also come about largely as a

result of either or both of inflation and high nominal interest rates.

      Finally, a third feature of the post-war American economic climate

that is useful to bear in mind in analyzing this era"s financial market

changes is the shifting character of the international equilibrium (or

disequilibrium).   From the beginning of World War I onward, the Western

world's international economic balance was highly precarious, and inter-

national mechanisms were important in propagating economic disturbances as
                                    ..    4
well as in heightening their   sever~ty.      In the early years after World War II,
                                     -8-


it looked as if the world economy was at last -- or,       in   the opinion of some

who recalled conditions before World War I, again -- relatively free from

this source of instability., After World War II the world had accepted a de

facto dollar standard; and it maintained this convenience even after the

return to convertibility of key European currencies i.n 1958.         In addition,

until the early 1960s the recovering European economies continually sought

both more dollars and more American goods, so that the United States enjoyed

not only a strong balance of payments but also      th~   confidence that came from

knowing that oth2r countries would gladly absorb dollars in payment for

their goods if the American payments balance were not in balance.

        This situation changed as the post-war period advanced.        America's

trading partners increasingly became competitors, and tough competitors at

that.    Balance-of-payments surpluses changed to deficits.        Discussions of

how the United States could satisfy the familiar "dollar shortage"

disappeared, to be replaced by questions of what, if anything, the United

States could do to relieve the "dollar overhang."         In the 1970s volatility

in the foreign exchange markets again became a major concern, this time with

a weak rather than a strong dollar as the center of attention.            Questions

about the future of the dollar's role in international trade and finance

became widespread, especially after the abandonment of dollar-gold

convertibility in 1971 and the gradual move to a de facto system of "floating

but managed" exchange rates during the next several years.          The effective

cartelization of the world oil supply in 1973 brought a new wave of payments

imbalances and highly skewed accumulations of international reserves, this

time far greater in magnitude than any recent experience.          On balance, the

trend toward ever greater stability in     the   international economic environment

in the first half of the post-war period reversed itself in         ~~e   second half,
                                     -9-



although even in the 1970s the situation is' far from what it was in the

inter-war years, and the continuing presence of institutions like the

International Monetary Fund provide a measure of safety that was not there

before.     This advance and then retreat in the stability of the international

economic system, and simultaneously in the strength of the American position

in it, have also helped to mold a -number of the major changes that have

taken place in the American financial markets during this period.

      In sum, real economic stability and prosperity, accelerating price

inflation, and a more stable but somewhat deteriorating international

equilibrium have lain behind much of the development of the American

financial markets in the post-war era.     Just within the past half decade,

however, public confidence in the continuation of the first of these three

factors has weakened noticeably.     In part this reduced confidence has

reflected the growing awareness of inflation and international events,

together with a mounting sentiment that these processes must not continue

unabated.     To whatever extent conditions fostering inflation and a weak

dollar had been a source of rapid economic growth, the public has inferred

that actions taken to curb them will probably trim the economy's average

real performance too.     The unanticipated magnitude of the 1973-75 recession,

coming as it did after two decades of damping of the economy's business

cycle, also exerted a major impact on people's thinking.     So too did the

series of oil price increases imposed by the cartel.     To whatever extent the

reliance on inexpensive and plentifully available energy supplies had been

a source of rapid growth, the public has feared that both price and quantity

actions taken by the foreign oil producers will limit and disrupt future

growth.     Even simple extrapolations of economic growth on the basis of purely
                                    -10-



domestic developments like labor force and productivity also suggested

slower growth ahead, since by the 1970s the post-war baby boom had matured,

the birth rate had fallen sharply, and the trend rise i.n productivity had
                                        S
sUffered at least one downward shift.

     Moreover, economic events have probably not been the sole cause of

the decline in confidence in America's economic prospects that has set in

during the 1970s.    Loss of the Vietnam War, apparent erosion of American

influence in world affairs, failure to meet domestic social objectives set

in the 1960s, increased emphasis on pollution and other intangible costs

typically associated with the economic growth process, the political trauma

of Watergate -- all contributed to the feeling, widely reported in surveys

of business and consumer opinion, that the future looked less bright tha:1

the post-war past had been.

      The chief reason why it is useful to emphasize here this roost      rece:1~


apparent shift in attitudes toward the nation's economic climate and

prospects is that it provides a clear warning against projecting, as a

forecast, any simple continuation of the post-war financial developments

described in the remainder of this essay.     Within only a decade -- a

relatively brief interval in the context of the overview attempted here

the American public has sharply changed its perception of the stable growth

and prosperity that has been perhaps the central feature of their economy's

post~war   experience.   Events may yet prove them right or wrong, but financial

behavior responds powerfully to attitudes and perceptions as well as

realities.    Especially for changes in financial markets, analyzing the past

is not equivalent to predicting the future.

II.   Changes in the Financing of Economic Activity

        Individuals, businesses and governments sometimes engage in financial

transactions directly with one another, although more often one or more

interroediaries stand between them.     Nevertheless, because the needs of non-

financial entities to borrow and lend, to issue liabilities and hold assets,

to render and receive payments, constitute the essential raison d'etre of

financial markets, in assessing changes in financial markets over a long

period of time it is useful to begin by abstracting from the financial

intermediation process and directly examining changes in the liability

issuing and asset holding behavior of the economy's nonfinancial participants.


A.    The Post-War Rise of the Private Debt Economy

        The single development in the American financial markets since World

War II that has been most striking from this perspective has been the rise

of the private debt economy.      Individuals and especially businesses have

almost continually increased their degree of reliance on debt in relati.on

to their basic nonfinancial activity.        Corporations have relied more on both

negotiated loans and market debt issues, in comparison to equity either

issued extern.ally or retained internally, to finance their oW'11ership of

productive assets and   w~rking   capital.    Individuals have relied more on

mortgage credit to finance their houses, and on consumer credit to finance

their ownership of durables and even their current consumption.        As a result,

the indebtedness of the American economy's private sector has risen

substa."'ltially.

        It is essential to ask at the outset whether this pervasive increase

in private indebtedness that has taken place during the post-war period has

                                       -12-



also represented a change in the nonfinancial economy's total propensity to

issue debt liabilities (and hold debt assets).       The answer is a straight-

forward negative.   The total amount of debt issued by nonfinancial borrowers

in the American economy has in fact remained remarkably stable, in relation
                                                          6
to economic activity, throughout the post-war period.         Hence the great rise

in private debt has mirrored a substantial decline, relative to economic

activity, in public debt.       Although state and local governments have

increased their debt somewhat, an enormous decline (again, relative to

economic activity) in the federal government's outstanding debt has

predominated.   Hence the post-war rise of the private debt economy has come

largely as the counterpart of a falling off of federal indebtedness.

      Figure 1 and Table 3 indicate the general dimensions of the post-war
                            7
movement to private debt.        Figure 1 plots, for the years 1918-78, the

total outstanding credit market debt issued by the economy's nonfinancial

borrowers, scaled as a percentage of nonfinancial economic activity as

measured by gross national product.        The figure also plots the respective

components of this total debt ratio according to major categories of non-

financial borrowers in the economy:        the federal government, state and local

governments, businesses, and households.        Table 3 presents for closer

inspection the underlying data for the post-war years, further distinguishing

between corporate and noncorporate businesses and also including, as a
                                                                              S

      The key aspect of the American nonfinancial economy's use of financial

markets that stands out sharply in Figure 1 is the relative stability of its

total debt outstanding despite the wide variation of the several components

that together comprise the total.       Apart from a one-time adjustment

associated with the fall of prices at the end of World War I,     ~~e   non-

financial economy's reliance on debt, scaled in relation to economic

activity, has shown essentially no trend over the past sixty years.        At 143%

as of yearend 1978, the debt rati.o was virtually unchanged from 142% in 1921.

Nonfinancial borrowers' outstanding debt rose significant'ly in relation to

too rapidly for the pay-down of debt to keep pace.       Otherwise the economy's

total nonfinancial debt ratio has remained roughly steady throughout this

period.   Indeed, as Table 3 documents in greater detail, the debt ratio h2.s

been especially steady during the most recent quarter-century, exhibiting

only a slight upward trend and a small amount of cyclicality due to
                                                    .           10
fluctuations of gross national product around its growth trend.     From this

overall perspective, therefore, the years since vJorld War II have largely

represented a continuation of the pre-war era;

      It is interesting to speculate about the wlderlying economic behavior

that has held the economy's total outstanding nonfinancial debt so steady in

relation to its nonfinancial activity.    Several different kinds of behavi0r,

not mutually exclusive, may have contributed to this phenomenon.        First, the

risk of default typically prevents either individuals or businesses from

borrowing much in excess of their ownership of (explicit or implicit)

collateral, and physical assets constitute the only such collateral that most

nonfinancial borrowers can provide.   To the extent that private wealth holders

in the economy seek to maintain their net worth in relation to their incomes

by accumulating more physical assets as they own fewer government-issued

financial assets, therefore, their ability to issue their own debt will rise
                                    -14-



as the predominance of government-issued debt declines.       Alternatively,

some private borrowers may be able to issue as much debt as they want in

relation to their incomes, but may also recognize that their liability for

future tax payments to support the goverrunent' s debt: set'vice obligations

makes the government's debt in some ways equivalent to tneir own.       As their

indirect obligations to help service government-issued debt decline,

therefore, they become willing to incur an increasing amount of direct

obligations for their own debt.    Finally, since financial intermediaries

must issue their own liabilities approximately in proportion to whatever

assets they hold, the amount of debt liabilities that the nonfinancial

economy in total issues and the   ~~ount   of financial assets that the non-

financial economy in total holds must be about equal.      If private wealth

holders in the economy have steady demands for financial assets in relation

to their incomes, then the decline of government-issued debt will clear the

way for the market as a whole to absorb more private debt, so that this

apparent stability on the borrowing side of the financial markets in reality

simply mirrors a more fundamental stability on the lending side.       Regardless

of the relative importance of these (and possibly other) kinds of economic

behavior i.n explaining the stability of the economy's nonfinancial debt

ratio, however, that stability has now remained one of the major regularities

of the economy's performance over a long peliod of time.

      In sharp contrast to the steadiness of the American nonfinancial

economy's overall reliance on debt, the debt issuing behavior on the part of

specific categories of nonfinancial borrowers has     sho~~   widely divergent

patterns.   Here the ongoing post-war trend toward ever less federal

government debt and ever more private debt in relation to gross national.

its relative indebtedness.    During the 1930s, however, the ratio of the

government's debt to gross national product increased by a factor of two-

and-a-half (from 18% in 1930 to 45% in 1940), and during World War II it

increased by yet another two-and-a-half (to 119% in 1945).      Yne financial

system absorbed this rapid relative growth of government indebtedness at

first by a temporary increase in the total nonfinancial debt ratio, and

then by a sharp reduction in outstanding private debt in relation to

economic activity.    Since World War II, however, the federal government has

again been "repaying" its debt -    not by actual repayment from budget

surpluses but by the growth (in recent years, mostly the inflation)

of economic activity -    so that in 1978 the ratio of its debt to gross

national product was again down to 28%, almost identical to the value in

1918.   From the perspective of its total absorption of resources from the

financial markets, therefore, the government's posture during the bulk of

the post World War II period has mostly resembled that of the 1920s. and pas

stood in contrast to that of the 1930s and the war itself.

        The post-war rise of the private debt economy, following as it did

the decline in reliance on private debt during the 1930s and the war years,

has mirrored the change in the federal government's behavior.

Both businesses and individuals have participated in this post-war

resurgence of private debt.    The outstanding debt of businesses, which

declined in relation to gross national product from 123% in 1932 to 29% in

1946, has risen in the post-war years to 50% in 1978 (in comparison with

a whole, the trend toward increasing reliance on debt by the private sector

has been clear.

        In sum, the sustained large-scale turn toward private debt has been

one of the principal ways in which the American financial markets in the

post-war period have changed, at least in comparison to their more           i~~lediatc


pre-war experience.     An   important question, which this essay leaves

unresolved, is    wheL~er    this resurgence of private debt has primarily

constituted merely a. return to "normality" after the aberration of the

depression and the war or, instead, a shift to a greater "normal"

indebtedness than that which prevailed half a· century ago.           Both factors

have no doubt contributed at least to some extent.            That the years 1930-45

constituted an aberration, and that a large part of the post-war trend has

represented a reversal of that aberration, is certainly plausible enough.

MoreovE:r, as the discussion below brings out, after the \'1ar the relative

indebtedness of some categories of nonfinancial borrowers rose steadily for

one or two decades but then reached a plateau for some time, perhaps

indicating completion of the reversal process and re-attainment of the

relevant pre-war (and pre-depression) norms.             Nevertheless, the plateauing

of businesses' relative indebtedness in the past few years may have been a

reflection of cyclical factors rather than longer-run forces, and, after a

hiatus of over a decade, households have begun to increase their relative
                                     -17-



indebtedness once again.     Even apart from the evidence of experience itself,

there are a priori reasons for believing that the progressive development

of intermediation in the American financial markets, discussed in Section

III below, nmy have created an environment that is indeed consistent      wit~   a

higher "normal" private debt ratio than that which characterized the

pre-war economy.


B.   Specific Nonfinancial Borrowers' Debt Issuing Behavior

      Before going on to examine changes in patterns of intermediation and

in asset holding behavior, it is useful to gain a better understanding of

the way in which private debt has corne to play this greater role in the

financing of economic activity by focusing briefly on the post-war borrowing

experience of the principal specific groups whose needs the Arnerican

financial markets serve.

      Businesses.     Table 4 provides an indication of the changing absolute

and relative magnitudes of American nonfinancial corporate businesses'

financial needs by presenting data, in dollars and as a ratio to gross

national product, showing the average volume of corporations' uses of funds

during successive five-year segments of the post-war period to date (and

the three-year average for 1976-78).        On the whole, the experience of

unincorporated businesses has been roughly similar to that of corporations

in this regard.     Corporate businesses' total uses of funds have grown not

only absolutely but also in comparison to the overall scale of the nation's

economic activity, although this increase has entirely come in the 1960s

and 1970s.   Corporation's uses of funds for all purposes first declined

from an average 9.9% of gross national product during 1946-50 to 9.2% during

                .
As the memorandum item in the table shows, the nonfinancial activity of the

corporate sector, as measured by its gross domestic product, has risen

almost throughout   th(~   post.-war period, so that at least a part of tJ1is

greater relative use of funds in recent years may have reflected greater

relative nonfinancial activity.       Within the overall total, uses of funds

for purposes of physical investment --. including plant, equipment, real

estate, inventories, and other real investments -- has consistently dominated

uses of funds for purposes of acquiring financial assets, and has also

accounted for most of the increase in total uses in relation to gross

national product.    Nonfinancial corporations have also consistently used

some funds to acquire (mostly nonliquid) financial assets, thereby acting

in part as financial intermediaries.

      Against this background of corporate businesses' needs for funds in

their ongoing ordinary nonfinancial activity,· Table 5 presents five-year

average data, in· dollars and as percentages of total sources of funds,

showing how corporations have financed these needs.           After World War II '

the balance of corporate financing first shi.fted toward internally geneu,ted

funds including both depreciation allowances and undistributed profits.

Beginning in the early 1960s, however, it shifted back toward external

funds, including both debt and equity issues.        Internal funds provided an

average 67% of corporations total funds requirements during 1951-55 and 69%

during 1956-60, but then fell to only 55% during 1971-75.         Also over these

years depreciation allowances increased in importance, and retained earnings

(in other words, internal additions of common equity) decreased in importance,

among the Sources of internal funds themselves.        To the extent that

depreciation allowances represent genuine consumption of the capital stock

rather than merely a way of redefining profits so as to render them exempt

from corporate income taxes, therefore, the decline in the contribution of

internally generated funds to the growth of the corporate sector has been
                                                 1.1
even more pronounced than these data suggest. -         During 1974-77 the effects

of the severe business recession and recovery temporarily reversed the

trend toward external finance, so much so that corporations' outstanding

indebtedness fell from 41% of gross ns.tional product to 38%.           Since then,

however, corporations have apparently resumed the financing patterns that

had predominated for a decade and a half bGfore the unusually deep recession.

      A   fur~~er   feature of corporate financial behavior that emerges

clearly from Table 5 is the increase in importance of debt, and corresponding

decline in importance of equity (until the early 19705), among corporations'

external sources of funds.     New issues of equity (net of retirements)

accounted for an average of nearly 15% of corporations' external funds

sources.during the 1950s but then less than 5% during the 1960s, and in

three years out of ten guring the 1960s equity         retira~ents   actually exceeded

new issues.   Moreover, the data shovln in Table 5 importantly understate

both the magnitude and the persistence of the shift to debt finance.            vihat

little equity issuance took place during the 1960s typically represented

initial public offerings of speculative new ventures aimed at a segment of

the investing public that was willing to bear substantial risk.            Established

corporations largely avoided the equity market.         In addition, the bulge of

equity offerings during the early 1970s primarily represented only one

sector of American industry (public utility companies), and it consisted in

large part of preferred shares which are in many respects simply bonds that

receive special tax treatment f or corporate 1nvestors.

         Businesses i increasing reliance on debt financing has probably

reflected several influences on corporate financial decision making.            To

begin,    rr~st k~erican   businesses emerged from Wor.ld War II carrying debt

that was, in relati.on to their volume of producti.on and profits, very small

in comparison with their pre-war experience.          As Figure 1 shows, non-

financial business indebtedness in relation to gross national product

peaked in 1932 and then fell slowly during the remainder of the 19305.               The

most rapid decline, however, came during the war years, as the overall

business debt ratio fell from 63% in 1940 to 27% in 1945 (40% to 17% for

corporations).     It is at least possible, therefore, that the entire

subsequent increase to 55% at the 1974 peak (37% for corporations)         siDpl~'


represented a slow restoration --which may not yet be complete -- of a

perceived normal indebtedness that has remained unchanged since before the

war.     Indeed, by comparison with the standard of the 1920s, the post-war

rise in corporate indebtedness has been modest thus far.

         Other, more specific explanations are also available, however.         First,

any private borrower's willingness to incur debt liabilities         pres~~ably


reflects confidence in the ability to meet these obligations under

a wide range of plausible circumstances, including both those particular

to the borrower and those general to the economy.          As business decision

makers became aware of the American economy's distinctly greater stability

and prosperity in the post-war era, they probably associated a smaller risk

with any given level of indebtedness in relation to either balance sheet or

income reference points.        Second, the secular acceleration of inflation and

rise of nominal interest rates has provided a further incentive for taxable
                                                -21-



borrowers to increase their indebtedness.                As Figure 2 shows, on average

nominal interest rates have about kept pace with inflation, so that "real"

interest rates have remained roughly wlchanged during the post-war period.

Given the deductability of interest payments against income for tax

purposes, however, after-tax "real" interest rates faced "by corporate

borrowers have been negative almost throughout this period, and have become

progressively more negative since the early 1960s -- exactly the period of
                                                                                 16
greatest increase in the debt share of total sources of funds.                          Finally,

at least throughout the 19605, corporate financial decision makers appear

to have operated almost continually under the opinion that equities were

somehow "undervalued."                Especially during the 1960s the belief that

equities were undervalued on a widespread basis led not only to the

paucity of new equity issues by major corporations but also to such

developments as a wave of conglomerate mergers largely financed by debt.

In fact, as Figure 3 shows, equity prices on average had risen sharply

during the 19505 and 1960s, both nominally and on a price-adjusted basis.

Since then there has been little trend movement nominally and a large

decline in real terms, so that any               relucta~ce    to issue new equities in the

late 19605 because of undervaluation appears (with the benefit of hindsight)

to have been misplaced.

         Whatever its cause, the shift by corporations from internal funds

generation to external financing and from equity to debt within that external

financing total, together with similar trends among nonincorporated

businesses, has been a ,major feature of the post-war American financial

markets.         Table 6 presents data showing the total accumulation and also the

 data show clearly that the large shift to debt financing beginning in the

. mid 19605 also brought a slow increase in the short-term share of the debt,

 thereby breaking away from the virtually fixed maturity composition that
                                                18
 had prevailed since the end of World War II.

                                   -
 relative indebtedness, shown in Figure 1 and Table 3, has probably reflected

 behavioral influences analogous to those identified above as likely causes

 of the rise in businesses' reliance on debt.        Initially just the return to

 borrowing standards that had prevailed before the war, then a changing

 perception of tolerable debt levels as confidence in the economy's stability

 and prosperity became widespread, and finally the growing after-tax

 incentive for those in higher tax brackets to borrow as price inflation and

 nominal interest rates rose together,19 all con~ributed to individuals'

 greater willingness to borrow.

       Unlike businesses, however, individuals during the post-war period

 have increased their outstanding debt well beyond the relationship to gross

 national product that prevailed during the pre-war years.       Households'

 outstanding debt gradually rose from 15% of gross national product in 1921

 to 24% in 1929, then temporarily rose somewhat further in the early 19305

 (when gross national product was well below trend), but then stabilized

 again at an unvarying 25% throughout 1936-40.       When individuals emerged

 from World War II with a debt ratio of only 13% in 1945 (the low had been

 11\ a year earlier), they presumably felt ample room to borrow heavily.

 Individuals pushed their indebtedness relative to gross national product

 past the 25% pre-war norm as early as 1952, however, and contipued to

 increase it virtually without interruption until 1964 when it reached 48% --

a 1e:ve1 at whi.ch it remained almost constant through 1975.   Hence it appeared

that individuals'had reached a new post-war capacity level of tolerable

debt.   Just during the late 1970s, however, individuals have once again

begun to increase their relative indebtedness.    AIl of these changes in

households' i.ndebtedness in relation to gross national product have also

represented changes in relation to personal disposable income, which has

claimed a steady average of 69% of the gross national product, with no

trend at all, throughout the post-war period.

        Tables 7, 8 and 9 present data for households comparable to that

shown in Tables 4, 5 and 6 for nonfinancial corporate businesses.           First,

Table 7 indicates households' changing financial needs by showing their

total uses of funds for all pruposes, divided between current consumptic:l

of non-durable goods and services and all "investment" type uses -           incll~Qin9

new residential construction, outlays for durable goods, and financial

investment.    Whether the evolution of individual behavior documented in

Table 7 constitutes a case for change or continuity within the post-war

period is largely a matter of emphasis.    Nondurable   cons~~ption   has    re~ained


a steady five-ei.ghths of gross national product, without any trend, since the

early 19505.    Households' total non-consumption uses of funds remained

roughly steady at one-fifth of the gross national product until 1970, but has

risen sharply since then.    Within this total, both durables purchases and

residential construction have held a steady relation to overall economic

activity throughout, but the net acquisiti.on of financial assets has

approximately doubled over the post-war years, rising from an average 6% of

gross national product during the late 19405 and 1950s to 10-12% in the1970s.

liabilities -- the people who borrow are often not the same ones who

accumulate assets -     on an aggregated basis the notion that individuals

have increased their    ~rrowing   (relative to economic activity) either to

finance invest.ment in houses and durables or to fi.nance current cons.uJI".ption

turns out to be false.      Instead, they have borrowed more 'and simultaneously

held more financial assets.

         A comparison of households' total uses of funds versus personal

~.isposable    income, shown as a memorandum item in Table 7, indicates that

individuals have had to be net borrowers throughout the post-war period.

After showing little trend for a quarter-century, the shortfall of disposable

income from total uses of funds has increased sharply in the 1970s.                 The

data in Table 8 show how households have financed their growing needs for
         20
funds.        Here again the data suggest a long period of stability, followed

by some change in household behavior either at the beginning of the 1970s

or perhaps the 19605.      Until then the balance of saving and borrowing as

sources of funds remained largely unchanged.              More recently individuals

have relied more heavily on borrowing, including both mortgages and consumer
                                           21
credit (primarily installment credit             ).   Table 9 indicates the accumulation

and also the relatively stable composition of this expanding individual debt

by type of borrowing.     Subject to some variation primarily associated with

the pace of homebuilding activity and the             rnove~ent   of house prices, horne

mortgages have accounted for a fairly steady five-eighths of total household

indebtedness throughout the post-war period.              Consumer credit has gradually

shrunk in relation to the total, while the relatively small amount of

borrowing in all other forms has gradually             gro~m.

gradually increased their outstanding debt from 7% of the gross national

product at the end of World War II to just over double that in 1971 before

allowing it to decline somewhat in the 1970s.     Once again, a major 9Qrtion

of this increase in indebtedness constituted a returr. to pre-war norms after

the aberration of the wartime years.   During the 1920s the state and local

government debt ratio had slowly risen from 10% to 13%, and after some

fluctuation in the early 19308 it stood at 13% in 1941 also.      At least until

1960, therefore, the post-war increase was merely a restoration of the

previous relative debt level.   For the next decade outstanding state

and local government debt grew little further in relation to the economy's

nonfinancial activity, and in the 19705 it has again declined to well within

its pre-war range.

        As Table 10 shows, the leveling of the state and local government debt

ratio in the 1960s and its decline in the 1970s stand in some contrast to

the relative size of state and local   gover~~ents'   non=inancial activity,

whi~h   continued to grow vigorously through both the 1950s and the 1960s, and

has leveled off but still not declined in the 1970s.      State and local

government spending has been the single most rapidly growing cornponent of

the nation's total spending since World War II.     The great surge in the

provision of local public services during this period. much of which was

associated with the needs created by the post-war baby boom, more than

doubled state and local governments' purchases of goods and services as a

share of the gross national product.    Only in the 1970s has this growth in

spending leveled off, as the demographics have shifted markedly and an

increasing number of communities have all but completed their basic social

capital installations including schools, hospitals, roads and sewers.

       The budget data in Table 10 also show that state and local governm8nts

on average have typically kept their total receipts, consisting primarily

of tax revenues and federal grants, rising in pace with their increasing

total expenditures -     including primarily purchases of goods and services,

plus small amounts of transfer       pa}~ents   and the excess of" interest paid
     .
over ~nterest      . d • 22
              rece1ve          Indeed, in the 1970s they have consistently run
             23
surpluses.        Hence state and local governments' borrowing, which has

consisted almost entirely of long-term debt, has served in large part to

finance these governments'     o~~   investment in financial instruments,

especially Treasury securities.        In 1978, however, the federal government

eliminated the right of state and local         goverp~ents   to earn a positive

"spread" by issuing tax exempt (and therefore lm...er yield) securities in

order to hold (without paying taxes) higher yielding Treasury securities.

Hence the relationship between state and local         gover~ments'   debt issues and

their budget surpluses or deficits may well become closer in the future than

it has been in the recent past.

       Foreign Borrowers.     Foreign borrowers have played a relatively small,

though growing, role in the American financial markets throughout the post-
       . d • 24
war per10         During the late 1950s and early 1960s, discussions of the

American balance of payments deficit, which people were just then corning to

perceive as a problem, often focused on the strength of the American

financial markets and on their ability to extend credit to finance the

growth of world trade and development.          Even so, as the memorandum column of

Table 3 indicates, outstanding debt issued by foreigners in the American

markets first equalled 5% of this country's gross national product only in

1963, and it peaked at an only slightly higher ratio after the imposition of
                                       -27-


capital controls the next year.     Moreover, throughout this period and into

the 1970s, about half of the foreign borrowing here took the form of loans

from the federal government rather than funds advanced by private investors.

Foreign debt in American markets di.d not again reach the 1964 level (in

relation to gross national product) until 1974, after the removal of the

capital controls.   The subsequent growth has remained modest through 1978,

although the increasing   amo~~t   of developing country debt owed to American

banks has recently raised widespread questions about these banks' exposure

to risks associated with foreign lending.

        It is interesting to speculate about whether foreign borrowing would

have been a more important activity in Anlerican markets but for the

restrictive government actions taken in the 19605 to prevent capital outflows

in the interest of maintaining a stronger dollar.         From 1964 until 1974 the

Interest Equalization Tax effectively prohibited the sale in the United

States of debt securities issued by foreign borrowers other than Canadian

provinces and international institutions like the World Bank, and from 1965

until 1974 the Federal Reserve's so-called Voluntary Foreign Credit Restraint
                                                     25
program limited lending abroad by American banks.           These two restrictions

along with the Commerce Department's Office of Foreign Direct        Inv~stment


program, which from 1965 to 1974 required a~erican companies to finance abroad

whatever funds they were investing abroad, and the advent of effective interest

ceilings on domestic deposits (discussed in Section IV below) -- probably

provided the chief impetus to the rapid development of the Eurodollar and Euro-

bond markets.    Without these capital controls foreign borrowers almost certainly

would have done more financing in American markets, and might have done much

more.    Since the removal of capital controls the volume of both American banks'

lending abroad and foreign issues in the American bond market has picked up
                                    -28-



sharply, but the Euro markets, now that they are well established, remain
                •                                                       26
the major immediate source of dollar credits to most foreign borrowers.

In retrospect it is clear that the capital flow restrictions imposed in the

19605 had the effect of enhancing the competitive position of, for      exa~ple,


the London financial markets over those in New York.

      Federal Government.   The federal government's reliance on the American

financial markets during the post-war period has largely constituted a

return to the experience of the 1920s after the aberration of the depression

and the war years.   After World War II the   gover~~ent's   outstanding debt

fell steadily in relation to gross national product until the mid 19705 -

from 119% in 1945 to 56% in 1955, 37% in 1965, and a low of 25% in 1974.

Although the federal government's budget has rarely been in surplus, only

during the years 1949, 1953 and 1975-76 did the impact of business recessions

on tax revenues and transfer payments enlarge the deficit to such an extent

that the government did not "pay down" the public debt in relation to (tempo-

rari1y shrunken) nonfinancial activity.    Nevertheless, the other post-war

recessions -- in 1957-58, 1960-61 and 1969-70 --. did produce some slowing,

though not a reversal, of the overall post-war decline in the      goverr~ent'~


debt ratio.   The combined effect of the relati.vely mild 1969-70 recession

and the especially severe 1973-75 recession has been   011   balance to halt much

of the decline of the public debt ratio in the 1970s, although the government

budget projections for 1979-81 that are available as of the time of writing

suggest that this decline may now be in progress once again.

financial needs to its nonfinancial activity.     Apart from a one-time jump at

recessions, federal expenditures have         groT~   slowly but steadily in relation

to gross national product throughout the post-war period.            Within the

overall total, however, the mix between transfer payments and direct

purchases of goods and services has radically changed.            Except for a brief

bulge during the vietnam tvar years, the share of gross national product

claimed by federal goods and services purchases has fallen ever since the

early 19505.      By contrast, during this same period federal transfers --

including grants to state and local governments, Social Security benefits

and all other income support payments -- have risen even more rapidly in

relation to gross national product.       As a result, total expenditures (which

also include the excess of interest paid over interest received) have grown

modestly in relative size, and their composi.tion is no·.... nearly two-thirds

transfers and only one-third direct purchases instead of the reverse twenty
             27
years ago.

      The federal government typically enlarges its portfolio of directly

held financial assets only slowly, so that its borrowing primarily reflects

the difference bet\oleen its total expenditures and its total receipts from

tax revenues and Social Security contributions.            After a large surplus during

the late 19405 and a small deficit during the Korean War years, the federal

government's budget was in balance on average during the late 1950s.              Since

then the budget deficit has averaged 0.5% of the gross national product

during the 19605, nearly 2% during the early 1970s and more than 2% during

1976-78.     Even after allowance for   L~e    enlargement of the deficit due to the

severe 1973-75 recession, the federal budget deficit has shown a slow but

steady tendency to grow in relation to the economy's nonfinancial activity.28

The result has been the continual slowing -- and in 1975-76 the temporary
                                      -30-



reversal -- of the 'decline in the federal debt ratio that has dominated the

post-war period thus far.,

      The maturity composition of the debt issued by the federal government

has also changed substantially during t.'1e p.")st-war period, as Table 12 shows_

Federal debt management policy has not only stood in contrast to the pattern

of wartime financing but has also undergone several sharp breaks within the

post-war years.   Especially since   L~e   Federal Reserve System's abandonment

of bond price stabilization at the beginning of the 19505, post-war debt

management has mostly emphasized short-term rather than long-term financing,

driving the mean maturity of the outstanding federal debt down from 113

months in 1946 to a low of only 33 months in 1976.       In two distinct periOdS,

however, debt management has gone the other way_      During the early 1960s

the government lengthened its outstanding debt, from a mean maturity of 50

months in September, 1960, to 65 months in January, 1965. 29      In addition,

beginning in 1976 and continuing through the t.ime of writing, the     gove~nment


has been lengthening its debt once again.      The increase in mean maturity

from 33 months in January, 1976, to 43 months as of September, 1.979,

represents about as rapid a rate of increase as the rate of decrease that

predornina'ted on average during the previous thirty years.

III.        . in the Working of the Financial Markets
        Chanaes

        How have the American financial markets in the post-war period met

the changing needs that the economy has placed on them?                              In any well

developed financial system it is useful to distinguish the liability issuing

and asset holding activity which takes place directly between nonfinancial

participants in the economy, whose respective principal busi.ness interests

lie elsewhere, from that which takes place through an intermediary whose

principal business is financial transactions themselves.                              In general, changes

in how financial markets work to meet the requirements of the nonfinancial

economy may represent some combination of changes in the economy's overall

degree of intermediation and changes in how the intermediaries go about

their business.       In fact both aspects together have accounted for changes

in the American financial system during the post-war era.


A.     The Advance of Financial Intermediation

        T~roughout    their history, but more so during the twentieth century and

especially in the years since World War II, the American financial markets

have undergone a shift a'Nay from direct transactions between nonfinancial

The development of the commercial banking system and of                             ~~e   life insurance

industry in earlier years, and more recently the great expansion of nonbank

deposit institutions and both private and public sector pension funds, have

been important features of the development of the American financial system.

         In the post-war period the continuation and even acceleration of the

trend toward intermediated financial markets has hardly been independent of

the simultaneous rise in the economy's reliance on privately issued debt.

                                                                       31
Instead, the two developments have been natural counterparts.               In
                   .
comparison with default-free government obligations, risky private

securities impose both information and transactions costs that encourage

the economy' s   developm~~nt   of financial intermediaries.     Holders (or

potential holders) of private securities must first discover the specific

risks that individual claims against private issuers entail, and then

monitor these risks on an ongoing basis.         These informati.on costs are

especially large in the case of negotiated loans like home mortgages,

consumer credit, and bank loans to businesses.           Not only economies of scale

but also the advantages of specialization favor delegating this information

gathering and processing function to third parties.           An equally important

function performed by financial intermediaries holding private securities

is the pooling of specific risks.        In transforming the direct claims that

they hold into the indirect claims that they issue, intermediaries economize

on transactions costs so as to facilitate diversification by enabling

investors to own interests (indirectly) in a large          n~~er   of imperfectly

divisible assets.      In addition, by pooling many individuals' and businesses'

needs for liquidity, deposit       inte~Tllediaries   often change the risk

characteristics of the aggregate of assets to be held by issuing claims

(often explicit or implicit demand claims) that have a shorter maturity than

the claims that they in turn hold.        Similarly, pension and insurance inter-

mediaries change the aggregate risk structure that insured parties face by

pooling actuarial risks.

       Individuals are the principal nonfinancial holders of assets that

represent direct claims on other nonfinancial participants in the economy.

Individuals' continued willingness to hold such assets therefore constitutes
                                          -33-



a retardant to the advance of financial intermediation, while their

reluctance to   perfor~m   this   f~~ction   creates the basic need for intermediation.

aggregate holdings of deposit-type liabilities of financial intermediaries

have grown continually from the early 1950s to the late 19705, not only

absolutely but in relation to overall nonfinancial economic activity (and

personal income).      Households' claims on insurance and pension reserves have

also grown on balance during the post-war years, although here the growth has

been less steady because of the effect of equity price changes on the valuation

of these reserves       (see again Figure 3).       By contrast, households' direct

holdings of nonintermediated debt have declined in relative terms almost

continually since World War II, and their direct holdings of equity claims

on business corporations have varied mostly with equity price fluctuations,

e~1ibiting little overall relative trend. 33 Since the total size of
households' financial asset portfolios in relation to gross national product

has also   sho~~   no overall trend -- first declining during the immediate

post-war years, then rising sharply in the 1950s, remaining steady through

the 19605, and declining in the 1970s -- these patterns of growth and decline

in comparison to gross national product also correspond, for the post-war

period as a whole, to growth or decline in shares of households' total

portfolio.

      Households' increasing preference for claims on intermediaries has

appeared even more pronounced from the perspective of their accumulation of

financial assets.     Table 13 shows households' net acquisition of various

categories of financial assets, both in dollars and as a share of the total.

The two features of households' investment behavior that stand out most

sharply here are the dominance of deposits throughout the post-war period

and the change that took place at the end of the 1950s in households' net

investment in corporate equities.   Households purchased more equity shares

in corporations than they sold in every year during 1946-57, so that the

tripling in value of their direct "equity holdings over this period

represented the combined result of capital gains and positive net purchases.

By contrast, households have sold more direct equity shares than they have

purchased in every year since 1958, so that capital gains have accounted for

more than all of the subsequent increase in total   ~~lue   of their direct

equity holdings.   Moreover, allowing for the shift from direct ownership of

equities to indirect ownership via mutual funds does not alter the

fundamental picture of individuals' investment behavior.      Households in the

aggregate were net purchasers of mutual fund shares during the rise of that

industry in the 1960s, but not in sufficient quantity to offset the

liquidation of their direct equity holdings.   More recently, they have been

net sellers of both direct equity holdings and mutual fund shares in every

year since 1972.   The conclusion remains that equity price movements have

accounted for more than all of any increase in the value of individuals'

equity holdings.   Because equity prices have fluctuated widely but shown

little net gain in nominal terms since the mid 1960s (see again Figure 3),

individuals' aggregate equity portfolio has therefore shown no trend movement in

nominal value and has declined in relative value during the last decade and more.

      The shift of individuals' investment flows away from equities during

the second half of the post-war period probably reflects several considerations

in addition to the economies of scale and risk pooling noted above as general
                                           -35-



advantages of intermediation.          Changing   bir~~   rates, age distributions, and

income levels have all played some role.           The increasing government provision

of health, education and income security benefits has also altered the

objectives associated with saving for many people.             The growing importance

of workers' claims on future pension benefits, including job-specific

pensions in both the private and public sectors and also Social Security,

has in particular changed many people's need to accumulate assets directly

                      ,       34        Finally, perceptions of the relative returns

and risks -- including especially inflation risk -- associated with different

assets have also changed markedly during the post-war period.              After the

unpegging of bond prices in 1951, fixed-income securities became subject to

market risk in addition to inflation risk, and in the 1970s the inflation

risk has increased dramatically.          As for equities, during most of ·the 1950s

and 1960s, renewed confidence in economic stability and prosperity lessened

fears of any collapse of values comparable to that of 1929-33, and in
                                                                                       35
addition. many people regarded them as a "hedge" against price inflation.

advance a substantial amount of direct credit, both to individuals in the

form of installment and other consumer credit, and to each other in the

form of trade credit and commercial paper.           Even with the ready availability

of business credit cards and charge accounts, however, commercial banks and

finance companies have increasingly dominated the consumer credit field.

The share of outstanding consumer credit owed to nonfi.nancial businesses

(including corporations and others) has fallen from just over one-third in

the early 1950s to just under one-sixth in the 1970s.            In addition, business

lending via purchases of nonfinancial commercial paper has remained

relatively small, so that trade credit -- typically equal to 15-18% of the

gross national product, and mostly borrowed and lent within the corporate

sector -- remains the primary vehicle for businesses' holdings of direct

claims on nonfinancial obligors.

        Foreign investors have held a small but growing share.of direct clai.ms

has transferred assets abroad, especially to member           cOQ~tries   of

small base, however, so that foreign holdings still represented less than

5% of all direct claims against American nonfinancial obligors as of yearend

1978.    Nevertheless, the concentration of foreign (especially foreign

official) investments in specific instruments has made foreign holdings of

particular importance in some American markets.            The yearend 1978 share of

federal government securities held abroad, for example, was nearly one-sixth.

         Figure 5 indicates "the extent to which the increasing preference for

claims on intermediaries by individuals (and. to a lesser extent, other

nonfinancial investors) has shifted to       inte1~ediaries   the task of meeting

the needs that nonfinancial participants in the economy have brought to the

American financial markets.     As of 1978 individuals in the aggregate

remained the largest single class of holders of direct claims on nonfinancial

borrowers and share issuers -- but only by virtue of their continuing

domination of the ownership of corporate equities.       Because the direct

claims that individuals hold consist overwhelmingly of equities (see again

Figure 4), the household share of oWllership of the total of direct claims

outstanding has varied with fluctuations in equity prices.          Overall, however,

the household share has declined, as has the share held by all other

nonfinancial investors.     As the share of direct claims on nonfinancial

entities held by all nonfinancial investors has declined, the share held by

financial intermediaries has correspondingly risen.        Intermediaries' holdings

first accounted for the majority of all direct claims outstanding in the

American financial markets in 1969, and they have remained the majority ever

since.

         Table 15 presents flow data indicating the even      s~ronger   post-war

dominance of intermediaries in meeting the funds required each year

by nonfinancial participants in the economy.       Here the main difference from

the pattern indicated in Figure 5 is that these data exclude equity capital

gains, which constituted most of the increase in households' equity holdings

until the late 19605 and more than all of the increase since then.           Apart

from accumulating capital gains on equities, individuals and other private

domestic nonfinancial investors have played only a small and shrinking

role in meeting directly the needs that nonfinancial entities have brought to the
                       39
financial markets.           In large part because of the growing fraction of those

needs that have come in the form of debt issued by private borrowers, non-

financial investors have instea.d acctL.'11ulated claims on intermediaries and

have left to them the task of directly allocating the economy's financial

resources.


B.   The Role of Specific Intermediaries

       The advance of intermediation in the post-war period has hardly been

uniform.     The specialization of American financial intermediaries has

inevitably led to some playing more important roles than others, and some

experiencing more rapid growth than others, as the needs and objectives of

both.borrowers and lenders have changed and as government interventions have

(intentionally or otherwise) favored first one kind of institution and then

another.

       Commercial Banks.         Tne commercial banking system has long stood at the

center of economists' interest in financial markets.          Even today, despite

nearly two decades of increasing emphasis on nonbank intermediaries in

of the economy to professional evaluations of monetary         poli~1   often proceed

as if commercial banks were the only intermediaries in the financial markets.

This emphasis on the commercial banking system is understandable in part, in

view of the special role that banks play in the monetary policy process by

virtue of their relationship to the Federal Reserve System.          In addition, in

the past commercial banks were more dominant in financial market activity

than they are today.          Before World War II banks' assets and liabilities
                                              -39-



dwarfed those of other intermediaries, and before passage of the Glass-

steagall Act in 1933 commercial banks also dominated the American securities
             41
business.         Until as recently as the early 1970s, conwercial banks enjoyed

a monopoly on the right to issue checkable             d~posits.


         Since World War II the American commercial banking system has

approximately held its own in relation to the scale of nonfinancial economic

activity, but it has not participated in the economy's overall post-war

expansion of intermediation.             The approximate stability of the banking

system's relative size is apparent in Figure 5, and also in the data on

commercial banks' assets and liabilities presented in Table 16.

The total size of the banking system in relation to gross national product

has shown essentially no trend during the post-war period.              Put the other

way around, as Figure 6 shows, there has been little post-war trend

in the "income velocity" of the broad M2 money stock, which consists of most

commercial bank deposit liabilities (plus the public's currency holdings),

or in     th~   corresponding income velocity of bank credit, which consists of

         commerc~a                                   This relative stability (actually a

slow decline) in the post-war period stands in marked contrast to              ~~e   pre-war

years when,over nearly a century, the size of the banking system continually
                                                        43
grew in relation to gross national product.

         Within    ~~e   stability of the overall totals, however, the post-war years

have also seen substantial shifts in composition on both sides of the

banking system's balance sheet.             Among bank assets, the most significant

development of the post-war period has been the recovery of bank loan

portfolios and hence the general resumption of banks' traditional role as

"inside" intermediaries.     In 1929 loans constituted 73% of bank credit.

During the depression and then the war years, however, the fall-off in

private debt issuing meant that, for all practical purposes, there was little

or no loan business to be had.     By contrast, the federal governrr~nt was then

issuing debt in record volume, and banks participated in financing it.              By

1935 banks' securities investments exceeded their loan portfolios, and in

1945 investments constituted 79% of bank credit.          Commercial   b~.ks   simply

were no longer very commercial.      The years since 1946 have largely consisted

of a reversal of the 1930-45 pattern, with bank loans exceeding securities

investments in 1957 for the first time in more than two decades and reaching

73% of total bank credit as of yearend 1978.

      In rebuilding their loan portfolios and de-emphasizing their invest-

ments, banks have also both altered the mix of their lending business and

changed the character of their securities holdings.          Although banks remain

a principal source of business credit, and commercial and industrial loans

are still the largest single category of bank lending, they no longer

dominate bw.k loan portfolios as they once did.           Instead, mortgage credit

and other   cons~~er   loans now comprise nearly one-third of the total.

Especially during the second half of the post-war period, the widespread use

of bank-issued credit cards has been a major factor in banks' development of

their consumer lending business.     Moreover,   ~1lOng   business loans per se, the

larger banks have increasingly become a major factor in the intermediate-

term credit market through the use of explicitly longer maturity loans (in

some cases up to ten years) and revolving credits of an implicitly ongoing

nature.     Total bank investments have grown slowly since World War II, but

because of tax incentives banks have so concentrated their investments on
                                         -41-



state and local government issues that, for a few years in the early 1970s,
                                                                                44
theyhe1d more of these securities than of federal         goverr~ent    debt.

      Among bank liabilities, the two most significant changes that have

occurred during the post-war period have been the continual decline of               de~and


balances and increase of time and saving deposits, relative to ei·ther total

bank liabilities or gross national product, and the "liability management

revolution" that has greatly increased the larger banks' reliance on "bought

funds."    As Figure 6 shows, the income velocity of the narrow Ml money stock,

consisting of currency plus demand deposits, has about tripled over the post-

war years as a result of a combination of influences including economies of

scale in the public's holding of cash balances, the secular rise in nominal

interest rates, and the increasingly widespread use of credit cards and
                      45
charge    acco~~ts.        This persistent trend increase in M1 velocity stands in

sharp contrast to either the absence of any trend during 1910-30 or the

steeply declining trend during 1930-45.         Hence only   b~e   strong growth of time

and savings deposits, including the new negotiable certificates of deposit

that first came into existence in 1961, has accounted for the much slower

post-war increase in the income velocity of M2.         Large banks' growing use of

such liabilities as certificates of deposit, federal funds, Eurodollar

borrowings, commercial paper issues, repurchase agreements and so on --

instruments that in some cases represent the development of new financial

markets since World War II -- has not only changed banks' balance sheets but

also facilitated a major change in the feasible aggressiveness of bank lending

practices.     The enormous post-war expansion of bank loan portfolios, which

banks have achieved in part through the competitive use of such devices as

loan commitments and medium-term credits, would probably have been irnpossible
                                      -42-



if banks had simply continued to follow the classic practice of treating

their deposits (and other liabilities) as deternrined by outside forces.

      Finally, it is useful to point out explicitly that because of changes

in commercial bank organization, especially during the 1960s, tlle represen-·

tation of banks as having merely held their own during the post-war increase

in the American economy's degree of financial intermediation relative to

econornic activity risks understating by a wide margin the growing overall

presence of commercial banks in the financial system.        After falling by more

than one-half between 1920 and 1935, the number of American commercial banks

has remained roughly steady at about 14,000.      The number of bank branches,

however, has risen from some 4,000 to over 32,000 during the post-war years,

with rrQst of this growth occurring since 1960.     Moreover, especially since

the 1970 Amendments to the Bank Holding Company Act, banks have increasingly
                                                                                     46
gone into activities other than their traditional loan and deposit business.

Although their direct participation in financial intermediation has not kept

pace with the rising post-war trend, commercial banks have increasingly

enhanced their importance as more nearly full-service financial institutions.

      Nonbank Deposit Institutions.     As is clear from Figure 5, one group of

intermediaries that has accounted for much of the post-war increase in

American financial intermediation has been the nonbank deposit institutions

including savings and loan associations, mutual savings banks, and credit

unions.   ~ne   public's strong demand for   consumer-tx~e   time and savings

deposits has kept these institutions growing rapidly, not just absolutely

but in .relation to economic activity, during most of the post-war period.       In

fact, as Figure 6 shows, their growth has even been great enough to offset

the relative decline of the commercial banking system, so that the income
                                    -43-



velocity of the M3 money stock, consisting of       ~12   plus nonbank deposits, has

shown a modest downward trend since the beginning of the data series in 1959.

Moreover, when extrapolated backward this trend appears to have been a

continuation of the downward trend associated with M2 during the pre-war era

when nonbank deposit institutions were not of major importance •

and combined asset holdings of the three major groups of nonbank deposit

institutions, first in relation to gross national product and then as a

share of the total assets of the three groups of institutions together.               The

vast post-war expansion of the savings and loan industry stands out clearly

here.   Between the early post-war years and the 1970s outstanding savings

and loan shares more than quadrupled as a percentage of gross national

product.   By 1978 the amount of these shares equaled more than twice the

amount of mutual savings bank deposits and credit union shares combined, and

also equaled about five-sixths of the      amo~~t   of consumer-type time and

savings deposits held at   co~~ercial   banks.   In comparison with mutual savings

banks, the primary factor underlying the more rapid growth of savings and

loan associations has probably been mere geography; mutual savings banks are

overwhelmingly concentrated in a few states, especially New York and

Massachusetts, which have experienced slower than average economic growth

during the post-war period.   In comparison with commercial banks, the primary

factor has probably been the effect of government regulation, in that savings

and loan associations did not face deposit interest rate ceilings until 1965

and have enjoyed a one-fourth percent differential over          co~mercial   banks

since then.   The growth of credit unions has been even faster than that of

savings and loan associations, but credit unions constitute another example

of rapid growth from a small base, and they remain by far the smallest of

the three groups of insti.tutions.      Mutual savings banks are alone among the

three groups in having failed to do more than grow in pace with economic

activity.    Although mutual savings banks were twice as large as savings and

loan associations at the end of World War II, savings and-loans were equal

in size in 1954 and more than three times as large by 1978.

       Because all of these nonbank deposi.t institutions operate under legal

and regulatory constraints governing the disposition of their asset

portfolios, their aggregate contribution to meeting the financial needs of

nonfinancial participants in the economy"has followed a fairly predictable

pattern.    Savings and loan associations and mutual savings banks typically

invest some 80% and 70% of their assets in mortgages, respectively, so that

these two groups together have become the nation's leading provider of

mortgage lending.      As   of yearend 1978 savings and loans and mutual savings

banks together held 45% of all outstanding mortgages (in comparison to 18%

for   cc~~ercial   banks, the next largest class of holders).    These institutions

are especially predominant in the market for single-family home mortgages,

accounting for 55% of yearend 1978 loans outstanding.        Credit unions, by

contrast, have traditionally invest.?d most of their. assets in     conSQ~er


installment loans, and by 1978 they accounted for 14% of the outstanding

consumer credit.

       As the discussion in Section IV below emphasizes, the history of

~~erican    nonbank deposit institutions in the post-war period has been in

large part a story of evolving financial regulation, including restrictions

on these intermediaries' liability issuing as well as their. asset holding.

In this context, what may well turn out to be two of the most important
                                        -45-



changes affecting nonbank financial institutions within the post-war era

are only just in progress at the time of writing.       The first is the sudden

acceleration of the erosion of the deposit interest rate ceilings these

institutions have faced si.nce the mid 1960s, follm.,ring the introduction in

mid 1978 of "money market certificates" bearing yields set in relation to

those on Treasury bills.      Just by late 1979 -- that is, after less than

eighteen months -- these new deposit certificates accounted for more than

one-fourth of all deposits at savings and loan institutions and almost one-

fourth at mutual savings banks.        The second change is the expansion of authority

to issue interest-bearing checkable deposits, which nonbank deposit institutions

and commercial banks in the New England states received in several steps

during 1972-76, and the extension of which to the rest of the country is to be

decided by Congress by 1980.      Both checking account authority and the freedom

from deposit interest rate ceilings are likely to increase greatly the demand

for claims on nonbank deposit intermediaries, "although the impact of. the

latter on these institutions' cash flows (and even solvency in some cases)

makes it a   mi~ed   blessing in the short run.

      ~ondeposit     Intermediaries.   Finally, as is also apparent from Figure 5,

a significant part of the post-war increase in the American economy's degree

of financial intermediation has stemmed from neither commercial banks nor

nonbank deposit institutions but, instead, from intermediaries that

issue only nondeposit claims.      There are many forms of such intermediaries

operating in the American markets, but the most familiar and important among

them include life and casualty insurance companies, private and public sector

pension funds, independent consumer finance companies and the "captive"

finance companies of nonfinancial businesses, equity and money market mutual

funds, real estate investment trusts, and security brokers and dealers.

      Table 18 presents data, analogous to that shown above for the nonbank

deposit institutions, for three specific categories of nondeposit inter-

me d··~ar~es:

local government pension funds.        The reason for focusing in particular on

these three groups is not only that they are the largest of the nondeposit
                                         ,           .
intermediaries but also that their respective post-war experience reflects

some interesting contrasts.        Because the low interest rates implicitly paid

on the savings component of ordinary life insurance has increasingly favored

the use of group and other term insurance policies, life insurance companies'

total assets held and liabilities outstanding grew little relative to gross

national product during the first half of the post-war period, and since then

they have been declining in relative terms.        Moreover, the relative decline

in these companies' life insurance business has been even more pronounced,

in that their growth in recent years has consisted disproportionately of

pensionmor~es which    they manage for other businesses.      As of yearend 1978

pension reserves constituted nearly one-third of life insurance companies'

total liabilities, up from less than one-tenth in the early post-war years.

       By contrast,   r~th   private and public sector pensions have   ex~erienced


extraordinarily rapid growth throughout these years.         Tax incentives at both

the individual and corporate levels, business personnel policies aimed at

reducing worker turn-over, features of the collective bargaining process, and

other corporate financial objectives have all combined to favor the

mushrooming of private pension liabilities since World War II.         During most

of this period, however, businesses had (and many used) broad latitude to

incur pension liabilities without funding them.          The 1974 Employee Retirement

has been especially great during the 1970s when many private pension funds'

asset portfolios, of which in the aggregate about two-thirds is invested in

equities, have suffered an erosion in market value.

        State and local government pensions, including both teachers' and

other employees' funds, have experienced similar post-war growth.              Public

sector workers have the same tax incentive to use the pension mechanism to

spread income beyond retirement as do private sector workers.             Although

public sector employers do not have the same tax incentives as do private

businesses, in many cases 1:!'"le political process has probably favored the use

of pension compensation over current compensation, especially when there is

no pressure to raise tax or other revenues immediately to fund the accumu-

lating pension liabilities.          In fact public sector pension funds have been and

remain substantially underfunded, so that the asset data shown in Table 18
                                                     50
greatly understate their liabilities also.                The continued growth of public

sector pensions' assets during the 1970s, in contrast to private pensions,

reflects merely the smaller share of assets invested in equities              (about one-

third in the aggregate) rather than any difference in funding practices.

       The asset mix of these insurance and pension intermediaries _.- and
                       .
hence their role in financing economic activity -- has also undergone

important changes since World War II.               Regulatory changes in the 1960s

allowed many life insurance       comp~lies    to increase the equity portion of

their portfolios, and since the mid 1960s life insurers have largely

withdra~m     from direct home mortgage lending.           State and local governmept

pension funds and especially private pension funds have even more

dr:<1U\latically increased the equity share of their investments.            Consequently,

these nondeposit intermediaries have increasingly become a major source of

both debt and equity funds for corporate businesses.               As a result

of these portfolio changes, together with the rapid growth of pensions and

the (relative) stagnation of the commercial banking system, insurance

companies and pension funds combined have              increasing~y   dominated   bap~s   as

holders of claims on the American corporate business·· sector -- despite

banks' post-war emphasis on loans over investments in government securities.

In   L~e   early post-war years these intermediaries held only slightly more

claims on     t.~e   corporate sector than did commercial banks, but by the 19705

they held more than twice as much.

           It is also important to distinguish the claims on business held by

banks, which are overwhelmingly in the form of short- to medium-term loans,

from the corresponding claims held by insurance companies and pension funds,

which consist mostly of long-term debt and equity securities.                 These       non-

deposit intermediaries have traditionally held some three-fourths of all

outstanding corporate bonds, and in recent years they have also cQme to hold

nearly one-sixth of all corporate equity.               The flow data shown in Tables 19

and 20 give a further idea of these investors' importance in                p~oviding      long-

term debt and equity capital to American business corporations.         In addition

to accounting for much or all of the corporate sector's net long-term bond

financing throughout the post-war period, since 1960 they have also accounted

for more than all of its equity financing I absorbing also t.he equity holdings

liquidated by the household sector.     In sum, businesses' equity and bond

financing has become increasingly dominated by these investors.         Given their

high rates of portfolio turn-over, especially in comparison with individuals,

equity and bond trading has become even more so.


C.   Financial Innovation and the Advance of   v~rket   Efficiency

      with individuals doing less of the direct lending in the American

financial markets and specialized intermediaries doing more, it is not

surprising that many aspects of the working of these markets have changed

during the post-war years, and that most of these changes have tended to

reduce or eliminate barriers to the transfer of financial resources and

thereby to render the financial system more effici.ent than before.        One

example of this evolution has been individuals' increasing ability to

diversify their holdings via mutual funds, pensions and mortgage pools.

Another has been their i.ncreased ability to escape interest rate ceilings

via negotiable certificates of deposit or money market certificates,

~4d minim~~   size requirements via money market mutual funds.       Still another

has been their ability to invest abroad (or for businesses to borrow abroad)

as legal barriers have fallen.    Especially in conjunction with      i~~ovations


exploiting new physical technologies, post-war changes in financial inter-

mediation have reduced many of the barriers and frictions that interfere

with the capital allocation process.

      At least four kinds of friction reducing changes bear explicit attention.
                                          -50-


First, wholly apart from the effective reduction of transactions costs

associated with i.ncreased intermediation, marginal transactions costs in both

the direct and the indirect'senses have fallen irregularly throughout the

post-war period.       The fee typically charged for negotiated underwritings of

high grade corporate bonds, for example, declined from $10 or more per $1000

bond in the early post-war years to $8.75 per bond in the late 1950s and has

remained unchanged at that level ever since, although underwriting fees for

competitively bid bond issues have fallen more        substCL~tially   in recent year.s.

Bid-asked spreads have fallen from $2.50 or $5.00 to $1.25 or even $0.625

per bond for actively traded government bonds, and the feasible size of trans-

action at the quoted prices has increased substantially for both government

and corporate bonds.         Bid-asked spreads for equity issues traded on the New

York Stock Exchange have also declined to a typical $0.25 or $0.125 per

share for most issues, instead of the $0.375 per share that was more

prevalent some years ago.         Effective equity brokerage fees have typically

fallen as well, especially for larger trades, although under the fixed minimum

cowndssion system the reductions usually took the 'form of indirect rebates

and services provided.         Since the Securities and Exchange Commission prohibited

fixed   rninim~~1   commission rates in 1975, average fees on large trades have

fallen from $0.15      pe~   share to only $0.08 per share (0.4% of principal value).

OVerall, as a result of natural competitive forces in the financial markets,

striking advances in electronic communications and data processing technology,

and specific regulatory actions, these and other direct transactions costs

have fallen sufficiently .that the markets for what are traditionally regarded

as "nonliquid" instruments now in fact provide substantial liquidity. 51,           In

addition, indirect transactions costs at the margin have fallen during the

post-war period as nonfinancial businesses have increasingly .invested in
                                    · -51-



sophisticated financial staffs, either "in-house" or on a retainer basis,

and individuals have gained substantially more financial knowledge also.

      A second change which has been related to the decline in transactions

costs, and whi.ch has also served' to make markets both more liquid a.'1d more

efficient in the sense of reducing barriers to financial allocations and

re-allocations, has been the increasing trend toward negotiability of

financial assets.   As table 21 shows, nonfinancial corporations and finance

companies have on balance increased the negotiability of -- and hence the

potential market for -- both their short-term and their long-term deht by

substituting commercial paper issues for bank loans and publicly offered

bonds for directly placed bonds.    In addition, a large part of the post-war

trend toward negotiability of financial assets has occurred through the

development of new financial instruments.    Commercial banks first introduced

the negotiable certificate of deposit in 1961, and by the mid 19iOs these

certificates accounted for some one-tenth of banks' total liabilities.      Bank

lending has also become more of a straightforward market transaction and less

closely tied to bank-customer relations, as in many cases commitment fees

have augmented or replaced deposit balances as criteria for extending credit,

and the greater flexibility provided by banks' liability    manage~ent   practices

has better enabled them to accommodate fluctuating business credit demands

(especially through the use of floating-rate loans).     The introduction of

exchange-traded options and financial futures markets has facilitated hedging

and speculating investment postures that previously were either impossible

to achieve or possible only via    expensive combinations of long and short

positions.   The development in the 1960s of a secondary mortgage market, and

the advent of mortgage-backed "pass-through" securities, has also rendered

home mortgages in effect negotiable and has correspondingly increased the




                                                                                     ". • '!'   ~

range of investors prepared to consider them.

      The graduaL and piecemeal removal of international barriers to financial

transactions, including the American actions already noted above as well as

corresponding actions by other countries, has been a third important factor

in the post-\oJar development of the American -    indeed,   th~   world _..   financial

system.    One part of this process -has simply been the development cf vieble

financial markets abroad.    Most European countries did not even have currency

convertibility for current transactions until 1958 (Japan not until 1964).

Convertibility for financial transactions has corne in individual pieces

since then, and it is still incomplete although there is now so r..uch

convertibility that massive short-run movements of short-term ce.pital hav·2

become a major problem in the international monetary system.          Si!1ce the

removal of the American capital controls, both American and foreign

borrowers may again choose whether to raise funds in the A!nerican mar}:et:s        O~~

k~erican   investors may choose whether to buy securities issued at home or

abroad.    Other countries have also gradually eliminated analogous capital

controls -    most recently the United Kingdom just in 1979.        All of these

developments have improved the markets' ability to allocate financia.l resour:::es

in comparison \'1ith the earlier situation in which banks' participatioI:. in the

Eurodollar market was the primary vehicle for international capital flows, or

even more the situation of the still earlier post-war years before the

reopening of foreign financial markets and the use of modern coromunications

technology to connect them wit.h the American markets.       In addition, as the

example of around-the-clock trading in Eurodollars and Asian dollars suggests,

the removal of international financial barriers has also even further enhanced

the overall negotiability of   ~any   financial assets.   The move to floating

essay, has also been an important part of this entire set of developments.

      Financial innovation per se -- whether due to technological, regulatory,

or entrepreneurial forces -- has constituted a fourth major source of post-

war change   enh~lcing   the efficiency of the   ~~erican   financial system.   Given

its low capital intensity and highly mobile (and well educated) labor force,

the financial industry is typically able to adopt innovations both more

cheaply and more rapidly than can, for exa'llple, manufacturing or other
             .
production l1nes   0   f b '
                         US1ness. 53   Many of the innovations that have been so

important in changing the structure and working characteristics of the

American financial markets have already appeared in the discussion above.

Other examples include such now standard instruments as leveraged leases,

variable-rate annuities, corporate bonds subject to call protection, and

floating-rate debt issues, as well as instruments that are only just now

corning into use like graduated-payment and variable-rate mortgages.

Additional markets li.ke those for federal funds and conunodity futures are

not new in the post-war period, but they now play a far greater role in          ~~e


financial system than ever before.        Adoption of modern electronic technology

has already facilitated such innovations as remote terminal banking, and far

reaching structural changes like the development of a semi-automated national

market system for equity trading, or the introduction of an electronic          f~~ds


transfer system for commercial banking, are now visible on the horizon

though not yet in place.       In every case, these innovations have acted to

reinforce the continual trend toward erosion of barriers and frictions that

has marked the evolution of the American financial markets since World War II.

      Despite this cataloguing of the reduction of costs and barriers that

have followed from the rise of intermediation together with innovation,
                                            -54-



however, it would be misleading to suggest that the American financial

system has yet (or will soon) realize economists' idealized conception of a

perfectly efficient mechanism for allocating financial resources.                Hany

imperfections remain.       Perhaps the most striking example of the funerican

financial markets' continuing shortcomings in this            rcsp~ct   is the failure,

despite the experience documented in Table 14, to provide an investment

vehicle that would - (presumably, for a price)         guarantc(~   the purchasing po;.;er

remains a relatively inflexible instrurr.ent despite recent innovations,55 tax

lock-ins remain important despite          L~e   changes in inheritance taxes in 1976

and in capital gains taxes in 1978, pension rights remain entirely illiquid,

and most individuals face severe liquidity constraints preventing their

borrowing against future income in the form of either wages or pension

benefits.   More generally, the gap between the interest rates that most

individuals earn on assets and pay on borrowings is very wide.                In sum, the

post-war trend has indeed been toward more efficient markets, but at least

as of 1979 there is much room left for further development.

IV.    Changes in the Role of Government

        In addition· to i.ts reliance on the financial market.s as a borrower

financing its current deficit, the federal government has played a nUrr~0r of

other roles in the development of the America.n financial markets since

World War II.      Regulatory actions and· tax policies have resulted in

significant impacts on how the financial markets have been able to do their

job.    The government's activities as a financial intermediary have affected

the allocation (and perhaps the total) of saving in                t..~e    economy.   The

monetary policy carried out by          L~e   Federal Reserve System has fundamentally

shaped the post-war course not only of the finar.cial markets but of the

economy as a \o,'hole.     In sum, despite the decline of the governnent' s role

as. a direct borrower, the broader changes at work during the post-war ern

have probably been in the direction of a growing overall influence of

government on the American financial markets.


A.     Deposit Insurance and Government Regulation

         The proliferation of the federal government's regulatory activities

since World War II has touched almost every part of the American economy,

                J...t·
an d h as b roug.. · J.mpor t an t an d .f ar reac!h"J.ng cnanges. 56      The financial markets

have been no exception in this regard.               Some of the most significant

innovations in financial market regulation came during the 1930s, as part of

the society's immediate reaction to the excesses of the 1920s and their

effects during the depression.           Others have corne since the war.              On both

counts, however, the post-war experience has been significantly different

from what went before.

         The single most important development along these lines during this
                                         -56-



century has been the almost universal adoption of deposit insurance following

the inception of both the Federal        Deposit Insurar..ce Corporation (FDIC)

and the Federal Savings and Loan Ir..surance Corr:oration in 1934.       Before 1934

the individual depositor had always to regard his deposit holdings asassd.s

subject to default risk, and the wave of bank failures during the early 1930s

dramatically dem:mstrated the potential impact of default not only on individuals'

perceptions, and hence their asset holding behavior, but also on nonfinancial

macroeconomic outcomes.   After 1934 depositors' losses due to bank failure

shrank quickly to miniscule proportion.         Bank failures and forced mergers,

of which there were hundreds each year during the 19205 and more than 1,000

in each year during 1930-33 (over 4,000 in 1933 alone), suddenly shrank to

the double-digit range in 1934 and into single digits per year by the end of

World War II.   Moreover, from 1934 until the mid 19705 what few bank failures

did occur were entirely concentrated among banks with less than $100        w~llion


in deposits, and nearly three-fourths of all failures were among banks with
                                    57
less than $1 million in deposits.          Even then, more often than not -- and

especially when a large bank has failed, as in 1974 --. the FDIC has arranged

either for a merger or for the assumption of the fai.led bank's valid assets

(and a corresponding share of its liabilities) by another bank, rather            th~~

simply pursuing liquidation, so that depositors have suffered no loss of

liquidity at all.   Even in cases of liquidation, the FDIC has typically

settled depositors' claims almost immediately.         In sum, the advent of deposit

insurance has fundamentally changed the nature of the American financial

markets.

      Federal regulation of banking has not been limited to that incidental to

the insurance of deposits.   The Federal Reserve System, the FDIC and the Comp-
                                          -57-



troller of the Currency have shared with the individual state banking             co~is-


sions the responsibili.ty for regulation and supervi.sion of comnercial banks.

Important aspects of these activities include inspecting bank operations (and

in particular the composition of bank portfolios),           r~ling   on bank merger

applications, and regulating the entra.nce of banks and bank holding corr.?anies

into activities beyond traditional banking businesses.            Because the fixed-

percentage pricing system for deposit         ins~rance   implicitly acts as a subsidy to

risk taking, it is possible that the role of bank inspection has been especially

important in limiting the risk level of bcnking, although the available evidence

~s
  .          on t h'~s         .
                         quest~on.
                                     58   Bank inspections have in any case become more

relevant for limiting risks as banks have moved heavily into international

transactions like exchange market trading and foreign lending.              In addition,

control over banks' applications to engage in nonbanking activities has

become more important as banks and their holding companies have increasingly

widened their scope to encompass leasing, credit cards, real estate,

insurance and other related activities.

      Growth of federal regulation in the post-war era has also extended

beyond banks    ~ld oL~er   deposit intermediaries.       The securities legislation

of the 19305, inc1udi.ng especi.ally the National Banking (Glass-Steagall) and

Securities Acts of 1933 and the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, not only

created a separate securities industry distinct from the commercial banking

system but also set down an elaborate set of rules governing securities

issuing and trading and established the Securities and Exchange Commission to

enforce them.    This legislation of course antedated World War II, but many of

its effects have appeared only after the war.         Disclosure requirements

increased, and have continued to increase throughout the post-war years.

Public utili.ty companies from 1941 and railroads from 19d4 were compelled

to seek competiti·"e bids on their new sec uri ties -- a pract.ice which over

time brought major changes in the structure of the investment banking
. d ustry. 59
:tn             l-1argin requirements for securities trading, set by "the Federal

Reserve under authority of the 1933     ~ct,      have remained at" or above 50% since

World War II -- an especially sharp contrast to the experience of the 19205.

Under the In"estrnent Advisor Act of 1940, the regulation of the post-war

securities industry has extended also to asset management as well as the

trading and issuing functions.      As of   L~e    time of writing,   t~e   Securities

and Exchange Commission is actively considering plans to restructure

securities trading so as to develop the nationwide market system mandated by

Congress in 1975, and it is possible that the implementation of such a

system would eventually even result in a dealer market's roplacing the

aucti.on market that has characterized most American stock exchanges for

nearly two centuries.

       Federal regulation of the financial markets has also affected non-

deposit intermediaries other than securities brokers and dealers.               The most

recent development along these lines, which bears potentially important

implications not just for the financial markets but also for the overall

amount and composition of saving in the American economy, is the regulation

of private pension funds under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act

of 1974.    In addition to the minimum pension funding standards already

discussed in Section III, this legislation further specified associated

fiducia~l   responsibilities for the management of pension funds' assets.                Even

within the first few years it has had a noticeable impact on both the              an~lli~t

of pension funding and the composition of pension investments.               Given the
                                       -59-



already increasing role of private,pensions in post-war financial inter-

mediation, as discussed above, these changes are of great potential

significance for the future.


B.   New Distortions in the Allocative Mechanism

        It would be surprising if the increase since World War II in the

presence of government, both in the financial markets and more broadly in

the economy as a whole, had not brought with it at least some distortions

in the economy's allocative mechanism.        In fact, as the post-war period has

advanced, government actions have directly or indirectly         introd~ced num~rous


distortions in the financial system's allocation of capital.          Several of

these distortions, like the restrictions on international capital flows, have

already figured in the discussion of Sections II and III.          Nevertheless, it

is important to note specifically two aspects of       t~e   distortion of capital

allocations t..hat have been particularly inportant since World Har II and

have differentiated this period from the pre-war experience.

        The National Banking Act of 1933 introduced deposit interest rate

ceilings, in part as a response to banks' alleged overly aggressive bidding

for interbank demand deposits during the 1920s.        The ceilings have also

applied to other demand deposi,ts as well as time and saving deposits, however,

so that they have also served as an anti-competitive device to subsidize            bar~

profits and bank borrowers at the expense of bank depositors.          Given the.

post-war changes in the pattern of deposit holding reviewed in Section III,

the main focus of these ceilings, imposed under the Federal Reserve's

Regulation Q and analogous regulations governing nonbank intermediaries, came

to be   cons~~er-type   time and savings deposits.    Moreover, given the growing
                                          -60-



role of nonbank intermediaries both in issuing such deposits and in mortgage

lending t the subsidy has mostly either passed to homeO'.·;ners or bolstered the
                                                 _           60
lending institutions' (usually inaccessible) reserves.

         Apart fremthe long-run average subsidy transferred from depositors to

mortgage borrowers, however, the chief effect of deposit interest rate

ceilings has been the introduction of severevblatility into both inter-

mediation and homebuilding through the interaction of these ceilings with

the cyclical pattern of short-term interest rate        m~vcmcnts.   A wholly new

post-war phenomenon, experienced for t:!1e first tir:le when interest rates on

readily avai.lable open market investment instruments rose above the

prevailing savings deposit ceilings in 1966, ·....as the widespread withdrawal

of deposits from both banks and nonbank dej?Osit internediaries.         This

"disintermediation" then led to reduced n:ortgage lending, which after so:ne

lag led in turn to a decline in residential construction activity.          As

Figure 7 shows, this pattern has subsequently recurred in 1969-70 and in

1973-74, with increasing     severit~i   except tha.t in more recent episodes government-

sponsored intermediaries have increasingly supplemented the funds lost to the

mortgage market.    Nevertheless, the net result has been the introduction of

sufficient   ~olatility   into the residential construction industrj that the

decline in housing activity induced in this manner has typically been a major

element in post-war economic downturns.

         The second major post-war distortion in the financial markets' capital

allocation mechanism has come from taxes, and in particular from the inter-

action of taxes with the more rapid price inflation of the later post-war

years.    The federal government was constitutionally prohibited from

imposing income taxes until after passage of the Sixteenth Amendment in 1913,

and tax rates remained        iowby   today~s standards untii World War It.            After

the great increase institut~d;to firiance the war, tax ra.tes have fallen only

slowly during the posi;-war period.         tn addition, the effect of inflation

over time has been to lower the real iricome level associated with the highi.:'r
    .                    61
marg1nal tax rates.

        More importantly, however, because the income tax applies to nominal

asset returns -        including gains in prices that merely keep pace with

inflation, and whatever pr~rnium nominal i~terest rates include to compensate

lenders for the erosion in the real value of their principal -                    the faster

average rates of inflation in recent years have increasingly magnified the

associated tax distortions.           Given the tax deductibility of nominal interest

payments, the after-inflation interest rate on              long-te~       borrowir.g by   mediu~


risk business corporations was negative during ten of the thirteen years

1966-78.      Analogously, for an individual investor in the median tax

bracket among all American taxpayers, the after-inflation after-tax return
                                                                       \
on Treasury bills was negative during nine of these thirteen years.

Moreover, the presence of deposit interest ceilings has further compow1ded

the effect of taxes and inflation.           Not since 1967 have ordinary savings

accounts at noziliank deposit institutions returned a positive after-

inflation after-tax yield to the investor in the median tax bracket.

        As   th~   discussion in"Sections II and III has already noted, a variety of

tax-related effects have influenced individuals' and businesses' asset holding

and liability issuing behavior as well as the structure of financial inter-

mediation.         Individuals' and banks' preferences for tax-exempt state and
                                                  <<t, .•



local government securities, the post-war emphasis on debt in corporate

finance, and the increasing channeling of saving through pensions and other
                                            -62-



tax-exempt or tax-sheltered vehicles are all attributable, at least in part,

to the interaction of taxes and inflation.            Withi.n the later post-war years,

these effects have also led individuals to restructure their portfolios in

yet further ways, shifti:lg from deposit to nonder-'os! t forms of financial

assets and, even more, from financial assets to houses and other real invest-
         62
ments.          ThesE"~   and similar distortions, like those dlle to deposit interest

ceilings, have         pres~~ably   had important effects not just on financial market

developments but on economic activity more generally.


C.   The      Grow~~   of Government Intermediation and Credit Guarantees

         Another important change that has corr.e about within the post-war period,

in part as a direct reaction to the distortions noted above, has been the

great increase in the federal government's activities as an intermediary for,

and also a guarantor of, private credit.            The "off-budget" sponsored credit

agencies like the Federal Home Loan Bank System and the Federal Intermediate

Credit Bank were in operation before World War II, but the scale of their

lending operations was small.            As of 1946, all of these agencies combined

held only about $2 billion of assets, the majority of which consisted of

agricultural loans, and they owed only $2 billion of liabilities.             The focus

of these agencies' activity turned more toward support for homebuilding after

the Federal National Mortgage Association began its lending operations in

1955, but as late as 1960, when their combined assets had reached $11 billion,

their total agricultural credit outstanding still exceeded their total housing

credit.        Only in the 19605 and 1970s, when the interaction of deposit interest

Government sponsored intermediation has           gro~~   rapidly, not just absolutely

but in relation to gross national product, and by 1978 these internediaries

held more    thano~e-fifth   of all outstanding horne mortgages and nearly two-

fifths of all outstanding farm debt.          Moreover, the total housing credit

advanced by these intermediaries, which has grown especially rapidly since

the onset of periodic d~sinterrnediation in the mid 19605, includes not cnl~r

direct purchases of mortgages but also Federal Horne Loan Bank advances to

savings and loan associations, so that the effective amount is even             greatc~.

       Federally sponsored intermediaries conduct their business much like

private intermediaries, acquiring financial assets on either a loan or

purchase basis, and in turn issuing their own liabilities.              There are at

least two important differences, however.           One is that government inter-

mediaries do not operate subject to the profit motive alone.              While they

pursue a profit objective, they do so within the limitations imposed by their

Benefit Guarantee Corporation.     The federal government has also sponsored
large-scale loan guarantee programs for diverse borrowers ranging from

college students and small businesses to the Lockheed and Chrysler

Corporations and New York City.     In all, the government's 1978 outstanding

credit and credit guarantees -- including direct loans, formally guaranteed

loans, and other loans by federally sponsored lenders -- totaled $440

billion in comparison to $626 billion of direct federal debt obligations

outstanding.   In addition, the   amo~~ts   of deposits insured by the FDIC

and the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation were $761 billion

and $401 billion, respectively, in 1978.

      The post-war growth in the American economy's reliance on federal

government intermediation, deposit insurance, and other credit guarantees

has probably been to a great extent a cotmterpart of the government's waning

role as a direct borrower.   Given the substantial decline (relative to non-

financial activity) that has occurred in the federal government's outstanding

debt, and the corresponding increase in the outstanding debt of private non-
                                        -65-



financial borrowers, the financial markets have increasingly attempted to

make pri.vate Qbli"gations more acceptable to the economy's ultimate wealth

holders by converting them into government obligations via government

insurancf'~   and credit guarantees.   Along   \>ii   th the increase in pri.vate financial

intermediation, the growth of government credit guarantees broadly defined

including some that are merely implicit -- have enabled the                ~~Grican


financial system to absorb the large post-war shift in the public versus

private mix of direct primary debt.


D.   'l'he Evolution of Monetary Policy

       Finally, one of the most important, and importantly changing, aspects

of the federal government's role in the American financial markets during

the post-war era has been the monetary policy carried out by the Federal

Reserve System.      The changes since World War II in the method of              conducti~g


monetary policy, in the effect of monetary            po~icy   on the A."Tlerican econor-::y,

and in the perceptions of monetary policy held by financial market

participants have all been profound.

       Although monetary policy developments have been fundamental to the

interaction between the American financial markets and nonfinancial                  econo~y,

a detailed quantitative analysis of the macroeconomic effects of post-war

monetary policy lies beyond the scope of this essay.66                Nevertheless, an

essay on post-war changes in the financial markets would be incomplete

without some attention -- albeit at the qualitative level -- to how monetary

policy has evolved over these years.

       The Federal Reserve System, created by Congress in 1914 as America's

first central bank since the 1830s, has responsibility for maintaining the

currency and also for the implementation of monetary policy, which along
                                     -66-


with fiscal policy has constituted one of the two principal engines of

government macroeconomic influence during much of this century.           As an

historical matter, it is interesting to note tha"t the macroeconomic         obj<~ctives


uni.versally associated- with monetary policy in the post-war era -- and

especially the objective Of maintaining price stability -         received no

mention by Congress in the original 1913 Federal Reserve Act.            Instead,

prompted by the recurrent series of financial crises and panics, most

recently in 1901, 1907 and 1913, Congress charged the new Federal Reserve

System with the more direct task of preserving stability in the financial

markets.   More specifically, with the   contractiona~r     economic effect of the

recent financial panics in mind, Congress instructed the Federal Reserve

"to furnish an elastic currency" -   exactly the opposi"te of the anti-

inflation objective widely associated with monetary policy, and viewed by

many people as the chief desideratum of     rr~netary   policy, today.

      The use of monetary policy to achieve broader        ~acroeconomic    objectives

evolved slowly and cautiously during the pre-war years, as economists and

Federal Reserve officials gradually came to understand the working of open

market operations, now the most important tool of monetary policy but not

even contemplated as such in rJ1e Federal Reserve Act.        The establishment in

1923 of what subsequently developed into today's Federal Open Harket

Committee led temporarily to an increasing emphasis on open market operations

and macroeconomic objectives, but the confusions of the depression and the

associated international monetary problems then arrested the development of

the monetary policy mechanism.   During World War II the Federal Reserve

facilitated the financing of the huge increase in public debt noted above by

supporting the prices of Treasury securities.      After the war the reluctance

to impose losses on investors who had financed the war effort led to a

continuation of the bond price supports, thereby precluding active use of
                                       -67-


monetary policy for a further half-decade.

      The first major post-war change in the posture of American monetary
                  ..
policy came in 1951, when tbe Treasury-redcral Reserve Accord relieved the

central bank of its wartime obligation to peg long-term interest rates.

Monetary policy then assumed the macroeconomic role that it has played evcr

since.    Even so, interest rates, especially short-tern rates, remained

relatively low during much of this period (see again Figure 2), and the

Federal Reserve on balance     follo~ed   the half-restrictive,   half-acco~modative


policy subsequently known as "leaning against the \olind."        r-!ore specifically,

the Federal Reserve primarily keyed its open market operations in the very

short run to the net    fr~e   reserve position (that is, excess reserves less

borrowed reserves) of the commercial banking system.        The theory of open

market operations underlying this operating strategy -- which         ~as   based   01,


the relation between sources and uses of bank reserves, and on the assur:1;:tion

of banks' interest inelastic demand for excess reserves and reluctance to

borrow at the discount window -- implied that net free reserves measured

banks' willingness to extend loans and create deposits, and hence measured

the effect of monetary policy in stimulating or retarding nonfinancial

economic activi.ty.    In addition, net free reserves appeared to constitute

the perfect "money market" variable -         a close proxy for market interest

rates (given the level of the Federal Reserve's own discount rate), yet not

itself an interest rate and hence not a contradiction of the Accord.

         For several reasons financial market participants during the 1950s and

even the early 1960s did not attach to monetary policy the great importance

that they have associated with it in more recent years.           The "go-slow"

consensus economic philosophy of the Eisenhower years -- which Congress never

actively opposed, even under the Democratic majorities of the second half of

the decade -was broadly consistent with the "sound money" ethos traditionally
                                      :"68-




associated with central banking as well as the more. specific "leaning against

the wind" policy, which served to dampen cyclical fluctuations of market

interest rates as well as to keep them low on average.       In addition, although

most economists had favored the Accord freeing monetary policy 1 much of t.he

popular tbinkingof the 1950s emphasized the newfound importance of fiscal

policy.

      Several changes occurred thereafter,    ho~ever,   that not only heightened

market participants' awareness of monetary policy but also changed how

monetary pOlicy has \o:orked.   The emergence of a "guns plus butter" policy,

as the Great Society program and the Vietnam \1ar effort peaked simultaneously,

had the support of Congress but appeared to be running afoul of the Federal

Reserve as interest rates climbed steadily beginning in 1965.       Restrictive

monetary pOlicy was a major factor, and visibly so, in the macroeconomic

policy environment from 1966 on, in part because of the increased sensitivity

of the financial markets to interest rate levels as they interacted with the

deposit rate ceilings (see again Figure 7).     After 1969 the acceleration of

price inflation raised new questions about the relative priority of full

employment and price stability in macroeconomic policy making, and the

business recessions of 1969-70 and especially 1973-75 placed monetarj policy

in the middle between the unprecedented double-digit price inflation and the

highest unemployment rate of the post-war era.     Monetary policy had gradually

moved from off stage to on, and then to the center.

      Another source of the increasing attention focused on monetary policy

during the second half of the post-war period has been a change of attitudes

toward fiscal policy.    When it emerged during the 1960s that an occasionally
                                        -69-



flexible fi.scal   poL_~y   was not as sufficient as many people had hoped as a

"cure" for business fluctuations, the perception of the potential of

monetary policy expanded to fill the apparent need.          As is usual in such

situations, once opinion began to change it probably \'lent too far in the

opposite direction.    In the context of an already        so~ewhat    polarized   econo~ic


policy environment, monetary policy therefore became simultaneously the hope

of those who opposed whatever they believed to be the current stance of

fiscal policy, as well as the target of those who          sup~orted    that stance but

were dissatisfied with the apparent results.         !>loreover, the question of the

fiscal-monetary balance, and therefore the coordination of fiscal and monetary

policies, also emerged as issues of some import.           Hatters of timing came to

be perceived as relevant too, as evidence        accQ~ulated   on the lags associated

with the effects of policy actions.       Most economists continued to believe

that the "outside" lags with \vhich moneta.ry policy influences business

activity were longer than the corresponding fiscal policy lags, but the

Federal Reserv'e' s compact decision structure shortened the "inside" lag of

monetary policy in comparison with the         c~~ersome   Congressional    co~~ttee


process involved in taking fiscal actions.

      At the same time, questions arose about the operating methods used to

conduct monetary policy per see       Most of the attention centered on the short-

run policy of setting the banking system's free reserve position, and then

after 1961 on tile corresponding short-run policy of setting a short-term

interest rate.     The essence of the debate was whether this operating method

in fact constituted only a short-run guide for open market operations aimed

at broader objectives or, instead, had developed into a system of false
                                       -70-



beacons for policy over the longer run.       The main point was that it was nor

appropriate simply to regard monetary policy as steady or changing because

market interest rates (or free reserves) were fixed or moving.        t>fuat mattered

was instf<.:!a.d the relationship bet:ween observed interest rates and so;nething

else -     something that was at best difficult to determine:    Events played a

part here, toe, as the acceleration and increasing volatility of price

inflation rendered the inference of a "real" market rate of interest ever

more difficult.     To the extent that allowing for price expectations was basic

to interpreting observed (nominal) interest rates as "indicators" of the

likely effect of monetary policy on nonfinancial economic activity,

calculating such corrections was becoming ever more difficult.

         At the beginning of the 1970s, therefore, the Federal Reserve shiftea

the strategy of .its monetary policy yet again -      this time to a'! ernphasis on

quanti tati'.Ie measures of commercial banking acti vi ty in general, and    0:1


narrowly defined Ml money stock in particular.       In the late 19685 the

Federal Reserve had experimented with a "proviso" approach, according to

which short-run open market operations pursued a stated interest rate

objective provided that doing so did not cause some aggregate measure to

deviate from a predetermined ra.nge.      In 1970 t.he Federal Reserve finally

adopted an operating strategy based explicitly on monetary targets.          The

directives governing the conduct of open market operations continued to

specify a    nar~owly   constrained short-term interest rate (the federal funds

rate), but with the clear understanding that tilis practice was in large part

meant to achieve the targeted rate of monetary growth.       Although these

directives typically specified target ranges for the growth of several

monetary aggregates, as well as cO!!lrnercial bank credit, ill practice the focus
                                          -71-



of policy through the time of writing seems to have been primarily on the
                      67
narrow money stock.

      The Federal Reserve' s rnonetar.l targets strategy has subsequently

evolved into a fairly well-defined two-stage procedure.            First, at Ule

"strategy" level, about once per quarter the Federal Reserve translates its
                                  .
ultimate policy aims (in terms of the econony's growth, employment, price

stability, and so on) into a set of desired growth rates for the monetary

aggregates over the next year.         Because it will choose a new set of desired

one-year growth rates three months later,         ho~ever,   only the first quarter of

this one-year extrapolation is of direct operational relevance.              Second, at

the "tactics" level, within the quarter the Federal Reserve detennines how

best to manipulate the instruments over which it can           ex~rt   close control

(such as nonborrowed bank reserves, or a short-term interest rate) so as to

cause the designated monetary aggregates to move in the specified way.                 In

practice the federal       f~~ds   rate typically served in this   instr~~ent   role

until 1979, ,,,hen the Federal Reserve initiated a new experiment using the

growth of bank reserves as its short-run operating guide.              Although the

Federal Open Market Committee, which has responsibility for these decisions,

meets formally only once a month, it also occasionally uses telephone

conferences to make within-month adjustments in the instrument setting aimed

at achieving the desired monetary growth, subject only to the need to avoid

undue instability in the money market.           Apart from occasional variations,

the Federal Reserve has essentially continued to pursue its monetary targets

operating strategy along these lines through the time of writing.

      In part as a result of the new strategy of open market operations

implemented during the 1970s, the short-run volatility of market interest
                                       -72-



rates sr:arply increased (see again Figure 2).      These wider interest rate fluctu-

ations in turn have been the source of niany of the developments discussed earlier

in this essay.    Together with the ever higher average level of interest rates

during the sec'oYld ha.lf of the post-war- period, th:::y have heightened the :::Ma.reness

of monetary policy among nearly all part.icipants in the financial markets.

In addition, along \'li th dissatisfaction ...·:i th macroeconomic outcomes in the

1970s, they have spurred Congress to institute regular "oversight" procedures

requiring the Federal Reserve periodically to report its current monetary

growth targets through the relevant Congressional committees.             The practical

ability of Congress to supervise the Federal Reserve's monetary pOlicy in
                                                                     68
any effective sense, however, appears to be dubious at best.

      Finally, a feature of A.'aerican monetary pol icy tl.at has also changed

several times since World War I I has b2en the degree of influence associated

with international considerations.      Before the war international financial

matters were often at e1e heart of Federal Reserve policy making.             By contrast,

during the "dollar shortage" of the early post-war years American monetary

policy was largely free to pursue dOmestic objectives without much regard for

international considerations, and the relatively conservative posture of

monetary policy (and fiscal policy) during much of the 1950s posed no threat
                                                        69
to the country's already strong currency      any~ay.        After the balance of

payments had become a   n~jor   problem in the early 1960s, however, the Federal

Reserve began at times to take monetary policy decisions with an eye to their

international ramifications.       Since then the international constraint on

monetary policy making has strengthened and then waned several times.

Somewhat surprisingly, although the American role in the international monetary

system became a major focus of attention in the early 1970s, with the exchange

rate realignment and suspension of dollar-gold convertibility in 1971 and

the move to floatlng exchange rates after 1973, American monetary policy

primarily emphasized domestic objectives during these years.      By contrast,

v.   Summary and Concluding   Co~~ents


      This essay has doclmented three major developments that have dominated

the American financial markets since World War II.

       First, the nonfinancial econowJ has increasingly relied on private

debt financing.    At the war's end there vias much government debt but 1 ittIe

private debt outstanding.     Since then both nonfinancial businesses and

individuals have greatly increased their indebtedness, while the federal

government has sharply reduced its indebtedness, in comparison to the

economy's nonfinancial activity.     The sustained rise in private indebtedness

has represented in part a return to pre-war practices after the aberration

of the depression and war years, and in part the     est~~lishment   of new   nor~s


for indebtedness in relation to incomes.      Perceptions of enhanced economic

prosperity and stability, greater tax incentives to debt finance under

conditions of accelerating price inflation and rising nominal interest rates,

increased holdings of physical assets, and the relative decline in government-

issued debt per se have probably played some part in accounting for the large

relative increase in the nonfinancial economy's private debt.

       Second, the economy has increasingly relied on financial intermediaries

to hold the claims issued by nonfinancial borrowers.      Individuals as well as

other nonfinancial investors have allocated a growing share of their portfolios

to claims on financial intermediaries, rather than direct claims on

nonfinancial borrowers.     Even in the holding of corporate equities, the one

area traditionally dominated by individual ownership, intermediaries have

begun to playa more substantial role.       Nonbank deposit intermediaries,

including especially savings and loan associations, and private and public

s~ctor   pension funds have figured prominently in the continuing overall
                                         -75-



post-war rise in financial      intex~ediation.        This increasing degree of

fi~~~cial    intermediation has facilitated the increased debt financingo£

private nonfinancial borrowers and, together with a series of financial

innovations, h<'lS also helped to break    dO\l.-r1   barriers and frictions interfering

with efficient allocation of the econony's financial res6urces.

      Third, in contrast to its declining role as a direct borro",:er, the

federal government has in other ;"lays becone::       ~Cl~e   of an influence in the

financial markets.     The gover.nment has increasingly served as an insurer and

guarantor of, and an intermediary for, private claims.               Federal deposit

insurance, instituted shortly before the war, inportantly changed the

character of private intermediation, and other :orms of government credit

guarantees have proliferated subsequently.             Federally sponsored credit

agencies, and more recently mortgage pools, have supplemented private inter-

mediation.     Goverr~ent   regulation of the financial markets has also increased

in both scope and effect, and market participants have corne to attach ever

more importance to monetary policy actions as well.

     Finally, it is important to re-emphasize that these three post-war

developments .-- the rise of the private debt economy, the incr.easing degree of

financial in·termediation I and the growing role of the federal gove.rn..rnent

are not independent phenomena.      These three ongoing processes constitute

different but closely related facets of the same overall pattern of American

financial evolution.    Because of the differing risk and liquidity characteristics

of public versus private securities, the post-war shift from public to private

debt has increased the economy's need for financial intermediation, and the

growth and development of that intermediation have in turn facili.tated the

successful issuance and absorption of ever greater amounts of private debt
                                      -76-



relative to nonfinancial activity.    Similarly, in place of direct   governm~nt­


issued debt, the "federal goverrL~ent has indirectly tr~~sformed private debt

into its own on an increasing scale through a combination of guarantees and

federally sponsored intermediation.    On balance, over thirty-five years   th~


most important post-war changes in the American fina.ncial" markets have

largely been parts of the same consistent story.

1.       See Gordon's essay in this volume for a comprehensive treatment.

2.       Table 1 is in part adapted from Baily (1978).

    3.   Moreover, the use of annual data for the first seven     dOw~turns   shown in

         Table 2 importantly understates the peak-to-trough decline of real gross

         national product in comparison to that shown using quarterly data for

         the six post-war downturns.

4.       Kindleberger (1978) provided a lively review of the international

         propaga.tion of economic di.sturbances.

5.       Per~i (19~7),   Jorgenson (1978) and Perloff and Wachter (1979) documented

         this shift and offered alternative explanations.

6.       Debt issued by nonfinancial borrowers is similar to the concept of

         "primary securities" introduced by Gurley and Shaw (1960).

7.       The data shown here include only those liabilities classified as "credit

         market debt" in the Federal Reserve Board's f1ow-of-funds accounts.         The

         debt of the federal government therefore excludes currency     ~,d   bank

         reserves but includes the Federal Reserve System's holdings of       U.s.
      government securities ($147.8 billion and $118.6 billion, respectively,

      as of yearend 1978).           For state and local governments, households, and

      unincorporated nonfinancial businesses, credit market debt in each case

      constituted 95% or more of all liabilities oL1tstanding as of yearend

      1978; for nonfinancial business corporations, yearend 1978 total

      liabilities consisted of 71% credit market liabilities, 24% trade debt

      (almost allowed to each other), and 5% other liabilities.

 8.   It is not appropriate to include foreign debt in an analysis of these

      data from the perspective of the            u.s.   economy's liability issuing

      behavior.           By contrast, if there were some assurance that debt issued

      by foreign borrowers in U.S. markets remained in the portfolios of U.S.

      investors, then it would be appropriate to include that debt in an

      analysis from the perspective of the U.S. economy's asset holding

      behavior.           (TIle caveat, of course, would apply as well to debt issued

      in the    u.s.      markets by U.S. borrowers.)

 9.   The peak debt/GNP ratio during 1918-78 occurred in 1933, the trough

      year of    t...~e   depression.     In addition, much of the household and business

      debt nominally outstanding during the depression was of questionable

      actual value.

10.   During 1953-1978 the         U.s.   debt/GNP ratio has been more stable than the

      money/GNP ratio.          This statement is true regardless of whether one uses

      annual or quarterly data, either unadjusted or detrended, with money

      measured as either Ml or M2; see Friedman (1979a).

11.   See Friedman (1979a) for a discussion of each of these three behavioral

      hypotheses and a look at some pertinent post-war evidence.
12.   The   u.s.   government's debt increased from only $1.2 billion in 1916,

      the year in which the united States entered t.he war, to $25.6 bilJ.ion

      in 1919, the year in which the war ended.

13.   Apart from a discrepancy due to inadequacies of statistical reporting,

      the total sources of funds shown in Table 5 is equal-to the total uses

      of funds shown in Table 4.

14.   According to     u.s.   Department of Commerce estimates, reported

      depreciation allowances understated corporations' true capital

      consumption by some $2-4 billion annually during 1946-61, then over-

      stated it by about      ~he   same amount during 1962-73, and since 1974 has

      understated it again by an increasing amount ($13 billion in 1978).

      See Feldstein and Summers (1979) for an analysis of the relation

      between allowable depreciation and true capital        cons~ption    under

      conditions of price inflation.

15.   During 1971-76, the years of the equity bulge, public utility          compani~s


      accounted for 46% of total gross offerings, and preferred shares

      accounted for 29% of total gross offerings.         (These data, from the

      Securities and Exchange Commission, are not available on the net basis

      used in Table 5.)

16.   For an analysis of this issue see Feldstein (1976) and Feldstein eta al.

      (1978).      The more basic point that the corporate tax structure favors

      debt over equity financing has long been familiar; see, for example,

      Modigliani and Miller (1963).

17.   Long-term debt, with a maturity of over one year, is measured

      approximately as bonds, multi-family and commercial mortgages, and 40%
      of bank loans.     Short-term debt is all other credit market borrowings,

      including mostly finance company loans, commerci.al paper, and the

      remainder of bank loans.

18.   The rise in short-tentl indebtedness (",hieh reached 25. -;. of credit

      market debt as of yearend 1978) still seems small in       co~~arison   with

      the attention it has received.        Moreover, even the small increase that

      has occurred may be only an illusion if, as seems lik81y, an increasing

      share of bank lending is actually intermediate-terra.       The much

      discussed notion of declining corporate liquidity is captured much

      better by the relationships among both liabilities and assets. (See

      again the data in Table 4 on funds used to acquire financial assets.)

      The yearend ratio of the corporate sector's liquid assets to its short-

      term liabilities has fallen from .86        in 1946 to .68 in 1950, .48 in

      1960, .26 in 1970 and a low point of .25 in 1973; after recovering to

      .34 in 1976, as a consequence of the severe 1973-75 recession, the

      ratio has fallen again to .27 in 1978.

19.   Hendershott and Hu (1979) have documented the growing after-tax

      incenti'J8 for   indi~liduals'   mortgage borrowing to finance home ownership

      in recent years, even for those in marginal tax brackets as low as 30%.

      A similar conclusion holds for consumer credit, although here low tax

      bracket individuals account for more of the borrowing.

20.   Apart from a discrepancy due to inadequacies of statistical reporting,

      the total sources of funds shown in Table 8 is equal to the total

      "investment" uses of funds shown in Table 7.

21.   Although installment credit constituted only about one-half of total
      consumer credit outstanding in the early post-war years, it has so

      dominated consumer borrowing that, as of       year~nd   1978, households owed

      $276 billion of installment credit and only $64 billion of other

      consumer credit.

22.   Since the early 1960s the most rapidly     growi~g   expense item of state

      and local governments has been contributions to their employees' pension

      funds; see Munnell and   Co~~olly   (1976) for a review of this experience.

      The growth of these pension funds has itself been an important

      development, on which Section III below focuses.

23.   To avoid confusion it is worth noting explicitly that the general funds

      of state and local   gover~~ents   have been in surplus in the 1970s.

      Since their pension funds also run a large current surplus, the state-

      local government sector has been heavily in surplus on a consolidated

      basis throughout the post-war period.

24.   Because of the enormous size of the     u.s.   markets, however, especially

      in comparison with specific foreign markets, what represents only a

      small part of lending here may often play a sizeable role in meeting

      the needs of particular foreign borrowers.

25.   See Solomon (1977) for a description of the capital controls program

      and a discussion placing it in the context of the U.S. economy's post-

      war foreign economic policy.

26.   Remaining barriers to foreign securities issues in the U.S. market

      include the withholding tax on interest and dividends paid to foreigners

      and disclosure requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
27.   Because of the cyclicality    ot   transfer payments and the overall weakness

      of the   u.s.   economy in the 1970s, the data shown in Table 11 slightly

      overstate the trend increase in both transfers and total federal expc!ld-

      itures in relation to gross nati(:.nal product.       See Break's essay in this

      volume for a comprehensive review of post-war trends in federal spending.

28.   In 1978, the fourth year of the      econo~ic   expansion, the (calendar year)

      fed~ral   deficit was $ 28 billion, or 1.3% of gross national product.

29.   During this same period the Federal Reserve        Syste~   was trying, via its

      "Operation Twist," to shorten the mean maturity of the federal debt

      held by public investors.      As Table 12 shows, the debt      manage~ent


      policy predominated.      A number of researchers subsequently attempted to

      analyze the effects of Operation Twist as if it were not offset by debt

      management policy; see, for example, Modigliani and Sutch (1966,1967).

      In light of the prevailing debt management policy, it is not surprising

      that such efforts were unsuccessful.

30.   See Goldsmith (1958, 1969) and Gurley and Shaw (1960) for an analysis

      of the pre-war experience.

31.   The interesting question of cause and effect between these two

      developments lies beyond the scope of this essay.

32.   ~ne   data plotted in Figure 4 and used also in Table 13 below refer only

      to financial assets and hence exclude nonfinancial assets like houses

      and consumer durables.     As of yearend 1978 households' nonfinancial

      assets, valued at replacement cost, totaled $2.8 trillion (of which

      $1.5 trillion was residential real estate) in comparison to $4.8 trillion

      of financial assets.     The available current-value data on nonfinancial
      asset holdings are understandably weak.

33.   Moreover, these data overstate households' direct equity holdings in

      that they do not separate holdings via mutual funds, which grew from

      an average 2% of total equity holdings in 1946-50 to 7% in 1971-75.

34.   Feldstein (1974), for examplet derived a large estimate of Social

      Security "wealth" (defined as the present discounted value of expected

      future benefits) and found evidence of a significant impact of Social

      Security on private saving behavior.         Although this work and the

      literature that has followed it have emphasized effects on total saving

      behavior, there is no :t'eason to expect the conposi tion of asset holding

      to remain invariant.

35.   Some of the best known examples of this        thin~ing   were Greenough (1951)

      and Advisory Committee (1969).

36.   Lintner (1975), Modigliani and Cohn (1979) and Feldstein (1979),          ano~g


      others, have provided analyses of the failure of equity returns to keep

      pace with inflation.

37.   'l'able 14   ~.s   adapted from Bodie (1979) and is based on updated annua.l data

      compiled by Ibbotson and Sinquefield (1977): see also Bodie (1976).            See

      cagan (1974) for a more detailed examination of data over a longer time

      period and for cross-country comparisons.

38.   See Hartman (1978) for a review of the participation of foreign

      investors in the u.s. financial markets.         A distinction documented by

      Hartman is that, within the category of long-term portfolio (as opposed

      to direct) investments, foreign investors have mostly bought u.S.

      equities while u.S. investors have mostly bought foreign debt securities.
39.    Funds generated internally and retained by corporC'te businesses also

       represent a form of investment by the holders of ""qui ty shares in t.hose

       corporations •   Given the large household m.mership of equities,

       including ret.ained earni.ngs in the data shm·,'!1 in Table 12 would 9 r eatly

       increase the share of funds "advanced" by nonfinanciiil.l investors but

       would still leave intermediaries as the direct source of well over half

       of the total.

40.    Much of this literature has follmoled the lead of Gurley and Sha"", (1960) .

41.    Follm'7ing Glass-Steagall, commercial banks no longer engage in investment

       banking or broker-dealer activities for publicly offered corporate

       securities, although they do so for public sector securities, and in

       recent years they have been increasingly involved in arranging direct

       placements of corporate securities.      In addition, the trust   d~partments


       of commercial banks continue to be the largest single factor in private

       asset management.

42.    See Fellner and Larkins (1976) for a discussion of the stability of        M2

       velocity, and Friedman (l979b) for a corresponding discussion for bank

       credit.

43.    The work of Friedman (1959) and Friedman and Schwartz (1963) explained

       the downward pre-war trend in M2 velocity by emphasizing the role of

       money as a luxury good.

 44.   Banks' holdings of Treasury securities were essentially flat from 1946

       until the swelling of the federal deficit occurred in 1975, so that

       banks' portfolios of municipals have exceeded their portfolios of

       Treasuries ever since 1969.     Except. for 1974-76, all of the growth in
      banks' holdings of federal government debt has consisted of federal

      agency   secur~ties.


45.   See Goldfeld (1973,1976) for a review of the post-war evidence on money

      demand behavior.

46.   See Rhoades (1976) for a summary of changes in banking structure

      following the 1970 amendments.

47.   In Table 18, however, the respective size of the three groups is

      indicated by their total assets because of the lack of historical data

      on pension funds' liabilities.

48.   See Weiss (1976) for a review of the ERISA legislation and its i.mpact.

49.   Tepper and Affleck (1974) and Oldfield (1976), among others, have

      investigated the nature of this underfunding.   Although corporations

      are now required to report (as a footnote to the balance sheet) the

      difference between pension assets and liabilities for vested benefits,

      there is no easy way to discover the liability for nonvested benefits.

50.   See again Munnell and Connolly (1976).

51.   Silber (1977), for example, has analyzed liquidity provided by markets

      as an alternative to liquidity provided by intermediaries.

52.   See Branson's essay in this volume for a comprehensive treatment.

53.   Silber (1975) has developed a theory of financial innovation.   For

      discussions of the impact of specific recent financial innovations,

      see, for example, Lieberman (1977), Porter et ale (1979) and "Lombra

      and Kaufman (1978).
54.   Tobin (1963), for example, called on the government to issue such an

      instrument long before the major acceleration of inflation.          More

      recently,    resear~hers   have sought to discover why the private markets

      have not provided it; see, for example, Fischer (1975,1979).

55.   See, for example, Modigliani and Lessard (1975).

56.   See caves' essay in this      vol~e   for a comprehensive   treat~ent.


57.   Data on bank failures are available from Friedman and Schwartz (1963)

      and successive issues of the FDIC Annual Report.

58.   For analyses of this issue see, for example, Maisel (1979).

59.   The federal government's most ambitious post-war effort to restructure

      the investment banking industry failed, however,       w~en    the government

      lost   ~~e   antitrust suit it brought against seventeen leading investment

      banking firms (U.S. v. Morgan et al.) in 1951.

60.   An   anomaly of these ceilings is that mutual institutions which are in

      principle owned by their depositors -- including savings and loan

      associations, mutual savings      ba~ks   and credit unions -- are prohibited

      from fully distributing earnings to their owners.           Earnings above the

      ceiling rate merely accumulate unless the institution converts to a

      stock organization (as is legal for savings and loans), in which case

      they become a windfall to the new owners.

61.   Congress has repeatedly adjusted the brackets, but on balance these

      adjustments have had sufficient redistributive elements to reduce the

      real income level to which the higher marginal rates apply.

62.   Kane (1980), for example, has documented the substantial shifts in

      individuals' asset holding.since the early 1960s.
63.   It is possible, however, that the mortgage market receives less as a net

      addition to available funds than all of the credit provided by the

      sponsored credit agencies and mortgage pools if they in turn sell their

      securities to investors who would othenvise have held deposits in thrift

      institutions.   See, for example, the analysis of this question in Jaffee

      and Rosen (1979).

64.   It is important not to draw this distinction too firmly,      howev~r.   For

      example, savings and loan associations are constrained to hold at least

      82% of their asset portfolios in residential   ~ortgages   (or other

      qualified assets).    Also, as the discussion above notes, in the presence

      of deposit interest ceilings limiting the pay-out of earnings to holders

      of deposit shares, it is not clear what role the profit motive plays

      in savings and loans' portfolio decisions.

65.   See Penner and Silber (1973) for an analysis of the subsidy implicit

      in federal credit programs.

66.   See Gordon's essay in this volume.    For more detailed accounts of post-

      war monetary policy, see Friedman and Schwartz (1963), Brunner and

      Meltzer (1964), Guttentag (1966), Bach (197l), Brimmer (1972) and Poole

      (1975).   Parts of what follows draw on Friedman (1977,1978) •.

67.   Although some observers have alleged that the Federal Reserve's

      commitment to the monetary growth targets has been largely rhetorical,

      a steady accumulation of evidence shows that the observed movement of

      the money stock in relation to its targeted growth path has become a

      major determinant -    on some evidence, the dominant one -     of short-run

      monetary policy operations.    De Rosa and Stern (1975), Feige and McGhee

      (1979) and Lombra and Moran (1979) have all found evidence to this effect.
68.   Pierce (1978) and Roberts (1978) have both assessed this effort and

      drawn essent~ally negative conclusions.

69.   Concerns about the dollar's external position first arose in    conj~~ction


      with the govermnent's $12 billion deficit in 1958 -- a peacetime record

      at the time, and equal to nearly 3% of the gross national product (a

      relative size not again reached until the 1973-75 recession).
