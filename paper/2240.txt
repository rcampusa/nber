  Changing Patterns of International Investment In and By the United States




                                  ABSTRACT




     The international investment account of the United States has gone
through several cycles. Before World War I, the U.S. was a borrower most
of the time and an international debtor. Between the two World Wars, it
was first a lender and then a refuge for foreign capital. After World War
II, the U.S. became the world's major lender and creditor and in the last
few years it has become the world's largest borrower, and, according to the
official accounts, even a net debtor.

     U.S. direct investment abroad began while the U.S. was still an
overall borrower and debtor. The technological leaders among U.S. manufac-
turing firms pioneered in this technique for exploiting their particular
knowledge and skills by producing in other countries. The peak in the
importance of foreign assets relative to the domestic assets of U.S. com-
panies was probably reached during the early 1970s.

     While the flow of direct investment from the U.S. has slowed, there
has recently been a large inflow of foreign direct investment into the
U.S.. That inflow has roughly tripled the share of foreign-owned companies
in the U.S. since 1950.

     While foreign-owned firms accounted for only about 33 per cent of
total U.S. employment after all the recent growth in foreign direct invest-
ment in the U.S., the shares in manufacturing and wholesale trade were con-
siderably higher. Foreign firms accounted for almost 40 per cent of
chemical industry employment, but for less than 10 per cent in all the
other industries. The foreign shares in service industries, aside from
wholesale trade, increased, but remained below 3 per cent.

                                1. Introduction



     After World War II, the United States became the major supplier of capital

 in world markets, and that role appeared for many years to be a permanent one.

 The recent swing to being the world's largest borrower is a reminder that the

 U.S. history in this respect has been a cyclical one since the late nine-

 teenth century, alternating between periods of capital exporting and capital

 importing. These swings were mainly based on economic circumstances, but at

 times wars and threats of wars, revolutions, and other types of government

 instability made investment flow uphill, against the pull of purely economic

forces.

    A more constant feature than the direction of the capital flow has been

the association of U.S. capital exports with the export of technology and

management. Americans were the innovators in exporting the package of manage-

ment, technology, and capital, sometimes even without the capital, that is

known as foreign direct investment: the ownership of production facilities

in one country by firms based in another country.




    This paper was prepared for an NBER conference on The Changing Role of
the United States in the World Economy, held in Palm Beach, Florida, March
5—8, 1987. The paper is part of the NBER's program in International
Studies and draws on research carried on under grants from the National
Science Foundation and the Ford Foundation and a PSC—CUNY research award. I

    The development of this type of multinational enterprise and the changes

that have taken place within it reflect the evolution of the competitiveness

and comparative advantage of American firms and their responses to changes in

political and economic circumstances. The innovation represented by these

U.S. enterprises has been increasingly copied by firms based in other

countries, with the result that many foreign firms have entered the U.S.

market, and multinational activity has become a feature even of firms from

developing countries.

    Against the relatively steady growth of direct investment, first out of

the U.S. and then into it, there have been large swings in other forms of

investment. Most of foreign investment in the U.S. has been portfolio rather

than direct investment; that is, it has not included foreign control of U.S.

enterprises. The U.S. too has engaged in brief, but very large, spurts in

portfolio investing in foreign countries. These are important, despite their

infrequency, because they have been so large, at times outrunning the steadier

trends in direct investment.

                           2. Historical Background

Foreign Investment in the U.S. Before World War I.

     The recent metamorphosis of the U.S. into a large international borrower

has been unsettling. It is an unfamiliar role and has been for many decades,

but it is not a totally new one. It is a return to the pattern of the first

century of the existence of the U.S. Most of the time from George

Washington's inauguration until an abrupt turn to capital exporting at the end

of the 19th century, the U.S. had been a net borrower in foreign financial

markets.

     The cumulation of borrowing year after year until the end of the 19th

century meant that the U.S. was a net debtor throughout these years, and it

was still a net debtor at the beginning of World War I, despite 15 or 20 years

in which the U.S. was a net foreign lender most of the time.

        p. 445.

     An indication of the size of the debt relative to the U.S. economy is

that the net indebtedness was about 3 per cent of U.S. national wealth or

tangible assets (land, structures, equipment, and inventories) in 1900, and

the indebtedness of 1914 was a little over 2 per cent of national wealth in

1912. U.S. gross indebtedness in 1914, including foreign holdings of direct

investment, was about 2J per cent of total tangible and financial assets in

the U.S. in 1912 (U.S. Bureau of the Census 1975, Series F 377 and F 378).

    There are several ways to view the role of these flows of financial capi-
                                     —5—
 tal in American development. One is as a source of financing for aggregate

 capital formation, permitting faster accumulation of capital than would have

 taken place if only domestic financing had been available. On this basis, it

 is hard to suppose that imports of capital had a great influence on the rate

 of development, at least during most of the 19th century. The capital inflows

 never reached more than 1i per cent of total output in any decade from the

 1830's through the first 10 years of the twentieth century and were probably

 never more than 6 or possibly 7 per cent of gross capital formation.

     In general, U.S. borrowing from foreign countries rose when U.S. capital

formation surged, and tapered off as U.S. saving, rising more gradually and

steadily, caught up with capital formation. Thus, investment from abroad

accommodated the large spurts in the demand for capital that characterized the
                                    -6-
rapidly growing economy.

     There may have been other roles for borrowing from abroad. One might have

been to supply funds for particularly risky forms of capital formation at a

lower interest rate than would have been required by domestic lenders. Another

may have been to supply funds when, in the face of heavy demands by rapidly

growing sectors, U.S. domestic lenders' needs for diversification of risks made

them reluctant to offer sufficient financing to these sectors. A somewhat dif-

ferent interpretation is that U.S. railway and government securities, relati-

vely safe and requiring less local knowledge than investment in smaller scale

enterprises in agriculture, mining and manufacturing, tended to be sold over-

seas, while domestic suppliers of capital invested in the riskier, but more pro-

fitable sectors (Edelstein 1982, 237—238).

     The bulk of foreign investment in the U.S. was portfolio investment

rather than direct investment. That is, it consisted of purchases of bonds or,

to a small extent, equities that did not involve control over the enterprise

receiving the capital. Just before World War I, about 80 per cent of the stock

of long-term foreign investment in the U.S. was portfolio investment, and the

same had been true for the flow over a long period (Edeistein 1982, 36

and 37).

 Governments and railways were the chief borrowers and most of the financing

 was in the form of bonds rather than equities. Most of the foreign investment,

 whether for governments or private companies, went to large, lumpy, social

overhead capital projects, such as canals, railways, electrical utilities, and

 telephone and telegraph systems (Edeistein 1982, pp. 39-41). Manufacturing

enterprises were probably almost all too small to seek foreign financing or

even, in most cases, public financing from domestic sources.

     There were instances of manufacturing enterprises set up by foreign

craftsmen or entrepreneurs with special knowledge or skill.          However, in an

era in which transportation and communication were slow by modern standards,

these often involved the migration of the owners and eventual conversion of

their enterprises into domestic entities. Thus, these enterprises involved

mainly a flow of human capital to the U.S.

     We do not deal with the flow of human capital here, but it may have been

more important to U.S. development than the flows of financial capital. In

terms of numbers, immigration into the U.S. in each decade from the 1830s
                                    —8-
through the beginning of World War I ranged from about 5 to 10 per cent of

the number already in the country (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1975, Series A 6

and C 89). Furthermore, most of the immigrants (a 50 per cent larger propor-

tion than in the population as a whole) were between 15 and 44 years of age

(U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1975, Series C 119, C 122-27, C 138, and C 141).

They came to the U.S., therefore, with most of their rearing costs already

incurred and with a large part of their working lives still ahead of them.

The Beginnings of U.S. Direct Investment Abroad

     The U.S. has been unique among the major investing countries in that the

principal form of its investment has been, from the earliest times recorded,

direct rather than portfolio investment. That is, it has typically involved

control of foreign operations rather than simply the lending of capital to

foreign-controlled firms or to governments. The earliest estimates, for 1897,

show over 90 per cent of U.S. investment to have been of this type.

     The earliest examples of U.S. direct investment took place while the U.S.

was still, on net balance, an importer of capital. They illustrate the key

role of the export of technology, or other firm-specific assets, as contrasted

to the pure export of capital, as is the case with portfolio investment.

 (printing presses), Babcock and Wilcox (boilers), International Bell Telephone

 and Western Electric, Edison Electric, Thomson—Houston Electric, a component

 of General Electric when it was formed later, Westinghouse Air Brake, Kodak,

 McCormick, Worthington Pump, Chicago Pneumatic Tool, Otis Elevator, National

 Cash Register, and Libbey-Owens (Southard 1931; Wilkins 1970, Chapter III).

 These companies were typically early technological leaders in their fields.

Another indication of the importance of technology rather than capital is the

number of instances in which the parent's investment consisted entirely or

largely of patent-rights, as in the case of Ford in Canada, Libbey-Owens Glass

in various European countries, and Westinghouse Electric in the U.K. (Lewis

1938, 300-301).

The Transformation of the U.S. International Balance Sheet, 1914-1919

     The beginning of World War I found the U.S. still a substantial inter-

national net debtor, but the events of the next few years transformed the

country's international balance sheet. As a result of wartime lending by the

U.S. and especially the liquidation of foreign claims against the U.S. in the

form of holdings of U.S. securities, this country ended the period as a net

creditor in international markets.

inter-government debt of almost $10 billion that was to bedevil international

negotiations on reparations and other topics through the interwar years.

The U.S. as an International Investor, 1919-1929

    The period of the 1920s, and particularly the late 1920s, was exceptional

in the history of U.S. investing abroad in two respects. One was that the

growth of portfolio investment was far greater than that of direct investment,

to the extent that the stock of portfolio investment exceeded that of direct

investment for the first and only time at the end of that period.

The other was that, in the late 1920s, direct investment in foreign public

utilities, which represented only 4 per cent of the stock of direct investment

in 1924, accounted for over a third of the increase during the next five

years.

    Almost the whole history of U.S. direct investment in foreign public uti-

lities is concentrated in the few years between 1924 and 1929. The increase in

the stock of public utility investment in these years was almost 80 per cent

of the 1929 total as compared with less than 30 per cent for all industries

combined.

South America, far above that area's share in total direct investment.

    More than a third of the growth in direct investment between 1924 and 1929

was in South America, the location of less than fifth of such investment in

1924, and over a quarter of the growth in portfolio investment was directed

there in these years, although the initial share was only 10 per cent. Another

way of describing the temporal concentration of investment in South America is

that almost half of the stock of direct investment and almost two thirds of

the stock of portfolio investment in South America in 1929 were accounted for

by the growth between 1924 and 1929.

    The changes in value, especially for portfolio investment, reflect some

price changes as well as new investment. However, these data do not reflect

the price changes on individual issues but only changes in exchange rates. In

any case, very little of the investment was in common stock (about 5 per

cent), and almost all the loans were dollar loans (about 95 per cent), so that

neither possible source of price change, stock prices or exchange rates, could

have been of much importance. Thus, the changes in portfolio investment must

represent a tremendous flurry of new financing during this period.

    The reasons for this concentrated burst of portfolio investment were pro-

bably different from those behind the direct investment in utilities. The two

U.S. companies that were the ultimate parents of most of the utility affi-
                                       — 16 -

hates   were major manufacturers of the capital goods purchased by the

utilities. Neither one was a domestic company in the industries in which these

affiliates operated. The ownership of foreign utilities was, in effect, a way

of exploiting the parents! advantages in technology and marketing in the

telephone and electric power equipment manufacturing industries. The con-

centration of these investments in Latin America and their decline were at

least partly the result of government monopolization and regulation, earlier

in Europe and later in Latin America and Asia as well.

    The burst of portfolio investment in the late 1920s was fueled by some of

the same speculative spirit that propelled the U.S. stock market in those

years. The concentration in South American investment represented, according

to one very thorough study (Mintz 1951) and many contemporary accounts, a

large decline in the quality of credit extended, as the boom of the late 1920s

progressed. The fall in quality -is summarized by the fact that of the loans

extended in the first half of the 1920s, only 18 per cent went into default

later, while the share of defaults was 50 per cent for loans extended in

1925-29 (Mintz 1951, 6).

Defaults and Liquidations, 1929—1935

    After the large build-up of portfolio assets and liabilities in the

last few years of the 1920's, the depression of the 1930s led to a wave of

liquidations of security holdings and of defaults on foreign bonds among U.S.

investments abroad as well. In addition, asset and liability values decreased

as a result of declines in prices, but much of this decline is concealed by

the use of book values for bonds. We do have a rough estimate of U.S. inter-

national assets with defaulted bonds valued at market, but we do not have a

similar estimate for market values of other securities or direct investment.

    Even without any allowance for default or price depreciation on bonds,

we can observe a decline of more than a quarter in securities assets, a

reduction of short-term assets by almost half, and a decline of about 20

per cent in securities liabilities. The market value of U.S. security

holdings, taking account of depreciation on defaulted bonds but not on other

securities, declined almost 50 per cent.

   By 1935, the primacy of direct investment among U.S. assets had reap-
                                    - 18   -


peared. Some of the direct investment values may be inflated by the use of
book values. Still, mismeasurement of capital stock is not responsible for

the main story, as can be seen from the capital flow data. The U.S. continued

to invest in controlled companies abroad, at least for the first couple of

years, and the decline in value of these investments must therefore have

stemmed largely from exchange rate changes, and from declines before sale in

the value of assets sold during the period.

The data for long-term portfolio and short-term investment reveal a

repatriation to the U.S. of about $2 billion. The rest of the $3 billion

decline in U.S. portfolio assets may reflect some losses from declines in the
                                     - 19   —

 value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. On the other

the decline in foreign portfolio and short-term assets in the U.S. of almost

$3 billion was less than half accounted for by capital flows during the

period.

    The U.S. ran a surplus on goods and services during this period of more

than $3 billion. The deficits of the U.S. partner countries were financed not

by private capital flows but by an absorption of gold by the U.S. of about $3

billion in the last two years of the period.

The U.S. as a Destination of Flight Capital, 1935-1940

    Despite the low level of economic activity in the U.S. in the second

half of the 1930s, foreign private investment in the U.S. more than

doubled. The fastest growth was in short-terni investment, which more than

quadrupled, but every category of foreign investment grew.

    In contrast, both U.S. direct and U.S. portfolio investment abroad

declined, especially the latter. The $7 billion increase in foreign invest-

ment in the U.S. in combination with a cumulative U.S. surplus on goods and

services of almost $5 billion, were financed largely by a $12 billion flow of

reserve assets into the U.S. government's account.

    An indication of the size of this capital flow is that over the five

years it was almost 20 per cent of gross capital formation and greater than
                                      — 21 —

net capital formation. In effect, the capital inflow was financing all net

capital formation in the U.S. during this period.

    With this large inflow of capital, the U.S., after 20 or so years as a

net creditor on private account, slipped back into the position of a net

debtor, aside from U.S. government holdings of official reserve assets.

Effects of World War II and the Reconstruction Period on the

U.S. International Capital Position

    In contrast to World War I, when foreigners liquidated well over half

their long-term investments in the U.S., foreign holdings of private U.S.

assets were unchanged between the beginning and end of World War II.

Foreign holdings of U.S. government securities grew substantially, while the

U.S. private sector raised its foreign assets by about 20 per cent. The U.S.

remained a net debtor outside of its official reserve assets.

   After 1945, the U.S. resumed its acquisition of private foreign assets,

mainly direct investments, and by 1950 the U.S. was once again a net creditor

even outside its official reserve assets. A $35 billion cumulative surplus in

net exports of goods and services in the late 1940's was financed partly by
                                           — 23 —

  the growth of U.S. assets and by transfers, but a large fraction--more than

  third—-was financed by an accumulation of official reserve in the hands of the

  U.S.

  The Growth of U.S. Direct Investment Abroad After World War II

         After 1950, the growth of U.S. direct investment abroad, slowed by the

 Great Depression and World War II, resumed its rise. One measure of the spread

 of U.S. firms, the number of new affiliates established, rose rapidly to a

 peak until the late 1960s, and then slowed down.

     These data are confined to a fixed group of corporations that had become

multinational by the time the sample was selected, and the decline in the rate
                                     — 24 —

of   establishment may have represented only the exhaustion of profitable loca-

tions for new affiliates by this particular group of parents. Furthermore, the

data take no account of the size of the newly established affiliates or of

their growth after establishment.

      Another measure of foreign direct investment is the value of such invest-

ment, measured as the book value of parent investment in affiliates as

reported on the books of affiliates. Since these values are, of course,

affected by inflation and by the growth of the economy in general, we compare

the value of direct investment in foreign countries with the total assets of

U.S. corporations.

     These ratios suggest that the peak importance of foreign investment rela-

tive to all U.S. corporate assets was in    the   early or mid-1970s, although the

year—to—year fluctuations make it difficult to identify a precise peak.

     Foreign investment was always less important in finance than in other

industries, and the ratio for all industries is greatly affected by the inclu—

sion of financial corporations. Overseas investment was a much higher propor-

tion of the assets of nonfinancial corporations than of those of financial

corporations or all corporations, but the time pattern appears to have been
                                      - 26   —


similar:   a peak at some point between 1966 and 1977 (comparable data for

intervening   years are not available) and then a decline to the levels of the

1950s.

     The amount of investment relative to assets is only one of several

possible measures of the international activities of U.S. firms. It is the one

that can be carried back the furthest, but it has several drawbacks. At best

it measures the financial stake in overseas affilitates, but it does not

reflect the level of activity carried on there. U.S. firms could be increasing

the share of production they carry on abroad or the share of their employment

abroad while reducing their investment in foreign affiliates and still

retaining control of them. More serious problems of measurement arise from the

fact that the investment in foreign affiliates is measured in book values

rather than current values and that these are subject to the vagaries of

currency translation. The tangible assets of all U.S. firms, in the denomina—

tor of the ratio, are estimated current values. The high inflation rates of

the late 1970s and early 1980s must have raised the totals for U.S. firms

assets relative to the values on the books of affiliates, and the rise in the

value of the dollar from 1982 to 1985 must have had a similar effect. We must

therefore be somewhat skeptical about this evidence for a decline in the

importance of overseas activities.

   A measure free of problems of valuation is provided by data on employment,

although this measure is also subject to question.

               Commerce 1985g. Employment in affiliates from Brereton 1986 and

               U.S. Department of Commerce 1975, 1981, and 1985a.

 Relative to private non-agricultural employment in the U.S. (U.S. Department

of Commerce 1985g), employment in majority-owned affiliates (the only figures

available for 1966) rose between 1966 and 1977 (U.S. Department of Commerce

1975 and 1981). Between that date and 1982, all measures of employment

declined relative to U.S. employment, and nonbank affiliate employment con-

tinued to decline relatively through 1984 (U.S. Department of Commerce 1985a,

and Brereton 1986).

    The main question about this measure is whether employment is a good

measure for comparing domestic and overseas labor input. For one thing, there

was a shift toward female and part-time employment in the U.S. that may not

have been matched overseas. Aside from the measurement problem, it is hard to

know whether the relative drop in affiliate employment from 1977 to 1982

reflects mainly the effect of the 1982 recession or is part of a declining
                                         28 -

trend.
        One indication in the opposite direction, discussed later, is that exports

from overseas affiliates have, within manufacturing, increased relative to

exports from the United States by the affiliates' parents and by the U.S. as a

whole. This measure also has defects. It has the advantage that all measures

are in current values, but it also reflects the changing degree of export orien-

tation of affiliates, parents, and U.S. firms in general.

        The main changes in the composition of U.S. investment abroad are

described in Table 1. The major shifts over the thirty years have been the

declines in importance of investment in the production of goods, especially

primary products, and in public utilities and transportation, and the rise in

importance of investment in trade and services. The fall in investment in pri-

mary production all took place before 1977, prior to the oil crises.

Investment in public utilities and transportation, accounting for 13 per cent

of investment in 1957, had been reduced to under 2 per cent by 1982. Within

the trade and services group, it was finance that was responsible for the

great increase in importance of the sector. There was some growth in the

importance of trade, but other services, especially outside of oil-field ser-

vices, remained of small importance throughout, although they probably did

grow.

The Competitiveness and Comparative Advantage of U.S. Multinational Firms

    It is customary to discuss the competitiveness of countries and of

industries in them in terms of their shares in world markets or of particular

markets. A country's competitiveness depends in the short-run on the effects

of its monetary and fiscal policies on prices and exchange rates and over

longer periods on the rate and direction of its advances in productivity.
                                     — 29 —

     To some extent, companies that become multinational in their operations

 loosen their dependence on these home-country determinants of competitiveness.

 If home-country production becomes more expensive relative to foreign produc—

 tion because of rapid inflation at home or because the exchange value of the

 home country's currency has risen, or because labor has risen in price or

 decreased in efficiency, the multinational firm has some opportunity to shift

 its production to locations in other countries.

     The competitiveness of the multinational firm depends on the firm's

 characteristics rather than on those of its home country. It may rest on the

possession of patents or other technological assets based on the firm's R & 0.

 It may rest on the ability to manage or control certain types of production or

distribution operations. It may originate in access to raw materials on

favorable terms or in access to home-country markets. All these factors have

in common that they can be exploited wherever the firm operates. That is, they

are mobile geographically within the firm but relatively immobile Jetween

firms (Lipsey and Kravis 1985).

    One could imagine a number of possible indicators of the competitiveness

of a firm or a group of firms. One would be its shares in world production or

world consumption of some set of products. Another would be the share in world

trade or in world exports of products or groups of products. Still others

would be shares in value added, employment, or capital. All the indicators

have drawbacks. The use of employment or capital shares relies on a single

factor of production when others may be equally important or may behave

differently. Value added may be affected by the shifting of profits to mini-

mize taxes or for other reasons. Production or consumption are difficult to

use because world and area aggregates are difficult to assemble. They may also
                                     - 30   -


 be subject to manipulation by host-country governments controlling access to

 their home markets.

     Shares in export trade, used here as a competitiveness measure, have

drawbacks also-—for one, they slight firms and industries making products

that, because of weight or bulk, or for other reasons, tend to be supplied

 from within the countries where they are consumed. Despite the drawbacks,

export shares have a number of advantages as measures of competitiveness. One

 is that there are reasonably comprehensive world and regional aggregates

against which to measure a firm's share. The main advantage of using exports

rather than production for this purpose is that exports are more footloose. A

country has more power to determine which producers supply its home market

than which supply export markets. Shares in export markets may, therefore,

represent the underlying economic advantages of firms and countries to a

greater degree than do shares in production.

    That is not to say that export markets are unaffected by government inter-

ventions or other non—economic factors. The imposition of export requirements

on U.S. affiliates by some governments as the price for acquisition of a local

firm in the host country or even for continued operation in the country has

been a source of much friction between the United States and these countries.

However, these export-promoting policies are circumscribed by the ability of

companies to leave markets where the costs imposed on them are too high. They

are also limited by the watchfulness of other countries over their own home

and export markets.

    The competitiveness of U.S. multinationals, measured by their export

shares, can be described and compared to that of the U.S. as a country by the

following figures:

 The shares of the U.S. and its multinationals were about equal in 1966, but

 the multinationals kept their share remarkably constant while that of the U.S.

 declined, particularly in the earlier years.

     The parent firms of the U.S. multinationals did not escape the forces that

 led to the fall in the U.S. export share, but the fall in the parents! share

 was a little smaller than that of the U.S.:

The multinationals were more successful than non-multinational U.S. firms in

world markets for manufactured goods.

    What kept the multinationals' share in world exports up was the success of

their exports from their foreign affiliates, a record that can be traced back

25 years:

In the first 20 years, the shares of U.S. multinationals' affiliates in both

developed countries and LOC's grew rapidly, but after that, only the shares of

the LOC affiliates grew, while affiliates in the developed countries more or

less held their shares steady.                                                   -




   This   growth in exports from foreign affiliates implies that larger and

larger portions of world market shares outside the U.S. held by U.S. multina-

tionals and by all U.S. firms were being supplied from production outside the

U.S., as can be seen from the following:

By 1983, almost half of all manufactured exports by U.S. multinationals and

over 40 per cent of manufactured exports by all U.S. firms were supplied by

foreign affiliates of the multinationals.

    We can identify the comparative advantage of U.S. multinationals by the

industry distribution of their exports relative to that of the U.S. as a

country or of the world. Another way of putting this measure is saying that we

take the multinationals' share of exports in each industry relative to their

share in all industries combined. This measure is sometimes referred to as

"revealed comparative advantage" and has the drawbacks of such measures. For

example, it is not based on the presumed determinants of comparative advantage

and incorporates the effects of trade barriers, subsidies, and many other fac-

tors that can affect trade flows.

    If we take these distributions for 1966, the first year for which we have

the data, we find that the U.S. as a country enjoyed comparative advantages

relative to the world as a whole in chemicals, machinery, and transport equip-

ment, and comparative disadvantages in food products, metals, and miscella-
                                  - 34   -



neous manufacturing industries.

    The comparative advantages of U.S. multinationals were in the same

industries, but to a larger degree, and the same was true for the comparative

disadvantages of the multinationals. Thus, if we compare U.S. multinationals

with the U.S. as a country, the multinationals had comparative advantages over

other U.S. firms in chemicals, machinery, and especially transport equipment,

and disadvantages relative to the U.S. in foods, metals, and miscellaneous

manufacturing industries.

In other words, where the U.S. was strong, U.S. multinationals, taken as a

group, were stronger. And where the U.S. was weak, U.S. multinationals as a

group were weaker. That is not to say that there were no individual U.S.

multinationals with comparative advantages in foods or metals that permitted

them to operate in many countries. The data show that such firms were less

common in these industries than in chemicals or machinery.

      Sixteen   years later, the main outlines of the story were similar. There

  was a slight weakening of the U.S. position in chemicals and transport equip-

  ment, as well as in the already weak metals area, and a stronger comparative

  advantage in machinery.

Within machinery, the U.S. comparative advantage in nonelectrical machinery

increased and that in electrical machinery declined.

    U.S. multinationals increased their comparative advantage in chemicals

relative to the world and to the U.S. as a country, but their previously very

large comparative advantage relative to the world in transport equipment was

substantially reduced. Their comparative disadvantages in foods and metals

were also reduced, but remained large. In 1982, U.S. multinationals still

showed a large comparative advantage relative to the world in chemicals, non—
                                     - 36   -


electrical   and electrical machinery, and transport equipment, but there was

one exception to the rule that their comparative advantages were an accen-

tuated version of U.S. comparative advantage. That exception was in non-

electrical machinery, in which the comparative advantage of the U.S. as a

country exceeded that of the U.S. multinationals.

    For 1977 and 1982 it is possible to examine the comparative advantage of

U.S. multinationals for a much finer breakdown of industry groups into 30 or

more industries. The industries in which U.S. multinationals exhibited the

largest comparative advantage relative to the world were, in order:

              1. Tobacco products

              2. Office and computing machinery

              3. Electronic components

              4. Soaps, cleansers, etc.

              5. Drugs

              6. Construction machinery


Source: Appendix Table 3


Of the six, four were also among the industries of greatest comparative advan-

tage for the U.S. as a country, exceptions being the two chemicals groups.

These industries are characterized by high expenditures on R & D (office and

computing machinery, drugs, and electronic components) and on advertising

(tobacco products, drugs, soaps, cleansers, etc.)

     The 1977-82 period was one in which the shift by multinationals from the

U.S. to their overseas affiliates as their export base, which was strong in

the previous decade, was interrupted and even reversed to a small extent. As

might be expected, there was wide variation among industries in this respect.
                                     — 37 —

 Most of the industries in which U.S. multinationals' exports rose rapidly saw

 a continuation of the shift to overseas production for export. That category

 included drugs, industrial chemicals, other chemicals, other transport equip-

 ment, plastic products, and instruments. Two major exceptions were office and

 computing machinery and electronic components. There was not a major shift

 back to the U.S. (in percentage terms) in these two industries, but there was

 clearly no move away from U.S. operations.

      By comparing the distributions of exports of U.S. multinationals for 1977

 and 1982 with those of the U.S. for the same year, we can get some notion of

 the distinctive comparative advantages of these firms, as compared with the

 U.S. as a geographical entity (Appendix Table 5). Among the major groups, the

multinationals showed comparative advantages in chemicals, electrical machi-

 nery, and transport equipment, but not in foods, metals, non-electrical machi-

nery, and "other manufacturing."

     The ratios for more detailed industries are suggestive. Within foods, the

multinationals held a large advantage over other U.S. firms in beverages, pro-

bably an advertising-intensive industry. In chemicals, the largest advantage

was in soaps, cleaners, etc., also an advertising-intensive field, followed by

drugs and, by a small margin, industrial chemicals, the former extremely

R & D-intensjve, the latter a little above average. In non-electrical machi-

nery, the largest advantage of multinationals over other U.S. firms was in

office and computing machinery, by far the most R & D-intensive group. In the

electrical machinery group, the multinationals' advantages were large relative

to the U.S. in electronic components and, in 1982, also in communications

equipment, both R & D—intensive industries, but not in "other electrical

machinery," the most P & 0-intensive. However, in electrical machinery, the
                                             - 38   —

lines   are quite blurry among the detailed industries. Many parents seem to

cross these detailed industry lines.

    There are a number of indications here that both R & D intensity and

advertising intensity are major factors in the comparative advantage of U.S.

multinationals, and both have been associated with U.S. firms' shares in

foreign markets (for example, in Caves 1974). R & 0 intensity is a variable

that has been associated in many studies with the comparative advantage of the

U.S. as a country (for example, Baldwin 1979, and Stern and Maskus 1981). Our

data confirm that association. If we relate the share of an industry in U.S.

exports relative to its share in world exports (U.S./W) to the R & D intensity

of industries, as measured by the ratio of R & 0 expenditures to sales (RD/S),

we find we can explain a substantial part (4O) of the inter—industry dif-

ferences in U.S. export shares in 1977 with that factor alone:



(1) US/W =      .089    +       .022 RD/S               =   .40
              (5.96)        (4.40)


    t-statistics in parentheses

    However, the same R & D intensities are even more strongly related to the

comparative advantage of U.S. multinationals in the same year, measured in the

same way (share of industry in multinationals' exports relative to its share

in world exports (USMNC/W):



(2) USMNC/W =    .098       +    .052 RD/S          2 =
                (3.39)          (5.26)


The foreign investment survey does not include data on advertising intensity,

the other characteristic associated with U.S. multinationals' comparative
                                      — 39 -


 advantage, but R & D intensity at least is one attribute explaining the com-

 parative advantages of the U.S. and of U.S. multinationals, especially that of

 the multinationals.

 Changing Characteristics of U.S-owned Foreign Operations

     U.S. affiliates in foreign countries exist mainly to serve local markets.

 About two thirds of their sales have been in their host countries in the last

 few years.

Exporting is most important for affiliates in primary production-—

agriculture, mining, and the extraction of petroleum-—in all of which a

majority of sales were outside the host country. The reason for the export-

orientation of affiliates in these industries is that they were drawn to their

locations not by the prospect of breaking into or enlarging their shares of

the host country's market but by the presence of relatively cheap resources.
                                    - 40    -



    At the other end of the scale, affiliates in sbme non-commodity
industries—-public utilities, retail trade, and business and personal

services--concentrated heavily in their host-country markets.

    Over the last quarter-century, the trend has been for affiliates to become

more export oriented. The share of exports in total sales more than doubled

for manufacturing affiliates. That is a substantial shift in orientation, but

it was not as large as the rise in the share of exports in GNP or in output of

goods in the U.S. and in other countries.

    The export-orientation of affiliates varies by location as well as by

industry

 Afffliates   in all industries combined were more export-oriented in developing

 than in developed countries, partly because those in natural-resource

 industries were large exporters, and partly because of the high ratios for the

 Asia and Pacific countries. In manufacturing, the affiliates in Asia and Paci-

 fic countries exported over 40 per cent of their sales. Affiliates in Japan

 and in Oceania were very inward-looking, perhaps because these countries had

 comparatively protected markets.

      For the most part, overseas affiliates have relied little on the U.S. as

 a market, a little over 10 per cent of their sales in the two most recent

years for which we have data and a similar proportion twenty-five years

earlier. The unusually low share in 1966 and the exceptionally high U.S. share

in 1977 both reflected mainly the fluctuations of the petroleum industry.

     aExdluding trade and finance

Source: Appendix Table 7

     Affiliates in primary production——agriculture, mining, and petroleum

extraction--have, in general, been the most dependent on the U.S. market,
                                       — 42 —

 although the finance (except banking), insurance, and real estate group
entered that category in 1982. In the other broad industry groups, manufac-

 turing, construction, public utilities and transportation, wholesale and

retail trade, and services, sales to the U.S. have ranged from less than one

per cent of affiliate sales to a little over 10 per cent.

     If there has been any trend in some of the groups, it seems to be toward

an increasing dependence on the U.S. market. The largest jump was in the

finance group, as mentioned above, but there have been persistent increases in

manufacturing (more than a doubling of the share of sales to the U.S.) and,

over the last few years, a substantial one in wholesale trade. The rise of

almost 50 per cent in the dependence of manufacturing affiliates on the U.S.

market suggests the influence of the increasing exchange value of the dollar

in those years. It remains to be seen whether the reversal in exchange rates

will undo this shift in orientation.

     A widely discussed trend in the character of direct investment by the

U.S. and by other countries has been the move toward shared ownership, and

particularly toward minority ownership, with majority shares in the hands of

citizens of the host country. The less developed countries, particularly in

Latin America, have promoted this trend. Restrictions on majority ownership

were written into the Andean Pact and into Mexican law.

     Despite the pressure from host country governments, U.S. parent companies

have been more reluctant to share ownership in affiliates than companies from

other countries. Of the multinationals' affiliates surveyed in the Harvard

program that were established before 1951, 58 per cent of the U.S.—owned affi-

liates, 39 per cent of European affiliates, and 27 per cent of affiliates of

firms in other countries were wholly-owned. All these proportions had
                                      — 43 —

  decreased by the late 1960's to 46, 19, and 6 per cent, but the preference of

  U.S. firms for 100 per cent ownership remains clear (OECD 1981, p. 50).

       There has been some move by U.S. multinationals toward
                                                                sharing ownership.
  The proportion of total affiliate sales made by majority-owned affiliates fell

  from 88 per cent in 1966 to 77 per cent in 1982. The decline took place in the

  first ten years of that period, however, and there was actually a small rise

  between 1977 and 1982.

      There are large differences among industries in the shares of majority-

 owned affiliates, and the reduced share in the aggregate could represent

 shifts among, as well as within, industries. It is clear, however (see

 Appendix Table 8) that in all the major industry groups, the proportion of

 sales by affiliates less than majority owned grew between 1966 and 1982 in

 both developed countries and LDCs. The rise of these affiliates was important

 in mining, retail trade, and public utilities and transportation, and in LDCs

 they accounted for half or more of affiliate sales in these industries
                                                                          by
 1982. Thus, if the growth of these firms has been a response to host-

 countries' efforts to gain substantial shares in the equity of foreign owned

affiliates, the efforts have met with some success.

     One might expect that, given that technological or proprietary infor-

mation is the basis for the competitive advantage of multinational firms, the

more important these factors were in an industry, the greater would be the

reluctance of parent companies to share these advantages and the stronger the

insistence on control or, preferably, total ownership of affiliates. it is

indeed the case that among manufacturing industries, those that rank high with

respect to spending on R & D are also among the ones with the highest shares

of majority ownership.

The only exception was electronic components and accessories in developed

countries, largely in Japan (a country in which less than 20 per cent of manu-

facturing affiliate sales are from majority—owned affiliates). In fact, in

these industries, the share of majority-owned affiliates actually increased

between 1977 and 1982, despite the decline in the majority-owned share in

manufacturing as a whole.

     it is clear, then, that the policy of forcing shared ownership has not

been very successful for the LDCs in R & 0 intensive industries. The cost of

enforcing the policy may have been too great: a reduction in foreign invest-

ment in these industries and in the consequent transfer of technology.

The Recent Growth of Foreign Direct Investment in the U.S.

reaching its peak rate of growth, hardly any of the world's flow of new

direct investment was coming to the United States.

 From 1961 through 1967, less than 3 per cent of the flow to developed

 countries came to the U.S., and in 1967 the U.S. was the location of less than

10 per cent of the    world stock of direct investment (Hood and Young 1979, 18,

and U.S. Bureau of the Census 1975, Series U-35). The U.S. share of inflows of

direct investment to developed countries rose to over 10 per cent in 1968-73,

and since then has been over 20 per cent in every year through 1983. It has

stayed over a third since 1978 and reached as high as two-thirds in 1981. The

U.S. share of inflows to all countries has been over a quarter since the late

1970s and reached a peak close to 50 per cent -in 1981. The U.S. has absorbed

more than all developing countries together since 1978 and usually more than

all the European countries combined.

     With this large inflow of direct investment, the stock of foreign

direct investment in the U.S. has been growing very rapidly. One indication

of the growth is the comparison with assets of all U.S. corporations.

After staying around i per cent from 1950 through 1966, the ratio tripled

in the next 20 years, and more than doubled in the eight years from 1977 to

1985.

        Another way of describing the growth of foreign direct investment in

the U.S. is by comparing it with U.S. investment abroad.

 The greatest leap in foreign investment in the U.S. relative to U.S. invest-

ment abroad took place in the five years from 1977 to 1982 when foreign direct

 investment grew from less than a quarter of U.S. direct investment abroad to

60 per cent of it, and the ratio has continued to increase rapidly since 1982.

     Since these are book values, they are subject to the familiar doubts

about their meaning and comparability. The U.S. direct investments abroad are

much older, on average, than the foreign direct investments in the U.S. and

were made -in periods of much lower asset prices. It is therefore likely that

the use of book values understates the value of U.S. investments relative to

market values much more than it does the foreign investments. Thus, the extent

and growth of foreign investment in the U.S. relative to U.S. investment

abroad is probably considerably exaggerated in these figures.

     Another fact that points to such a bias is the difference in income.

Despite the relatively small ostensible difference in the value of the stocks,

income on U.S. direct investment abroad was more than four times as large as
                                     - 48   -



income on foreign direct investment in the U.S. in 1985 (U.S. Department of

Commerce 1986a and 1986b).

    For the most recent decade or so, data on employment provide a measure

of foreign firms' participation in the U.S. economy that is free of the

effects of exchange rate changes and conversion methods. This measure too

demonstrates the rapid growth of foreign-owned operations, but also indicates

that their role in the U.S. economy as a whole remains small.

     A point to keep in mind in comparing inward and outward direct investment

is that U.S. firms became multinational earlier than did most foreign firms

and probably reached something like an equilibrium stock of foreign assets by

the end of the 1960's. After that, there was not a large net movement of U.S.

firms into multinational status. Foreign firms, in contrast, have, for the

most part, become multinational fairly recently and are adding to their over-

seas operations rapidly because they have not reached the goals they have set.

One indication of the relative maturity in this sense of U.S. direct invest-

ment is that all (and more) of its growth came from reinvested earnings in
                                        — 49 —

 1984 and 1985, while most of the growth of other countriest direct investment

 in the U.S. is from flows of new equity and debt.

     U.S. parents were bringing some of their foreign assets back to the U.S.

by reducing equity and intercompany debt, while foreign companies were

increasing their holdings of U.S. assets far beyond their accumulation of

reinvested earnings.

Characteristics of Foreign—Owned Affiliates in the U.S.

     The fact that the share of foreign-owned firms in U.S. employment was

still only about 3 1/2 per cent in 1985 might appear to deflate the anxieties

that have beer aroused by the inflow of direct investment. However, the

explanation for that concern lies in the concentration of the investment;

half of the employment in foreign-owned firms is in manufacturing, which

accounted for only about 15 per cent of total nonagricultural employment in

the U.S. in 1984 (Appendix Table 10).

   Aside from mining, the ratios for which are affected seriously by
                                      — 50 -

 incomparabilities   between numerator and denominator, the greatest foreign

share in U.S. employment--7 per cent--is in manufacturing. That share almost

tripled in ten years.

     Employment in foreign-owned manufacturing operations more than doubled

while total U.S. employment in manufacturing stayed about constant or even

declined a little.

    Employment in foreign service affiliates rose at an even faster rate

than in goods production. However, in these industries U.S. total

employment was also rising, by about 50 per cent over 10 years. As a

result, although the foreign share increased, it did not grow as rapidly as

in manufacturing.

      At the end of the period, among trade, finance, and services, it was

  only in wholesale trade, probably closely tied to the distribution of

  imported goods, that the share of employment in foreign—owned firms reached

  5 per cent. In other groups the foreign share was under 3 per cent.

 However, the ratios for finance, insurance, and real estate are

 understated, because the data for foreign-owned firms omit banks. It does

 seem clear, however, that foreign penetration of the service sectors was

 relatively small.

     Within manufacturing also, there were wide differences among industries

 in the degree of foreign penetration. In 1984, almost 40 per cent of inanu-

 facturing employment in the chemical industry was in foreign—owned firms,

 while the proportions in other industries were all under 10 per cent.

   The foreign share increased substantially in every group, at least

doubling within each industry. However, the ranking of the industries
                                     - 52   —


hardly   changed at all. The greatest degree of foreign penetration was in

chemicals at the beginning and at the end of the period, followed by food

manufacturing industries, and there was a relatively small foreign

employment share in nonelectrical machinery in both periods. Thus the com-

parative advantages of foreign firms relative to U.S. firms seemed to

remain in the same industries.

    The industry distribution of employment in foreign firms in 1984 was

much more concentrated in manufacturing and petroleum, and in goods pro-

ducing industries as a group, than was U.S. employment in general, as can

be seen below.

The shares in trade and finance did not diverge as much from those of the U.S.

as a whole, especially if one takes account of the omission of banks from the

total of foreign holdings. However, the share of employment in foreign-owned

companies that was in service industries was less than a third of that for

U.S. firms.

    The differences in the distributions reflect two influences. Foreign

firms may have had a comparative advantage in goods production and U.S.
                                         - 54   -


 firms   in service production. However, the results may also reflect dif-

 ferences in the difficulty of carrying across national boundaries the com-

 parative advantages of firms. Whatever gives firms a comparative advantage

 or competitiveness in manufacturing industries, whether it is ownership of

 patents on knowledge of production techniques or management abilities, may

 be easier to move across national boundaries than the characteristics that

distinguish firms in trade and service industries. That might be because

of inherent characteristics of the two groups of industries or because

 there are many more regulatory and similar obstacles placed in the path of

service industry producers than in the path of goods-producing companies.

Since entry into the U.S. market is relatively unrestricted and the share of

foreign firms in services is small, the suspicion that there are inherent

obstacles to service industry direct investment is reinforced.

    The main trends in the industry distribution of foreign firms'

employment appear to move it toward the U.S. pattern. That is, the share

of mining and petroleum was declining, as was that; of manufacturing after

1977. The main increase in importance within foreign-owned companies was

in the service industries.

Sources of Foreign Direct Investment in the U.S.

    As foreign direct investment has flowed into the U.S. in the last few

years there have been periodic alarms about increasing control of U.S.

industry by companies from the Middle East or Japan. Despite the publi-

cized incidents of investments from these countries, the great bulk - 2/3

of the total -   of   foreign direct investment in the U.S. continues to be

controlled by European firms. Over 40 per cent of the foreign investment

is concentrated in two countries, the Netherlands and the U.K.

    It should be mentioned that the identification of firms by nationality is

often uncertain. These ratios may well understate the ultimate Japanese and

Middle Eastern stake that is partly held through firms incorporated in Europe.

Data on U.S. direct investment abroad include investments by U.S. firms

controlled by foreigners and data on foreign direct investment in the U.S.

include investment by foreign firms controlled by U.S. parents. In the latter

case, however, the surveys include a classification by ultimate beneficial

ownership.

   The shares of the different countries and areas vary from industry to

industry. Investment in the petroleum industry, for example is overwhelmingly
                                     — 56 —

from Europe, over 80 per cent of the total from the Netherlands and the U.K.

(Appendix Table 11). Investment in manufacturing, the area that receives most

public attention, is also largely from Europe — about 3/4 -   but   several

countries participate, 9 per cent from France, 10 per cent from Germany, and

12 per cent form Switzerland, aside from the usual high proportion, over 40

per cent, from the Netherlands and the U.K. Japan accounts for less than 5

per cent of this investment.

    Japan's investment is concentrated in wholesale trade. That investment is

more than half of Japan's total investment position in the U.S. and is more

than 40 per cent of total foreign direct investment in the industry. Japan

also plays a larger role in investment in U.S. banking--almost a fifth-—than

in the other industries.

    Investment from Latin America, largely the Netherlands Antilles, is

more concentrated in the U.S. real estate industry that that from any other

source. More than a quarter of Latin America direct investment and that

from the Netherlands Antilles is in that industry and over a quarter of

total foreign direct investment in real estate is from Latin America, most

from the Netherlands Antilles.

   The sources of the most recent growth in the foreign investment posi-

tion in the U.S. do not suggest revolutionary changes in the pattern.

 Europe accounted for 2/3 of the additions over the last five years, as it

 did for the stock. The major change was that Japan was the source of 14

per cent of the additions, as compared to only 6 per cent of the 1980 stock

and the Netherlands and the U.K. less than 50 per cent of additions as corn—

pared with a share in the 1980 stock of almost 60 per cent. Within manu-

facturing, increases in investment from France were small relative to the

initial stock and those from Switzerland and
                                                   Japan were relatively large,
the latter from a very small base of only 3 per cent of total foreign

investment in manufacturing.


    5. Portfolio Investment and Aggregate Investment Flows and Stocks

    The capital account of the United States has gone through wide swings,

representing what appears to be an underlying evolution of the U.S. from
                                        — 58 —

steady capital exporter in the 1960s to the world's major capital importer in
the mid—1980s. The major element of the U.S. capital outflow in the first

decade was the steadily growing direct investment flow to foreign countries,

averaging about $4 billion per year.

That trend of direct investment was not interrupted in the next few years, but

it was outweighed in 1971 and 1972 by the monetary troubles of the United

States, reflected in the additions to foreign official holdings in the U.S. of

over $183 billion a year and, until the devaluation of the dollar, by the

running down of foreign deposits in U.S. banks.

    The next ten years were turbulent, including the two oil price shocks

and two U.S. recessions that were severe by post—World War II standards.

U.S. direct investment abroad continued to grow and accounted for capital

export averaging about $12i billion a year, but it was reduced severely by

the 1982 recession and did not recover to earlier levels until 1985.

However, a new element entered the picture in this decade: foreign lending

by U.S. banks at the rate of over $37 billion a year, dwarfing the direct
                                         - 59   —

  investment that had been dominant in the 1960s. As U.S. banks lent
                                                                              abroad,

  they also absorbed deposits from abroad that were far larger than in earlier

  years, averaging over $20 billion a year. While the two series were not per-

  fectly synchronized, the bank lending and bank borrowing did move more or less

  in step, as U.S. banks acted as intermediaries between the countries accumu-

  lating assets and those absorbing them. The inflow of capital to the U.S.

 also included large additions to foreign holdings of U.S. Treasury securities

 and, beginning in the late 1970s, large direct investment flows to the U.S.

     The next few years were to see a spectacular reversal of the U.S.

 position. U.S. bank lending, which had averaged over $37 billion a year in

 the 1973-82 decade and over $80 billion a year in 1980-82 dropped to under

 a billion dollars in 1985. At the same time, U.S. bank borrowing from

 abroad, which had averaged a little over $20 billion a year during 1973-82

 and almost $40 billion in 1980—82, continued to average over $40 billion in

 1983-85. Thus, the U.S. was absorbing foreign capital through U.S. banks,

 through foreign purchases of Treasury securities, and through foreign purcha—

 ses of other U.S. securities.

Most of the foreign purchases of U.S. securities other than Treasury

securities in the last couple of years have been of bonds rather than stocks,

although stocks predominated earlier:

    The sources of other U.S. borrowing, including purchases of U.S.

Treasury securities and additions to U.S. bank liabilities other than

foreign official assets, were more widely dispersed.

In this case too, the industrial countries have been the main sources of

funds, but among them, Japan, included in the other industrial countries,

played a larger role than in purchases of corporate bonds. The Caribbean

centers are intermediaries, the origins of whose funds are not reported.

The rest of the U.S. borrowing, about a fifth, came mainly from the deve-

loping countries of Latin America and Asia.

    Changes in foreign official assets in the U.S. were relatively small on

net balance in 1983-85 but there were significant shifts among countries.

    Since the collapse of oil prices OPEC countries have been drawing down

reserves in the U.S. while the industrial countries and the developing

countries have been increasing them. In contrast, -in the four years before,

OPEC countries had been increasing their official reserve holdings in the

U.S. by almost $10 billion a year and the industrial countries had been

reducing theirs just about as fast. In the years after the first oil shock

all three groups of countries were adding to the official reserves held in

the U.S.

    The collapse of U.S. bank lending during the last three years includes

very different behavior toward industrial and developing countries.

Lending to developed countries changed little, but with respect to the

developing countries of Latin America and Asia the U.S. turned from net

lending to net repayment of debt.

    Over longer periods, the concentration of the growth of debt in a very

few years becomes evident. Almost two thirds of the total since the first

oil shock was extended during 1981 and 1982, and that pattern was repeated in

almost all the borrowing countries.

                                  6. Summary


     The United States has gone through several cycles in the state of its

foreign investment account. It was a borrower and international debtor

before World War I, first a lender and then a refuge for foreign capital

between the wars, the world's major lender and creditor after World War II,

and, in the last few years, a borrower again, and, according to the offi-

cial accounts, even a net debtor. Most foreign investment in the U.S. has
                                      — 65 -

  always been portfolio investment, although direct investment has been

  growing rapidly -in recent years, while most U.S. investment abroad has

  typically been direct investment. The major episodes of foreign portfolio

  investment by the U.S. have not been happy ones. One was the -intergovern-

 ment lending during World War I, eventually written off. A second was the

 burst of lending to Latin America -in the late 1920s, a good part of which

 ended in default. And the third was the large international lending of the

 period after the first oil crisis, much of which is of questionable

 standing now.

      The long period of U.S. borrowing before 1900 does not seem to have

 brought enough foreign capital into the U.S. for the transfer of resources

 involved to have made a great difference in the long run growth of the

 country. The role of the foreign capital appears to have been that of

accommodating capital needs for sharp bursts -in U.S. growth or in the

growth of particular sectors, especially capital-intensive ones, until

domestic saving caught up with capital formation. If the irregularity of

capital requirements was an intrinsic feature of rapid growth, the inflow

of foreign capital was more important than its size would indicate.

     U.S. direct investment abroad began while the U.S. was still an

overall borrower and debtor, as the technological leaders among U.S. manu-

facturing firms pioneered in the technique of exploiting their firm advan-

tages by producing in other countries. The major expansion -in U.S. direct

investment took place in the 1950s and 1960s, as U.S. firms took advantage

of the great advances in communication and transportation to spread their

production activities around the world. The peak in the stock of foreign

assets relative to domestic assets was probably reached during the early
                                     - 66   -


 1970s, although the share of their exports that multinational U.S. manufac-

turing firms produced abroad continued to increase after that.

     The bulk of U.S. direct investment abroad has always been in goods

production. However, there was a brief period in the 1920s in which almost

all of U.S. investment in public utilities was concentrated, presumably a

reflection of the U.S. lead in telephone systems and electric power production

and distribution. Within the production of goods there has been a shift away

from primary production, between a third and a half of the total in the 1950s,

to manufacturing, which reached its peak share in the late 1960s or early

1970s. Since then there has been growth in the trade and services sector, the

share of which roughly doubled between the mid-1950s and the mid-1980s and

reached almost a third of total direct investment. Most of this is in whole-

sale trade and finance, with other services, even including oil-field ser-

vices, still less than 5 per cent of U.S. direct investment abroad in 1985.

     Using foreign production to retain their competitiveness in world

markets, U.S. multinational manufacturing firms have been able to retain a

constant share of world exports of manufactures over the last 15 or 20

years, while the share of the U.S. as a country has fallen sharply. What

sustained the share of U.S. multinationals was the growth in their exports

from locations outside the U.S., to the point that almost half of their

exports now originate from their foreign production.

     The comparative advantage of both the U.S. and its multinational firms

is concentrated in chemicals, machinery, and transport equipment, to judge

by export performance. The multinationals' share is large relative to

that of the U.S. in chemicals, electrical machinery, and transport equip-

ment, but the share of the U.S as a country is greater -in non—electrical
                                       — 67 —

  machinery.   Among more narrowly defined industries, the multinationals'

  comparative advantage is strongest in industries with heavy investments in

 advertising and in R&D. R&D intensity, a major explanation of the com-

 parative advantage of the U.S. as a country, explains the comparative

 advantage of U.S. multinationals to an even greater degree.

      Over the last quarter-century u.s. affiliates in foreign countries

 have changed their operations in several respects. One is that they have

 become more oriented to exporting and another is that they have become more

 dependent on the U.S. market. However, they still sell mainly in their

 host-country markets, and what they do export goes mainly to countries

 other than the U.S. Exports to the U.S. market are only 14 per cent of

 their total sales.

      There has been an increase in the proportion of affiliates in which

parents own less than a majority share, although that trend has at least

slowed. Affiliates in the most technologically advanced industries con-

tinue to be majority-owned in most cases, presumably because sharing of

ownership would erode the very advantages that make direct investment pro-
fitable.

     While the flow of direct investment from the U.S. has slowed, there

has recently been a large inflow of foreign direct investment into the

U.S., roughly tripling the share of foreign-owned companies in the U.S.

since 1950, doubling it in the last decade, and reaching to about three

quarters of the value of U.S. investment abroad if those book value figures

are taken literally. They probably exaggerate the size of inward direct

investment relative to outward investment because so much of the inward

investment has occurred in recent years.
                                      - 68   —


     While foreign-owned firms accounted for only about 3 per cent of
total U.S. employment after all the recent growth in foreign investment,

the shares in manufacturing and wholesale trade were considerably higher.

Within manufacturing there was also considerable variation, with foreign

firms accounting for almost 40 per cent of chemical industry employment,

but in all the other industries for less than 10 per cent. The foreign

shares in service industries, aside from wholesale trade, increased, but

remained below 3 per cent. To some extent, these figures reflect U.S. com-

parative advantage in service industry production, but the fact that U.S.

companies' direct investment in foreign service industries is not itself very

large suggests that it may be difficult to carry firm advantages in these

industries across national borders.

     The sources of these foreign investment flows into the U.S. continue

to be mainly European countries, particularly the UK and the Netherlands.

However, there has been some increase in the flow from Japan, mainly into

wholesale trade. Most of that is probably connected with exporting from

and importing to Japan rather than with wholesale trading among U.S. com-

panies.

     Aside from the increased flow of direct investment into the U.S. in

recent years, there have been major shifts in the U.S. international capital

position stemming largely from changes in portfolio investment. The United

States became a very large capital importer in 1983-85 as U.S. banks

reduced their net lending to insignificant amounts overall and foreign

countries added greatly to their holdings not only of direct investment but

also of U.S. Treasury securities, other U.S. securities, and deposits in

U.S. banks. Most of the flows have been from Europe, as in the case of
                                     — 69 —

direct   investment, but Japan has also become an important investor, par-

ticularly in U.S. Treasury securities.

     The growth of U.S. bank claims on foreigners was concentrated in a

very short period after the second rise in oil prices, with most
                                                                   being
accumulated in 1981 and 1982. That concentration is unpleasantly remi-

niscent of the concentration of portfolio investment in the late 1920s, but

there has already been a substantial reduction in those claims in 1985

alone.
