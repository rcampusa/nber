                         Randomness   in Tax Enforcement




                                      ABSTRACT




        For moSt parameter values, Increased randomness about how auch taxaole
   income an auditor   uld assess leads to higher reported Income arid more
   revenue, When reducing randomness      is
                                         costly, optimailty requires some
   randomness in assessed taxable Income. Fven       if
                                                   reducing randomness     g
   costless, taxpayers may prefer some randomness when the increased revenue can
   be   rebated, so that the government a revenue stays fIxed. These    results   do
   not rely on   the presence of a distortion    in labor supply,

       ee (1987) reports that, although taxpayers have the right to ask, the RS
      for binding decisions on tax issues, these decisions have no eievance or

      of $10,000. We assume trat, due to costliress, taxpayers do not often taKe
      auvantage of this.



      Randomness could also be reduced by changing the tax law itself.   Por ex-
      ample, the U.S.    Treasury Department's tax reform proposal of Novemper,
      1984, Tax Reform for Fai,Simplicity, and Economic Growth, stressed
      the rnportance of simplifying tre tax code,     it further recognized tnat
      simplicity in taxation has several dimensions, among them that 'under a
      simple system, most responsible taxpayers would be more certain of their
      tax liapilities."   If the tax code is truly unclear in its details, then
      an ex post appeal to the Tax Court is just another lottery (a'though it        s
      better to have two chances for a victory than one). Stil , tre decision
      of the Tax Court is unpredictable.

    Our model    is    consistent    with two characterizations     o' auditors1 motives.

The 'inst is that each auditor enforces toe 1aw to the               cast    of h4s   on hen

ability,    but some tax issues a—a unoeroaim.           The second is that, wh4le       some

adtors      favor the Treasury and others favor toe taxpayer, the assignment o'

auditors to taxpayers is random.

point   of rome,      imposes no loss in expected utility and does not ohange the

amont —f reven,e collected.           Hence, it is socially desirable to save costs by

a1ow4ng sore raroomness in tax liability assessments, and to rebate the savings

to taxpayers.    Since this is true for every tax rate, it 'ollows that the optimal

rombnat'on of tax code and enforcement            pocy      reouras some    a—oomress.




    ments is not oostiy, and our ana'ysis does rot apply ther,    For example,
    it may cc that, wh4ie clarifying the tax code is costly, the increased
    clarity recuces the cost of training auoitors, and or net saves costs.



'
     This corroborates        the intuit1or of Roberts (1979) who argued that uncer-
     tainty of true tax       liability ensures conservative decision making by risk—
     ave—se agents, and       may therefore be preferable to the alternative of having
     explicit rules fo—       esery possible situation.



     The argument is smiiar to Baidry1s (1984) argumemt that         complete

     zero, is inefficient when the marginal cost of enforcemert  positive.'  s

      Our earlier paper (1987) gives examples to show that optma enforcement
      may or may not require a trivially small probability of audit, and infi-
      nitely high variance in assessed ncome.



      We assume that the increased revenue is returned to taxpayers as a lump sum
      rebate, rather than as a owered tax rate. This simp'cation nas been
      used Frequently in the literature. See, for example, Slenrod and Yitznaki
      (:987) and lowell (1985).  There are two Oifferences between lowering the

2.     UNCERTAINTY AND REVENUE




      We assume   that,   conditional      on audit, the auditor may assess one of two in-

audted that       'true taxable ncome' was overeported and a rebate is forthcoming.




       But we show in our earl1er paper (1967) that in thjs req4me tne optimal
       varanoe :n assessed income is f4nite.


                                                                               no
       That expected uti4ty may increase wth uncertainty even when there is
       cost saving is reminiscent of the results of Weiss (1976), Stiglitz (1992)

       distortions to the 'abor market, randomness in tax liability may impove
       welfare.   The welfare benefit of increased 'abor supply may outweigh the

says tre tax due on assessed income plus                  a   fine on the unreported           income.       If

use the notation
                          wNA, WAL,     w     to refer to the net incomes availaole to the

taxpayer      in   the    case of no audit, audit with a low assessment, rn—d, and audit

witn    a   ngh    assessment,        m+d.     Letting y        be the   taxpayers gross              income,

NA_1t wA=y               t(in+d)   tf(m+dr), and wAL= y-t(m-d) or WAL_            yt(flid)(mdr),

r<md, WAH<WAL<WNA.             When r>m-d,
                                           W,<WNA<WAL.


     Since the taxpayer's reported income will typically depend                        or'    d as well as

on   the    procability of audit and fine rate, the amount of revenue coi1ected will

a so depend on d.           We snow that when taxpayers have nonincreasing absolute risk

avers'or,5 reportec income rises with d, and therefore the amount of evenue

cc Jectec rises with a also.                   Taxpayers choose reported income r(d,p,t) to

maximize expected utility, knowing that an audit is possible.                           The optmai         '-e—




       Decreasing absolute risk aversion implies that in the choice cetween a safe
       asset and a risky asset, the risky asset is a normal good. Therefore de-
       creasing absolute risk aversion is often taken as a reasonable assumption
       about preferences.    However, when assessed income is a random va'iaDle,
       trere is no safe asset.

'      A report of m±d always dominates e larger report, because we assume fines

       the texpeyer is not audited, and has no advantage when the texpeyer is au-
       dited.   We allow the texpeyer to report negetive income. As one can see
       from the first—order conditions (4) end (5) below, the texpeyer will not
       do so if it forces income in the state of the world that he is audited and
       assessed high to be close to zero, provided the merginel utility of income
       goes to infinity as income goes to zero.

   Proposition        1:    Suppose      creferences        exhibit   nonincreasing absolute risk

nc"eases with d.           If d=0, a marginal increase in d does not               afect      revenue.




   Proof:          We discuss     this    seoarately        for the   domains     on wh;ch        r(.)<rn—d,


r()=m—d, m—d<r()<m+d and r()=m+d.                      Fi"st suppose that r()<m—a, wnich                   can

orly occur     i    p<1/(i+f).     Differentiating (4)           implctly,


      Since   excected      utility is a concave functon of r, the dervative is
      000increasing.        It follows that the r(.) wnich satisfies (4) and (5)                            s
      unique.


      If o=i and honestly reporting rm is therefore equiva'ent to noding a safe
      asset), the taxpayer will report r<m when p<1/(1+f), because the expected
      return to underreporting income is positive.   If p1/(1±f), the taxpayer
      will prefer to report rm,      Since probability of audit 1/(1f) makes

      There may be an interval of values on which r(.)m—d, althougn or d suf-
      ficiently large, m—d<r(), At rrr—d, the marginal utility of increasing r
      jumps down Oiscontinuousiy by the amount (pf/2)U[y—t(m—d)].   The optimal
      'eport r(•) equals m—d if these marginal utilities are on opposite sides
      of zero. For some values of d, a marginal increase in d will preserve the
       jump at r()m—d. If p<1/(1f), then revenue decreases with d on an in-
      terval where r(.)m-0.

3.    SOME RANDOMNESS IS OPTIMAL




     We now    argue   that,   wnsn   clarifying the tax         cods 4s   costlj, son       randomness

is optima'      irrespective of       now   or   why the other tax and enforcement parameters

are selected.          This is because a marginal Increase                in   d from   daO saves   costs

without reducing        expected utilit; or increasing revenue.



      ins following Lena        is required:

EU(r(d,p.t),d,p,t] with respect to d 4s                  zero.   That is, a marginal increase 'n

randomress does not decrease expected utility.




      Proof:    Suppose 'irst that p'1/(14f), so that taxpayers report r(O,p,t$m

wnen    d0.         The part;a1 derivat've            witn respect   to   r is zero because 0' tne

taxpayer's optimizing cnotce.               Therefore we on1y need to show that the partial

5. CONCLUSION




      We   first   showed   that the optimal tax           and enforcement poflcy         requires   some

      One implication of this study         is that, if tne enforcement agency maximizes


net revenue, it will bade a offerent view               o   rardomness than if it 'naxTh'izes

                 expected utslity.      An interpretatlon oc Proposition       I   is t'at, if
taxpayers

fines fixed, more randomness is a1wayx petter.               But more randomness may or may

not e'nanoe expected ut''ity.           Siemrod and Yitzhaki (1987) snowed that a s4r.iiar
