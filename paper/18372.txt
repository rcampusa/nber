                                                 ABSTRACT

This paper investigates whether the international globalization of financial markets allows for significant
cross-country risk-sharing at the business cycle frequency. We find that cross-country risk-sharing
is still limited and this is unlikely to be the result of financial frictions that limit state-contingent contracts.
Part of the limited international risk sharing could be the consequence of frictions that de-facto reduce
the short-term mobility of financial capital. But even with these frictions we find significant divergence
between model predictions and the data.

1. Introduction
    The globalization of capital markets that started in the 1980s created a
regime of high international capital mobility across industrialized countries
and several emerging economies. Indicators of international capital mobility,
both de-jure and de-facto, show that capital mobility increased significantly
since the early 1980s.1 For example, in the United States—the largest indus-
trialized country—the stocks of gross foreign assets and liabilities have more
than tripled during the last thirty years. Because income fluctuations remain
unsynchronized across countries—with the exception, perhaps, of the most
recent crisis—a natural question to ask is whether the global integration of
financial markets has facilitated international risk-sharing, particularly in re-
ducing the impact of country-specific income fluctuations on the consumption
of tradables goods.
    The fact that the cross-country ownership of foreign assets has increased
dramatically does not necessarily imply that countries are capable of better
smoothing their consumption of tradable goods relatively to their idiosyn-
cratic income over the business cycle. Even if countries experience large
international capital flows at low frequencies, which in turn lead to large
stocks of foreign assets, the cyclical dynamics of these flows may not generate
greater consumption smoothing at the business cycle frequency. Thus, the
first goal of this paper is to document whether the canonical model of optimal
consumption and savings with complete markets and full capital mobility is
consistent with the high frequency dynamics of consumption observed for a
set of industrialized and emerging economies.
    The canonical model includes two countries, each one endowed with
stochastic income processes for tradable and nontradable goods. In the em-
pirical application of this model, the first country is the “focus” country (for
example the US) while the second represents the rest of the world (the aggre-
gation of all remaining countries). We put together a sample of 21 countries
including 18 OECD countries and three large emerging economies. We then
solve the model for each of these countries, treating each one as the focus
country and pairing it with its corresponding rest-of-the-world aggregate. In
line with the structure of the model, we decompose the observed income of
each country into tradable and nontradable components. We then estimate

joint stochastic processes for the various components of income in the focus
country and its corresponding rest-of-the-world aggregate, and use them to
calibrate the model. Finally, we use numerical simulations to produce time
series for consumption and compare these with their empirical counterparts.
    Since our analysis focuses on the business cycle frequency, we abstract
from forces that drive international capital flows and consumption smoothing
at longer horizons, such as cross-country differences in medium- and long-
term growth. In this respect, our study differs in a complementary way from
Gourinchas and Jeanne (2011), who focus on growth differences across coun-
tries. Despite the different focus, we reach a similar conclusion: the canonical
model with complete markets and capital mobility displays dynamics very
different from the data.
    The assumption of complete markets made in the canonical model is
obviously very stylized and, at least in principle, raises the possibility that
incomplete markets may bring the model closer to the data. In line with
this argument, recent studies have emphasized the possible links between
incomplete markets, frictions in financial markets and global imbalances (see
Angeletos and Panousi (2011), Caballero et al. (2008), Fogli and Perri (2006),
Mendoza et al. (2009)). Since these studies mostly focus on low-frequency
movements in foreign asset holdings, it is natural to ask whether similar
frictions can also be important for explaining the high-frequency comovement
of tradable consumption and income within each country.
    To address this question, we extend the model by introducing incomplete
markets. We consider an environment where countries can trade only non-
state-contingent assets, subject to a lower bound (or borrowing limit). We
refer to this version of the model as the Bond Economy. We find that the
dynamics of consumption in the Bond Economy are very similar to the dy-
namics predicted by the model with complete markets. This implies that,
given the observed characteristics of income fluctuations, countries should
achieve a high degree of risk sharing even if non-contingent bonds are the
only assets traded in world asset markets. This result is reminiscent of results
obtained in previous studies showing that non-contingent bonds already pro-
vide significant consumption insurance (see Baxter and Crucini (1995) and
Heathcote and Perri (2002)).2 This result also implies, unfortunately, that

   2
   An earlier study in the finance literature by Telmer (1993) showed that trade in riskless
bonds could approximate well complete-markets equilibria in closed-economy models with



                                             2
the high-frequency dynamics of consumption predicted by the Bond Econ-
omy are quite different from the dynamics observed in the data because, as
observed above, the latter differ sharply from the dynamics predicted by the
complete markets model.
    Our Bond Economy model shares some of the features of the model pro-
posed by Bai and Zhang (2012) to study the effect of financial integration on
international risk sharing. They consider a global economy with a continuum
of heterogeneous small open economies trading non-state-contingent bonds
exposed to default risk, and with country income fluctuations purely idiosyn-
cratic. Our Bond Economy can be thought of as a two-agent variant of their
model without default but enriched to include uninsurable risk in the form of
nontradable goods and aggregate (global) shocks.3 Moreover, our work also
differs in that we focus on the time-series behavior of consumption, instead
of the cross-country panel elasticity of consumption with respect to income
in a stochastic stationary equilibrium.
    Since the Bond Economy with borrowing limit can be considered one
of the most restrictive forms of financial structure, our results cast doubt
on the hypothesis that financial market frictions that limit state contingent
contracts can explain the limited degree of international risk sharing at the
business cycle horizon.4 Notice that this does not imply that market in-
completeness cannot explain low-frequency movements in foreign assets and
international portfolio composition, or that financial frictions are not relevant
for the transmission mechanism at work during global financial crises.5
    The second type of frictions we consider as a potential mechanism to rec-
oncile the empirical dynamics of consumption with the theory is the presence

heterogeneous agents, and that the model does poorly at accounting for observed asset
returns. The model we propose in the next section can be interpreted as a version of
Telmer’s model if we remove nontraded goods and re-label countries as agents.
   3
     The consideration of nontradable goods and global shocks could be potentially impor-
tant. The imperfect risk sharing captured in Bai and Zhang’s estimate of the cross-country
consumption elasticity of about 0.6 could reflect the combined effects of nontradable goods,
aggregate shocks, and goods and assets trading costs, in addition to default risk.

restrict cross-country risk sharing.

ballero et al. (2008), Fogli and Perri (2006), Mendoza et al. (2009), and the recent literature
on the global crisis by Dedola and Lombardo (2010), Devereux and Yetman (2010), Enders
et al. (2011), Mendoza (2010), Mendoza and Quadrini (2010), Perri and Quadrini (2011).

of international portfolio rigidities. Starting from the Bond Economy as de-
scribed above, we add a convex cost of changing the stock of foreign assets.
This cost can be interpreted as capturing actual portfolio adjustment costs
at the individual level and/or rigidities that limit the international mobility
of financial investments.6 With this friction, the ability of the model to repli-
cate the empirical dynamics of consumption improves significantly, although
there is still a sizable divergence between the predictions of the model and
the data. Effectively, portfolio adjustment costs bring the economy closer
to financial autarky. Thus, an interpretation of this result is that, although
formal barriers to the mobility of capital have been lifted in most countries,
international financial markets remain intrinsically segmented in the short
term.
     This paper is related to the large literature on international risk shar-
ing and international real business cycles (IRBC). In particular, our findings
are in line with the empirical work by Lewis (1996). She concluded that
neither non-separability in tradable and nontradable consumption nor capi-
tal market restrictions could explain, separately, the observed consumption
co-movements. When considered together, however, the risk sharing pre-
dictions of a model with consumption non-separability and capital markets
restrictions cannot be rejected by the data. More recently, Kose et al. (2009)
provide further empirical evidence of a limited degree of international risk-
sharing in a large data set of industrialized and developing countries, and
find little impact coming from financial globalization.
     In the IRBC literature, our work is closely related to the studies by Stock-
man and Tesar (1995) and Benigno and Thoenissen (2008). Stockman and
Tesar showed that non-tradeability of goods does not improve the ability of
the IRBC model with complete markets driven by technology shocks alone
to match the observed higher cross-country correlations of output relative
to consumption. Benigno and Thoenissen showed that this remains the case
even if complete markets are replaced with a riskless bond, although with
this modification the model can explain the low correlation between the real
exchange rate and relative consumption. The work of Aguiar and Gopinath
(2007) is also relevant because they show that a business cycle model of
a small open economy can produce consumption volatility in excess of in-

   6
    Rigidities in international asset trading or capital controls have also been considered
in Backus et al. (1992) and Mendoza (1991a).



                                            4
come volatility as the result of shocks to growth rates or trends of income
processes. Thus, a complementary explanation for the apparent lack of in-
ternational risk sharing may derive from cross-country differences in trend
and stationary components of income fluctuations.
     The results of our analysis are also related to recent findings obtained by
Corsetti et al. (2011) and Fitzgerald (forthcoming). The findings of these
two studies suggest that an alternative force driving the lack of risk sharing
in the data may be fluctuations in real costs of trading goods. Fitzgerald
examined the extent to which cross-country variations in ratios of marginal
utilities can be accounted for by variations in relative wealth (i.e. devia-
tions from complete markets) versus other mechanisms that operate through
relative goods prices, and found that the former alone cannot account for
observed fluctuations in marginal utility ratios. Corsetti et al. showed that
the observed low correlation between relative consumption and real depreci-
ation, which IRBC models with complete markets cannot explain, tends to
be particularly low at cyclical frequencies. This is similar to our finding that
the complete markets model does a poor job at matching cyclical consump-
tion risk sharing. They also showed that an incomplete markets model with
nontradable goods can do better at accounting for this feature of the data
if it incorporates income effects from output shocks to both tradables and
nontradables, which can cause the international relative prices of a country
to strengthen, together with a rise in relative consumption.
     The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we illustrate
some empirical regularities that we take as targets for the quantitative appli-
cation of the model. Section 3 describes the theoretical model and Section 4
conducts the quantitative analysis. Sections 5 and 6 conduct some robustness
checks and the final Section 7 presents concluding remarks.

2. Empirical regularities
    We examine annual data for 18 major OECD economies and three ma-
jor emerging economies.7 We use output and consumption data from the
OECD’s National Account Statistics for the OECD countries and data from

  7
    The OECD countries in our sample are: the United States, the United Kingdom,
Japan, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Canada, the Netherlands, Australia, Sweden, Fin-
land, Norway, Denmark, Austria, Mexico, Turkey and Korea. The emerging economies
are Brazil, China and India.


                                          5
the World Bank’s World Development Indicators for the three emerging
economies. For all countries we draw population data from the United Na-
tions’ Population Information Network. All estimates reported here are based
on annual data measured at constant prices, expressed in per capita terms,
logged and detrended with the Hodrick-Prescott filter (using the smoothing
parameter λ = 100). The sample period is 1970-2007.
    Table 1 reports the standard deviations of total output, tradable output,
and nontradable output, as well as the relative standard deviations and elas-
ticities of total consumption to total output, and of tradable absorption to
tradable output. Total output is defined as GDP and total consumption is
final consumption expenditures of households. Tradable output is defined as
the sum of value added in agriculture and industry. Nontradable output is
defined as value added in services. Tradable absorption is defined as trad-
able output minus net exports. Nontradable absorption is by definition equal
to nontradable output. We use absorption measures because breakdowns of
consumption and investment data into tradables and nontradables are diffi-
cult to construct for some of the countries and years included in our sample.
Appendix A provides further details about the data.
    We emphasize three main patterns that emerge from Table 1:
   1. Output fluctuations in emerging economies are generally larger than
      those observed in industrialized countries.
   2. There is no obvious pattern in the variability of consumption relative
      to income. Across industrialized countries, the variability ratio ranges
      from 0.81 to 1.47 with a median of 1.05, while in emerging countries
      it ranges from 0.87 to 1.27 with a median of 1.14. The medians are
      consistent with Aguiar and Gopinath (2007) showing that emerging
      markets have higher consumption variability ratios, but the wider range
      for the industrialized countries shows that there are several economies
      with consumption variability ratios that are both higher than 1 and
      higher than the ratios observed in emerging economies.8 Moreover, the

    8
      Our limited sample of emerging economies excludes several countries that experienced
financial crises in the 1980s or 1990s (e.g. Argentina, Indonesia, Malaysia, Russia, Thai-
land, etc). Table 2 in Durdu et al. (2009) reports consumption-GDP variability ratios
for all emerging countries that had a crisis in the 1990s, and these ratios range from 0.54
to 2.25. This range is wider than the one we found for industrialized countries, but it is
still the case that several industrialized economies in our Table 1 have variability ratios
higher than 1 and higher than for several emerging economies in Table 2 of Durdu et al.

      cross-country average of the variability ratio is 1.11 across all countries.
   3. Tradable output is more volatile than total output, but tradable ab-
      sorbtion is proportionately even more volatile for a large majority of
      countries. This fact holds for all countries in the sample except Turkey.
      For most countries, the larger relative volatility of tradable absorption
      results in a larger elasticity of tradable absorption than for total con-

(e.g. Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Denmark and the U.K. in our Table 1 v. Ecuador,
Mexico, Peru, Hong Kong, Philippines and Thailand in their Table 2).

       sumption.
    Table A.1 in the appendix reproduces the same statistics as Table 1 but
separately for the subperiods 1970-1990 and 1991-2007. The distinction
between the two subperiods is of interest because the latter is commonly
thought as being characterized by greater financial integration. The table
shows that the patterns outlined above characterize both subperiods.
    Table 2 reports international correlations for total output, total consump-
tion, tradable output, and tradable absorption.9 The correlations are be-
tween a variable in country i and the same variable in the corresponding
estimate of the “rest of the world.” The rest of the world is the aggregation
of all countries included in the sample with the exception of country i (see
Appendix A).
    In accordance with the findings of existing studies on risk-sharing and
IRBC, the consumption and absorption correlations are systematically and
significantly lower than unity. They range from -0.15 to 0.77 for total con-
sumption and from -0.16 to 0.72 for tradable absorption. These statistics
contrast with the perfect consumption correlation predicted by the standard
two-country model with complete markets. Furthermore, and again in line
with earlier studies, output correlations are generally higher than consump-
tion or absorption correlations, both for total consumption (for 15 out of 20
countries) and for tradable absorption (for 14 out of 20 countries).
    Overall, the facts outlined in this section about consumption variability
ratios and international correlations suggest that there is limited consump-
tion risk sharing at the business cycle frequency. The next step is to examine
these facts from the perspective of a general equilibrium model.

3. Model Economy
    Consider a world economy with two countries indexed by i = {1, 2}.
Each country is inhabited by a representative agent with identical preferences
defined over consumption of tradable goods, cTi,t , and nontradable goods, cN
                                                                            i,t .
Preferences are homogenous across countries with lifetime utility given by

The function U (.) is twice-continuously differentiable, concave and satisfies
the Inada conditions. The function C(., .) is a CES aggregator of tradable
and nontradable consumption.
    Agents in each country i receive two types of income. The first is the
                                                    N
income earned in the nontradable sector, yi,t          . The second is income earned
                         T
in the tradable sector, yi,t . The state of the world economy at each point in
                                    T     T      N      N
time is given by the vector st = (y1,t , y2,t , y1,t , y2,t ), which follows a first-order,

                           st+1


   Each country’s holdings of potentially state-contingent, one-period inter-
national claims, are denoted by bi,t (st ). Their prices, denominated in tradable
goods, are denoted by q(st , st+1 ). The clearing condition in the international
asset market is

                   n · b1,t+1 (st+1 ) + (1 − n) · b2,t+1 (st+1 ) = 0,

which must hold for all possible realizations of st+1 . The variable n denotes
the population share of country 1 in the world population. Thus, 1 − n is
the population share of country 2. As we explain later, the relative size of
the two countries plays an important role because international risk sharing
is more limited to the extent that a country is relatively large.
    The international asset market structure can take different configurations
depending on the degree of capital mobility and the ability of asset markets
to provide insurance. We consider four alternative specifications.

3.1. Complete markets
    When markets are complete, bi,t+1 (st+1 ) represents a complete set of clas-
sic Arrow securities contingent on st+1 . Besides the imposition of a transver-
sality condition that prevents Ponzi schemes, there are no restrictions on the
contingencies that can be traded. Given that cN          N
                                                  i,t = yi,t , perfect risk-pooling
implies that the ratio of marginal utilities from tradable consumption in the
two countries stays constant over time, that is,
                                        ∂U (C(cT
                                               1,t ,c1,t ))
                                                     N

                                              ∂cT
                                                1,t
                                                              = κ.
                                        ∂U (C(cT
                                               2,t ,c2,t ))
                                                     N

                                                2,t


    The constant κ depends on the relative wealth of the two countries defined
as the expected present value of lifetime endowments in utility terms (see, for
example, Backus (1993)). This condition, together with the global market-
clearing condition for tradable goods,

                n · cT1,t + (1 − n) · cT2,t = n · y1,t
                                                   T                T
                                                       + (1 − n) · y2,t ,

determines the equilibrium allocations for the global economy.

                                                   10
   For the analysis that follows it will be convenient to remember that all
agents face a common set of prices for the Arrow securities. Furthermore,
expected intertemporal marginal rates of substitution are equalized across
countries, that is,

3.2. Bond economy
    In this market structure, agents cannot trade assets that are state contin-
gent. Therefore, bi,t+1 (st+1 ) ≡ bi,t+1 and q(st , st+1 ) = 1/Rt for all (st , st+1 ).
International capital markets are limited to trades in bonds denominated in
units of tradable goods and paying the risk free real interest rate Rt . The
resource constraint in tradable goods in each country becomes
                                         bi,t+1
                               cTi,t +             T
                                                = yi,t + bi,t .
                                          Rt
The market clearing condition in the asset market is

                          n · b1,t+1 + (1 − n) · b2,t+1 = 0.

   In addition, each country faces the borrowing limit bi,t+1 ≥ b. With this
constraint, the equilibrium allocation satisfies the optimality conditions

where µi,t is the Lagrange multiplier associate with the borrowing constraint.
    The first condition is the Euler equation for bonds while the second equa-
tion pins down the market-clearing (relative) price of nontradable goods, Pi,t .
This price equals the marginal rate of substitution in consumption between
tradables and nontradables.

3.3. Bond economy with costly portfolio adjustment
    As in the previous environment, agents can trade only non-state-contingent
bonds denominated in tradable goods. However, they face a quadratic cost
in changing bond holdings, that is, ϕi (bi,t , bi,t+1 ) = φi (bi,t+1 − bi,t )2 . The
resource constraint for tradable goods becomes
                                 bi,t+1
                       cTi,t +                                   T
                                        + ϕi (bi,t , bi,t+1 ) = yi,t + bi,t .             (1)
                                  Rt
    The equilibrium allocations must satisfy the world market-clearing con-
dition for tradable goods, ncT1,t + (1 − n)cT2,t = ny1,t       T
                                                                   + (1 − n)y2,tT
                                                                                  , as well as
the optimality condition equating the relative price of nontradables to the
marginal rate of substitution between tradables and nontradables. The Euler
equation for bonds now takes the form

      ∂U C(cTi,t , cN
                    i,t )

             ∂cTi,t
                    (                            h                              )
                        ∂U C(cTi,t+1 , cN i,t+1 )                              i

                                ∂cTi,t+1

As before, µi,t is the Lagrange multiplier for the borrowing constraint.
   Before continuing, we would like to emphasize that in this economy the
portfolio adjustment cost has implications similar to that of a convex cost of
trading goods (cost to change net exports). We will return to this point in
the quantitative analysis.

3.4. Financial autarky
    In financial autarky, countries do not trade any assets. Therefore, bi,t+1 (st+1 ) ≡
0 for all st+1 . Autarky in capital markets also implies autarky in goods mar-
kets since there is a single, homogeneous tradable good. Thus, consumption
of tradables must equal the income generated in the domestic tradable sector,
that is, cTi,t = yi,t
                  T
                      .
    The autarky outcome coincides with the limiting case of the bond econ-
omy with an infinitely high portfolio adjustment cost: when the adjustment
cost is very high, countries do not trade even if they are allowed to.

4. Quantitative Analysis
    The quantitative exercise involves solving and simulating the different
versions of the model (Complete Markets, Bond Economy, Bond Economy
with Portfolio Rigidities and Financial Autarky) for the 21 countries included
in our sample as described in Section 2. A description of the numerical
procedure is provided in Appendix C.
    In each simulation we pair one country (the focus country) with its corre-
sponding rest-of-the-world (ROW) aggregate. For example, in the first exer-
cise, country 1 is representative of the United States and country 2 aggregates
the remaining 20 countries. In the second, country 1 is representative of the
United Kingdom and country 2 aggregates all countries in the sample but
the United Kingdom. We then move to the third country, Japan, and repeat
the exercise until we have covered all the 21 countries included in the sample.
Notice that as we solve for the different versions of the model, we also find
the corresponding equilibrium world real interest rate and relative prices of
nontradable goods.
    After solving for the decision rules in the general equilibrium, we feed
the model with the actual realizations of tradable and nontradable incomes
constructed from the data over the period 1970-2007 and find the equilibrium
consumption time series implied by these particular realizations of income.
We then compare the consumption series predicted by the model with the
empirical absorption series over the same period and report statistics that
summarize the goodness of the fit. Notice that we use the absorption measure
from the data instead of consumption because the breakdowns of consump-
tion and investment data into tradables and nontradables are difficult to
construct for some of the countries and years included in the sample. In
Section 5 we examine the robustness of our findings to the use of a more
direct measure of tradable consumption which, however, is only available for
a shorter sample period and a smaller set of countries. In order to start the
simulation, we need to initialize the assets holdings bt in 1970 (subsequent
values are determined endogenously). It turns out that the simulation results
are not significantly affected by the starting values of bt . Given this, we set
the initial values to zero for all countries.

4.1. Calibration
    The parsimonious structure of the model implies that there are only a
few parameters that need to be calibrated. Since we are using annual data,

                                      13
we choose the period in the model to be one year and set the discount factor
to β = 0.95. The utility function with respect to aggregate consumption
                                                                   1−σ
is of the constant-relative-risk-aversion form, that is, U (C) = C1−σ . We set
σ = 2, which is a standard value in DSGE models. The consumption basket
is a CES aggregator
                             h                            i− 1
                      T   N         T −             N −
                  C(c , c ) = ω · (c ) + (1 − ω) · (c )         ,

where 1/(1 + ) is the elasticity of substitution between tradable and non-
tradable consumption. The two parameters that enter this function are set
to ω = 0.3 and  = 0.316, in line with some empirical evidence and exist-
ing parameterizations in open economy business cycle models. We have also
repeated the simulation for alternative values of  with similar findings.10
    Next we assign the lower bound for asset holdings. We set b to 50 percent
of the mean value of tradable income, which is normalized to unity. As we
document in Section 4.4, the results are not very sensitive to the value of b.
This holds as long as the parameter is not set to a value too close to zero, in
which case the specification converges to the autarky model.
    The stochastic processes for the endowments of tradables and nontrad-
ables are calibrated as follows. We start with the decomposition of GDP
data into tradable and nontradable series as described earlier in Section 2.
Then we organize these series into a set of pairs. In each pair, we treat a
given country as the reference country i, or the ‘home country,’ and the other
country is the corresponding ROW construct defined as the aggregate of all
other countries included in the sample except country i. Hence, as we change
the reference country i in each pair, we also change the corresponding ROW
aggregate. To make this explicit, we use the index i∗ to denote the ROW
economy with respect to country i.
    For tractability reasons, the stochastic structure of the model is simplified
by assuming that tradable endowments, sTt ≡ (yi,t      T
                                                         , yiT∗ ,t ), and nontradable
               N       N   N
endowments, st ≡ (yi,t , yi∗ ,t ), follow two independent Markov processes, with
each process including two realizations for each variable. Therefore, there are

  10
    The value of  = 0.316 corresponds to an elasticity of substitution of 1/(1 + ) = 0.76.
This is between the estimates of Ostry and Reinhart (1992) who find an elasticity of 1.28
and Stockman and Tesar (1995) who find an elasticity of 0.44. To check the robustness of
our results, we have also simulated the model with  = −0.219 and  = 1.27, corresponding
to elasticities of 1.28 and 0.44, respectively. The general findings do not change.

                                                   g
    Let πj,j be the transition probabilities for st , g ∈ {T, N }. Following
            0

Mendoza (1991b) we assume that these transition probabilities are given by
the bi-variate version of the Simple Persistence Rule as follows:
                            g             g  g      g
                           πj,j 0 = (1 − θ )Πj 0 + θ pj,j 0 ,                     (3)

where θg is a persistence parameter, Πgj0 is the long-run probability of the j 0
realization of state sgt+1 , and pj,j 0 = 1 if j = j 0 andP0 otherwise. The transition
probabilities naturally satisfy 0 ≤ πj,j 0 ≤ 1 and j 0 πj,j 0 = 1. The stochastic
structure is further simplified by imposing symmetry in the realization vec-
tors and in the long-run probabilities of symmetric states. In addition, the
Simple Persistence Rule imposes that the first-order autocorrelations of the
two variables are the same. This is not a significant limitation because, as
we show in Table A.2 in the Appendix, the first-order autocorrelations of the
various income processes are not very different.
    With the above restrictions in place, each Markov process can be char-
acterized by four parameters: the unconditional standard deviations of the
home and foreign income shocks, σig and σig∗ , the unconditional contempora-
neous correlation between home and foreign shocks, ρgi,i∗ , and the common
first-order autocorrelation ρg of the home and foreign variables. See Ap-
pendix B for further details.
    The parameters σig , σig∗ and ρgi,i∗ are set to match their empirical coun-
terparts for each country and each good as reported in Table A.2 in the
Appendix. Meanwhile, the parameter ρg is set to the average between the
autocorrelation of the home shock, ρgi , and that of the ROW shock, ρgi∗ .

4.2. Complete Markets and Bond Economy
    Figure 1 plots two tradable consumption series. The first series is from
the data (continuous line) while the second (dashed line) is generated by
the model with complete markets. It is important to remember that the
empirical series for consumption measure tradable income absorbtion, that
is, tradable output minus the trade balance. The model does not feature
capital accumulation, so in the model consumption coincides with absorption.
In Section 5 we also use actual tradable consumption measurements which,
however, are only available for fewer countries and for a shorter time period.
    With complete markets, the ratio of marginal utilities from tradable con-
sumption between country i and its corresponding ROW aggregate remains

                                          15
constant across time and states of nature. In the simulation, we choose this
constant ratio based on the relative per-capita wealth of the two countries
(focus country and the corresponding ROW aggregate). Notice that, even
though the ratio of marginal utilities in tradable consumption is constant, the
ratio of tradable consumption is not constant because marginal utilities also
depend on nontradable consumption. As we can see from Figure 1, there
is a significant divergence between the data and the model with complete
markets.
    To better understand the dynamics of tradable consumption predicted by
the model, Figure 2 plots tradable income and tradable consumption for both
countries in each simulation. The figure shows that the tradable consump-
tion of country i follows closely the aggregate tradable output of the second
country (ROW). Since the second country results from the aggregation of all
remaining countries, its size is usually much larger than the size of country
i. Effectively, the income of the ROW country approximates worldwide in-
come whose fluctuations cannot be insured. Thus, it is not surprising that
the tradable consumption of country i follows closely the tradable income
(and consumption) of the ROW country, especially when country i is rela-
tively small. This shows the importance of considering global shocks in the
analysis of cross-country risk-sharing.
    One of the goals of this paper is to investigate whether financial market
frictions could explain part of the divergence between observed absorption
and simulated consumption. Of course, there are different ways of capturing
market incompleteness. As explained in the previous section, we consider
the simplest characterization of incomplete markets in which countries can
trade only non-contingent bonds (standard borrowing and lending).
    As can be seen in Figure 3, the dynamics of tradable consumption gener-
ated by the Bond Economy are almost identical to the dynamics generated
by the Complete Markets Economy. This implies that the ability of the Bond
Economy to capture the empirical dynamics is also limited. From this we
conjecture that, given the nature of national income fluctuations implicit in
the data, financial market frictions that prevent trade in contingent claims
do not play on average a crucial role in limiting international risk-sharing.
As long as countries can trade non-contingent claims, they should be able to
achieve a high degree of risk sharing.
    The intuition for this result is that the borrowing constraints are not
binding very often. And when the constraints are not binding, bonds are
good insurance instruments against country income fluctuations with the

                                      16
characteristics observed in the data. The exception are episodes in which
countries face binding borrowing constraints, as in the event of financial
crises. But these episodes arise infrequently.

4.3. Portfolio Adjustment Cost Model
     Since the Bond Economy can be considered one of the lowest forms of
financial sophistication (high degree of financial frictions), the divergence
between the cyclical consumption predicted by the model and its data coun-
terpart must be explained by other frictions.
     We now consider the economy with Portfolio Adjustment Costs. In this
economy, agents can trade non-contingent bonds bt . However, in re-adjusting
their bond holdings, agents in country i incur the cost ϕ(bt , bt+1 ) = φ(bt+1 −
bt )2 . Notice that it is not relevant for equilibrium allocations whether the
cost is incurred by a country or by its ROW aggregate. Therefore, we assume
without loss of generality that the cost is incurred only by country i.
     This adjustment cost formalizes in reduced form several types of rigidi-
ties. For example, it could derive from actual costs in changing individual
portfolios or from restrictions in international financial transactions. In the
second case, the cost would capture formal and informal limits to interna-
tional capital mobility. The cost could also reflect the effect of financial
frictions that are not well captured by the Bond Economy, such as the im-
plications of informational costs or the heterogenous liquidity and maturity
profile of external assets. Of course, by taking this reduced-form approach,
we do not provide a micro-foundation for this cost. Our interest is in study-
ing whether the cost can reduce the gap between the observed absorption
dynamics and those generated by the model.11
     We would also like to emphasize that this type of rigidity has similar im-
plications as trade costs, that is, rigidities that limit changes in imports and
exports. Some studies have proposed these costs as a potential explanation
for the observed lack of international risk sharing (e.g. Fitzgerald (forthcom-
ing)). In fact, abstracting from interest payments, an increase in the stock
of bonds held by country i is associated with an increase in net imports of
the same magnitude.12

  11
     As observed earlier, the adjustment cost does not imply that countries cannot have
large net foreign asset positions. It only smooths their changes, affecting the short term
dynamics (i.e. business cycle frequency).

     We are grateful to Mark Aguiar for pointing out this similarity.

    To assign a value to the parameter φ, we proceed as follows. For each
country we find the value of φ that minimizes the sum of squared differences
between the tradable consumption series generated by the model for country
i, and the tradable absorption series observed in the data. The feasible values
of φ are constrained to be in the interval [0, 10]. With a value of φ = 0 the
specification coincides with the Bond Economy. At the other end, a value of
φ = 10 effectively brings the economy to financial autarky. The minimizing
values of φ are reported in Table 3 and the series generated by the model are
plotted in Figure 4.
    For several countries, the introduction of the adjustment cost improves
significantly the fit of the model. For these countries, the minimizing value
of φ is at the upper bound. As stated above, this brings the economy close

    to a regime of Financial Autarky. Therefore, for a majority of countries, the
    Autarky equilibrium seems to better capture the ‘high frequency’ movements
    in tradable consumption. Again, this does not mean that countries cannot
    have large net foreign asset positions. However, these positions could be very
    sticky in the short term.
        Another way to summarize the performance of the various versions of
    the model is to compute the elasticities of absorption and consumption to
    income. Table 4 reports the elasticities of both tradable consumption (trad-
    able absorption in the data) to tradable income and total consumption to
    total income. The model with portfolio adjustment costs generates elastic-
    ities that are much closer to the data. This is another indicator of limited
    risk sharing at high frequency horizons.
        Although portfolio rigidities improve the fit of the model, there is still

                                                19
significant divergence between the model and the data. Therefore, other
factors not explicitly considered here must play some role. We leave the
investigation of these other factors for future research.

4.4. Sensitivity to the borrowing limit
    We now show that the results obtained so far are not sensitive to the
borrowing limit. Table 5 reports the φ estimates and the associated sum of
squared errors under a tighter borrowing limit, that is, b = −0.25 compared
to b = −0.5 in the baseline calibration. The numbers reported in the table
are almost identical to those reported in Table 3 for the baseline model.
Therefore, the results are not sensitive to the borrowing limit. This holds as
long as b is not too close to zero. The limiting case where b = 0 is equivalent
to the autarky specification, and therefore, also to the portfolio rigidity model
with an infinitely large portfolio adjustment cost.

5. Alternative empirical benchmark
    In Section 4 we used data on tradable goods absorption to measure the
fit of our respective models. In this section, we repeat the analysis with
an empirical measure of tradable goods consumption rather than tradable
goods absorption. Following Stockman and Tesar (1995), we proxy non-
tradable consumption with consumption of services and compute tradable
consumption by subtracting nontradable consumption from total consump-
tion. While we find this measure of tradable consumption a priori preferable
to the absorption measure used in Section 4 to gauge the fit the model, we
refrain from using it in our main analysis because of data availability. Com-
plete consumption time series by type for the period 1970-2007 are indeed
only available for a very small number of countries in our sample. For this
reason, in this section we focus on the sample period 1985-2007. For this
period, complete data series are available for 10 countries (see Appendix A
for details).
    Table 6 reports the sum of squared errors between the data and the model
under this alternative empirical benchmark. The key findings of Section 4
do not change. In particular, it is still the case that the Bond Economy
yields sum of squared errors that are very similar to the Complete Markets
Economy. Furthermore, as for the baseline analysis based on an empirical
absorption series, portfolio adjustment costs reduce the sum of squared errors

for all countries and do so significantly for some of them.13 Therefore, the
finding that portfolio adjustment costs improve the fit of the model remains
valid when we use a consumption time series as empirical benchmark.

that the endowment processes follow stochastic trends, in line with the shocks
to growth rates or trends introduced by Aguiar and Gopinath (2007). The

where zi,t follows a stationary process. This variable is the gross growth rate
of tradable endowment.
    The process for the nontradable endowment is specified as

                                yi,t = yi,t−1 zi,t ,
        N
where zi,t also follows a stationary process. This specification guarantees that
the ratio of tradable and nontradable endowments is stationary within each
country even if the two endowments are not stationary. Thus, the growth
rates of the two sectors converge to a common long-run average, in line

with standard balanced growth assumptions. The variables (z1,t      , z2,t , z1,t , z2,t )
follow a joint first order Markov process.
       In order to solve the model, we normalize the non-stationary variables by

the lagged value of tradable endowment yi,t−1    and use the tilde sign to denote
the normalized variables. For example, normalized tradable consumption is

c̃Ti,t = yTi,t . Similarly, nontradable consumption is given by c̃N    i,t  =      T

    Once normalized, the model can be solved using the same methodology
used to solve the model with stationary endowments. The only complication
is that we have an additional state variables. In addition to s̃t and b̃1,t —which
are the equivalent of st and b1,t in the version of the model with stationary
endowments—we now also have country 1’s endowment share ψt ∈ [0, 1].

tradable incomes (rather than HP detrended tradable incomes). The empiri-

cal counterparts of z1,t and z2,t are the ratios of nontradable income to lagged
tradable income, which we detrend using the HP filter.

   of countries, the model with portfolio rigidities still improves the fit of the
   model. The right section of the table reports the elasticities of tradable
   consumption growth (tradable absorption growth in the data) to tradable
   income growth. For the elasticity as well, we see that portfolio rigidities still
   improve the performance of the model for a majority of countries.

   7. Conclusion
       This paper investigates the extent to which international globalization of
   financial markets allows for cross-country risk-sharing at the business cycle
   frequency. Our analysis suggests that cross-country cyclical risk sharing is

                                              24
still limited and that this is unlikely to be the result of financial market fric-
tions that limit the availability of state-contingent trades (insurance) and/or
to sizable nontradable income fluctuations. Frictions that de-facto reduce the
short-term mobility of financial capital or international portfolio adjustment
costs play an important role but do not completely eliminate the gap between
the predictions of the model and the data. We leave for future research the
investigation of additional factors that could explain the still limited degree
of international risk sharing.

Appendix A. Data sources and definitions
    For all OECD countries (the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan,
Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Canada, Netherlands, Australia, Sweden, Fin-
land, Norway, Denmark, Austria, Mexico, Turkey, Korea), we use data from
the OECD’s National Account Statistics. Total output is GDP. Tradable
output is the sum of value added in “agriculture, hunting and forestry, fish-
ing” (sectors A and B) and “industry, including energy” (sectors C to E).
Nontradable output is the sum of value added in “construction” (sector F),
“wholesale and retail trade, repairs, hotels and restaurants” (sectors G to I),
“financial intermediation, real estate, renting and business activities” (sectors
J to K) and “other services” (sectors L to P).
    For Brazil, China and India, we use data from the World Bank’s World
Development Indicators. Total output is again GDP. Tradable output is the
sum of value added in “agriculture” and “industry.” Nontradable output is
value added in “services, etc”.
    We also considered a measure of tradable consumption for the analysis
reported in Section 5. There, we proxy nontradable consumption with con-
sumption of services (“final consumption expenditure of households on the
territory, service”) and compute tradable consumption by subtracting this
proxy for nontradable consumption to total private consumption (“final con-
sumption expenditure of households on the territory”). Since disaggregated
consumption data is only available for a handful of countries for the whole
sample period 1970-2007, we restrict the sample period to 1985-2007. For this
subperiod, disaggregated consumption data is available for Australia, Aus-
tria, Canada, Finland, France, Korea, the Netherlands, Norway, the United
Kingdom and the United States. Therefore, the simulation results are re-
ported only for this sub-sample of 10 countries.
                                           T     N
Rest of the world (ROW) aggregates. Let Yj,t , Yj,t and Nj,t respectively de-
note tradable output, nontradable output and population of country j. To
construct the ROW aggregates relatively to the focus country i (indexed by
i∗ ), we perform the following steps:

  1. We compute tradable output, nontradable output and population of
     ROW with respect to country i as
                     X                 X                 X
           YiT∗ ,t =     T
                       Yj,t , YiN
                                ∗ ,t =
                                           N
                                         Yj,t , Ni∗ ,t =   Nj,t .
                      j6=i                  j6=i                j6=i



                                       26
2. We then compute per-capita tradable and nontradable outputs for
   country i and for its corresponding ROW as

                   Yi,tT                Yi,tN                   YiT∗ ,t                 YiN
                                                                                          ∗ ,t
        Yei,tT =         ,   Yei,tN =         ,    YeiT∗ ,t =           ,   YeiN
                                                                               ∗ ,t =          .
                   Ni,t                 Ni,t                    Ni∗ ,t                  Ni∗ ,t

3. Next we log and detrend the per-capita variables Yei,tT , Yei,tN , YeiT∗ ,t , YeiN∗ ,t

   using the Hodrik-Prescott filter with smoothing parameter λ = 100.
                                                       T       N
   The detrended cyclical components are denoted by yi,t   , yi,t  , yiT∗ ,t , yiN∗ ,t .

Appendix B. Calibration of Markov processes
    Endowments for each of the two goods g ∈ {T, N } have two realizations,
resulting in four possible realizations for nontradable endowments and four
possible realizations for tradable endowments (two in country i and two in
country i∗ ). Therefore, the state of nature for the world economy has 16
possible outcomes. Denoting by sgt = (yi,t g

are given by the “simple persistence rule”
                                 g             g  g      g
                                πj,j 0 = (1 − θ )Πj 0 + θ pj,j 0 ,


where θg is a persistence parameter, Πgj0 is the long-run probability of state
sg (j 0 ) , and pj,j 0 = 1 if j = j 0 and 0 otherwise.   P The transition probabilities
                                   0
satisfy 0 ≤ πj,j 0 ≤ 1 for j, j = 1, . . . , 4 and j 0 πj,j 0 = 1 for j = 1, . . . , 4. The

dard deviations of the shocks are equal to σig = yig and σig∗ = yig∗ . The
contemporaneous correlation is ρgi,i∗ = 4Πg − 1 and the common first-order
autocorrelation is ρgi = ρgi∗ = ρg = θg .

Appendix C. Computational procedure
    We describe here the computational procedures used to solve for the com-
petitive equilibrium in the Complete Markets Economy, in the Bond Econ-
omy and in the Costly Portfolio Adjustment Economy. The autarky equilib-
rium is trivial to compute since each country consumes its own endowments
of tradables and nontradables.

where κ is a constant pinned down by the relative wealth of the two countries
in the initial simulation period and ni is the population share of country i.
The first equation imposes that the ratio of marginal utilities stays constant
over time while the second equation is the worldwide resource constraint.

Bond Economy. The computation of the equilibrium in the Bond Economy
is more complex since the borrowing constraints are occasionally binding.
The solution is based on a Projection Method. We first discretize the bond
holdingshof country i, bi,t . We
                              i choose a grid of 51 equally spaced points in the
interval b , −(ni /(1−ni ))b . The stochastic endowments are also discretized
as described in the calibration section. We then find the values of cTi,t , cTi∗ ,t ,
bi,t+1 , bi∗ ,t+1 and Rt at each grid point of the state space by solving the system
                                               bi,t+1

    The first and second equations are the budget constraints for each country.
The third equation is the market clearing condition for bonds. The last
two equations are the optimality conditions for the choice of bonds. The
inequality signs account for corner solutions (binding borrowing constraint).
    In order to solve the last two equations we need to compute the expec-
tations on the right hand side of these equations. This requires an iterative
procedure where we guess the (approximate) functions

    The approximation functions for the expectation terms are given by linear
interpolations of the values assigned to these terms at each grid point of
the state space. Therefore, the guess for these functions consists of values
assigned to the expectation terms at each grid point for st .

                                                        31
    Once we have the guessed functions ϕi (st ) and ϕi∗ (st ), we can solve the
above five equations at each grid point using a nonlinear solver. The solutions
are then used to compute the expectation terms one period earlier at each
grid point. This provides the new guesses for ϕi (st ) and ϕi∗ (st ). We repeat
the procedure until convergence.

Costly Portfolio Adjustment Economy. The procedure is analogous to the
Bond Economy after replacing the budget constraint (C.3) and the Euler
condition (C.6) for country i with equations (1) and (2).
