We introduce a general framework to analyze the trade-off between education and family size. Our
framework incorporates parental preferences for birth order and delivers theoretically consistent birth
order and family size effects on children's educational attainment. We develop an empirical strategy
to identify these effects. We show that the coefficient on family size in a regression of educational
attainment on birth order and family size does not identify the family size effect as defined within
our framework, even when the endogeneity of both birth order and family size are properly accounted
for. Using Danish administrative data we test the theoretical implications of the model. The data does
not reject our theory. We find significant birth order and family size effects in individuals' years of
education thereby confirming the presence of a quantity-quality trade off.

1     Introduction

Understanding the effect of changes in family size on children’s education has been an ongoing
concern in economics. Existing theoretical discussions have followed Becker and Lewis’s [6]
seminal paper. Under the assumption that parents treat all children equally, these models
predict that an increase in family size reduces children’s education.1 A separate strand of
the literature, proceeding mostly on empirical grounds, has shown that the equal treatment
assumption overly simplifies how education is distributed within the household. For example,
Black et al. [12] investigate the relationship between family size and education, while taking into
account differences in the order of birth of a child, their birth order. There are two important
results coming from this empirical literature. The first is that birth order negatively influences
a child’s education. The second is that after controlling for birth order, there is no evidence
supporting a negative effect of family size on a child’s education. In other words, the existing
empirical evidence do not support the hypothesis of a quantity-quality trade-off.2
    This paper formulates a model of fertility choice that incorporates parental preferences for
specific birth orders. The theory delivers theoretically consistent birth order and family size
effects on children’s educational attainment. Specifically, the theory predicts that an exogenous
increase in family size reduces average human capital within the household, even when birth order
effects are present. The theory also highlights the limitations of existing empirical strategies in
identifying the effect of family size in the presence of birth order predispositions; primarily due
to not fully accounting for the fact that family size and birth order are jointly determined.
Guided by the theory, we introduce and implement a simple empirical strategy that identifies
the effect of family size on children’s human capital separately from birth order effects. We test
the model’s predictions using a population-wide comprehensive administrative panel dataset
from Denmark.
    We find that birth order has a strong negative effect on a child’s education, consistent with
existing empirical studies. Controlling for family fixed effects and with a linear birth order effect,
    1
      The literature on family size and education is too large to provide a detailed account here. From a theoretical
perspective, Barro and Becker [4], Becker, Murphy and Tamura [7], Becker and Tomes [8], Doepke [14], and Galor
and Weil [15] study family size and education in models of economic growth. Some empirical studies include Ahn
et al. [1], Angrist et al. [3], Behrman et al. [11], Glick et. al [16], Hanushek [18], Li et al. [23], Millet and Wang
[25], Parish and Willis [28], Qian [29], and Schultz [32]. These studies typically abstract from birth order effects.
    2
      Recently Mogstad and Wiswall [26] have argued that this result may not be robust to nonlinear family size
effects, an issue we shall return to in this paper as well.




                                                          2
an additional birth order reduces years of schooling by little less than one fifth of a year. Results
are similar in magnitude when we allow for nonlinear birth order effects. However, contrary to
the previous literature, we find that family size, once carefully analyzed in the light of the theory,
has a strong negative effect on the distribution of education in the household; particularly on
the household’s average. Quantitatively, in the case of linear family size effects, an additional
child reduces the average number of years of schooling in the household by about one tenth of a
year. In a more flexible specification we find evidence of nonlinear family size effects. Overall,
we provide evidence supporting the existence of a trade-off between quality and quantity of
children.
   Our findings relating to the effect of family size appears at odds with previous findings in
e.g. Black et al. [12]. We use our model to shed light on the reasons behind the different
results. Consider two households with different family sizes but equal expenditures on chil-
dren. Since expenditures are equal, per child education should on average be lower in the
larger household. This effect of family size is a consequence of limited parental resources, or
the quantity-quality trade-off. But differences in family size necessarily translates into differ-
ences in birth orders within the two families, changing the distribution of education within the
household. Importantly, the average birth order is higher in the larger family. A comparison
of the educational outcomes of children with the same birth order in families of different sizes
confounds the quantity-quality trade-off with differences in the average birth order effect in the
two families. Specifically, if parents have a predisposition to favor low birth orders, we show that
the coefficient on family size in a regression of educational attainment on birth order and family
size provides a biased-towards-zero estimate of the family size effect and thus leads to a false
rejection of the quantity-quality trade-off. This is true even when the endogeneity of both birth
order and family size are properly accounted for as in e.g. Black et al. [12]. The bias is not due
to endogeneity; it arises because one cannot manipulate family size, holding the within-family
distribution of birth orders constant.
   Our empirical strategy overcome this complication in two simple steps. In the first step,
we estimate birth order effects controlling for family-fixed effects. In the second step, we “net
out” the estimated birth order effects from the child’s education and estimate the effect of an
exogenous change in family size using an instrumental variable approach. One can also think
of the two steps as identifying birth order effects from within-family variation in educational


                                                  3
attainment in the first step, while the second step utilizes between-family variation in educational
attainment to estimate the family size effect, or the quantity-quality trade-off.
        The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces our model of fertility
in which parents have general preferences for birth order. Section 3 discusses the empirical
implications associated with the theory. Section 4 describes our data. Section 5 presents our
main results, and section 6 concludes.


2        A model of birth order and family size

This section presents a simple model of fertility in which parents treat children differentially.
Our focus is on parents’ choices regarding family size and their children’s human capital. We
keep in the background other endogenous choices that parents may make (e.g., choices regarding
parental consumption and time allocation). A general model is presented in the Appendix. We
assume that family size is a continuous variable and that parents make all decisions in a single
stage of choice.3 Children are born sequentially but within this single stage.
        Let N represents family size. Let i represent the order in which children are born, their birth
order. Birth order is jointly realized with family size, i ∈ [0, N ]. A child’s human capital is a
function of her birth order, h(i). Parents are altruistic; their utility depends on family size, N ,
and the human capital at each birth order, h(i), as in

                                                          Z    N
                                        U (h, N ) ≡                u(h(i), i)di,                              (1)
                                                           0


where the function u(h(i), i) denotes the parents’ utility function. This represents the indirect
utility function that nets out the other choices parents make (i.e., choices other than those of N
and h(i)) after taking into account constraints other than the budget constraint

                                             Z     N
                                                       p(i)h(i)di ≤ Y ,                                       (2)
                                               0


in which Y is the parents’ total spending in their children and p(i) > 0 is the (given) cost
per unit of human capital for a child born at order i. The cost p(i) captures pure pecuniary
advantages for some birth orders.
    3
    In the empirical analysis, we take family size to be a discrete variable. The central predictions of the model
are not sensitive to whether family size is modeled as a continuous or a discrete variable.


                                                              4
    The utility function u(h(i), i) captures birth order differences in child endowments, abil-
ity, and pure parental preferences.4 Human capital will differ across birth orders as long as
∂ 2 u(h, i)/∂h∂i 6= 0 or ∂p(i)/∂i 6= 0; see Proposition 1(iii) below. We assume that u ∈ C 2 and
satisfies Inada conditions, particularly limh→0 ∂u(h, i)/∂h = ∞ for all (h, i). We assume stronger
concavity conditions than usual to ensure that the problem is globally concave.5 Parental pref-
erences are gender-neutral and there is no mortality.
    Parents maximize their utility (1) subject to the budget set (2). Therefore, optimal decisions
are represented by a family size N ∗ ∈ [0, N + ], where N + is a biological upper bound of fertility,
and by a bounded human capital profile h∗ ∈ C 1 . Optimal family size satisfies


                                        u(h∗ (N ∗ ), N ∗ ) = λp(N ∗ )h∗ (N ∗ ),                                       (3)


and human capital satisfies
                                                ∂u(h∗ (i), i)
                                                              = λp(i),                                                (4)
                                                  ∂h(i)

for all i ∈ [0, N ∗ ], where λ is the Lagrange multiplier associated with (2).
    The first-order conditions are fairly intuitive. Expression (3) says that an additional child
adds the term u(h∗ (N ∗ ), N ∗ ) to the sum of utilities of the other children. Increasing N , however,
requires additional spending; parents must invest h∗ (N ∗ ) at a cost p(N ∗ ). Expression (4) says
that the utility gains from human capital investments at birth order i must, at the margin, equal
their cost. Combining (3) and (4) yields

                                     1 u(h∗ (N ∗ ), N ∗ )    1 ∂u(h∗ (i), i)
                                                          =                  ,                                        (5)
                                   p(N ∗ ) h∗ (N ∗ )        p(i) ∂h(i)

for all i ∈ [0, N ∗ ]. The left-hand side of (5) is the per dollar average utility of the “last” child
and the right-hand-side is the (constant) per dollar marginal utility of the other children. Thus
expression (5) simply says that the average gains from the “last” child must compensate the
marginal losses associated with a reduction in the human capital of inframarginal children.
     4
       The literature on the intrahousehold allocation of resources usually relies on an earnings production function
f (h(i), e(i), i), where e(i) is a child endowment; see, e.g., Behrman et al. [10]. If parental utility is written as
u(h(i), i) ≡ u(f (h(i), e(i), i), i), the index i can be seen as the result of the differences just listed. Our results do
not rely on a separate identification of the contribution of endowments, intellectual ability, and pure preferences.
     5
       The maximization of (1) subject to (2) is an isoperimetric problem; see Hestenes [20]. We assume
∂ 2 u(h, i)/∂h2 < 0 for all (h, i). To ensure that the optimal choices of N are interior, we assume ∂u(h, i)/∂i −
h(∂u(h, i)/∂h)(∂p(i)/∂i)/p(i) < 0 for all (h, i). This second order condition is standard in variational problems
with optimal endpoints; see Vincent and Brusch ([35], Theorem 3.1).


                                                            5
    To characterize the human capital profiles, we can write (4) as a differential equation

                                          ∂h∗ (i)
                                                  = ∆(h∗ (i), i),                                      (6)
                                            ∂i

for all i ∈ [0, N ∗ ], where

                                                                        ∂ 2 u(h, i)/∂h∂i
                                                               
                                 ∂u(h, i)/∂h         ∂p(i)/∂i
                       ∆(h, i) ≡ 2                                  −                    .             (7)
                                ∂ u(h, i)/∂h2          p(i)             ∂ 2 u(h, i)/∂h2

    Parental choices involve two decisions. First, the optimal family size N ∗ , which is determined
by (3), and, second, the optimal human capital associated with birth order i, which follows from
expression (6) and terminal condition {h∗ (N ∗ ), N ∗ }. In this context, ∆(h, i) defines the shape
of the human capital profiles for any family size, including the optimal choice N ∗ .

Proposition 1 (i) If ∆(h, i) < (>)0, for all (h, i), then human capital is a decreasing (increas-
ing) function of birth order. (ii) If ∆(h, i) = δ, then the human capital profile is linear with
slope δ. (iii) If ∆(h, i) = 0, then human capital is allocated equally among all children, e.g., the
human capital profile is “flat.”

    Proof. The proof follows from (6). Equivalently, consider the integral equation: h∗ (i) =
           R N∗
h∗ (N ∗ ) − i ∆(h∗ (x), x)dx. (i) follows from the differentiation under the integral sign. In (ii),
h∗ (i) = [h∗ (N ∗ ) − δN ∗ ] + δi. Finally, (iii) implies that h∗ (i) = h∗ (N ∗ ), which is constant across
birth orders.

    Case (i) in proposition 1 shows that the model yields human capital profiles of any general
shape depending on the preference and cost differentials. In case (ii), changes in family size only
alter the intercept of the human capital profile. However, as the proof makes clear, the change in
the intercept is not independent of the slope parameter δ. As discussed below, this point plays a
central role in the empirical implementation of the model. Case (iii) on the other hand, assumes
that parents treat all of their children equally, e.g., ∆(h, i) = ∂ 2 u(h, i)/∂h∂i = ∂p(i)/∂i = 0.
This special case is the Becker and Lewis [6] formulation.
    Proposition 1 however, does not describe the effects of exogenous changes in family size
on children’s human capital, an idea motivating the entire empirical literature analyzing the
“quality-quantity trade-off”. But identifying exogenous changes in family size is not an easy
task, since the optimal family size N ∗ is endogenous. This explains why in this literature twin

                                                     6
births are commonly used as exogenous sources of variation (instruments) for N ∗ (Rosenzweig
and Wolpin [30]). The conceptual experiment behind this logic is as follows. Parents plans
for their children’s human capital satisfy (6), and parents plans for family size satisfy (3) but
only for families without twins. Let {h∗ (i|N ∗ ) : i ∈ [0, N ∗ ]} be the optimal human capital of
child with birth order i in a family of size N ∗ . But choosing family size involves the possibility
of multiple births. Suppose that twinning is unanticipated and undiversifiable, and denote by
Z ∈ {0, z} the occurrence of a twin birth. Therefore, if there are twins, family size becomes
N ∗ + z with z > 0 representing the “additional exogenous children.” Proposition 2 characterizes
how human capital changes for existing children changes with an exogenous increase in family
size.

Proposition 2 The human capital profile of families of size N ∗ dominates (i.e., it lies above)
the human capital profile of families of size N ∗ + z with z > 0. That is, h∗ (i|N ∗ ) > h∗ (i|N ∗ + z),
for all i ∈ [0, N ∗ ].

       Proof. Human capital profiles are solutions to (6). Because of the existence and uniqueness
theorem for differential equations, one and only one integral curve passes through each terminal
point (Hestenes ([20], Appendix, Theorem 3.1).6 Accordingly, any two human capital profiles
with different end values should not cross (Hestenes ([20], Appendix, Theorem 4.1). Next,
assume to the contrary that h∗ (i|N ∗ ) ≤ h∗ (i|N ∗ + z) for all i ∈ [0, N ∗ ]. Both plans exhaust
spending. Then,

                  Z     N∗                                            Z   N ∗ +z
                             p(i)[h∗ (i|N ∗ ) − h∗ (i|N ∗ + z)]di =                p(i)h∗ (i|N ∗ + z)di.      (8)
                    0                                                 N∗


Since spending in the additional children is positive (e.g., the right-hand side of (8)), h∗ (i|N ∗ ) ≤
h∗ (i|N ∗ + z) for i ∈ [0, N ∗ ] is a contradiction.

       This result is a direct consequence of the decline in available resources per child due to the
increase in family size. In Proposition 2, total spending Y is constant, but the results would be
maintained if the presence of additional children lowers parental spending.7
   6
     These arguments are similar in spirit to Brock’s [13] analysis of changes in the planning horizon in the
neoclassical growth model. An alternative proof based on standard comparative statics is given in the Appendix,
as an intermediate step of the proof of Proposition 3. Our results might be proved by monotone comparative
statics methods which have generalized Brock’s [13] results; see, e.g., Amir [2] and Milgrom and Shannon [24].
These methods may be useful to obtain more general results than those presented here.
   7
     The problematic case is when Y increases “too much” so that the budget constraint (2) is relaxed. Let Y 0 (z)

                Figure 1: Human capital profiles under negative birth order effects.


    Figure 1 represents graphically Proposition 2 in the case of negative birth order effects; the
case of positive birth order effects is represented in Figure 2. Both figures indicate that children’s
human capital profiles in larger families should be below the human capital profiles of smaller
families, regardless of the direction of the parental birth order predisposition.
    In Proposition 2, twins “shift” family size but leave the shape of the human capital profile
unaffected. This means that parental predispositions toward birth order do not change with
twinning. That is, the preference and cost differentials subsumed in ∆(h, i) should be inde-
pendent of the presence of twins: the additional children z should influence ∆(h∗ (i|N ∗ ), i) only
through h∗ (i|N ∗ +z). This exclusion restriction allows us to find a solution for (6) while treating
N ∗ and N ∗ + z as different terminal points. In our empirical analysis below, we will focus on
twins at the last birth because the occurrence of twins at that stage best matches the theoretical
description just presented.
    Proposition 2 compares individual-level human capital for the same birth orders in families
of size N ∗ and families of size N ∗ + z, but it is silent about the human capital investments of
the additional children, i.e., children of birth orders i ∈ (N ∗ , N ∗ + z], and consequently, about
the effect of the exogenous change on household’s average human capital. Let H(N ∗ ) denote
denote parental spending for parents with additional children. If the extra resources, Y 0 (z) − Y , are larger than
the extra cost in (8), parents with additional children will be able to invest more than (or at least as much as)
parents without additional children.

   Proposition 3 is our general version of the “quantity-quality trade-off” in the presence of
birth order effects.

Proposition 3 Consider the following conditions:

 (a) ∆(h, i) ≤ 0, for all (h, i),

 (b) ∆(h, i) > 0 and ∂ 2 u(h, i)/∂h∂i ≥ −∂ 2 u(h, i)/∂h2 , for all (h, i).

   If either (a) or (b) hold, then average human capital of families of size N ∗ is larger than
average human capital of families of size N ∗ + z. That is, H(N ∗ ) > H(N ∗ + z).

   Proof. See Appendix
   To get a better intuition for this result, and conditions (a) and (b), it is useful to notice that
an exogenous increase in family size affects average human capital through two different channels:
an income channel and a substitution channel. As in Proposition 2, the income channel arises
because the available resources per child decrease as family size increases. The substitution
channel arises because the unit cost of human capital, p(i), may be lower for the additional

                                                                                            9
children (i.e., i ∈ (N ∗ , N ∗ + z]) than for the existing children (i.e., i ∈ [0, N ∗ ]). Indeed, the unit
cost of human capital for the additional children may be so low that average human capital may
increase as family size increases.
   Condition (a) guarantees that the substitution channel works in the same direction as the
income channel. Thus, as family size increases, the average cost per unit of human capital
also increases. In this case, substituting toward the additional children tightens the budget
constraint. With that in mind, the intuition behind this condition is simple: the additional
children lower average human capital because they contribute negatively to the family’s average;
see Figure 1. Condition (b) on the other hand, guarantees that the substitution channel is weaker
than the income channel. The inequality ∂ 2 u(h, i)/∂h∂i ≥ −∂ 2 u(h, i)/∂h2 ensures that reducing
the human capital of the existing children generates marginal utility losses that are sufficiently
strong to limit parents’ substitution toward the additional children.
   A particular case of our “quantity-quality trade-off” formulation does not require either
condition (a) or condition (b) to hold. It relies, however, on a special assumption.

Proposition 4 Suppose that p(i) = p for all i. Then average human capital decreases nonlin-
early with family size.

   Proof. The result is a trivial consequence of expression (2). If p(i) = p, then the budget
constraint can be written simply as
                                               pN H ≤ Y ,                                             (10)

which implies that H(N ∗ ) = Y /pN ∗ > Y /p(N ∗ + z) = H(N ∗ + z).

   Proposition 4 assumes that all children face the same human capital cost. This assumption
eliminates the substitution channel and forces N and H to enter multiplicatively in the budget set
(10). This result is central in Becker and Lewis [6]’s formulation of the “quantity-quality trade-
off and illustrates why the conventional framework cannot be used to study birth order effects,
because, by assumption, all children are treated equally. Under equal treatment, individual and
average human capital exactly coincide: h∗ (i) = H(N ∗ ) for all i. Propositions 3 and 4, do not
assume that children are treated equally. Importantly, we shall see in the next section that
Proposition 4 describes the empirically relevant model formulation.
   On the contrary, the “quantity-quality trade-off” in Propositions 3 and 4 is more general


                                                    10
than Becker and Lewis [6] formulation. It allows for a general analysis of the study of birth
order effects.
    In closing, we note that, throughout this section, we have used a utility function u(h(i), i)
and a linear aggregator across children’s utilities. The Appendix presents the more general
aggregators used by Behrman et al. [10] and Barro and Becker [4]. We have also abstracted from
many considerations relevant to the allocation of resources within a household. For example, by
treating parental spending as given, we have abstracted from the resource allocation between
parents and children. We also consider parental consumption in the Appendix. The Appendix
demonstrates the robustness of the basic theoretical predictions to these generalizations.


3    Empirical implications of the theory

To facilitate the exposition of the econometric model, the remainder of the paper treats birth
order i as a discrete variable. We index birth order specific objects by subscript i, and family
specific objects by the subscript j. For example, h∗ij is the (optimal) human capital of a child
with birth order i in family j.
    To understand the empirical implications of the theory, assume that the utility function (1)
takes the single index form


                                  uj (hij , i) = uj (hij − δi − vj − εij ),                       (11)


where δi and vj represent birth order and family specific preferences, respectively, and εij repre-
sents a family and birth order specific idiosyncratic preference shock; that is, E[εij |i, j] = 0 for
all i and j. The terms δi and vj in (11) are related to the “birth order effect” and the “family
size effect” whose full content is specified below.
    Recall that parental choices of Nj∗ and h∗ij satisfy (3) and (4), respectively. Let µij be
the inverse function of (4), i.e., µij ≡ {∂uj /∂hij }−1 (λj pij ). Thus, µij is an implicit function of
parental spending Yj , family size Nj∗ (via the Lagrange multiplier λj ), family-specific preferences
(via the utility function uj ), and birth order i (via the human capital cost pij ). The following
regression equation may now be obtained from expressions (4) and (11):


                                       h∗ij = δi + µij + vj + εij ,                               (12)


                                                     11
for i = 1, ..., Nj∗ .
    In order to endow (12) with empirical content, we need to impose further restriction on µij .
Particularly, if pij = pj , then µij does not vary by birth order i and, with a slight abuse of
notation, can be subsumed into the family fixed effect vj . This is why we noted above that
Proposition 4 represents the empirically relevant formulation of our theory. The family fixed
effect now represents family specific preferences, expenditures, and prices, and the human capital
equation now reads
                                         h∗ij = δi + vj + εij .                                 (13)

    Family size Nj∗ is not explicit in (13), although it is part of the family fixed effect vj .
Averaging expression (13) at the family level yields


                                       vj = H(Nj∗ ) − δ̄(Nj∗ ),                                 (14)


where H(Nj∗ ) is family j’s average human capital and δ̄(Nj∗ ) is the average birth order effect,

                                                     1 XNj∗
                                       δ̄(Nj∗ ) =           δi .                                (15)
                                                    Nj∗ i=1


    The theory suggests a nonlinear relationship between Hj and Nj∗ (see Proposition 4). There-
fore, we adopt the following semi-nonparametric relationship in the empirical analysis:


                                     H(Nj∗ ) = α + η(Nj∗ ) + ξj ,                               (16)


where η(Nj∗ ) is an unrestricted function of Nj∗ , ξj is a function of parental spending and prefer-
ences. Nj∗ is endogenous in relation to ξj . Substituting (14)-(16) into (13) yields


                             h∗ij = α + δi + η(Nj∗ ) − δ̄(Nj∗ ) + ξj + εij ,                    (17)


for i = 1, ..., Nj∗ . We refer to ∂η(Nj∗ )/∂Nj∗ as the family size effect on the grounds that average
human capital is also the human capital of the “typical” child in a family of size Nj∗ . That is,
H(Nj∗ ) is the human capital of a child for which δi = δ̄(Nj∗ ); see (16) and (17).
    Expression (17) shows that an exogenous change in family size, from Nj∗ to Nj∗ + z, has two
distinct effects on an individual’s human capital. The first is the family size effect, H(Nj∗ +


                                                    12
z) − H(Nj∗ ) = η(Nj∗ + z) − η(Nj∗ ). As we remarked after Proposition 3, this effect is associated
with our general “quantity-quality trade-off” and holds independently of birth order effects. The
second is the average birth order effect, δ̄(Nj∗ + z) − δ̄(Nj∗ ). This effect arises due to the parent’s
predisposition toward certain birth orders. In effect, as we stress throughout the analysis, one
cannot manipulate family size without manipulating the birth order configuration within the
family.
    Expression (17) imposes no special restrictions on the shape of the human capital profiles.
A special case is that of linear functions: δi = δi and η(Nj∗ ) = βNj∗ . In this case, the birth
order and family size effects are each represented by a single parameter: δ and β, respectively.
The average birth order effect is δ̄(Nj∗ ) = δ(Nj∗ + 1)/2, which is linear in Nj∗ with slope δ/2.8
Another special and testable case is Becker and Lewis [6] formulation: δi = 0 for all i. In this
case, δ̄(Nj∗ ) = 0 and only the family size effect is relevant.
    In proceeding it is useful to restate (17) in vector notation (no additional restriction imposed).
Define ιA to be a vector whose A-th entry equals 1 and all other entries equal 0. The dimension
of ιA is N + . Similarly, let δ ≡ (δ1 , ..., δN + ), β ≡ (β1 , ..., βN + ), and δ̄ ≡ (δ̄1 , ..., δ̄N + ). Our main
outcome equation (17) can now be written as:


                                   h∗ij = α + ι0i δ + ι0Nj∗ (β − δ̄) + ξj + εij ,                                (18)


for all i = 1, ..., Nj∗ . The parameters of interest are contained in the vectors δ and β, the effects
of birth order and family size on human capital accumulation, respectively. Consequently, our
empirical work is based on the following regression model:


                                          h∗ij = a + ι0i d + ι0Nj∗ b + ij ,                                     (19)


where d = (d1 , ..., dN + ) and b = (b1 , ..., bN + ) are vectors of parameters, and ij is an error term.
Notice that ij contains the family fixed effect ξj .9 Since d = δ and b = β − δ̄, (19) is simply a
   8
     This case further illustrates that summations can be replaced by integrals without loss of generality. For
example, the continuous analog of (15) is
                                                                 Z   Nj∗
                                                            1
                                              δ̄(Nj∗ ) =                   δ(i)di.
                                                           Nj∗   0

When δ(i) = δi, δ̄(Nj∗ ) = δNj∗ /2, which is also linear with slope δ/2.

     Throughout, we suppose that information on individual human capital h∗ij , birth order i, family size Nj∗ , and
family identifiers is available. Fertility is completed for all families, and families have at least two children. That

3.1    Existing empirical strategies

The overriding issue in an empirical analysis of education, birth order and family size is a dual
endogeneity problem. Family size is chosen in response to parental preferences and spending, and
the cost of human capital, all of which are part of the composite family fixed effect. A family’s
birth order configuration depends deterministically on family size, and thus also correlates with
the family fixed effect. It is thus clear that the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) estimator does
not admit consistent estimation of the parameters of interest β and δ.
    Black et al. [12] proposed an empirical strategy for dealing with the dual endogeneity
problem. Stated in the notation of our model, their outcome equation allows for a linear effect
of family size and nonlinear effects of birth order. That is,


                                          h∗ij = a + ι0i d + bNj∗ + ij ,                                      (20)


and their parameter of interest is b, i.e. the regression coefficient on family size Nj∗ on individual
human capital formation h∗ij controlling for birth order i. Birth order effects are nuisance
parameters in this setup.10 Black et al. [12] do not discuss the theoretical foundations motivating
this outcome equation
    From (18) it is clear that a regression equation involving nonlinear birth order effects ι0i d and
a linear family size effect bNj∗ , as does (20), might not be appropriate. The reason is that the
regression coefficient on family size picks up variation in human capital induced by difference in
the average birth order effect across families. If birth order effects are nonlinear, average birth
order effect varies nonlinearly across families as well. Mogstad and Wiswall [26] also argue,
although from an empirical point of view, that a regression equation like (20), where family size
enters linearly, is unnecessarily restrictive. They devise a non-parametric Instrumental Variables
(IV) strategy for the case where family size enters nonlinearly, i.e. takes the form ι0N ∗ b. This
                                                                                                        j

extension allows an outcome equation of a form that is consistent with our theoretical model
(see (19)). In the following, we consider the Mogstad and Wiswall [26] extension of the Black
is, we cannot estimate b1 and thus we normalize the first entry in b to zero. To avoid collinearity problems, we
further normalize the first entry in d and the second entry in b to zero. It is straightforward to include exogenous
regressors; we do so in the empirical analysis.
   10
      Black et al. [12] subsequently estimate birth order effects using the within-family estimator.

et al. [12] estimation procedure.
   Using (19), consider the first k − 1 children in families with k or more children (k ≥ 2). The
birth order configuration within each of these families is identical and, therefore, independent
of the family fixed effect. In terms of (19), ij ⊥ ι0i |(i ≤ k − 1, Nj∗ ≥ k). Family size indicators
of course remain endogenous regressors. Mogstad and Wiswall [26] show how one can exploit
exogenous variation in family size induced by twin births to develop a nonparametric IV esti-
mator for b in (19). The procedure can be implemented for different value of k ≥ 2. For our
purposes it suffices to consider the case k = 2. Denote the resulting estimator by b
                                                                                   b IV .

   If the instrumental variable is valid (in the usual sense), it is evident that b
                                                                                  b IV , interpreted

within the context of our model, has the following probability limit:


                                            b IV = b = β − δ̄.
                                       plim b                                                    (21)


Hence, b
       b IV consistently estimates the causal effect of family size on mean individual human

capital conditional on birth order i. Indeed, it is straightforward to show that bN = E[h∗ij |i, N ] −
E[h∗ij |i, N = 2] for N ≥ 3 (recall the data is such that N > 2 and we normalize b2 = β2 − δ̄2 = 0,
cf. footnote 9). Notice that our theory of fertility implies that b < 0 (element-by-element, see
Proposition 2).
   However, the causal effect of family size on mean individual human capital conditional on
birth order i confounds two separate effects. Indeed, bN = {E[Hj |N ] − E[Hj |N = 2]} + {E[h∗ij −
Hj |i, N ] − E[h∗ij − Hj |i, N ]} = βN − δ̄N . The first effect, βN , reflects the difference in human
capital between a child of average birth order in a family of size N and a child of average birth
order in a family of size N = 2. This is our generalized family size effect (see Proposition 3).
The second effect, −δ̄N , reflects the change in the average birth order effect between families of
size N and families of size N = 2. The two effects are confounded here because, as discussed
in the context of our model, one cannot manipulate family size without manipulating the birth
order configuration. Disentangling the two effects is important. Indeed, testing Proposition 3
requires a estimator of β, and, as we show further below, understanding whether dispersion in
human capital acquisition arises within or between families, also requires one to separate β and
δ. This illustrates the contribution and advantages of our approach over the previous literature.

3.2     A theory-driven empirical strategy

We now present a simple theory-driven empirical strategy that solves the dual endogeneity
problem associated with birth order and family size. This strategy delivers consistent estimates
of the full vectors of birth order effects δ and family size effects β, even when parents have
predispositions towards certain birth orders. It draws its motivation from the decomposition of
the variance of individual human capital. In particular, using expression (18), the variance of
individual human capital can be written as


                               V ar[h∗ij ] = E{V ar[ι0i δ + εij |j]} + V ar[ι0Nj∗ β + ξj ].                           (22)


from where we conclude that the within-family variation in human capital, E{V ar[ι0i δ + εij |j]},
is only a function of δ (and not of β), whereas the between-family variation, V ar[ι0N ∗ β + ξj ],
                                                                                                                  j

is only a function of β (and not of δ). Hence, we can identify birth order effects from within-
family variation and family size effects from between-family variation in human capital.11 We
next apply this simple logic to overcome the dual endogeneity problem of birth order and family
size.
    In the empirical analysis we augment (19) with individual level controls xij (age and sex)
and family level controls wj (mother’s age and education and father’s age and education). We
treat the controls as strictly exogenous.


Estimating birth order effects.                 Let d
                                                    b Within denote the within-family OLS estimate of the

birth order effect in (19). The within-family estimator is equivalent to the family fixed effect
estimator of the birth order effects. Applying the within-family transformation to (19) produces
the following estimation equation:
                                 "                      #0        "                     #0
                                      1 XNj∗                           1 XNj∗
          h∗ij   −   H(Nj∗ )   = ιi − ∗      ιi              d + xij − ∗      xij             g + [ij − ξj ] ,       (23)
                                     Nj  i=1                          Nj  i=1


                                           PNj∗
where we have used that (1/Nj∗ )              i=1 ij   = ξj and g contains the parameters associated with
the vector of individual level controls. The within-family transformation sweeps out all family
   11
      The use of within and between sources of variation is loosely reminiscent of Hausman and Taylor [19]. In a
linear panel data model, Hausman and Taylor [19] propose an IV estimator that separately exploit these sources
of variation. They make use of “internal” instruments obtained from exogenous regressors. We do not have
regressors well suited for this purpose. Instead, we exploit conventional “external” instrumental variables.


                                                             16
level variables, including family size Nj∗ . Moreover, the error-term [ij − ξj ] has been purged
from the family fixed effect, thus solving the endogeneity problem in relation to the vector of
birth order effects. It is standard to show that


                                               plim d̂Within = δ.


In other words, the within-family OLS estimator d̂Within correctly identifies δ.12


Estimating family size effects.             Family size effects are estimated using between-family vari-
ation in average human capital, which is not contaminated by birth order effects. Averaging
(19) at the family level yields

                               "               #0                "                 #0
                            1 XNj∗                                 1 XNj∗
             H(Nj∗ ) = a +         ιi               d + ι0Nj∗ b +         xij           g + wj0 f + ξj ,       (24)
                           Nj∗ i=1                                Nj∗ i=1



where f contains the parameters associated with the vector of family level controls.
    Our goal is to estimate β, the causal effect of family size Nj∗ on the human capital of the “typ-
                                         h          PNj∗ i0                                  PNj∗
ical” child. To this effect, notice that (1/Nj∗ ) i=1    ιi d = ι0N ∗ d¯ where d¯ ≡ (1/Nj∗ ) i=1   di ,
                                                                              j

and that an estimate of g is available from (23). Now, rewrite (24) as

                                      "                 #0 !
                                     1 XNj∗
                          H(Nj∗ ) −         xij            ĝ   = a + ι0Nj∗ c + wj0 f + ξj ,                   (25)
                                    Nj∗ i=1



where c ≡ d¯ + b. The left hand side of (25) is family level average human capital net of the
effect of (strictly exogenous) individual level controls,13 and family size Nj∗ is endogenous in
relation to the family fixed effect ξj . We overcome this problem by employing an IV estimator.
Specifically, following the literature, we use twinning as a source of exogenous variation in family
size.14 Denote the resulting IV estimator of c by ĉBetween . Using (18) and (25), it is standard
  12
     Black et al. [12] uses the same strategy for estimating birth order effects.
  13
     Alternatively one could leave the individual level controls averaged at the family level on the right hand side
and re-estimate g in (25).
  14
     As we noted in our discussion following Proposition 2, we can think of a twin births as a random and an
unplanned event, uncorrelated with any time-variant or time-invariant family characteristics, but correlated with
family size. Using Chinese data, Rosenzweig and Zhang [31] show that twinning influences the education of non-
twin siblings because of a change in family size, but also because of a change in the allocation of resources within
the household. Specifically, they show that in rural areas in China parents shift resources from less endowed
children to their healthier siblings. This concern is mitigated in the context of a developed country such as
Norway (Black et al. [12] and Mogstad and Wiswall [26]) or Denmark (this paper).



                                                        17
to show that
                                                         plim ĉBetween = β.                                      (26)

In other words, the between-family IV estimator ĉBetween correctly identifies β.
     With respect to the specification of the model, our empirical analysis includes various speci-
fications of the family size profile ι0N ∗ β. In the simple case where the family size profile is linear,
i.e. ι0N ∗ β = βN ∗ , and thus characterized by a single parameter β, only a single instrumental
variable is required for identification. In this case we use the occurrence of a twin birth in the
last birth in a family as an instrumental variable for Nj∗ . The IV regression is just-identified
and is computed via a 2SLS procedure.
     In the general case of a nonlinear family size profile, (25) contains a vector of endogenous
variables ιN ∗ . We have excluded families with N = 1 and treat N = 2 as the reference case.
Hence, ιN ∗ contains N + − 2 endogenous variables, and identification thus requires (at least)
N + − 2 instrumental variables. Following Mogstad and Wiswall [26] let z̃jk take the value one if
family j experienced a twin-birth in the k-th birth and the value zero otherwise. z̃jk is defined
in such a way that z̃jk = 0 for Nj∗ ≤ k − 1 (i.e. z̃jk is zero when information on twin birth at
parity k is missing due to truncation at Nj∗ ). Hence, z̃jk is systematically related to the family
fixed effect ξj in the subpopulation with Nj∗ > 2. Formally, E[z̃jk ξj |wj ] 6= 0 for k > 2. Hence,
                                            + −1
the vector z̃j = (z̃j2 , z̃j3 , ..., z̃jN          )0 does not qualify as a vector of instrumental variables for ιN ∗ .
     Angrist et al. [3] and Mogstad and Wiswall [27] show how this problem of partially missing
information can be circumvented. Indeed, let

                                                                        
                                       zjk = z̃jk − E[z̃jk |wj , Nj∗ ≥ k] 1(Nj∗ ≥ k)                              (27)

                                                                                                              + −1
for k = 3, 4, ..., N + − 1, where 1(·) is the indicator function. Then zj = (zj2 , zj3 , ..., zjN                    )0 is
a vector of valid instrumental variables, i.e. E[zj ξj |wj ] = 0. We estimate E[z̃jk |wj , Nj ≥ k] in
(27) by regressing z̃jk onto all variables in wj as well as their interactions within the relevant
subsamples defined by Nj∗ ≥ k.
     The variance-covariance matrix of the two-step estimator is estimated by applying the block-
bootstrap, treating families as the blocks (Horowitz [21]).




                                                                  18
4     Data

Our analysis data is extracted from IDA (Integreret Database for Arbejdsmarkedsforskning), a
comprehensive Danish administrative panel dataset for the period 1980-2006 with annual ob-
servations on all individuals aged 15-70 and residing in Denmark with a social security number
(CPR number). IDA contains detailed individual-level information on socioeconomic charac-
teristics, including gender, education, and income. The data is constructed and collected for
administrative purposes and contains very few measurement errors. Moreover, the data is pop-
ulation wide with a long period of observation. We can link children and parents, and thus
identify siblings; we define siblings as children born to the same mother.
    The unit of observation is an individual, and all outcome measurements are conducted in
2006. We impose a series of selection criteria, similar to those of Black et al. [12] who use
Norwegian administrative data; these criteria are detailed in the Appendix.15 We supplement
IDA with information on the precise date of birth, which allows us to identify twinning (or
rather multiple births). Information on date of birth is obtained from Statistics Denmark; the
merging procedure is documented in the Appendix. We are left with all individuals in 2006 aged
25-41 whose mother was both alive and present in IDA at some point during 1980-2006, and
who satisfy standard selection criteria.


Descriptive statistics.          Table 1 presents some descriptive statistics for the full sample of
1,256,031 children in 581,159 families, excluding single child families. The average individual is
38.2 years old and has 12.9 years of education. 52 percent are males and their parents did not
complete high school. On average, an individual has 1.7 siblings.
    Table 2 presents the distribution of family size, including single child families. 50.2 percent of
families have two children and less than one-third of the families have more than two children.16
   15
      The most important aspects in our selection criteria are the following: First, we only retain children aged 25
or above in 2006 to ensure that our outcome measurements represent complete education. Second, we exclude
families with children born after 1991 (aged 0-14 in 2006). This ensures that our family size measure represents
completed fertility. Third, we exclude families in which at least one member (a child or one of the parents) has
missing education data, and families where the mother was below 17 or above 49 when giving birth. The set of
children in IDA consist of all individuals with a valid pointer to the mother’s unique identifier, whose mother was
alive, aged 15-70 and present in IDA at some point during 1980-2006. These restrictions reduce our sample size
from 2,453,843 individuals (distributed over 1,272,874 families) to 1,256,031 individuals (distributed over 581,159)
families. See Appendix for further details.
   16
      The distribution of children in our sample (Denmark) differs from that reported by Black et al. [12] (Norway).
The differences can be attributed to the lower fertility rate in Denmark and to the fact that Norwegian women
marry more and earlier than Danish women; see Tsuya [34].



                                                        19
The average number of children in the family is 2.4. Table 3 presents the average education by
family size and birth order. This table shows a clear negative association between an individual’s
education and family size, as well as between an individual’s education and her birth order.
Similar patterns are documented for the mother’s and father’s education.
         Our empirical strategy exploits the within- and between-family variation in education. As
a final set of descriptive statistics we note that total variation in educational attainment in our
sample is 7.975, with 35 percent being attributable to within-family variation and 65 percent
to between-family variation. These values imply that understanding differences in education
within the family is as important as understanding differences in education between families.


5         Results

OLS results. We start by estimating the impact of family size on a child’s education, as
specified in expression (19), by OLS. The first column of Table 4 reports results from a linear
specification of family size on child’s education, controlling for the age and sex of the child. As
expected, the family size coefficient is negative and implies that an additional child decreases
schooling by a little more than a quarter of a year. Because family-specific characteristics might
impact the choice of completed family size and educational choices, column 4 adds unrestricted
indicators for the mother’s and father’s education, and a 5-year interval set of indicator variables
for mother’s and father’s age. Adding demographic controls reduces the magnitude of the
relationship by about 30 percent but the coefficient remains statistically significant.
         In order to account for birth order effects, column 5 adds a linear control for birth order.
Similar to previous findings (i.e., Black et al. [12]), the coefficient on family size is considerably
reduced to −0.04, but remains significant. Allowing for a more flexible estimation by including
indicator variables for birth order in column 6 does not change the results markedly.17 The
impact of family size is −0.066, smaller but comparable to the coefficient (−0.013) reported in
Black et al. [12] using Norwegian data.
         Birth order effects, whether included linearly or nonlinearly, are negative, large and highly
significant. They suggest, for example, that a third child in the family has, on average, 0.61
fewer years of education (column 6 in Table 4). As we discussed earlier, the negative birth
    17
    Notice however, that, according to our model, a regression equation where educational attainment is a linear
function of family size but a nonlinear function of birth orders is likely to be misspecified.



                                                      20
order effects could simply reflect family-specific unobservable factors. In columns 7 and 8 of
Table 4, we report results from estimating birth order effects while controlling for family fixed
effects. The family indicators capture any time-invariant characteristics, including completed
family size. Once we control for family fixed effects, the linear birth order effect is reduced by
about a half to −0.178. Similar changes in magnitude occur when we estimate the regression
including nonlinear birth order effects. The birth order results are similar in magnitude to the
results reported by Black et al. [12].


IV results.    The coefficients on family size reported in Table 4 are still likely to be biased,
even when controlling for a rich set of demographic controls. We follow initially the instrumental
variable approach that Black et al. [12] implement. As shown in section 3.1, this approach does
not identify the family size effect, or the quantity-quality trade-off, as defined in Proposition 3,
but it serves as an illustrative benchmark for the main empirical analysis to come.
   We estimate the family size effect using three different samples: the first sample includes the
educational outcomes of first born children in families with two or more children, the second
sample includes the outcomes of the first two children in families with three or more children,
and the third sample includes the outcomes of the first three children in families with four
or more children. We instrument family size with twins at second birth in the first sample,
twins at third birth in the second sample, and twins at fourth birth in the third sample, all
while controlling for demographic characteristics of the parents and including linear birth order
effects. Examining the outcomes of children born before the k−th birth avoids the problem that
a twin birth changes the birth order of children born after the twin birth in addition to changing
the family size.
   Table 5 reports the results of this exercise. In all three samples, the first stage results show
that there is a strong and highly significant relationship between a twin birth and family size.
The OLS results, reported in column 1, show that there is a negative and statistically significant
relationship between family size and education. The coefficient on family size in the first sample
is −0.09 and increases to about −0.23 in families with four or more births. The instrumented
family size effects are reported in column 3, and they vary by sample. The coefficient on family
size, when estimated using a sample of first born children in families with two or more children,
is about −0.024 but is not statistically distinguishable from zero. Similarly, the coefficient on



                                                21
family size estimated using a sample of the first three children in families with four or more
children is positive, although insignificant. The coefficient on family size, when using a sample
of the first two children in families with three or more children, is negative, sizable (−0.095),
and significant at the 5 percent level. With the exception of this latter finding, the results are
consistent with Black et al.’s [12] finding of no effect of family size on children’s education.


Two-step estimation results.         We now present the estimates from our two-step strategy.
We showed in Section 3.1 that this strategy identifies both birth order effects and the family
size effect as it is defined in Proposition 3. Our two main specifications are reported in Tables
6 and 7. Table 6 contains results for the case of linear birth order effects and a linear family
size effect. Table 7 contains results for the case of nonlinear birth order effects and a nonlinear
effect of family size. We further present a specification with nonlinear birth order effects and a
linear family size effect in Table 8. As we have already mentioned, the latter setup is likely to
misspecified, but we include it because it is a common specification in the literature and thus
facilitate comparisons between our results and results reported in previous studies.
   Recall that the first step estimates birth order effects, while controlling for family fixed
effects. This is similar to the way birth order effects are estimated in Black et al. [12]. Column
7 of Table 4 reports this result when including a linear birth order term. For convenience, we
report again these results in column 1 of Table 6. Likewise, the nonlinear birth order effects
reported in column 8 of Table 4 are reproduced in column 1 of Table 7.
   Column 2 of Table 6 reports OLS results of estimating equation (24), controlling for the
average age and sex composition in the family. The results indicate that an increase of one child
in the family size reduces the average educational level in the family by about 0.24 years. This
coefficient is comparable to the −0.186 OLS coefficient we report in Table 4, column 2. Column
3 of Table 6 adds demographic controls; the coefficient is reduced to −0.163 but it remains highly
significant. This estimate is larger in magnitude compared to the OLS coefficient (−0.040) we
report in Table 4, column 5.
   The OLS estimates do not account for the endogeneity of family size. Our IV strategy uses
the incidence of twins at last birth to instrument for family size. Using twins at last birth
ensures that desired family size is, on average, the same for families with singletons and for
families with a twin birth. Moreover, using twin birth at last birth ensures that the family size



                                                22
changes without also changing the birth order of subsequent children.
       Column 4 of Table 6 reports the IV coefficient of family size without demographic controls.
We note that the Minimum eigenvalue statistic indicates that our instruments are strong. The
estimated coefficient, −0.102, is significant at the one percent level. In addition to linear controls
for birth order, column 5 of Table 6 controls for demographic characteristics. The estimated
coefficient, −0.115, is also significant at the 1 percent level. Overall, the household-level IV
estimates counter the individual-level IV estimates in Tables 4 and 5, as well as the previous
findings of Black et al. [12]. Table 6 imply that an additional child significantly reduces the
average number of years of schooling in the household by about one tenth of a year.
       We now move on to our main set of results. These allow for nonlinear birth order effects
and nonlinear family size effects and are reported in Table 7. Specifically, Table 7 includes
separate indicators for families with 3, 4, and 5 children while using families with 2 children as
the omitted category. In the first-stage we consider the case where birth order effects are also
included nonlinearly. Because the second stage includes three endogenous family size effects,
we follow the methodology proposed by Angrist et al. [3] and Mogstad and Wiswall [27] and
construct multiple instruments using twin births at each birth order.18
       The IV results are reported in columns 4 and 5 of Table 7. We note again that the Minimum
eigenvalue statistic indicates that our instruments are strong. We focus initially on the specifica-
tion with demographic controls (column 5). The effect of family size is negative and statistically
significant for all family sizes. The reference category is N = 2. Hence, the point estimates in
column 5 of Table 7 implies that an additional child in families of size two reduces average years
of schooling by 0.12 years, an additional child in families of size three reduces average years of
schooling by an additional 0.17 years, whereas an additional child in families of size four has
only limited effect, reducing average years of schooling by by less then 0.01 years. This indicates
that family size might impact educational attainment in a nonlinear way. Comparing column 4
and column 5 of Table 7, we note that without demographic controls the effect of family size for
families of size three is insignificant. Otherwise, the two columns yield similar results.
       Qualitatively, the results reported in Table 7 are in line with those obtained with linear
birth order and family size effects. Three clear results stand out. First, birth order effects in
  18
     We estimate the family size profile nonparametrically, although we restrict the estimated family size effects
to be constant for families with N ≥ 5. Given that the effect of N = 1 and N = 2 are normalized to zero, we need
three instrumental variables. See the description in section 3, or consult Angrist et al. [3], Mogstad and Wiswall
[27] and Mogstad and Wiswall [26], for details.


                                                       23
educational attainment are both economically and statistically significant. This result is in line
with the existing literature. Second, our theoretically consistent family size effect is economically
and statistically significant; that is, the data strongly suggests the presence of a quantity-quality
trade-off. This is at odds with previous results reported in the literature. We have already
discussed how this difference is due to previous studies confounding the quantity-quality trade-
off (our Proposition 3) with differences in average birth order across families. Third, the effect
of family size appears to be non-linear, although monotonic.
   Taking a brief look towards Table 8 where family size is restricted to have a linear effect on
educational attainment even if birth orders can have nonlinear effects, we see that the estimated
family size effects is not strongly affected by the inclusion of the nonlinear birth order effects in
the first step of the estimation strategy (compare to Table 6).
   Finally, we have experimented with various ways of cutting the data in terms of excluding
families with children born before 1960, 1963 and 1965 (i.e. deleting older cohorts from the anal-
ysis), or in terms of retaining only the 1962-1971 cohorts or the 1972-1981 cohorts. Our results
are broadly robust to these experiments although we lose a bit of precision in the parameter
estimates.


Empirical Content of Theoretical Predictions.              Up to this point we have used the theo-
retical model to guide our empirical analysis, but the model in fact imposes restrictions on the
data that allow us to test its empirical validity. This allow us to assert whether our empirical
findings are in fact consistent with our theoretical framework.
   Before turning to a formal test of the model’s predictions, consider whether the numbers we
have reported above a quantitatively meaningful and how they relate to those reported in the
previous literature. This is most easily done by considering the implications of our framework
under the assumption of linear family size and birth order effects. In this case, the (biased)
individual-level IV estimate of the family size effect is b̂IV = β̂ − δ̂/2; see (21) and the discussion
in Section 3. Table 5 column 3 shows that b̂IV = −0.024. Our two-step strategy consistently
estimates β and δ. These estimates, reported in columns 1 and 5 of Table 6, are β̂ = −0.115 and
δ̂ = −0.178. Thus we predict b̂IV = −0.115 − (−0.178/2) = −0.026, which is virtually identical
to the individual-level IV estimate and the corresponding results reported in Black et al. [12]
(on Norwegian data).



                                                  24
   Testing Propositions 2 and 3. Our theoretical framework provides a guide to separately
identify birth order and family size effects. The theory is actually richer in that it provides
a set of testable predictions formulated in Propositions 2 and 3. Proposition 2 states that the
human capital profile of small families is always above the human capital profile of large families.
Proposition 3 states that the average human capital of small families is larger than the average
human capital of large families.
   Within the context of our empirical model (18), Proposition 2 implies that


                                   ι0N (β − δ̄) − ι0N +z (β − δ̄) > 0,                         (28)


for N = 2, 3, ..., (N + − 1) and z = 1, 2, ..., (N + − N ). With N + = 5, Proposition 2 thus imposes
three restrictions on the parameter space.
   Proposition 3 on the other hand, stipulates that


                                         ι0N β − ι0N +z β > 0,                                 (29)


for N = 2, 3, ..., (N + − 1) and z = 1, 2, ..., (N + − N ), introducing an additional three (inde-
pendent) restrictions. Our empirical implementation does not impose these six restrictions.
Therefore, we can use our estimates of β and δ, and their variance-covariance matrix, to con-
struct a Wald-type test statistic that informs on the empirical validity of (28) and (29).
   The theoretical predictions can be thus characterized by a set of inequality constraints im-
plying that the null (where (28) and (29) holds) is a multivariate composite hypothesis. This
impacts the asymptotic distribution of the Wald test statistic. In particular, the limiting distri-
bution is a complicated mixture of χ2 -distributions, making the computation of critical values
cumbersome (see e.g. Gourieroux et al. [17]). We overcome this difficulty by applying a rela-
tively simple test procedure developed by Kodde and Palm [22].
   The intuition behind the test is as follows. Consider the estimated parameter vector (δ̂, β̂)
from the unrestricted model (i.e. the parameter estimates reported in Tables 6, 7 and 8). Let
S be the feasible parameter space under the null. The Kodde and Palm test statistic D is
the distance between (δ̂, β̂) and the “closest” parameter vector admissible under the null. If
(δ̂, β̂) ∈ S, then D = 0, and if (δ̂, β̂) ∈
                                          / S, then D > 0. Hence, the null is rejected for “large”
values of D. Kodde and Palm [22] derive an upper and lower bound, D and D for the critical


                                                   25
value of D for a test of a given size. The decision rule is “reject the null if D > D”, and “do not
reject the null if D < D”. If D ≤ D ≤ D, the exact critical value for D needs to be computed to
obtain a conclusive test. Kodde and Palm [22] tabulate upper and lower bound critical values.
   Tables 6, 7 and 8 report the results from our tests of Propositions 2 and 3. The propositions
are not rejected in any of our multiple specifications. These results provide formal empirical
support for our general theory for the analysis of the “quality-quantity trade off” in fertility
models.
   Within- and between-family variation in human capital. Our empirical strategy
exploits the within- and between-family variation in education. We noted in the section 4 that
35 percent of the variation originates within families and 65 percent between families. Using the
estimated structural parameters of the model (δ̂, β̂) and the estimated parameters associated
with the exogenous controls (fˆ, ĝ) we provide a variance decomposition of the distribution of
years of schooling, breaking down the within- and between component. The full decomposition
is given as:


          V ar[h∗ij ] = E{V ar[ι0i δ̂ + x0ij ĝ + ε̂ij |j]} + V ar[E{ι0Nj∗ β̂ + x0ij ĝ + wj0 fˆ + ξˆj |j}],   (30)


where the first term on the right-hand side represents within-family variation and the second
term between-family variation.
   Table 9 reports the variance decomposition based on our preferred specification with nonlin-
ear birth order effects and nonlinear family size effects (parameter estimates reported in Table
7). The first row in Table 9 is the overall empirical within- and between variance decomposition
referred to in section 4. Total variation in years of schooling is 7.954 with the within- and
between family components accounting for 2.799 and 5.176.
   The second column in Table 9 breaks the within-family variation in years of schooling into
a birth order component ι0i δ̂, a component coming from age and gender heterogeneity x0ij fˆ, and
an “unexplained” component ε̂ij , as well as a term reflecting the covariance between birth order
and within-family age and gender structure. While birth order effects (and the coefficients on
age and gender) came out highly significant in our empirical analysis, we see that the lion’s
share of within-family variation in years of schooling, almost 98 percent, is “unexplained”, or in
the language of our model, due to idiosyncratic preference shocks. The within-family variance
of birth order effects accounts for 34 percent of the explained within-family variation, with the

                                                         26
remainder being accounted for by age and gender heterogeneity, including their covariance with
birth order effects.
         The third column in Table 9 breaks the between-family variation in years of schooling into
a family size component ι0N ∗ β̂, a component coming from between-family variation in age and
                                j

gender structures E{x0ij ĝ|j}, a component coming from heterogeneity in parent’s age and educa-
tion wj0 ĝ, a “family effect” component ξˆj , and the covariances amongst these components (some
of which are zero by construction).19 Due to the endogeneity of family size in relation to the
family effect ξˆj , it is difficult to interpret the between-family variance decomposition. However,
we note that the variance of the family effect accounts for 77 percent of between-family variation
in years of schooling. The second largest contribution comes from the variance in parent’s age
and education which accounts for 19 percent. In comparison, family size accounts for only 0.2
percent of between-family variation in years of schooling.


6         Conclusions

We study a model of fertility choice in which parents allocate resources differentially according to
the order of birth of a child, their birth order. The objective of the theory is to provide testable
predictions on the effect of family size on the children’s distribution of human capital within the
household. We then outline an empirical strategy that identifies the effect of family size on the
intra-household distribution of human capital separately from the effect that birth order may
have on a child’s education, and test these predictions using a population-wide comprehensive
administrative panel dataset from Denmark. Specifically, we implement a two-step empirical
strategy which estimates birth order effects controlling for family-fixed effects (first step), and
after netting out the estimated birth order effects from the child’s education, allows us to recover
the effect of an exogenous change in family size using an instrumental variable approach (second
step).
         Contrary to previous literature, our results suggest that both birth order and family size
affect years of education. Our results are robust to a variety of specifications. Our identification
strategy is based on our economic model. In this way, we demonstrate the importance of linking
the empirical strategy to economic theory.
    We assume that wj0 is strictly exogenous in relation to ξj . This restriction is imposed in the estimation at
    19

the family level. The decomposition of between-family variation in Table 9 relates to the family size weighted
distribution of family level components. The weighting induces covariance between wj0 and ξj .

Appendix A: Omitted proofs

Proof of Proposition 3. For convenience, we write ∂u(h∗ (i), i)/∂h simply as u∗h (i). Likewise,
we write the second derivatives evaluated at the optimum as u∗hi (i) and u∗hh (i).
   For any value of z, including z = 0, optimal choices for h(i) satisfy (4) with a Lagrange
multiplier λ(z). Differentiating this expression yields

                                          ∂h∗ (i|N ∗ + z)   ∂λ(z)        ∂λ(z) u∗h (i)
                               u∗hh (i)                   =       p(i) =               .                                       (1)
                                                 ∂z          ∂z           ∂z λ(z)

   Expressions (2) and (4) yield
                                                              N ∗ +z

Differentiating (2), and using (1), yields

                             ∂z     0            [−u∗hh (i)]

    Expression (3) shows that ∂λ(z)/∂z > 0, as long as the budget constraint binds (e.g.,
λ(z) > 0) and the parents value the human capital of the “additional children.” Substituting (3)
into (1), yields ∂h∗ (i|N ∗ + z)/∂z < 0 all i ∈ [0, N ∗ + z]; an alternative proof of Proposition 2.
    Next, differentiating H ∗ (N + z) in (9) yields
                                   "                               Z N ∗ +z                   #

   Using (3), a necessary condition for (4) to be negative is
         N ∗ +z
                                                                                                        u∗h (i)

If h∗ (i) is decreasing in i, then H(N ∗ + z) > h∗ (N ∗ + z) and (5) is satisfied trivially. This case
corresponds to condition (a). Consider next the case in which h∗ (i) is increasing in i. Using (4),
a sufficient condition for (5) to be satisfied is uh (h∗ (N ∗ + z), N ∗ + z) ≥ uh (h∗ (i), i). Subtracting
−uh (h∗ (N ∗ + z), i) on both sides, this condition can be written simply as

         [uh (h∗ (N ∗ + z), N ∗ + z) − uh (h∗ (N ∗ + z), i)] ≥ −[uh (h∗ (N ∗ + z), i) − uh (h∗ (i), i)],                       (6)

or as uhi (h, i) ≥ −uhh (h, i) for all (h, i), which is condition (b).



                                                                    1
Appendix B: General model [not for publication]
Here we consider a more general allocation problem and show that the predictions of the basic
model are robust to these extensions.
    Let C denote parental consumption. Assume parents value their consumption according to a
sub-utility function U 0 (C). As in Barro and Becker [4], consider a nonlinear aggregation over the
children’s sub-utilities. The upper limit of integration would then be given by a function α(N )
in (1). We also assume that there is a parental valuation for family size that is independent of
human capital. This utility component is v(N ). Further, as in Behrman et al. [10], we consider
a series of CES aggregator for the sub-utilities of parents and children.
    The general parental utility function is
                                                                                 1/ϕ

    Substitution takes place along multiple dimensions: −∞ < ρ ≤ 1 measures the degree of
substitutability between parental valuations across children at different birth orders, −∞ < η ≤
1 measures the degree of substitutability between parental investments in human capital and
family size, and −∞ < ϕ ≤ 1 measures the degree of substitutability between the parental
utility from consumption and the parental utility from investments in children. The function
u(h(i), i) can be interpreted as in the text.
    Parents maximize the utility function U (C, N, h) subject to the following budget constraint
                                                      Z    N

and α(N ) = N . Because there are multiple margins of substitution, the economic interpretation

of the first order conditions in the general model is much more involved than those in the
basic model. In (10), for example, it is necessary to recognize the substitution between parental
utility from their own consumption and the utility from their children, as well as the substitution
between family size and the overall value given to human capital investments.
    Let N ∗ denote the optimal family size and let h∗ (i) denote the human capital profile in the
general model. Despite the additional margins of substitution in the general model, the analysis
of this problem can be undertaken in essentially the same manner as in the basic model. First,
we characterize the human capital profiles treating N ∗ as a parameter, and then we examine
the response to exogenous changes in N ∗ . From, (10) we can write

                              ∂h∗ (i)   ˜ ∗ (i), i), for all i ∈ [0, N ∗ ],
                                      = ∆(h                                                   (12)
                                ∂i
with                          ∗                                ∗    ∗      ∗     ∗
               ˜ ∗ (i), i) ≡ uh (i) (pi (i)/p(i)) − [(ρ − 1)u (i)uh (i)ui (i) + uhi (i)] ,
               ∆(h
                                            (ρ − 1)u∗ (i)u∗h (i)2 + u∗hh (i)
such that when ρ = 1, we have ∆(h, ˜    i) = ∆(h, i) given in the basic model. Expression (12) also
represents a non-autonomous differential equation.
     It is possible to see that we can obtain a characterization analogous to Proposition 1. That,
is the human capital profiles in the general model can have any general shape. An exogenous
change in family size can also be studied as in the basic model. From a parental perspective,
such an increase is equivalent to a reduction in income. Notice that π(N ∗ + z) − πN ∗ represents
a lower bound of the additional expenses due to an increase in fertility from N ∗ to N ∗ + z.
If parental consumption is unchanged, an exogenous increase in family size must lower total
spending in children. If parents lower their consumption in response to an increase in fertility,
it is possible to see an increase in parental spending following an exogenous increase in family
size. For this case to take place, the income elasticity of parental consumption must be larger
than one. In other words, parental consumption C must be a luxury.
     Notice also that if p(i) = p for all i, then we can write the budget constraint (8) as qC +
πN + pN H ≤ I, which is the same budget constraint as in Becker and Lewis [6].

Appendix C: Detailed data description [not for publication]
This appendix documents the construction of the raw IDA data. For added readability, and to
keep this appendix self-contained, some of the information provided here is also included in the
main text. This appendix also contains a brief description of the mapping of Statistic Denmark’s
education codes into years of education.

IDA. Our empirical analysis utilizes the person files of IDA, a population-wide comprehensive
Danish administrative panel dataset. IDA is constructed and maintained by Statistics Denmark
and contains annual observations on all individuals (identified via a unique and time-invariant
person ID) aged 15-70 and residing in Denmark with a valid social security number. For co-
horts born in 1960 or later, we are able to link parents and children through a unique person
ID.20 Furthermore, IDA contains detailed individual-level information on an array of relevant
economic and socioeconomic characteristics. These include gender, educational attainment, and
information on the person ID of an individual’s cohabiting partner (if any) as well as a variable
measuring the number of children aged 0-14 in the household where the individual is residing.
Information on educational attainment comes in the form of information on highest completed
education. We transform this measure into years of education using the first two digits of an
eight-digit classification code of Danish educations.
    Years of education is the main outcome variable of this paper and we offer some details
on the construction of this variable here. The IDA person files contains information on each
individual’s highest completed education. This information is contained in an official 8-digit
classification code of Danish educations, denoted HFFSP.21 The first two digits of the HFFSP code
identifies the level of each education within the Danish educational system. Table A.1 present
the mapping of 2-digit HFFSP codes to education lengths, including a general description of each
of the education levels.
    At the onset, the population-wide annual IDA person files consists of 101,720,769 observa-
tions on 5,808,600 individuals (aged 15-70 at some point during 1980-2006). We supplement
IDA with data on the precise date of birth obtained from Statistics Denmark (usually the IDA
person files carries only information on the year of birth). Precise information on birth data is
essential for correctly identifying twin births.22
    The construction of the analysis sample goes over three steps. First, we identify potential
mothers and fathers from the population dataset and record relevant information. Second, we
identify children, whose outcomes in terms of education is the main object of interest in this
study, and merge information on parents onto the children dataset. Third, we impose a number
of selection criteria on the children dataset.
   20
      Up until 1978 it was common practice to delete information linking a person with his/her parents in the
family register when an individual turned 18. From 1978 onwards, the practice changed, and effectively, almost
all individuals born in 1960 or later have a pointer to their parents’ person ID, source: Statistics Denmark. The
data confirms that this is in fact the case, with almost every individual born in 1960 or later having valid pointers
to their mother’s person ID, whereas for individuals born prior to 1960, the fraction with valid information on
the ID of their mothers is much lower and declining in age.
   21
      Detailed documentation for this variable (in Danish) can be found on Statistic Denmark’s website.
   22
      The merging of the IDA person files and the date-of-birth data resulted in 69.40 percent of all individuals
in the IDA person files being assigned a precise date of birth. The unmatched individuals predominantly belong
to old cohorts, which is unproblematic for our analysis as it relies on identifying twin births among the younger
cohorts (whose parents are also present in the IDA data). We retain both matched and unmatched individuals in
the data as the unmatched observations (on older individuals) may contain information on parents.



                                                         4
    Mothers and fathers.– The set of potential mothers contains all women in the population
data. Likewise, the set of potential fathers is made up of all men in the population data. For
each potential mother we record the following information: age, years of education (measured
in the last year the mother appears in the population data), the number of children aged 0-14
in her household in 2006 (the year in which we measure outcomes), the mother’s number of
siblings (if available), and her income in each of the years she appears in the population data.
We also retain information on the person ID of cohabiting partners in each of the years the
mother appears in the population data.23 We record the same information for potential fathers,
except that we do not retain information on the number of children aged 0-14 in the father’s
household in 2006, and do not retain information on the father’s cohabiting partner.24
    Children.– The set of children contains all individuals in the population data that can be
merged with information on their mothers (i.e., it requires a non-missing pointer to the mother’s
person ID). In total 46,724,171 observations on 2,600,878 individuals distributed over 1,308,906
families are selected. We delete 8,783 families (i.e., sets of siblings born to the same mother)
where at least one of the children have invalid information on their precise date of birth. Likewise,
information on fathers is merged onto the panel of children. Notice, however, that we retain all
children independently of whether they are matched to their father.
    At this stage we compute family size defined as the number of siblings born to the same
mother. Using information on the precise date of birth we also identify twins as well as the
birth order of each child within their family. Formally, we use multiple births as an instrument,
but denote it twin births.25 Finally, we retain only the 2006 cross section of children (i.e.,
all outcome measurements are conducted in 2006). Parts of our analysis makes use of various
parental income measures and we trim the distribution of each of these measures by recoding
observations in the 1st and 99th percentiles as missing while retaining the observation in the
dataset. Before selection of the analysis data, the panel of children contains 2,453,843 individuals
and 1,272,874 families.26

Analysis data. A brief description of the selection criteria and the resulting analysis data
is included in Section 4. Starting from the set of children in IDA, defined as the 2,453,843
individuals (distributed over 1,272,874 families) who can be matched with a mother in IDA,27
we impose the following selection criteria to arrive at our analysis data:
    - We exclude 6,104 families where the mother was below 17 or above 49 when giving birth.28
    - We exclude 188,954 families in which at least one member (a child or one of the parents)
has missing education data.
  23
     This allow us to later condition the analysis on the father being the mother’s cohabiting partner.
  24
     We define families by the mother’s identity, and so, it is the composition of the mother’s household that is
the relevant conditioning variable.
  25
     At this stage of the sample selection process, the data contained 24,408 multiple births: 24,186 sets of twins,
217 sets of triplets, and 5 sets of quadruplets.
  26
     Our data is roughly consistent with official statistics related to cohort sizes and the frequency of twin births
available on Statistic Denmark’s website http://www.statistikbanken.dk/ (in Danish) .
  27
     In other words, the set of children in IDA consist of all individuals in IDA with a valid pointer to the mother’s
ID, who’s mother was alive, aged 15-70 and present in IDA at some point during 1980-2006. There are 2,453,843
such individuals.
  28
     The age variable used for sample selection indicates age X in the calendar year a person turns X. The youngest
possible mother in our sample would be a woman who turns 17 on Dec. 31st in year X and who gives birth on
January 1st year X (at age 16). The woman would thus have been above the age of consent at the time of

    - We exclude 199 families in which at least one pair of non-twin siblings are recorded as
being born less than seven months apart.
    - We exclude 87,633 families where the father is unknown for at least one of the siblings or
where siblings have different fathers.
    - We exclude 118,065 families with children born after 1991 (aged 0-14 in 2006).29 Below
we condition on children being 25 or above. IDs of parents are only sporadically available for
cohorts born before 1960.30 Hence, children born close to 1960 may have older siblings that are
not linked to their parents in IDA, inducing measurement errors in both family size and birth
order. Our results are robust to discarding families with children born before 1960, 1963 and
1965.
    - Only children aged 25 or above in 2006 are retained. We discard 308,893 individuals in
this step.
    - We exclude 3,904 observations on twins, only retaining an indicator for a twin birth in the
family and the order of the twin birth (we lose 2,559 families in this step).
    We are left with all individuals in 2006 aged 25-41 who’s parents were both alive and present
in IDA at some point during 1980-2006, and who satisfies the additional regularity conditions
listed above. The analysis data contains 1,256,031 individuals distributed over 581,159 families.
The unit of observation is an individual (in 2006). Note that some selection criteria are imposed
at the family level while others are imposed at the individual level. Family size and birth order
are recorded before the individual level selection criteria are imposed.

     Technically, since children are not included in IDA until the year they turn 15, we discard families where at
least one child age 0-14 resides on the mother’s address in 2006.

     Up until 1978 it was common practice in Denmark to delete information linking a person with his/her parents
when an individual turned 18. From 1978 onwards, the practice changed, and effectively, almost all individuals
born in 1960 or later have a pointer to their parents’ person ID (source: Statistics Denmark).

    The text provides a further description of the different education levels including the distinction between primary school education for individuals born 1958
    or earlier and individuals born 1959 or later. (a): Immigrants are overrepresented in this category as education obtained in their home country is seldom
    converted to Danish standards and recorded.
