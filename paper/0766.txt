               Exchange   Rate Determination and the Demand for Money


                                     ABSTRACT




     This paper examines the conventional monetary equation of exchange
rate determination.   Under certain exogeneity conditions, one can write

the price level, at home and abroad, as the ratio of the nominal money

supply to the demand for real money balances. Then, since the exchange

rate is the domestic price of foreign exchange, one can equate the exchange

rate to the ratio of domestic to foreign prices. This then allows one

to write, and estimate, the exchange rate as a function of the money supply

differential, income differential and interest rate differential. If

the domestic and foreign money demand errors are autocorrelated, and if

deviations from purchasing power parity are autocorrelated, tests based

on the above model may be invalid. Only if all autoregressive parameters

are equal will test results be valid. A full information maximum likelihood

procedure is used to estimate and test the assumptions necessary for the

conventional procedure to be correct. Finally, two alternative models of

exchange rate determination are considered to illustrate the importance

of introducing the error terms at the beginning of the analysis.

        Conventional models of the monetary approach to exchange rate deter—

mination assume a demand for money function for each country, with the same

parameters, and that purchasing power parity holds.' These two assumptions,

along with a semi—log functional form for money demand, allows one to write

the exchange rate as a function of the money supply differential, income dif-

ferential and interest rate differential, with an error term added at the end:

In this paper, •we examine under what conditions estimating equations (la) and

(lb) is appropriate and we provide an interpretation of the parameters y and

        In particular, we derive equations (la) and (lb) from a general model that

begins with specifying a conventional domestic and foreign money demand function

and allowing for deviations from purchasing power parity to be autoregressive.

I. Derivation of the Conventional Exchange Rate Equation.

        Let us begin by assuming conventional money demand functions for the home

and foreign country (denoted by an 1*T):

                     m
                             —
                                 Pt
                                      =   x   + u                                  (2a)


                     m — p = x + u*
                         *        *        **
                                                                                   (2b)

where
                                                              —2—



                               =
                       Ut           Put_i +
                        *               **            *
                       Ut =         P   ut_i +

                               =    (1 y i) = exogenous variables
                               =    log      of real income

                               =    interest         rate

                               =
                                    log      of the money supply

                       Pt =         log      of the price level

                               =
                                               S)
                   Ect tc a EE'

Next,    we impose a purchasing power parity (PPP) condition. We assume that the

deviations from PPP follow an AR(l) process2 (where s =                            log   of the exchange

rate):

                   -
                                        = G[s1—                            I   +                     (3a)


so   that we can write Pt —               p     as
                           =                                                                         (3b)
                                   s_(l_eL)P

From equation (2) we can solve for p—p to obtain

         tt = t—i                  + (l_PL)m —
                       **                      *

We next equate equations (3b) and (4) to obtain an expression for

We see, therefore, that for the general model (equations (2) and (3)),te

implied exchange rate equation (equation (5)) is quite complex. Equation (5)

         A special case of this model, often assumed by researchers, is when

the parameters of the money demand function in both countries are equal:

 can rewrite (5) as

            Under the usual assumption of                                    and p=p ,     the   appropriate estimation

 procedure forthe monetary approach to exchange rates is to estimate equations (7a)

  and (7b). In addition to assuming

                                          and p=p ,    is often assumed that devia-        it
 tions from PPP are random, that is, 0=0. In this case, the appropriate model

  is equation (7a) and an error process with an autocorrelation function given

  by (8b) (obtained by substituting 0=0 into Sa):                                                            -

 Alternatively, it is sometimes assumed that PPP holds as an identity, in which

 case the error process has an autocorrelation function given by (Sc):

There are several situations in which equation (9) will hold. Table I lists

the four assumptions on                                           in which (9) holds. The first is

when deviations from ?YP are random (0=0). Then, if we set y=p (where p is

the autoregressive parameter in the money demand function) and set                                equal to a
                                                                                   2               *
linear combination of the money demand errpr variances, a (where e =

and covariancwith Ppp, a, equation (9) will hold. The second case (which

is a special case of the first) is when pm' holds as an identity (0=0 and

      =   0).   Then, if we set y=p and a equal to a different linear combination

of variances and covariances, equation (9) will hold. The third case is when

the deviations from ppp are AR(l) (0#0). Then, if we set yp=0 (where 0 is

the autoregressive parameter in the Ppp equation), and a2 equal to a still

different linear combination of the underlying stochastic specification,

equation (9) will hold. A fourth case is when the money demand functions are

not autoregressive (p0). Then, if we set y=O and                               equal to the expression in

Table 1, equation (9) will hold. Therefore, if the deviations from PPP are not

random (see Frenkel (1981)) and we are willing to assume a priori that all auto-

regressive coefficients are equal (p=p*=9) and money demand parameters are
                  *
equal (=8 ), then             estimating the standard equation ((la) and (lc)) is appropriate.

However, to test these assumption one must consider a simultaneous estimation

procedure. Estimating equation (5) by nonlinear least squares, assuming w is
white noise, and testing S=B* and p=p* is incorrect, since           are
                                                           wt and
correlated.

equation system. The system consists of equations (2a), (2b) and (3a), rewritten

     Equation system (10) was estimated using quarterly data, from 1973—3 to

1979—4. Four currencies, relative to the dollar were used — the U.K. pound,

the German mark, the Swedish kronor and the Canadian dollar (see Data Appendix

for more details). The period was chosen due to a possible structural change

in the international monetary system in the first quarter of 1973, arising from

the collapse of the EEC agreement to stabilize the dollar value of their cur-

rencies. The system was estimated using the FIML procedure in Version 3.3 of

TSP. The results are summarized in Tables 2 to 5. Table 6 summarizes the

results of testing (l) through            and Table 7 presents an estimate of the

correlation natrix of the residuals.

     Several results can be seen in Tables 2 to 6. For the U.K., the income

elasticity of the demand for dollars was significantly negative for Model 1,

but significantly positive for Models 2 to 5.      In addition the domestic auto-

regressive parameter, p, was negative (equal to —.138) for Model 1, but positive

for Models 2 to 5. A problem arose in estimating the model with Germany. The

log likelihood value for the restricted Model 2 was greater than the log likelihood

value for the unrestricted Model 1. For Canada, the income elasticity of the

demand for U.S. dollars was negative. The autoregressive parameter in the PPP

equation, for Canada and Sweden, 0, was (insignificantly) greater than 1.0, which

indicates nonstationarity.5 (Consequently the test results should be viewed with

caution.)

     Table 7 presents estimates of the correlation matrix of residuals for Model

1, derived from    in equation (lOd). We notice that for Germany, Canada and

Sweden the correlation between domestic and foreign money demand residuals is quite

large —   .859, .708, .903, respectively. In general, the correlation between PPP
residuals and money demand residuals is small and negative.

the results look reasonable. Recall, the coefficient on (y_y*) is expected to

be negative and the coefficient on (i—i     ) is
                                            expected to be positive.

     As is evident from the previous sections, the final version (reduced fm:n)

of the exchange rate equation depends on certain assumptions about money demand

parameters and properties of error terms. In fact, the assumption that the

parameters of the domestic and foreign money demand is not made simply for

expository purposes —   it   is made so that one can obtain consistent estimates

of the model. In addition, the hypothesis is not always accepted.

III. Alternative Exchange Rate Models

     This paper has argued that it is essential to specify the error processes

at the initial stage of writing the money demand functions, and then deducing

the error process of the exchange rate equation. Two other models of exchange

rates can also be considered. In the first alternative model, Bilson (1978,

pp. 89—90) begins by assuming a partial adjustment model and autoregressive

errors for the money demand functions:

It is straightforward to verify that we can write the exchange rate equation

as


     (l_PL)s              _(l_p)(u_a*) + (1_pL)(mt_m*)

                                                         -
                          -

It is clear thatw is an MA(i)                           error     process. First, we notice that estimating

equation (13a) by OLS would yield inconsistent estimates due to the presence of

a lagged dependent variable and an MA(l) error term (w is correlated with

If we assumed that PPP held identically, so that                                      0, then the error term

in (13b) could be written as w =                                  —        In   this case, OLS estimation of

equation (13a) would yield consistent estimates. However, Bilson (1978)

estimates the following equation, by CORC:

                     =        (aa) + (mt_mt*)                           htt

CORC applied to equation (l4a) is inconsistent, since                will, in general,

be correlated with (m_m), if (nt_m*) is autoregressive. In addition, apply-

ing the CORe procedure to an equation with a lagged dependent variable may be

misleading since there nay be more than one estimate of p.6

         The results from estimating equation (13a), for Germany, by nonlinear

least squares, assuming                 0, yields

In this case, only p, the autoregressive parameter, is significant.

         Another alternative exchange rate model begins by assuming a partial

adjustment to the long run exchange rate s (see Frenkel (1978) ,             p.   181) .     In
this model we assume that the domestic and foreign money demand functions are

given by equations (ba) and (lob). To obtain the PPP equation, we assume

                s = a+
                       b(P_P:)                                                          (15a)

We see that the long run elasticity, b, is close to one, but imprecisely estimated.

The short run elasticity, b, is equal to .534. The income elasticity and interest

semi—elasticity are of the "right" sign, but imprecisely estimated.


IV. Summy

     In   this paper we have reexamined the estimation of monetary exchange rate

equations. Beginning with conventional money demand functions and assuming
                                     —21—


deviations from purchasing power parity are serially correlated (AR(l)), we

derived a reduced form exchange rate equation. Without further assumptions,

OLS (or nonlinear least squares) estimation is inconsistent. To derive the

conventional exchange rate equation, the most plausible set of assumptions

are that the parameters of domestic and foreign money demand functions are

the same. In this case estimation of the conventional equation will yield

consistent estimates, however the standard errors are incorrect. To obtain

correct standard errors from the conventional equation, one must assume, in

addition, that the autoregressive parameters in the money demand equations

and the PPP equation are equal. Only for Germany does this hypothesis appear

warranted, for the U.K., Sweden and Canada, the hypothesis is rejected.

     Next, we looked at two different models of exchange rates. In one model,

we assume partial adjustment in the money demand function. In the other model,

we assume partial adjustment in the PPP equation. Two different exchange rate

equations were then derived and estimated. However, the estimates in both

alternative models were imprecise.

5.   However, when the model was reestimated, using different initial values,
     p was less than 1.0. The results were approximately the same.

6.   Betancourt and Kelyian (1981) show that there may be several estimates of
     p when estimating a model with a lagged dependent variable and AR(1) error
     by CORC (due to multiple roots). However, Dufour and Gaudy (1981) point
     out that this will occur with probability zero. However, from a practical
     point of view, one must worry about multiple roots since they do appear in
     practice (Betancourt and Kelyian (1981), pp. 1076—77).

     The data was obtained from the December 1979 and April 1981 Jnternational

Financial Statistics (IFS) tapes. The variable and its IFS codes is given,

by country, in the following table.

where the IFS codes stand for:

    AE     = end of period exchange rate
     99B.P = real GDP, 1975 prices
     99A.R = real GNP, 1975 prices
     60C   = Treasury bill
     6QB   = call money rate
     61      government bond yield
    34     = money,
