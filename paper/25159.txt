How do banks respond to asset booms? This paper examines i) how U.S. banks responded to the
World War I farmland boom; ii) the impact of regulation; and iii) how bank closures exacerbated
the post-war bust. The boom encouraged new bank formation and balance sheet expansion
(especially by new banks). Deposit insurance amplified the impact of rising crop prices on bank
portfolios, while higher minimum capital requirements dampened the effects. Banks that
responded most aggressively to the asset boom had a higher probability of closing in the bust, and
counties with more bank closures experienced larger declines in land prices.

1. Introduction
        Asset price booms and busts are often intertwined with lending booms and busts.
Although possibly triggered by a fundamental shock, rising asset prices can stimulate lending
and increased leverage, which in turn causes asset prices to rise further, generating more lending,
and so on. Similarly, falling asset prices can force debt contraction and deleveraging that
reinforce the decline in asset prices. Large declines in asset prices can be disruptive, especially
when preceded by rapid credit growth or involve highly-leveraged assets such as real estate (e.g.,
Kindleberger 1978; Minsky 1986; Borio and Lowe 2002; Eichengreen and Mitchener 2004;
Reinhart and Rogoff 2009; Schularick and Taylor 2012).1 The interrelationship between asset
prices and lending booms thus raises important questions, including how various regulations and
policies might affect the vulnerability of the banking system to asset price shocks, and how bank
lending and instability can exacerbate asset price movements.
        Many studies have investigated these questions in the context of the U.S. house price
boom of the early-to-mid 2000s and financial crisis of 2008-09. For example, researchers have
highlighted the outsized role of the “shadow” banking system in supplying credit that fueled the
boom (e.g., Loutskina and Strahan 2009; Mian and Sufi 2009), while others focused on credit
demand (e.g., Glaeser et al. 2012; Dell’Ariccia et al. 2012). Still other studies have examined the
impact of the financial crisis and bank distress on economic activity during and after the crisis
(e.g., Campello et al. 2010; Ivashina and Scharfstein 2010; Chodorow-Reich 2014; Gertler and
Gilchrist 2018). However, the complexity of modern financial systems, which include banks
with international operations and off-balance sheet activities as well as shadow banks and other
forms of intermediation, can obscure fundamental relationships. Thus, detailed examinations of
episodes when such factors were not in play can be especially useful for identifying key
relationships between asset booms and the banking system, as well as the effects of different
policies that are hard to discern in more complex environments.
        This paper studies the interplay of bank lending and asset prices in the boom-bust cycle
affecting U.S. agricultural land prices during and after World War I. Unlike the recent U.S.
house price boom, where the underlying shock or set of shocks that triggered the boom has
proved difficult to identify conclusively, the farmland boom of the 1910s had a clearly

(1997), Geanakoplos (2010), and Nuňo and Thomas (2017).

identifiable trigger.2 The wartime collapse of European agriculture drove commodity prices
sharply higher and constituted an external demand shock that sparked the boom in U.S. farmland
prices. However, the boom was short-lived. European production bounced back quickly when
the war ended, driving down crop prices and land values in the United States, and initiating a
wave of farm foreclosures and bank failures in the early 1920s (Alston 1983; Alston, et al. 1994).
        The historical episode is particularly advantageous for studying the interrelationships
between lending and asset price booms and busts because bank lending at the time was decidedly
local. Federal law prohibited interstate branch banking, and most states either prohibited or
severely restricted branching within their borders. Moreover, with the automobile still in its
infancy and paved roads almost nonexistent in rural areas, it would have been impractical for
most farmers to obtain services from a bank located more than a few miles from their home.
Thus, the balance sheet information we observe for individual banks reflects their lending to
local farmers, and we can approximate local income shocks using detailed information about
crop production in a bank’s county.3 Specifically, we calculate a county-specific farm output
price shock by applying the annual nation-wide price changes of 11 major crops to the county
output shares of each crop before the war. This provides exogenous variation both across time
and within a state to identify the effects of the price shock.
        In two important studies of the episode, Rajan and Ramcharan (2015a, 2016) find that
counties with more banks experienced larger increases in farmland prices and mortgage debt
during the boom and suffered larger price declines and more bank failures during the bust.
Whereas Rajan and Ramcharan examine the effects of credit availability (as reflected in the
number of banks present in a county) and bank suspensions on county-level land prices, here we
use biennial balance sheet data for individual banks in 18 agricultural states for 1908-20 to
examine how the price shock affected i) the establishment of new banks, ii) bank portfolio
decisions, and iii) the determinants of bank closures when farm prices and incomes ultimately
collapsed. The bank-level data enable us to test whether state banking policies amplified or
dampened the impact of asset price shocks on the banking system, and to use an instrumental

  Studies attribute the U.S. housing boom to, among other things, loose monetary policy (Taylor 2010), a savings
“glut” and heightened demand for safe U.S. financial assets (Bernanke 2005), a bubble (Case and Shiller 2003), and
financial market innovations including securitization of subprime mortgages (Loutskina and Strahan 2009; Mian and
Sufi 2009).

  The county is a reasonable approximation of the area constituting a rural banking market at the time. Most
empirical studies define banking markets at the MSA or rural county level even in modern times.

variables approach to identify the impact of bank closures on county-level farmland values
during the early 1920s. Our study thus provides insights about the channels by which the asset
boom-bust affected the banking system and supply of credit, the role of government policies, and
how banking instability contributed to the collapse of asset prices when commodity prices began
to fall.
           Our results show that rising crop prices encouraged entry of new banks and balance sheet
expansion of new and previously established banks. While all banks expanded their assets and
loans, those established during the war were especially aggressive lenders. New banks accounted
for some one-third of the total increase in bank loans in our sample states between 1914 and
1920, and many increased their portfolio risk in response to rising crop prices. Similar to shadow
banks in modern times, state-chartered banks responded more strongly to the boom than did
more tightly regulated national banks. Moreover, we find that deposit insurance amplified the
effects of rising crop prices on bank loan volumes, whereas higher minimum capital
requirements deterred entry and dampened the effects of crop prices on loan growth and risk.
           When farm prices and incomes collapsed in the early 1920s, banks that had expanded
more during the boom had a higher probability of closing. Recently established banks were
especially likely to close, as were banks with insured deposits, higher leverage, or larger shares
of their portfolios devoted to loans. Further, banks located in counties with large increases in
land values during the boom were more likely to close when prices fell. Finally, we find that
bank closures exacerbated the collapse of farmland values during 1920-25. Thus, our research
provides new evidence of how banks can both be affected by and contribute to asset price booms
and busts, and how banking policies can influence the feedback loop around such events.
           The paper proceeds as follows: Section 2 provides historical background about the
agricultural boom-bust and the U.S. banking system at the time. Section 3 describes the data we
use to estimate the interrelationship between banks and asset prices. Sections 4 and 5 examine
the impact of the agricultural boom and bank regulation on the establishment of new banks and
the balance sheets of new and previously established banks. Section 6 examines the determinants
of bank closures during the bust. Section 7 estimates the contribution of bank closures to the
collapse of farmland values in the 1920s. Section 8 concludes.

2. Historical Background
         In agricultural regions, fluctuations in farm output prices and incomes importantly
influence the demand for funds and profit opportunities for local banks. The early 1900s were
generally good years for farmers. Prosperity brought more land under cultivation and rising farm
populations, as well as substantial growth in the number of commercial banks in farming
communities. Because most states prohibited or severely restricted branch banking, market entry
was almost solely in the form of new banks.4 Across the United States, the total number of banks
more than doubled from 13,053 in 1900 to 27,864 in 1914; the South and Great Plains regions
experienced increases of more than 200 percent (Board of Governors 1959, p. 33).
         World War I transformed good years for farmers and their banks into boom years as the
wartime demand for U.S. agricultural products caused prices to soar. Figure 1 shows that the
unweighted average of 11 crop prices rose by 160 percent between 1914 and 1919, but also that
the extent and timing of increases in the prices of individual crops varied. Whereas the prices of
cotton, flaxseed, Irish potatoes, and tobacco rose by more than 200 percent, those of oats, rye,
sweet potatoes, and buckwheat increased by less than 100 percent.5
         The wartime boom in farm output prices and incomes drove increases in land prices and
mortgage debt, and drew still more banks to farming communities. Farmland value per acre rose
by 51.4 percent on average between 1910 and 1920, with larger increases in the Midwest (60.6
percent), South (84.5 percent), and Great Plains (52.9 percent).6 As one might expect, land
values increased most in agricultural regions where the principal crops had the largest price gains
and where there was less available land to bring into production. Farmers often financed land and

4
  Banks with federal charters, i.e., national banks, were prohibited from opening branch offices, as were state-
chartered banks in most states, which hampered diversification and tied banks to the fortunes of their local
communities. Calomiris (2000) argues that northern farmers opposed branching to ensure that local banks would
continue to lend to them bad times as well as during prosperous periods, and in a 1924 referendum, voters in Illinois
soundly rejected branch banking (White 1984). In the handful of states that allowed branching, few banks operated
any branches outside their home office city. Among the agricultural states of the Great Plains, Midwest and South
that comprise our sample, banks operated only 112 branches outside of their home office city in 1910 and 174
branches in 1920 (Board of Governors 1943, Table 74, pg. 299). Furthermore, most of those branches were of banks
located in the largest cities of each state rather than banks located in farming communities. Thus, even where
permitted by law, branching was extremely limited and largely irrelevant for the agricultural banks and regions that
we study.
5
  By the early 20th century, commodity markets were highly integrated within the United States and U.S. markets
were well integrated with world commodity markets (see, e.g., Williamson 1996; Federico and Persson 2007; Sharp
and Weisdorf 2013). The sharp increases, and subsequent decreases, in world prices associated with the external
demand shock of World War I largely drove changes in U.S. crop prices and greatly overshadowed local variation in
prices (United States Department of Agriculture 1922).

  Throughout this section, the regional data are unweighted averages of state-level observations.

equipment purchases through banks and other lenders.7 Across all states, mortgage debt rose by
an average of 83 percent between 1910 and 1920. Southern states experienced the largest
increases (116 percent) while Northeastern states had the smallest increases (54 percent).
        More than 3,000 banks were chartered across the United States during or shortly after the
war, bringing the total to an all-time high of more than 31,000 banks, or about one bank for
every 3,500 persons, in 1921. Relative to population, banks were especially prevalent in the
Midwest and Great Plains, where states had as many as one bank for every 756 persons residing
in the state.8 Many banks opened in towns that previously had no bank. For example, among
states in the Midwest, Great Plains and South that make up our sample, 61 percent of new banks
were established in towns that had no bank in 1910, and 30 percent were in towns that had only
one bank. In total, bank loans rose by an average of nearly 100 percent across all states, though
states in the Great Plains and South experienced somewhat larger increases (119 percent and 112
percent, respectively) than those in the Northeast (71 percent).
        Most studies of the period conclude that farmers and their lenders expected crop prices to
remain high after the war and thereby justify higher land prices. For example, Horton, Larsen
and Wall (1942, p. 3) argue that “farm owners incurred debts and lenders made loans with the
expectation that present or future increases in income and land values would support the debt.”
However, contrary to those expectations, European production recovered quickly when the war
ended, and by 1921, crop prices were some 50 percent below their 1919 levels. The marked drop
in commodity prices in 1920-21 and resulting decline in farm incomes caused farmland values to
also collapse. Land values fell by an average of 27 percent between 1920 and 1925. Western
states saw the largest average decline at 43 percent, but states in the South, Midwest, and Great
Plains also experienced substantial declines of between 24 and 39 percent.
        The post-war collapse of crop prices also brought a sharp increase in bank failures,
voluntary liquidations, and mergers, producing the first sustained decline in the number of U.S.

  Loans during the period typically were a short-term with balloon payment rather than long-term with self-
amortizing payments. The average term of farm mortgage loans recorded by banks during 1917-21 was 2.7 years,
ranging from 1.4 years in the South to nearly 5 years in New England (Horton, Larsen, and Wall 1942, Table 74).
During the postbellum period, non-bank sources of farm loans included insurance companies, building and loan
associations, federal land banks, and other local farmers and merchants (Jaremski and Fishback 2018). In 1920,
commercial banks held 14 percent of outstanding farm mortgage debt, life insurance companies held 11 percent,
federal land banks 3 percent and private individuals 70 percent (Horton, Larsen and Wall 1942).

  North Dakota had one bank for every 756 persons. Other states with similar numbers included Iowa (1,257),
Nebraska (1,073), and South Dakota (914). The ratio is calculated by dividing the number of banks in 1921 (Board
of Governors 1959) by state population in 1920.

banks since the Civil War. After peaking in 1921, the number of banks fell by some 5,000, or 16
percent, over the 1920s. Bank suspension rates were especially high in states of the Pacific, Great
Plains, and South regions where many new banks had opened during the prior decade.9
Suspension rates were also generally higher among state-chartered banks (state banks) than
among banks with federal charters (national banks). Differences in the composition and
regulation of banks likely contributed to these differences. National banks were subject to
uniform and relatively strict standards across all states, whereas state banks were subject to the
laws, regulations, and policies established by the state in which they were located. In particular,
state banking regulations were more liberal toward mortgage loans for farmland, building, and
equipment purchases.10 Both federal and state banking laws prohibited interstate branching.
National banks were prohibited from operating any branches, and most states either prohibited or
severely limited intrastate branching. Thus, entry nearly always took the form of a new bank,
rather than a new branch of an established bank. State legislatures often set low minimum capital
requirements to encourage state-chartered banks to open in rural communities, however, whereas
national banks faced higher minimums, which held down their numbers in small towns. Thus,
while both bank types were present in large numbers in farming communities, national banks
were more prevalent in larger cities and less heavily involved in farm lending than state banks.
        State banking policies likely also affected banks’ ability and incentives to engage in high-
risk lending. Deposit insurance, which eight states adopted during the 1910s and early 1920s,
was one such policy. Intended to protect depositors from losses, all of the systems collapsed in
the 1920s with most failing to cover fully the deposits in failed banks (FDIC 1956). Insurance
assessments were a flat rate based on a bank’s total insured deposits rather than risk based.
Contemporaries argued that the insurance systems promoted excessive risk taking and growth of
state banking systems (Flood 1992), which recent studies have largely borne out. For example,
Calomiris and Jaremski (2019) find that insured banks generally had faster loan growth rates


9
  Suspensions include banks that failed or otherwise suspended operations because of financial difficulties. Some
banks that suspended later reopened, though most did not.
10
   Before 1914, national banks were generally prohibited from real estate lending. However, the Federal Reserve Act
(38 Stat. 251, 273), Section 24, specified “Any national banking association not situated in a central reserve city
may make loans secured by improved and unencumbered farm land … but no such loan shall be made for a longer
time than five years, nor for an amount exceeding fifty per centum of the actual value of the property offered as
security. Any such bank may make such loans in an aggregate sum equal to twenty-five per centum of its capital and
surplus or to one third of its time deposits….” A 1916 amendment clarified that farm mortgages made by national
banks against property other than farmland could have a term of no more than one year.

                                                        6
than uninsured banks. Moreover, they find evidence that depositors monitored bank risk taking
in that deposit flows were responsive to changes in bank loan portfolios and leverage when
deposits were not insured, but not after deposit insurance was implemented. Deposit insurance
also seems to have exacerbated the impact of the post-war collapse of farm prices and incomes
on bank loan growth, risk-taking and suspension rates (e.g., Calomiris 1992, Alston, et al. 1994,
Wheelock and Kumbhakar 1995, Wheelock and Wilson 1995, and Dehejia and Lleras-Muney
2007).11
         Minimum capital requirements, extended liability laws, and Federal Reserve membership
were among other banking policies that might have affected how banks in different locales
responded to changes in asset prices. Capital requirements, in the form of either higher minimum
capital amounts required to obtain a bank charter or extended liability on bank shareholders were
entry barriers that might have discouraged risk taking and the formation of new banks.12 The
effects of Federal Reserve membership are less obvious. Member banks were generally subject
to tougher regulations and supervision than non-member state banks, which might have deterred
risk taking, but the availability of the Fed’s discount window provided a liquidity backstop that
might have encouraged risk taking. Regardless, few state banks became Fed members, likely
because they perceived that the costs of membership outweighed the benefits.13
         The remainder of this paper attempts to fill out the story of the World War I agricultural
price shock by examining how banks responded to the boom, how banks fared during the bust,
and how the presence and lending of banks influenced the course of farmland values. Because
state and national banks faced very different regulatory regimes, in our empirical analysis, we
examine the response of national banks to the agricultural price shock and local banking
regulations separately from that of state banks.



11
   The evidence that deposit insurance promoted banking instability in the 1920s is consistent with studies that
examine other periods, including Keeley (1990), Demirgüç-Kunt and Detragiache (2002), Demirgüç-Kunt and
Huizinga (2004), Barth et al. (2006), and many others.
12
   Carlson et al. (2018) find that national banks in markets with low minimum capital requirements supplied more
credit, chose higher leverage, and were more likely to fail during or soon after the Panic of 1893, than were banks in
markets with higher minimum capital requirements.
13
   Federal Reserve membership was compulsory for national banks. However, even as late as 1929, fewer than 10
percent of state banks had joined the Federal Reserve System. Anderson et al. (2018) find that larger state banks and
those which provided services for other banks were more likely to join. Carlson and Wheelock (2018) find that
national banks were less liquid after the Fed’s establishment than before, suggesting that banks responded to the
Fed’s founding by shifting toward less liquid loans and securities.

3. Data
        To examine the effects of the World War I agricultural boom and subsequent bust on the
banking system, we merge county-level census data with bank-level balance sheet data. Our
sample includes only states in the South, Midwest, and Great Plains that published bank-level
information so as to focus on a balanced sample of locations where farming was a large share of
economic activity. And, to focus further on farming areas within those regions (rather than urban
and manufacturing centers) we include only counties that had (1) no city with a population over
25,000, (2) at least 250 farms, and (3) over 15,000 improved farm acres.14
          The county-level census dataset contains economic and demographic information for
1900, 1910, 1920, and 1925.15 Of particular interest is the county-level output of each farm crop.
Combining output data for 1910 with annual information on prices for 11 individual crops (corn,
wheat, oats, barley, rye, buckwheat, flaxseed, cotton, tobacco, Irish potatoes, and sweet potatoes)
from Carter et al. (2006), we form a county-specific crop price index for each year:
                                                        ∑11
                                                         𝑖=1 𝑄𝑖,𝑐,1910 ∗ 𝑃𝑖,𝑡
                                  𝐶𝑟𝑜𝑝𝐼𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑥𝑐,𝑡 =        11
                                                       ∑𝑖=1 𝑄𝑖,𝑐,1910 ∗ 𝑃𝑖,𝑎𝑣𝑔
where 𝑄𝑖,1910 is the output of crop i in county c in 1910, 𝑃𝑖,𝑡 is the price of crop i in year t, and
𝑃𝑖,𝑎𝑣𝑔 is the average price of crop i between 1908 and 1914. The index is the value of a basket of
crops at market prices in a given year normalized by the value of that same basket of crops at
their pre-war prices, where the county-specific crop output shares in 1910 determine the fixed
basket. The normalization is important to control for differences in the geographic size of
counties, as well as in the relative size of each county’s agricultural sector before the boom. The
measure takes an average value of 1 before World War I and rises throughout the war years.
        As the county-level basket of crops is held constant in 1910 and the crop prices are
national averages, CropIndexc,t has the benefit of being exogenous to the actions of local banks.
Of course, output levels and crop mix likely changed in response to rising farm incomes and




14
   We chose the cutoff points for farms and improved acres to eliminate the bottom 5 percent of the distribution. We
chose the population cutoff because the Census provides the number of people living in places with more than
25,000 for every county.
15
   The data were assembled by Haines (2004). We aggregate counties to their 1910 boundaries so as to have
consistent county definitions over time.

changes in relative prices.16 Our approach misses these shifts, but avoids any reverse causality
that local lending or changes in land values might have had on the measured crop price shock.
         Figure 2 illustrates the county-level geographic variation in the crop price index and the
percentage change in farmland value during the war. The top panel shows that the South, where
cotton and tobacco were dominant crops, and the upper Midwest, where buckwheat and Irish
potatoes were widely grown, generally experienced larger price gains than the Midwest and
Great Plains, where corn and wheat were major crops. The bottom panel shows that the change
in land value per acre followed a similar pattern: the largest gains in land values were in the
cotton growing portions of the South, and the smallest gains were in the corn growing regions of
the Midwest. The correlation is not perfect, however. For example, northwestern Iowa and
southeastern South Dakota experienced large gains in farmland values despite relatively modest
increases in the prices of the region’s principal crops (corn and wheat). The two maps also
illustrate the substantial within-state variation in average crop price and land value increases,
which we rely on to identify differential effects of the price shock on banks and farmland values.
         Our bank data consist of biennial, bank-level balance sheet information for 1908-20,
obtained from Annual Report of the Comptroller of the Currency and reports published by state
banking departments. The Comptroller published balance sheets for every national bank
annually, but many states did not publish balance sheets for their state-chartered banks before
1908, and most only published information every other year (see Mitchener and Jaremski 2015).
We digitized data from the available state reports for Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Iowa,
Kansas, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, North Carolina,
Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota, and Wisconsin, and interpolated values for the few reporting
gaps using the midpoint of data for the immediately surrounding years. The resulting biennial
dataset consists of 72,547 observations on 11,914 state banks and 2,989 national banks.17


16
   The crop index using the 1920 basket of crops has a 0.92 correlation with that for the 1910 basket, suggesting
there was not a substantial change in the distribution of crop production during the war. The lack of a change should
not be surprising as soil, climate, and market infrastructure largely determined the cash crops that could be grown
profitably in a given location.
17
   We interpolate less than 6 percent of observations. The results are similar if we instead drop these observations.
Throughout the paper, the term “state banks” refers to state-chartered commercial banks, trust companies, and
savings banks. All of these financial intermediaries took deposits and made loans. At the time, banking reports did
not include income statements or information about the interest rates paid on deposits or loans, thereby making it
impossible to calculate profit rates. We add 1 to the number of banks in each county to avoid missing values for the
few counties that did not have any banks. Appendix Table A.1 reports summary statistics for both the county and
bank-level data.

4. Responding to the Price Shock: Establishment of New Banks
         One impact the price shock might have had on the banking system was to spur bank
entry. Federal and state prohibitions on branching meant that the establishment of new banks,
rather than new branches of existing banks, was the dominant form of entry. Researchers have
documented that de novo banks generally have much higher failure rates than established banks
(e.g., DeYoung 2003). Thus, the agricultural boom might have contributed to banking system
instability by encouraging the establishment of new banks, many of which ultimately closed.18
         We estimate negative binomial count data regressions to investigate the impact of the
agricultural price shock and various bank regulations on bank entry at the county-level. The
dependent variable is the number of new banks established during a two-year period. The main
explanatory variable is the crop price index measured at the end of the prior period.19 We
estimate the following specification using biennial data from 1908 to 1920 (where entry during
1908-09 is the first observation):
         𝑁𝑒𝑤𝐵𝑎𝑛𝑘𝑠𝑐,𝑡 = 𝑎 + 𝛽1 𝐶𝑟𝑜𝑝𝐼𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑥𝑐,𝑡−1 + 𝛽2 𝑅𝑒𝑔𝑢𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑐,𝑡 + 𝛽3 𝑅𝑒𝑔𝑢𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑐,𝑡
                           ∗ 𝐶𝑟𝑜𝑝𝐼𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑥𝑐,𝑡−1 + 𝛽4 𝑋𝑐,𝑡 + 𝑡𝑡 + 𝑐𝑐 + 𝑒𝑐,𝑡 (1)
where 𝑁𝑒𝑤𝐵𝑎𝑛𝑘𝑠𝑐,𝑡 is the number of new banks entering county c during the biennial period t,
𝐶𝑟𝑜𝑝𝐼𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑥𝑐,𝑡−1 is the crop price index in county c at the end of the previous biennial period,
𝑅𝑒𝑔𝑢𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑐,𝑡 is a vector of bank regulations in county c in biennial period t including a dummy
variable for whether the state had an active deposit insurance system, a dummy variable for
whether the state imposed extended liability on state bank shareholders,20 and a dummy variable
for whether the state set a minimum capital requirement of more than $10,000 on state banks.
𝑋𝑐,𝑡 is a vector of county-specific census control variables for county c in the biennial period t,
𝑡𝑡 is a vector of year fixed effects, 𝑐𝑐 is a vector of county fixed effects, and 𝑒𝑐,𝑡 is a robust error

18
   The early 2000s housing boom was not associated with growth in the number of commercial banks. However, the
boom did increase both the demand for and supply of credit, and was associated with growth of the shadow banking
system and easing of lending standards (e.g., Loutskina and Strahan 2009; Mian and Sufi 2009; Dell’Ariccia et al.
2012; Gorton and Metrick 2012).
19
   In the Appendix, we show that the effects of the crop price index are similar if we use the lagged change in the
crop price index (Table A.2) a cross-section from 1914 to 1920 (Table A.3), or either a tobit regression of the entry
rate (Table A.5) or a probit model of entry or no entry in a given year (Table A.6). Finally, Table A.4 combines both
state and national bank data into one model to show that the effect of the crop price index is larger for state bank
entry than for national bank entry.
20
   Shareholders of national banks could be assessed an amount equal to the par value of the stock they held in the
event the bank failed, which is commonly referred to as double liability. Some states also imposed double liability
on bank shareholders. A few states imposed other multiples at times, but according to Grossman (2001), the “vast
majority” of states with any form of extended liability imposed double liability.

                                                         10
term clustered by county. As the county fixed effects control for location characteristics that are
constant over time, Equation (1) includes only those census control variables that vary over time:
the logarithms of county population and manufacturing output per person, the fraction of county
population living in a city or town of 2,500 or more persons, the fractions of county population
that are non-white, illiterate, or 15 years of age or younger, and the numbers of state and national
banks in the county at the beginning of the period.21 Note that because we include year fixed
effects, the effect of the increase in a county’s crop price index is only identified relative to the
sample average increase of the crop price index.
         Studies of bank entry in other settings find that local economic opportunities, market size,
and legal barriers all affect entry (e.g., Adams and Amel 2016; Adams and Gramlich 2016). The
crop price index observed at the beginning of a two-year period captures the economic
opportunities that encouraged entry. Both the level of each policy variable and its interaction
with the crop price index reflect the effects of regulation and other banking policies. The
presence of county-fixed effects in the model implies that the coefficients on the levels only
capture the effects of any changes in the policy. While these effects are important, there were
few changes during our period of study and the asset boom does not seem to have caused them.22
Hence, we treat the levels of the regulatory variables as controls that vary over time for the type
of institutions and political environment the bank was operating in at that point in time, and we
focus on the interactions, which indicate how the particular policy affected the impact of the crop
price shock on bank entry rates.



21
   We assume that the census variables grew linearly over time to construct annual estimates from the decennial
observations.
22
   Among our sample states, deposit insurance systems were established in Kansas, Mississippi, Nebraska,
Oklahoma, and South Dakota. State banks were required to join the deposit insurance systems in all of these states
except Kansas, where membership was voluntary. National banks were not permitted to join state deposit insurance
systems. While all national bank shareholders were subject to double liability, several of our sample states also
imposed extended liability on state banks, including Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Nebraska,
North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Dakota, and Wisconsin, but only Mississippi and Ohio adopted extended liability
during our sample period. Finally, nine states set minimum capital requirements for their state banks at $10,000 (or
$5000 in the case of North Carolina), while three had minimums above $10,000 ($15,000 in Alabama, Florida and
$25,000 in Ohio). Six states changed their minimums between 1910 and 1920, but only four crossed the $10,000
threshold: Illinois decreased from $25,000 to $10,000; Michigan decreased from $20,000 to $10,000; Nebraska
increased from $10,000 to $15,000; South Dakota increased from $10,000 to $15,000. The identities of states that
imposed double liability are from Grossman (2001). Information on minimum capital requirements is from White
(1983) and Rand McNally Bankers’ Directory. See Benmelech and Moskowitz (2010), Mitchener and Jaremski
(2015), Rajan and Ramcharan (2015b), Calomiris and Jaremski (2016) for studies on the political economy of
various bank regulation during the period.

                                                         11
         As discussed in Section 2, national banks faced substantially different regulations than
state banks and were particularly restricted from engaging in mortgage lending. Thus, we expect
that national banks responded differently to rising crop prices than did state banks (a hypothesis
that we explicitly test in the Appendix tables), and hence estimate Equation (1) separately for
state and national banks.23
         The estimation results for Equation 1, shown in Table 1, indicate that crop prices had a
positive and statistically significant impact on the entry of state banks, but not of national banks.
Because they generally faced higher minimum capital requirements and tighter restrictions on
mortgage lending than state banks, national banks were more likely to open in larger cities, and
less likely to lend directly to farmers in rural areas.
         We also find some evidence that banking policies affected how the shock affected bank
entry. Specifically, we estimate that in states with a minimum capital requirement above $10,000
(the median among our sample states), the effect of a given change in the crop price index on
entry of state banks was approximately one-half of the effect on entry in states with a lower
minimum capital requirement. Further, the negative correlation between national bank entry and
the crop price shock was predominately in states that had relatively high minimum capital
requirements on state banks, suggesting further that national banks were imperfect substitutes for
state banks. Finally, the results indicate that neither deposit insurance nor extended liability
statutes affected consistently the impact of crop prices on the establishment of either bank type.24
5. Responding to the Price Shock: Loan Growth and Balance Sheet Risk
         In addition to encouraging the formation of new banks, rising farm prices and incomes
likely affected bank growth rates and portfolio allocations. Using bank-level balance sheet data,
we examine how the agricultural price shock affected the growth of total assets and loans, as
well as ratios of loans to assets (loans/assets), paid-in capital, surplus, and undivided profits to
assets (capital/assets), liquid reserves to assets (cash/assets), and bonds and stocks to assets
(bonds/assets) of banks. Many studies across many settings find that bank failure risk is



23
   To test that the responses of national banks were fundamentally different than those of state banks, we estimated
each of the models reported in the paper on pooled data for state and national banks and included separate
interaction terms for state banks. F-tests reject the hypothesis that the coefficients on the state bank interaction terms
are jointly equal to zero in every case. See Appendix Tables A.4, A.11, and A.12.
24
   Calomiris and Jaremski (2019) also find that deposit insurance did not significantly affect the number of banks at
the state-level, but did not examine bank entry rates explicitly or examine the number of banks at the county-level.

                                                           12
correlated with these measures. Thus, the analysis provides evidence about whether banks’
response to the boom contributed to banking system instability by increasing failure risk.
         The model, which we estimate using biennial bank-level observations from 1908 to 1920,
is as follows:
 𝑌𝑖,𝑐,𝑡 = 𝑎 + 𝛽1 𝐶𝑟𝑜𝑝𝐼𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑥𝑐,𝑡 + 𝛽2 𝑅𝑒𝑔𝑢𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑐,𝑡 + 𝛽3 𝑅𝑒𝑔𝑢𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑐,𝑡 ∗ 𝐶𝑟𝑜𝑝𝐼𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑥𝑐,𝑡 + 𝛽4 𝑋𝑐,𝑡
                   + 𝛽5 𝐶𝑟𝑜𝑝𝐼𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑥𝑐,𝑡 ∗ 𝑌𝑟1918 + 𝑡𝑡 + 𝑢𝑖 + 𝑒𝑖,𝑐,𝑡 (2)
where 𝑌𝑖,𝑐,𝑡 is one of the specified balance sheet variables for bank i in county c during biennial
period t, 𝑌𝑟1918 is a dummy variable that takes the value 1 in 1918 and 0 otherwise, 𝑢𝑖 is a
vector of bank-fixed effects, 𝑒𝑖,𝑐,𝑡 is the error term clustered by county, 𝑋𝑐,𝑡 now contains all the
previous variables with the addition of the numbers of state and national banks in the current
year, 𝑅𝑒𝑔𝑢𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑐,𝑡 now contains a dummy variable for Federal Reserve membership during
biennial period t and the deposit insurance indicator variable for the state bank regression is at
the bank-level rather than the state-level, and the rest of the variables retain their previous
definitions. In these regressions, we include the interaction between the crop price index and the
1918 dummy to control for any differential effects of the price shock on banks when the United
States was at war. During the war, the U.S. government and Federal Reserve encouraged banks
to purchase government bonds and to provide funds to help their customers buy bonds (Meltzer
2003, pp. 84-90). This pressure might have altered how banks responded to rising crop prices in
those years.
     We again estimate Equation (2) separately for state banks (Table 2) and national banks
(Table 3) to account for the differing regulation.25 Focusing first on state banks, the specification
in the first column of each set reveals a positive and statistically significant impact of the crop
price index on total assets and loans. We estimate that a doubling of the crop price index
increased a state bank’s assets by 23.0 percent and loans by 23.7 percent. Further, the
coefficients on the crop price index are positive for loans/assets and cash/assets, and negative for
capital/assets and bonds/assets. Specifically, we estimate that a doubling of the crop price index
increased loans/assets by an insignificant 0.4 percentage points and cash/assets by 1.3 percentage

25
  In the Appendix, we report estimates of the balance sheet regressions in several different ways to show that the
results are robust to the modeling choices. Table A.7 reports a cross-sectional regression for 1914-20 to show a total
effect. Tables A.8 and A.9 report the results when including an autoregressive term to account for any serial
correlation in the balance sheet items. Table A.10 adds the lagged value of total assets to the balance sheet ratios
models to control for bank size. Table A.11 combines state and national banks into a single model to show that the
effect on state banks was much larger than that on national banks.

                                                         13
points, while reducing both capital/assets and bonds/assets by 3.0 percentage points. The effects
are quantitatively modest, though statistically significant (except for loans/assets), and somewhat
ambiguous about whether banks in general responded to the boom by increasing their overall
risk.
        Next we test whether banks established during the war responded differently to the boom
than did older banks. Berger and Udell (2004) find that in general, the quality of a bank’s loans is
lower when a higher proportion of the bank’s loan officers have never experienced severe loan
losses, or when the time since the bank last experienced a bust is long, which they argue
contributes to the tendency for loan growth to be procyclical. Thus, conceivably, banks that
opened during the boom were more aggressive lenders than older banks because older banks
were more likely to have encountered economic distress in the past, or had higher charter values
to protect. To test this hypothesis, we include an interaction of the crop price index with a
dummy set equal to 1 for banks that were established between 1914 and 1920 in the second and
third regressions in each set.
        For state banks, the coefficients on the young bank interaction term indicate that for a
given increase in the crop price index, the total loans and loans/assets of newer banks increased
much more than those of older banks. Specifically, we estimate that the loan volumes of newer
banks increased approximately 17 percent more for a given increase in the crop price index than
did the loans of established banks. Moreover, whereas the impact of the crop price index on
loans/assets of older banks was small and not statistically significant, the impact on the ratio for
new banks is positive and significant. A doubling of the crop price index increased loans/assets
by 2.5 percentage points for young banks, compared with an increase of 0.1 percentage points for
older state banks. Similarly, the impact of the crop price shock on capital/assets was nearly 50
percent larger for young banks than it was for older banks. We estimate that a doubling of the
crop price index caused capital/assets of young banks to decline by 4.1 percentage points,
compared with a decline of 2.8 percentage points for older banks. Finally, the regressions
indicate that whereas an increase in the crop price index increased the cash/assets ratio for older
banks, it had no effect on the ratio for young banks. Thus, the evidence indicates that newer state
banks responded more aggressively to the agricultural price shock than did older state banks.
        The third column of each set of regressions includes the interactions between the banking
policy variables and the crop price index to test whether specific regulation altered banks’


                                                 14
response to the shock. The negative coefficients on the interaction of the minimum capital
requirement dummy variable with the crop price index indicate that the impact of a given crop
price index value on total loans, total assets, and loans/assets was smaller in states with relatively
high minimum capital requirements. To the extent that higher minimums gave rural banks a
degree of local monopoly power, they likely encouraged conservative behavior and hence less
asset and loan expansion as well as higher reserves and lower leverage in response to a local
price shock. The positive coefficients on the interaction of extended liability with the crop price
index indicate that extended liability boosted the impact of crop prices on assets, loans, and
loans/assets, suggesting that it did not deter banks from responding aggressively to rising crop
prices. Grossman (2001) finds that extended liability generally reduced risk taking except in
periods of heightened financial distress, including the early 1920s, and notes that extended
liability was widely viewed as ineffective at containing banking system risk and eventually
eliminated in the 1930s.
       Finally, deposit insurance seems to have amplified the impact of crop prices on total
loans, assets, and capital/assets ratios of banks in state deposit insurance systems. The results
support previous studies that find that members of the state deposit insurance systems grew faster
and assumed more risk than did uninsured banks.
       The results reported in Table 3 indicate that national banks were less responsive to rising
crop prices, particularly in terms of the extensive growth measures. The baseline regressions,
which exclude policy interactions, reveal no evidence that national banks systematically
increased their total loans or loans/assets in response to crop prices. In line with national bank
entry, we find a negative correlation between total assets in national banks and the crop price
index, indicative of a redistribution of bank assets away from national banks to state banks in
response to rising crop prices. Further, we find no differences in the balance sheet ratio responses
of newer national banks and those established before the boom.
       The national bank results suggest some policy effects, however. Rising crop prices had a
larger impact on national bank assets, cash/assets, and bonds/assets after banks became Fed
members, but less impact on total loans and loans/assets. However, because all national banks
became Fed members when the System was established in 1914, the interaction cannot clearly
separate the effect of becoming a member from the effect of the beginning of World War I. The
results also indicate that national banks located in states with higher minimum capital


                                                 15
requirements for state banks experienced a reduced impact of crop prices on loans, assets and
loans/assets for national banks, similar to state banks. Thus, minimum capital requirements
appear to have been an especially effective brake on bank expansion in response to fundamental
shocks. By contrast, the effects on national banks of extended liability and deposit insurance
regimes for state banks are more mixed. However, as with state banks, deposit insurance tended
to amplify the impact of crop prices on total loans and assets, suggesting that even though
national banks were not eligible for insurance, they responded in a manner consistent with their
insured state bank competitors.
       Our results reveal several dynamics about the boom. First, the agricultural price shock
produced large increases in the assets and loans of state banks that were established before 1914,
and even larger increases for banks that opened during the boom. Newly-established banks
accounted for one-third of total loan growth between 1914 and 1920 in our sample counties.
Moreover, the contribution of younger banks to total growth was larger in states with deposit
insurance and smaller in states with high minimum capital requirements. Furthermore, while the
results are somewhat ambiguous as to whether older banks responded to rising crop prices by
taking on greater balance sheet risk, state banks established during the boom seem to have
responded more aggressively to rising agricultural prices by increasing their loans/assets and
leverage (i.e., by reducing capital/assets).
       Second, crop prices had much less impact on the loan growth of national banks, likely
because of their more limited role in financing agricultural investment and production.
Moreover, unlike the more aggressive response of newer state banks than older banks, we find
no evidence of differences in the responses of national banks based on when they were
established. The fact that state banks responded much more strongly than national banks to
agricultural fundamentals indicates that our crop price index reflects the agricultural price shock
rather than other factors correlated with World War I.
       Third, bank regulations and policies affected the response of state banks to the price
shock (and even the response of national banks to some extent). High minimum capital
requirements lessened the impact of rising farm output prices on the growth of bank assets and
loans, and balance sheet ratios correlated with risk, whereas deposit insurance amplified those
effects. Extended liability statutes, however, were apparently not a deterrent to an aggressive
response to rising crop prices.


                                                16
6. Which Banks Closed During the Bust?
        Farm output prices collapsed in 1920 and farmland values quickly followed. With much
lower incomes, many farmers were unable to repay mortgages and other loans incurred during
the boom, resulting in the failures of hundreds of banks in farming regions. Across the United
States, 1,787 commercial banks suspended operations during 1921-24, representing about 6
percent of active banks in 1921. Suspensions were highly concentrated in farm states; Minnesota,
Iowa, Missouri, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska and Kansas combined for 947
suspensions (Board of Governors 1943, p. 284). Our bank-level data enable us to test various
hypotheses about the causes of individual bank closures during the bust.26
        We estimate a probit model to examine the determinants of bank closures between 1920
and 1924. Our specification is similar to those estimated in other settings, such as the Great
Depression (White 1984), 1980s-90s (Wheelock and Wilson 1995, 2000), and Great Recession
(Cole and White 2012), in which the closure outcome is regressed on bank age as well as various
balance sheet measures intended to capture bank performance and risk. Larger banks might have
more opportunities for diversification or scale economies, and thus we anticipate that banks with
more total assets are less likely to close. We anticipate that higher loans/assets would increase
the likelihood of closure because loans are typically a bank’s most risky assets. By contrast, we
expect that greater liquidity (reflected in higher cash/assets) or capital (reflected in higher
capital/assets) would reduce the probability of closure. Finally, older banks might be better
managed or have more stable funding, and thus we expect that the closure probability was lower
for older banks, even leaving aside their less aggressive response to the boom noted previously.
        We also test whether the asset boom affected closure rates directly, rather than simply
through their observable impact on bank balance sheets. We include the percent changes in
farmland value per acre, mortgage debt per acre, and improved farm acreage between 1910 and
1920, as well as the log of mortgage debt per acre in 1920 to capture the boom.27 We do not
include measures of the bust, such as the change in farmland value during 1920-25, because they
might be determined in part by local bank closures. The model takes the form:
26
   A bank might close because it failed, voluntarily liquidated, merged with another bank, or changed its name or
charter type (e.g., a state bank that switched to a national charter), and neither state reports nor Rand McNally
provide consistent information about why individual banks closed. Because mergers, acquisitions, and name
changes were often undertaken for reasons correlated with bank distress, this should not bias the results in any
particular direction.
27
   Throughout the paper, our measures are in nominal dollars because mortgages and other loans were not indexed
for inflation, and bank failures reflected the performance of bank assets in nominal, rather than real terms.

𝑒𝑐,𝑡 is the robust error term, and the rest of the values retain their previous definitions. Because
the asset price boom measures are observed at the county level, we cannot include county-fixed
effects and instead expand on the county-level controls to include a vector of Federal Reserve
district fixed effects,28 the logarithm of crop value in 1920, average rainfall in the county, the
standard deviation of rainfall in the county, the logarithm of county land area (in square miles),
logarithm distance in miles to the Mississippi River, logarithm distance in miles to the Atlantic
Ocean, logarithm distance in miles to the Great Lakes, and logarithm distance in miles to the
Pacific Ocean (Rajan and Ramcharan 2015; Haines 2004). The vector of bank-specific variables
includes dummies for the entry year of the bank, the logarithm of total assets, loans/assets,
capital/assets, and cash/assets in 1920.
         As before, we estimate the model separately for national and state banks. We also
estimate the model on the full sample of state or national banks present in 1920 as well as on a
reduced sample of banks that were present in 1914 and survived through 1920.29 The reduced
sample allows us to include each bank’s percentage increase in total loans from 1914 to 1920 to
test whether rapid loan growth affected closure probability over and above the location-specific
factors. Fahlenbrach et al. (2018) document that rapid loan portfolio growth is generally
associated with lower average loan quality and lower future stock returns, while other studies

28
   Although the borders of many Fed districts align with state boundaries, several states in our sample (i.e., Illinois,
Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, and Wisconsin) are split between two different Fed districts. Therefore, we include
both state and Fed district fixed effects in the model.
29
   Appendix Table A.12 shows the results when we combine state and national banks into a single model and test for
differences in their reactions.

have found that rapid loan growth increases a bank’s failure risk (e.g., Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation 1997). Thus, even after controlling for bank age, we anticipate that banks with more
loan growth during the boom would have been more likely to close during the bust since rapid
growth might reflect aggressive lending associated with less screening of borrowers or lower
lending standards.
       The marginal effects of Equation (3) reported in Table 4 indicate that the probability of a
bank closing during 1920-24 was positively correlated with the increase in county farmland
value during the 1910s even after controlling for the balance sheet measures. We estimate that a
doubling of farmland value over the 1910s increased a state bank’s probability of closing during
1920-24 by 10.8 percentage points and a national bank’s probability of closing by 7.2 percentage
points. We find no impact of changes in mortgage debt per acre or improved acreage, or of the
level of mortgage debt per acre in 1920, on closure probabilities for state banks. However,
national banks located in counties with larger improved acreage increases during the 1910s had
higher probabilities of closing during 1920-24. Further, our results indicate that for state banks,
larger size (measured by the log of total assets), higher capital/assets, and higher cash/assets
reduced closure probability, whereas higher loans/assets increased the probability of closing. The
results for national banks go in the same directions but are not always statistically significant,
likely due to their lower closure rates and fewer observations.
       Finally, for both bank types, the year of entry dummies indicate that older banks were
much more likely to survive than banks that entered between 1918 and 1920 (i.e., the excluded
group). Compared with a bank that opened between 1918 and 1920, a state bank that opened
between 1916 and 1918 was 3.3 percent less likely to close, a state bank that opened between
1914 and 1916 was 6.7 percent less likely to close, and a state bank that opened before 1914 was
between 4.7 and 8.2 percent less likely to close.
       The results for the sample of banks established before 1914 are generally similar to those
for all banks present in 1920. The age dummies are no longer statistically significant, indicating
that the year of establishment mattered little for banks that opened before 1914. We also find that
rapid loan growth during the boom increased a bank’s probability of closing during the bust. The
estimates indicate that a 76.9 percent increase in loans during 1914-20 (i.e., the average
percentage change in bank loans in the sample) would have increased the probability of closure
by 1.38 percentage points (about 9 percent relative to the mean closure rate) even after


                                                 19
controlling for the increase in county farmland value during 1910-20 and bank balance sheet
composition in 1920.
          We also examine whether state banking regulations and policies affected closure rates
directly (rather than through their effects on bank balance sheets) using interactions with the
change in farmland value during 1910-20. If access to the Federal Reserve’s discount window
provided member banks with a reliable source of liquidity, then they might have been better able
to withstand the decline in farmland prices.30 Deposit insurance might have increased the
probability of bank closure during the 1920s by encouraging greater risk-taking during the boom
or as losses eroded bank net worth during the bust. The effect of extended liability on the closure
probability is unclear a priori. Although conceivably a deterrent to risk-taking, Grossman (2001)
speculates that extended liability gave bankers an incentive to close sooner in order to avoid
hitting shareholders with larger losses when banks inevitably failed. Finally, higher capital
requirements might be associated with greater buffers for losses as well as higher franchise
values.
          The results reported in the second and third columns indicate that of the policy variables,
only deposit insurance had a statistically significant impact on closure probability. The
coefficient estimates indicate that the impact of the increase in land prices during 1910-20 on
bank closure probability during 1920-25 was four times larger for banks with insured deposits
than for uninsured state banks. The insignificant coefficients on the other regulatory variables
suggest that their effects, if any, are captured by the bank balance sheet variables in the model
(e.g., higher dollar minimum capital requirements prevented the formation of very small banks as
well as new banks, both of which had higher closure rates). The inclusion of these interactions
greatly reduces the size and statistical significance of the coefficient on the change in farmland
value during 1910-20, however, indicating that the effect of the land boom worked through its
impact on bank balance sheets and their interactions with regulation.
          We did not include the change in farmland value during 1920-25 in our regressions
because of the possibility that bank closures had an impact on local land prices. However, with
the explicit understanding that the coefficients are not necessarily causal estimates, we add the
percent change in farmland value per acre for 1920-25 and its interaction with the percent change


30
  White (2015) argues that the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta lent aggressively to reduce bank distress during the
early 1920s. Our inclusion of Fed District fixed effects accounts for these types of differences.

                                                        20
in farmland value per acre 1910-20 to Equation (3), reported in Appendix Table A.13. The level
variable allows us to observe whether bank closures were sensitive to the farmland price bust,
whereas the interaction allows us to test whether the impact of the decline in land prices on bank
closure probability depended on the size of the preceding land price boom. The results provide
some evidence that the larger the increase in farmland value during the boom, the greater the
impact of a given decline in local farmland value per acre on the probability of closing during the
bust. Comparing two counties with the average change in farmland value during 1920-25 (i.e.,
34.9 percent), a state bank in a county that experienced a 25 percent larger rise in farmland
value during the 1910s was 0.8 percentage points more likely to close in the early-1920s than a
state bank located in the other county.
        The bank-level analysis provides insight into the dynamics surrounding the interplay of
bank and agricultural distress during the 1920s. On a macroeconomic level, the interaction
between the boom and the bust made things even worse, at least for state-chartered banks. That
said, microeconomic and regulatory factors also played a role. Banks that were established
during the war, expanded their loans during the boom, had higher loans/assets, lower
capital/assets, or lower cash/assets were more likely to close during the bust. Deposit insurance
appears to have made banks particularly vulnerable to the boom and bust in farmland values.
7. Bank Closures and the Bust
        The previous sections have shown how banks responded to and were affected by the
agricultural price shock. In this section, we explore the impact of banking instability on the
decline of farmland values after commodity prices collapsed in 1920. Rajan and Ramcharan
(2015a) show that, for a given shock to commodity prices, counties with more banks experienced
larger increases in farmland value than counties with fewer banks, and subsequently, those
counties experienced larger declines in land value through the 1930s and a lower level of land
prices as late as 1960.31 Further, Rajan and Ramcharan (2016) find that bank suspensions
depressed land values during the 1920s. To limit potential endogeneity, Rajan and Ramcharan
employ an identification strategy that involves including suspension rates in both the reference
county and in neighboring counties in another state in their regression, under the assumption that
suspensions in out-of-state counties capture the impact of economic activity and credit demand,


31
 In addition to showing similar results for the number of banks in our agricultural county sample, we show in
Appendix Table A.14 that loan growth during the 1910s exerted a separate positive effect on farmland value.

                                                        21
whereas in-state suspensions reflect both credit demand and supply effects. By contrast, we
exploit our microeconomic data on bank balance sheets to estimate predicted bank closure rates
based on predetermined values, which enables us to include all counties (not just those along
state borders) in the analysis. We also estimate separately the effects of state-chartered and
national bank closures, as well as the dynamics of the boom-bust event.
       We estimate the following model to examine how the growth and collapse of banks
contributed to the land price bust between 1920 and 1925:
   ∆𝐿𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑉𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒𝑐,1920−25
                   = 𝑎 + 𝛽1 ∆𝐶𝑟𝑜𝑝𝐼𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑥𝑐,1919−25 + 𝛽2 𝑆𝐷𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑠𝑐,1920 + 𝛽3 𝑁𝐷𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑠𝑐,1920
                   + 𝛽4 ∆𝐿𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑉𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒𝑐,1910−20 + 𝛽5 𝑋𝑐,1920 + 𝑠𝑠 + 𝑒𝑐 (4)
where ∆𝐿𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑉𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒𝑐,1920−25 is percentage change in farmland value per acre for county c from
1920 to 1925, ∆𝐶𝑟𝑜𝑝𝐼𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑥𝑐,1919−25 is the percentage change in the crop price index for county c
from 1919 to 1925, 𝑆𝐷𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑠𝑐,1920 and 𝑁𝐷𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑠𝑐,1920 are one of several measures of state or
national bank distress described below, and the rest of the variables retain their prior definitions.
To capture the effect of the banking sector distress on farmland value over and above the crop
price shock, we include three types of bank distress measures in the model. First, we include
interactions of the crop price index with the numbers of state and national banks in the county in
1920. Second, we include the percent change in bank loan volume in the county from 1910-20.
Finally, we include three direct measures of bank closures: the number of banks that closed
between 1920 and 1924, the value of assets in 1920 of those banks, and the fraction of a county’s
assets in 1920 made up by the banks that subsequently closed.
       The results, reported in Table 5, reveal a positive impact of changes in the crop price
index during 1919-25 on changes in farmland values during the bust. We also find a negative
impact of changes in farmland value per acre during the boom on changes in farmland value
during the bust. That is, controlling for the fall in crop prices after 1919, counties with larger
increases in farmland values during the 1910s suffered larger declines in land values during
1920-25. Our estimates indicate that a county with an additional 10 percentage point increase in
farmland value during the 1910s had a 3.1 percentage point larger decline in land value in the
1920s (i.e., about 10 percent of the mean decline in the sample) relative to another county.
       The presence of banks or the growth in bank loans might have had an impact to the extent
that they contributed to rising farmland values during the boom. However, we find no direct

                                                  22
impact of the number of banks in 1920, the interaction of the number of banks in 1920 with the
crop price change 1919-25, or the growth in bank loans during 1910-20 on the change in
farmland values during 1920-25.
         By contrast, changes in local credit supply resulting from state bank failures or other
closures seem to have had an impact. Results reported in columns (3) through (5) indicate that
the change in farmland value during 1920-25 is correlated with each of the three measures of
state bank closures. For example, a one standard deviation higher number of state bank closures
(i.e., 1.56 additional closures) is associated with 2 percentage point larger decline in land value.
Similarly, the decline in land value is negatively correlated with the amount of assets in closed
state banks and the percentage of a county’s banking assets in closed state banks. By contrast, we
find no evidence of a link between farmland value and national bank closures during the bust. As
previously noted, national banks generally did not respond with aggressive lending during the
land price boom, and few closed during the subsequent bust.
         The number of closures and assets in closed banks are the most accurate measures of
bank distress, but are also likely endogenous to the decline in farmland value. Because of this,
we report additional specifications in Table 6 that make use of the state bank closure regression
reported in column (2) of Table 4 to generate an arguably exogenous measure of predicted state
bank closure risk.32 The bank closure regressions contain a variety of bank-level variables that
reliably predict bank closure and should otherwise be uncorrelated with the decline in farmland
values in the early 1920s. Specifically, the closure regressions include measures of each bank’s
balance sheet and age in 1920. The county-level model controls for changes in the crop price
index, previous changes in farmland values, location-fixed effects, and the host of other county-
level control variables included in the closure model. Hence, the remaining variation in the
predicted probability of closure for each bank is driven exclusively by the bank’s balance sheet
composition and age in 1920. To move from the bank-level to the county-level, we sum the
predicted closure probabilities for each bank in a county.




32
  We focus on state bank closures because we found that changes in farmland value were not correlated with
national bank closures. Also, because few national banks closed during the bust, the explanatory power of the
balance sheet items and regulatory interactions are much weaker. The results are similar if we restrict the sample to
older state banks and include the percentage growth in loans 1914-20 (as in column (3) of Table 4) or if we include
regulatory interactions (as in column (2) of Table 4).

                                                         23
        In column (2) of Table 6, we provide estimates from a reduced form model that replaces
the number of state bank closures with the sum of the predicted closure probabilities.33 The
coefficient on the predicted closure probability is slightly larger but not significantly different
from the OLS estimate in column (1). In column (3), we formalize the IV specification by
utilizing a two-stage least squares model that instruments for the number of state bank closures
using the sum of predicted closure probabilities of state banks in the county.34 The coefficient on
the instrumented number of state bank closures in column (3) is larger than coefficient on raw
number of state bank closures in column (1). The same one standard deviation increase the
number of state bank closures is associated with a 4 percentage point decrease in farmland value.
The IV approach thus yields the same result as the OLS regressions: counties experiencing more
state banks closures saw additional reductions in farmland value during the 1920s.
8. Conclusion
        Banks are often intertwined with asset price booms and busts, as the financial crisis of
2008-09 and the preceding subprime mortgage boom demonstrated (e.g., Mian and Sufi 2009;
Glaeser et al. 2012; Gorton and Metrick 2012). Historical studies can be valuable for revealing
fundamental relationships and the effects of different policies that might not be apparent in
complex modern environments, however, and for evidence about the generality of relationships
observed in the recent past. The World War I agricultural boom and post-war bust is a
particularly useful episode for studying the interrelationship between banks and asset prices.
Triggered by the collapse of European agriculture during the war, rapidly rising commodity
prices ignited a farmland price boom in the United States. Rajan and Ramcharan (2015a) show
that the availability of credit contributed to the boom in land values and mortgage debt at the
county-level. Here, using bank-level data, we show how the banking system became enmeshed
in the boom. While older banks increased their lending to accommodate rising credit demand,
new banks were established and expanded even more aggressively. Similar to the “shadow”
banks of the modern era, state-chartered banks responded more strongly to the asset boom than
did more tightly regulated national banks. State banking regulations and policies influenced the
extent to which banks of both types responded to the boom, however, with higher minimum

33
   As shown in Appendix Table A.15, the results are similar if we simply count the number of state banks that had a
predicted closure probability over 5 percent.
34
   As might be expected from Table 4, the sum of the predicted closure probabilities strongly predicts the actual
number of state bank closures in the first stage. Using the method employed by Stock and Yogo (2005), the
Kleibergen-Paap Wald statistic rejects the hypothesis of a weak instrument at the 1 percent-level.

                                                        24
capital requirements deterring bank entry and loan growth, and deposit insurance encouraging
more aggressive lending. The World War I asset price boom thus provides supporting evidence
for studies of modern crises as well as a micro-level view of the macroeconomic dynamics found
in broader studies of asset booms and busts.
         The collapse in land values also affected banks. When farm output and land prices
collapsed after the war, banks that opened during the boom, banks with weak balance sheets, and
banks that had lent most aggressively during the boom were more likely to fail or be acquired
than other banks. Our results thus support studies on modern times that find that banks with
inexperienced lenders or aggressive loan growth perform worse than other banks when
fundamentals sour. Further, our study provides new evidence that deposit insurance was
destabilizing in that it amplified the effect of the asset boom on bank closure probabilities when
farm prices subsequently collapsed. Bank closures, and by extension banking policies, also
played a role in exacerbating the collapse of farmland prices in the 1920s. Controlling for the
change in crop prices, counties with more bank closures saw larger declines in land prices. Thus,
banking instability made the collapse of asset prices worse than it would have otherwise been.
         The historical episode offers many lessons for policymakers. First, policies that inhibit
bank scale and diversification can make a banking system prone to instability in the face of asset
price shocks.35 For example, throughout much of the 19th and 20th centuries, anti-branching laws
gave the United States an unstable, crisis-prone banking system comprised of small unit banks,
unlike the more stable banking system of Canada and other countries with large, diversified
banks (e.g., Bordo et al. 1994; Grossman 2010). Although the United States now permits
interstate branch banking, the lingering effects of past restrictions were apparent in the high
failures rates of banks located in regions with relatively extreme fluctuations in house prices
during the financial crisis of 2008-09 (Aubuchon and Wheelock 2010), and some limits on
geographic expansion remain.36 Further, various restrictions on bank activities implemented after
the crisis, such as the Volcker Rule, might actually increase bank asset or trading risk (Keppo
and Korte 2018).


35
   Numerous studies find that even the largest banks face increasing returns to scale (e.g., Wheelock and Wilson
2012; Hughes and Mester 2013), though there may be tradeoffs, such as reduced competition or greater systemic
risk, if banks are permitted unlimited size (see Mester 2008 for discussion).
36
   For example, state and federal banking laws cap the percentage of a state’s deposits that a bank can obtain through
acquisitions.

                                                         25
       Second, regulators need to be mindful of the tendency for aggressive lending among
newly-established banks and avoid policies that encourage excessive risk taking, especially
among new entrants. Third, our results indicate that entry barriers in the form of high minimum
capital required to obtain a bank charter promoted a more stable banking system, while
mispriced deposit insurance had the opposite effect. Our research thus supports studies finding
that erosion of entry barriers reduces bank charter values and promote instability, especially
when coupled with deposit insurance (e.g., Keeley 1990; Laeven and Levine 2009). Finally, the
episode provides evidence of how banking system instability can exacerbate asset price booms
and busts, and serves as a reminder that regulations and other policies that influence the stability
of banking systems can ultimately affect the stability of asset prices and hence real activity.

Notes: The map in the top panel displays the county-level crop price index in 1919. The map in the bottom panel
displays the percentage change in farmland value per acre (1910-20) from Haines (2004). In both maps dark
colors denotes higher values whereas light colors denotes lower values. Boundaries were obtained from Minnesota
Population Center (2004). We provide information on all states (not just those in our sample) in order to show that
states with available data display similar patterns to those that do not.

Notes: The table presents the results of a negative binomial regression. The dependent variable is the number of
new banks entering the county in each period. Each observation is a county and each county is observed every
two years. Counties with no entry over the period are dropped from the estimation. Only counties located in the
Midwest, Great Plains, or South with consistent bank-level data published are included. The sample also
excludes locations with cities over 25,000 population, fewer than 250 farms, or fewer than 15,000 improved
farm acres. County-level controls include the logarithms of county population and manufacturing output per
person, the fraction of county population living in a city or town of 2,500 or more persons, the fractions of
county population that are non-white, illiterate, or 15 years of age or younger, the number of national banks in
the county at the beginning of the period, and the number of state banks in the county at the beginning of the
period. Regulation controls include the presence of Extended liability, deposit insurance, or minimum capital
above $10,000 for state banks. Robust standard errors clustered by county are presented in parentheses below
the coefficients. * denotes significance at 10%; ** at 5% level and *** at 1% levels.

Notes: The table presents the results of an OLS regression. The dependent variable is provided in the column heading. Each observation is a bank
and each bank is observed every two years. Only state-chartered financial institutions (i.e., commercial banks, trust companies, and savings banks)
are included in the regression. Only counties located in the Midwest, Great Plains, or South with consistent bank-level data published are included.
The sample also excludes locations with a city over 25,001 persons, fewer than 250 farms, or fewer than 15,001 improved farm acres. "Young
Bank" is an indicator variable for whether the bank was established in 1914 or later. County-level controls include the logarithms of county
population and manufacturing output per person, the fraction of county population living in a city or town of 2,500 or more persons, the fractions of
county population that are non-white, illiterate, or 15 years of age or younger, the number of national banks in the county, and the number of state
banks in the county. Regulation controls include the presence of Extended liability, deposit insurance, minimum capital above $10,001, and Fed
membership for state banks. Standard errors clustered by county are presented in parentheses below the coefficients. * denotes significance at 10%;
** at 5% level and *** at 1% levels.

Notes: The table presents the results of an OLS regression. The dependent variable is provided in the column heading. Each observation is a bank
and each bank is observed every two years. Only OCC-chartered financial institutions (i.e., national banks) are included in the regression. Only
counties located in the Midwest, Great Plains, or South with consistent bank-level data published are included. The sample also excludes
locations with a city over 25,001 persons, fewer than 250 farms, or fewer than 15,001 improved farm acres. "Young Bank" is an indicator
variable for whether the bank was established in 1914 or later. County-level controls include the logarithms of county population and
manufacturing output per person, the fraction of county population living in a city or town of 2,500 or more persons, the fractions of county
population that are non-white, illiterate, or 15 years of age or younger, the number of national banks in the county, and the number of state banks
in the county. Regulation controls include the presence of Extended liability, deposit insurance, for minimum capital above $10,001 for state
banks. Standard errors clustered by county are presented in parentheses below the coefficients. * denotes significance at 10%; ** at 5% level and
*** at 1% levels.

Notes: The table presents the marginal effects from a Probit regression. The dependent variable is an indicator variable for whether the bank closed before
1924. Each observation is a bank in 1920. The column headings denote which banks are included in the regressions. Only counties located in the
Midwest, Great Plains, or South with consistent bank-level data published are included. The sample also excludes locations with a city over 25,000
persons, fewer than 250 farms, or fewer than 15,000 improved farm acres. County-level controls include the logarithms of county population and
manufacturing output per person, the fraction of county population living in a city or town of 2,500 or more persons, the fractions of county population
that are non-white, illiterate, or 15 years of age or younger, the number of national banks in the county, the number of state banks in the county, the
logarithm of the county's size in square miles, average rainfall in the county, the standard deviation of rainfall in the county, distances to Mississippi
River, Atlantic Ocean, Great Lakes, and Pacific Ocean, and a set of Fed district fixed effects. Because of state fixed effects, tegulation controls include
deposit insurance and Fed membership for state banks. Robust standard errors clustered by county are presented in parentheses below the coefficients. *

     Notes: The table presents the results of a negative binomial model. The dependent
variable is the number of new banks entering the county in each year. Each observation is
 a county and each county is observed every two years. Counties with no bank entry over
   the period are dropped from the sample. Only counties located in the Midwest, Great
 Plains, or South with consistent bank-level data published are included. The sample also
  excludes locations with cities over 25,000 population, fewer than 250 farms, or fewer
than 15,000 improved farm acres. County-level controls include the logarithms of county
 population and manufacturing output per person, the fraction of county population living
in a city or town of 2,500 or more persons, the fractions of county population that are non-
white, illiterate, or 15 years of age or younger, the number of national banks in the county
      at the beginning of the period, and the number of state banks in the county at the

Notes: The table presents the results of a negative binomial model. The dependent variable is the number of new
banks entering the county in each year. The sample contains two observations per county: one for state bank entry
and one for national bank entry. Each observation is a county and each county is observed every two years.
Counties with no bank entry over the period are dropped from the sample. Only counties located in the Midwest,
Great Plains, or South with consistent bank-level data published are included. The sample also excludes locations
with cities over 25,000 population, fewer than 250 farms, or fewer than 15,000 improved farm acres. County-level
controls include the logarithms of county population and manufacturing output per person, the fraction of county
population living in a city or town of 2,500 or more persons, the fractions of county population that are non-white,
illiterate, or 15 years of age or younger, the number of national banks in the county at the beginning of the period,
and the number of state banks in the county at the beginning of the period. Regulation controls include the
presence of Extended liability, deposit insurance, or minimum capital above $10,000 for state banks. The Chi-
Squared Test Statistic jointly measures whether the differential effect of state bank interactions are significantly
different from zero. Robust standard errors clustered by county are presented in parentheses below the
coefficients. * denotes significance at 10%; ** at 5% level and *** at 1% levels.

Notes: The table presents the results of an Tobit regression. The dependent variable is the rate
of new banks entering the county in each year where the numerator is the number of entering
banks and the denominator is the number of banks at the beginning of the period. Each
observation is a county and each county is observed every two years. Only counties located in
the Midwest, Great Plains, or South with consistent bank-level data published are included.
The sample also excludes locations with cities over 25,000 population, fewer than 250 farms,

Notes: The table presents the results of an probit regression. The dependent variable is a
dummy variable for whether a bank entered the county during the specified period. Each
observation is a county and each county is observed every two years. Only counties located in
the Midwest, Great Plains, or South with consistent bank-level data published are included.
The sample also excludes locations with cities over 25,000 population, fewer than 250 farms,
or fewer than 15,000 improved farm acres. County-level controls include the logarithms of
county population and manufacturing output per person, the fraction of county population
living in a city or town of 2,500 or more persons, the fractions of county population that are
non-white, illiterate, or 15 years of age or younger, the number of national banks in the county
at the beginning of the period, and the number of state banks in the county at the beginning of
the period. Regulation controls include the presence of Extended liability, deposit insurance, or
minimum capital above $10,000 for state banks. Robust standard errors clustered by county are
presented in parentheses below the coefficients. * denotes significance at 10%; ** at 5% level
and *** at 1% levels.

Notes: The table presents the results of an OLS regression. The dependent variable is provided in the column heading.
Each observation is the change in the balance sheet item from 1914 to 1920. Only state-chartered financial institutions
(i.e., commercial banks, trust companies, and savings banks) are included in "State Banks" columns whereas only OCC-
chartered financial institutions (i.e., national banks) are included in the "National Banks" columns. Only counties located
in the Midwest, Great Plains, or South with consistent bank-level data published are included. The sample also excludes
locations with a city over 25,000 persons, fewer than 250 farms, or fewer than 15,000 improved farm acres. County-level
controls include the logarithms of county population and manufacturing output per person, the fraction of county
population living in a city or town of 2,500 or more persons, the fractions of county population that are non-white,
illiterate, or 15 years of age or younger, the number of national banks in the county, the number of state banks in the
county, and a set of Fed district fixed effects. Standard errors clustered by county are presented in parentheses below the
coefficients. * denotes significance at 10%; ** at 5% level and *** at 1% levels.

Notes: The table presents the results of a first-order autoregressive OLS regression. The dependent variable is provided in the column heading. Each
observation is a bank and each bank is observed every two years. Only state-chartered financial institutions (i.e., commercial banks, trust companies, and
savings banks) are included in the regression. Only counties located in the Midwest, Great Plains, or South with consistent bank-level data published are
included. The sample also excludes locations with a city over 25,000 persons, fewer than 250 farms, or fewer than 15,000 improved farm acres. "Young
Bank" is an indicator variable for whether the bank was established in 1914 or later. County-level controls include the logarithms of county population
and manufacturing output per person, the fraction of county population living in a city or town of 2,500 or more persons, the fractions of county
population that are non-white, illiterate, or 15 years of age or younger, the number of national banks in the county, and the number of state banks in the
county. Regulation controls include the presence of Extended liability, deposit insurance, minimum capital above $10,001, and Fed membership for state
banks. Standard errors clustered by county are presented in parentheses below the coefficients. * denotes significance at 10%; ** at 5% level and *** at
1% levels.

Notes: The table presents the results of an OLS regression. The dependent variable is provided in the column heading. Each observation is a bank
and each bank is observed every two years. Only state-chartered financial institutions (i.e., commercial banks, trust companies, and savings banks)
are included in the top panel whereas OCC-chartered financial institutions (i.e., national banks) are included in the bottom panel. All regressions
contain the lagged value of the logarthm of Assets. Only counties located in the Midwest, Great Plains, or South with consistent bank-level data
published are included. The sample also excludes locations with a city over 25,000 persons, fewer than 250 farms, or fewer than 15,000 improved
farm acres. "Young Bank" is an indicator variable for whether the bank was established in 1914 or later. County-level controls include the
logarithms of county population and manufacturing output per person, the fraction of county population living in a city or town of 2,500 or more
persons, the fractions of county population that are non-white, illiterate, or 15 years of age or younger, the number of national banks in the county,
and the number of state banks in the county. Regulation controls include the presence of Extended liability, deposit insurance, minimum capital
above $10,001, and Fed membership for state banks. Standard errors clustered by county are presented in parentheses below the coefficients. *
denotes significance at 10%; ** at 5% level and *** at 1% levels.

 Notes: The table presents the results of an OLS regression. The dependent variable is provided in the column heading. Each observation
   is a bank and each bank is observed every two years. The sample contains both state-chartered financial institutions (i.e., commercial
  banks, trust companies, and savings banks) and OCC-chartered financial institutions (i.e., national banks). "State Bank" is an indicator
 variable that denotes whether the bank was state-chartered. Only counties located in the Midwest, Great Plains, or South with consistent
   bank-level data published are included. The sample also excludes locations with a city over 25,000 persons, fewer than 250 farms, or
fewer than 15,000 improved farm acres. County-level controls include the logarithms of county population and manufacturing output per
person, the fraction of county population living in a city or town of 2,500 or more persons, the fractions of county population that are non-
 white, illiterate, or 15 years of age or younger, the number of national banks in the county, and the number of state banks in the county.
 Regulation controls include the presence of Extended liability, deposit insurance, minimum capital above $10,001, and Fed membership
  for state banks. The F-Test Statistic jointly measures whether the differential effect of state bank interactions are significantly different
 from zero. Standard errors clustered by county are presented in parentheses below the coefficients. * denotes significance at 10%; ** at
                                                        5% level and *** at 1% levels.

   Notes: The table presents the marginal effects from a Probit regression. The dependent variable is an indicator variable for whether the
  bank closed before 1924. Each observation is a bank in 1920. The column headings denote which banks are included in the regressions.
    Only counties located in the Midwest, Great Plains, or South with consistent bank-level data published are included. The sample also
excludes locations with a city over 25,000 persons, fewer than 250 farms, or fewer than 15,000 improved farm acres. County-level controls
 include the logarithms of county population and manufacturing output per person, the fraction of county population living in a city or town
   of 2,500 or more persons, the fractions of county population that are non-white, illiterate, or 15 years of age or younger, the number of
 national banks in the county, the number of state banks in the county, the logarithm of the county's size in square miles, average rainfall in
the county, the standard deviation of rainfall in the county, distances to Mississippi River, Atlantic Ocean, Great Lakes, and Pacific Ocean,
 and a set of Fed district fixed effects. Because of state fixed effects, tegulation controls include deposit insurance and Fed membership for
  state banks. The F-Test Statistic jointly measures whether the differential effect of state bank interactions are significantly different from
 zero. Robust standard errors clustered by county are presented in parentheses below the coefficients. * denotes significance at 10%; ** at
                                                          5% level and *** at 1% levels.

Notes: The table presents the results of an OLS regression. The dependent variable is the percentage
change in farmland value per acre 1920-25. Each observation is a county. Only counties located in the
Midwest, Great Plains, or South with consistent bank-level data published are included. The sample also
excludes locations with a city over 25,000, fewer than 250 farms, or fewer than 15,000 improved
farming acres. The "Predicted Number" of closures is obtained by estimating each bank's probability of
closure from columns (2) and (6) of Table 4 and counting the number of banks with a probability of
closure higher than the specified cutoff value. County-level controls include the logarithms of county
population and manufacturing output per person, the fraction of county population living in a city or
town of 2,500 or more persons, the fractions of county population that are non-white, illiterate, or 15
years of age or younger, the number of national banks in the county, the number of state banks in the
county, the logarithm of the county's size in square miles, average rainfall in the county, the standard
deviation of rainfall in the county, distances to Mississippi River, Atlantic Ocean, Great Lakes, and
Pacific Ocean, the percentage of unimproved land in the county, and a set of Fed district fixed effects.
Robust standard errors are presented in parentheses below the coefficients. * denotes significance at
10%; ** at 5% level and *** at 1% levels.
