                                          ABSTRACT
     This paper      extends    the spatial       theory of     voting       to an    institutional

structure in which policy choices are a function of the composition of the

legislature and of the executive.               In an insti tutional setup in which the

policy outcome depends upon relative plurality, each voter has incentives to

be strategic since the outcome depends upon how everybody else votes.                                  By

applying    to    this game    between voters         the   refinements      of    Strong Nash        and

Coalition Proof Nash we prove existence of equilibria with properties which

appear   intuitive and realistic.           In fact,        the model       has   several    testable

implications which seem         consistent with some           observed patterns            of    voting

behavior in the United States and perhaps in other democracies in which the

executive    is    directly    elected.         For    instance,      the    model    predicts:        a)

split-ticket voting;      b) for some parameter values,               a split government with

different    parties    controlling       the     executive     and     the       majority       of   the

legislature; and c) the mid-term electoral cycle.
