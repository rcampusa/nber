      Keynesian, New Keynesian, and New Classical Economics

                               ABSTRACT

     Much of the new theory of macro—economics that has been
built upon micro—economic models of imperfect information leads
to conclusions which are surprisingly close in spirit to Keynes'

original analysis.    This paper summarizes the macro—economic
implications of information—based models of efficiency wages,
credit—rationing and the breakdown of financial markets for
equity—type securities.      It shows how these models lead to
behavior by firms and interactions among economic agents that
account for many of the phenomena identified by Keynes in
qualitative terms which were        largely     lost    in subsequent
formalizations   of   the    Keynesian model.          These imperfect
information   macro—models      provide   consistent       theoretical

explanations in the Keynesian spirit in unemployment, investment
concentrated business cycles, rigid prices and the effectiveness

of monetary and fiscal policy interventions. In doing so, they
reconcile macro and micro—economic analysis in a way that has so
far been achieved neither by the traditional Keynesians, who
assumed away the micro—dimension of the problem, nor by the new
classical economists who assumed away the macro—dimension of the

problem.

      Keynesian, New Keynesian, and New Classical Economics
                B. Greenwald and J. E. Stiglitz1

     For more than two centuries, there have been two opposing
views of the capitalist economy.      One, which usually attributes
its origins to Adam Smith, emphasizes the efficiency of the
market economy, the ability of the price system to transmit vital
information from producers to consumers, and vice versa, and to
coordinate allocation decisions, in a manner far beyond the
capacity of any central planner.          The other has focused its

concern on the shortcomings of capitalism, particularly on the
periodic episodes of massive unemployment of capital and labor.
Surely, adherents of this view claim, these cannot be the
manifestations of an efficient economic system.


     To the classical believers of the efficiency of market
economies, these    episodes   were     viewed    as disequilibrium

situations, temporary     aberations of an otherwise efficient
economy; market forces,   if left to themselves, would quickly
restore equilibrium.      Their modern day descendants, the New
Classical Economists, have gone one step further:     they deny the
very existence of a problem; the massive changes in employment
levels may best be interpreted, in their view, as a rational
response to changing relative prices (workers chose to take more

leisure in 1932, because of the low relative wage).              The

unemployment of capital was no more serious than the fact that
the spare tire of a car is, for the most part, unused: the extra
capacity is held for those few times when it is really needed.


     To Keynes' and his modern day followers, these views are not
just absurd: they make a mockery of the "scientific method"
which their adherents claim to follow.      Worse still, they are

irresponsible:   to the extent that governments follow the non-
interventionist policies often advocated, they not only condemn
those individuals who cannot obtain gainful employment to the
economic deprivation which results, but they also condemn the
society which condones this unemployment to a host of social and
economic consequences which follow from that unemployment.


     One of Keynes' great contributions was,          in effect, a
reconciliation of the two opposing views of capitalism:      rather

than denying either the existence of the unemployment problem or
its importance, he confronted it head on, argued that limited
government intervention could correct this malady, and with this
one malady corrected, the economy would once again operate in an
efficient manner:     the classical view would then be restored.
Samuelson dubbed this, the Neo—classical synthesis.



     The very reasons for the success of Keynes' approach
provided the basis for the eventual disillusionment which set in
3

so strongly, at least     in the United States, over the past two
decades. Keynes had attempted to retain as much of the classical

(neo—classical) apparatus as he could;     the standard model was
changed in minimal ways, with dramatic consequences.        The neo-

classical synthesis,     as attractive ideologically as it was for
those who believed in the market system, yet were disturbed by
massive unemployment, was taken as an article of faith, not
derived from any general theoretical structure: the fundamental
question of why the failures of the market economy should only
occur in the massive doses we associate with its periodic
recessions and depressions was never asked,      let alone answered.

Was it not more plausible that the Great Depression was but the
worse manifestation of a set of inefficiencies which, while
pervasive, were far harder to detect or prove?


     The schizophrenia to which Keynesian economics gave rise was

reflected in the way that economics was taught:      micro—economic
courses, in which students were introduced to Adam Smith's
invisible hand and the fundamental theorems of welfare economics,

were followed by macro—economic courses, focusing on the failures
of the market economy and the role of the government in
correcting them.        Two sub—disciplines developed, with micro—
economists looking down upon the (lack of) rigor of the macro—
economists, and denigrating the lack of theoretical foundations,

while macro—economists castigated       micro—economists    for the
obvious inappropriateness of their theories.
4

       Dissatisfaction with Keynesian economics was based not only
on this schizophrenia, but also on the lack of justification for

some of the central assumptions, e.g. wage and price rigidities.

Wages and prices were not rigid.    If they did not fall enough,
why didn't they? Why didn't firms who wanted to sell more simply
lower their prices? A quarter of a century of research failed to

provide convincing answers to these questions.2        This state of
affairs could not continue for long.           An      attempt at a
reconciliation between the two seemed inevitable.



       There were,   broadly speaking, two ways by which the
alternative approaches could be reconciled:         to adapt macro—
theory to micro—theory, or the converse.            The New Classical

Economics took the first approach. It argued that what was wrong

with     macro—economics   was   its absence of rigorous micro—
foundations. Its advocates set out on an ambitious research
program, entailing deriving the dynamic, aggregative behavior of
the economy from the basic principles of rational, maximizing


     2These were not the only objections to Keynesian theory, the
only sources of dissatisfaction. Historically, the inability to
cope with the simultaneous outbreak of inflation and unemployment
in the early seventies may have played as critical a role as the
more theoretical problems with which we have been concerned here.
The growth of monetarism during this period may, similarly, be
more due to its      ability   to   provide   simple   and clear
prescriptions, than to its ability to remedy the theoretical
deficiencies in Keynesian analysis.
       Theorists were concerned, of course, not only by its
incompleteness and its inconsistency with traditional micro—
economic analysis, but also by its internal inconsistencies, e.g.
its inconsistent expectational assumptions.
5

firms and individuals.      The School recognized the importance of
dynamics for understanding macro-behavior, and it.     recognized the
central role of expectations in determining dynamic behavior.      It

focused its attention,   then, on the consequences of rational
expectations formation, and it is this aspect of their work which
has given the School its alternative name.



     The name, "Rational Expectations"       school is, however,
misleading:     the central doctrines of the approach derive not
from its belief in rational expectations, however plausible or
implausible that assumption might be; but rather from its old
classical assumptions of market clearing.            And with those
assumptions, the conclusion that there is no unemployment, and
the irrelevance of government macro—policy,3     follow as trivial

consequences.    These conclusions,    it should be noted, would
follow were participants in the market far less rational than
postulated by the theory.


     The other approach sees unemployment, credit rationing,
business cycles as real economic problems, phenomena which cannot
be reconciled with the standard micro—theory, and therefore seeks


     3lndeed, Neary and Stiglitz (1983) have shown that with
rational expectations and price rigidities, government policy is
even more effective than with myopic expectations: multipliers
are even larger.    In the New Classical models, macro—policy is
irrelevant because it is unneeded.    Even with full employment
assumed, government policies will, in general, have real effects,
e.g., on capital accumulation. See Stiglitz (1981, 1983).
6

as its objective the development of a micro-theory which can
explain these phenomena.        For want of a better term, I shall
refer to this as the New Keynesian Economics. Work in this area
has centered on understanding the consequences of imperfect
information and incomplete markets, both for micro—economics and
for macro—economics.   Like the New Classical Economics, it seeks

a single theory, but unlike the New Classical Economics, it seeks
to explain unemployment, rather than to deny its existence. And
unemployment is shown to be just one manifestation of a much
wider set of market failures.



     This paper attempts to present the broad outlines of the New
Keynesian economics, and to show in what ways it is similar to
traditional Keynesian economics, and in what ways it differs.
Keynes had a vision of how the economy worked that was markedly
different from    that of the standard neo—classical theory.
Decisions by firms were not based on rational calculations.
Keynes used picturesque language to describe the behavior of
entrepreneurs: they were moved by "animal spirits."       But when
Keynes came down to write a simple model, he resorted to more
traditional modes of thinking, and these aspects were reinforced

in the subsequent developments (e.g. by Hicks.)          It is our

contention that Keynes' problems arose from his inability to
break away from his neo—classical training, that his vision,
captured so well in many of his brilliantly written passages,
provides greater insight into understanding unemployment and
business cycles than does the formal Keynesian model.
8

                  Some Key Keynesian Insights


     There are four insights of Keynes that we think of as
essential in constructing a model of unemployment and business
fluctuations:



1.    A general theory    must   explain   the   persistence of
unemployment, as well as the cyclicity in certain key economic
variables. To explain the persistent of unemployment, one has to
develop a theory of the labor market. Keynes resorted, at this
juncture, to    the assumption   of wage    (real or nominal?)
rigidities, an assumption which has been made the center of the
fixed price school, but has been attacked by critics of Keynesian
theory both on empirical grounds——wages, after all, fell by a
third in the Great Depression, and countries facing inflation,
with presumably some scope for changes in real wage, have faced
unemployment just as countries in which wages and prices have
fallen——and on theoretical grounds——no explanation for wage
rigidities, other than ad hoc institutional considerations is

provided.


     What is required, however, for the Keynesian conclusions is
not absolutely rigid wages, but only that wages do not fall to
market clearing levels.4 The recently developed efficiency wage

     4An alternative approach to that discussed here is that
though wages fall, prices fall, and at approximately the same
rate. Thus real wages do not fall. (This is the approach taken
9

theories5 provide such an explanation.        It   is based on the
hypothesis that there is imperfect information about the charact—
erjstjcs of workers; that the actions of workers cannot be
monitored; and that il is not possible to write contracts that
ensure that the worker bears all the consequences of his actions.

 As a result, the quality of the labor force, its productivity
(and hence the firm's profits) may increase with the wage paid.
Similarly, labor turnover may decrease with an increase in the
wage, and since the firm must bear some part of the turnover
costs, again profits may increase with an increase in wages, up
to some point.   In the face of unemployment, wages may not fall,
for firms will recognize that if they lower wages, productivity

will decrease, turnover may increase, and profits will fall.   In

this perspective, firms are competitive; there are many firms in

by Solow—Stiglitz (1968)).
     Though the falling wages and prices y give rise to an
increase in the demand for consumer goods——the Pigou—Patinkin
effect (in the absence of Barro—Ricardo considerations), there is
little doubt that in the short run, in the length of time for
which Keynesian analysis is appropriate, this effect is not of
quantitative significance.
     One should note that in many macro—economic models, real
balance effects play a crucial, if slightly surreptitious, role.
Thus, in the fixed price model, unemployment is attributed to too
high a level of wages and prices; if wages and prices fell
(keeping real wages, say, constant) employment would increase;
but this is only because of an assumed important real balance
effect.  One should also note that in the short run, even if
there were real balance effects of the kind noted by Pigou and
Patinkin, these effects might be outweighed, in the short run, by
dynamic, intertemporal substitution effects; if prices fall, and
consumers come to believe that they will fall further, this may
reduce their current demand for consumption.        See Neary and
Stiglitz (1983) or Grandmont.

the market.; but nonetheless firms are wage setters, at least
within a range.      If the Wairasian wage, where the demand for

labor equals the supply, is too low, any firm has the option of
raising its wage and thus increasing its profits. The efficiency
wage, the wage that maximizes the firm's profits, may of course
vary with economic circumstances; hence the wage is not absolute—
iy rigid. But wages need not fa1l to market clearing levels. 6


     An objection to this theory—--as well as to standard Keynesi-

an theory——is that the presence of wage rigidities in some
sector(s) of the economy        is   not   sufficient    to explain
unemployment.7    So long as there is some sector with flexible
wages, any individual who chooses not          to work     there is
voluntarily unemployed.     We view this to be largely a semantic
objection: the fact is that individuals who are observationally

indistinguishable from      the unemployed individual are being
employed at higher wages; that the          market equilibrium is
inefficient; and that resources which could be productively
employed remain idle.       (Elsewhere, (Greenwald—Stiglitz (1986b))

     6Thus, the policy implications of these theories may be
markedly different from those of the standard fixed wage—price
models.   The latter assume that economic policy has no effect on
the wages paid.     The efficiency wage models recognize that
certain policies (e.g. unemployment compensation) may have strong
effects on equilibrium wages, and the consequences of this need
to be taken into account.

     7This is, of course, not the only objection to efficiency
wage theory.     For a more extended discussion, see Stiglitz
(1986b).
11

we have discussed at length a variety of reasons why it may be
rational for an individual not to accept a low wage currently, if
he believes that a better paying job, will becoming available in
the near future; these have to do with    asymmetric information,
with the information conveyed by the individual's willingness to
accept a low wage job, as well as with the fact that once an
individual is employed, he becomes "used labor" with adverse
effects on future wages similar to those which          arise in
Akerlof's lemons model. We have also discussed the reasons why a
worker might not be willing to accept a        low wage from an
employer, with a promise of a future higher wage if the firm
survives, because to do so would, in effect, make the worker take
an equity position in the firm; see below for a discussion of why
individuals would not wish to do so.)


2.   A macro—economic theory must not only explain the persisten-
ce of unemployment, but also its fluctuations. This is not as
easy a task as it might seem. There are two problems.
     First, what are the sources of shocks to the economy which
give rise to such large perturbations in economic activity?8 It
is difficult to find shocks that are external to the economic

system, though occasionally    such shocks——such as wars and the




     8The problem is not that there are not shocks, but the
magnitude of the shocks, and their correlations across sectors.
12

rise in oil prices9 ——do occur. And if there are not exogenous
shocks, what are the internal mechanisms which lead to such
variations in economic activity?'0         There is considerable
evidence that much of the fluctuations are due to variations in
the demand for investment, and in particular for inventories.
But in theory, with concave production functions, with the shadow
price of labor being low in recessions, with low real interest
rates, there should be production smoothing:   inventories should
serve to dampen economic fluctuations; they should not serve to
exacerbate them.''



     Keynes was correct in stressing the importance of investment
for understanding economic fluctuations. To explain fluctuations
in investment, he had to rely on animal spirits, on unexplained

changes   in   expectations.      The expectational assumptions

     9But even this should be viewed as endogenous: no change in
demand or supply occurred, though the formation of a cartel can
be viewed, from this perspective, as an exogenous shock to the
system.
     '°The belief that the capitalist economic system could not
internally be flawed to the extent that it gave rise endogenously
to fluctuations provides much of the motivation for the search
for an external culprit, usually identified as the "government"
or "monetary authorities."
     ''There are other stabilizers in the economy which we have
not discussed. Savings serves to stabilize consumption.
     In the absence of adequate savings, the insurance provided
by implicit contracts serves to stabilize incomes, and thus to
stabilize consumption.   Thus, implicit contracts, rather than
exacerbating business fluctuations, may actually serve to reduce
them. (For a more extensive discussion of this paper, see
Stiglitz (1986).)
13

underlying Keynes' analysis may be no worse than those underlying
the rational expectations school.          Yet, there is something
disquieting about relying so completely on the inexplicable or
the irrational for a theory of business cycles.'2


     The second problem in explaining fluctuations           is the
following:       in the typical micro—economic model, changes in
prices (interest rates, wages) serve to dampen any disturbance to
demand or supply, just as we argued earlier that inventories
should stabilize the economy. Thus even large exogenous changes
(changes in demand curves or supply curves) may result in small

changes in equilibrium values.
     Keynes had to explain not only why the demand for investment


     l2Old style macro—economists explained these investment
fluctuations by reference to accelerators.         These accelerator
models implicitly were based on firms extrapolating current
levels of output into the future; that is, they were based on
irrational expectations.     These models may be descriptively
accurate, more    descriptively   accurate  than  the rational
expectations models; the question which we have posed for
ourselves is, however, can one explain the fluctuations in
investment without recourse to such irrational expectations.
     LaRoque has   recently put   forward a rather different
explanation for inventory behavior.    He postulates rational
expectations, but non—market clearing. He argues the inventories
are held for speculative purposes, and assumes that speculators
have some priority over others in the event of an excess supply
of goods. He shows then that this can give rise to inventory
cycles.      We suspect that if one looked carefully at shadow wages
during recessionary periods, and asked whether, given those
shadow wages, would it have paid firms to invest in inventories,
were they store the goods until a period of high demand, taking
into account market rates of interest, the answer would be yes,
and indeed the profits from doing so would have exceeded the
speculative profits accruing during periods in which inventories
were actually accumulated.
14

curve shifted, but also why changes in the interest rate could
not offset the direct effects.         While his explanation of the

source of the shift in the demand for investment may have been
incomplete, his explanation for why interest rate changes could
not offset these effects was unpersuasive.13 In his theory, the
reduction in the demand for investment should have lead to a fall

in the real interest rate; yet during the recession real interest

rates rose.       And businessmen argued that interest rates had
little effect on their investment decisions.

     Similarly, he failed to provide an explanation for why wages
did not change:    he simply asserted that they did not.

     The efficiency wage theory explains why wages may not fall
to market clearing levels.      A similar theory of the capital


     '3The liquidity trap theory was designed to explain a floor
on the nominal interest rate.   But so long as money cannot be
made to be negative—interest bearing, similar results would
follow simply from the non—negativity of nominal interest.     What
is relevant for investment should, ostensibly, be the real
interest rate. And the floor on nominal interest rates, combined
with deflationary    pressures of a recession, give rise to
increases in real interest rate. But the price rigidities, which
seem at the cornerstone of modern interpretations of Keynesian
analysis, would imply a fall in real interest rates in a
recession.    As we have already noted, prices did fall, real
interest rates did rise, but only to a limited extent.
     In more recent recessions, however, prices have been rising,
sometimes at a sufficient rate to make real interest rates
negative (and after tax real interest rates very negative).
These decreases in the real interest rate were not sufficient to
restore investment. (This is not surprising; firms traditionally
require twenty to thirty percent expected returns to undertake an
investment project. A change in the real interest rate from 2?
to l is little more than rounding error.) In the end, it is the
interest inelasticity of investment which appears to be crucial;
that is,  no plausible changes in real interest rates suffice to
restore investment. Below, we provide an explanation for this.
15

market shows why interest rates may not fall (See Stiglitz—Weiss,

1981,1983, 1985).       More generally, Akerlof and Yellen have
pointed out that even when firms should change the wages they pay
they may not do so; they show that the loss of profits from this
near—rational behavior may be small, even though the loss to
society may be large.       Indeed,   if firms are risk averse (as we

argue below they will be), and if there is some uncertainty about

the consequences of wage changes, keeping wages unchanged in the
face of certain disturbances is fully—rational.         (Again, similar

arguments hold for the capital market.)
     Moreover, the efficiency wage models further show why the
wages of firms are interdependent: the optimal wage for firm i
depends on      the wages    paid by     all other      firms.     This

interdependence may lead to multiple equilibria, in which no firm
changes its wage even in the face of changes in its demand.'4

     Thus,     by   explaining    wage, interest rate, and price
rigidities, these theories        help   to   explain     why certain
disturbances are multiplied by the economic system rather than
dampened. 15

     In the theory we present below, there is a further set of

     '4Again similar arguments hold for the capital market and
the product market. See, for instance, Stiglitz (1986c).
     '5Macro—economists, at least since Kahn's basic article,
have emphasized the role of multipliers, without recognizing how
inconsistent they are with standard micro—analysis. The critical
difference between economies which amplify disturbances and those
which dampen them seem to be price rigidities; our analyusis
exxplains these rigidities, and by doing so, puts the multiplier
on sound theoretical grounds.
16

reasons for the "multiplication" of disturbances.           In the
presence of incomplete markets and imperfect information, the
actions of one firm or individual exert externality—like effects
on others; the reduction of production by one firm, in response
to increased uncertainty or a reduction in its working capital,
increases the uncertainty and reduces the working capital of
other firms.         While   price   adjustments   tend   to dampen
disturbances, externality effects may (and in these instances do)

exacerbate them.16

3.      Keynes was correct in stressing the importance of the
dichotomy between       savings and investment.      In effect, he
recognized that funds within the firm were different from funds
in the household sector. Though he sensed the importance of this
distinction, when he came to write down his model, he wrote down
the standard neo—classical model, in which that distinction plays

no role.      The demand for investment was determined by the
interest rate. There was, for instance, no credit rationing.


        This was all the more surprising, given his (implicit,
sometimes explicit) general recognition of the importance of
capital market imperfections.         Individuals' consumption was

     '6There are other stabilizers in the economy which we have
not discussed. Savings serves to stabilize consumption.
     In the absence of adequate savings, the insurance provided
by implicit contracts serves to stabilize incomes, and thus to
stabilize consumption.     Thus, implicit contracts, rather than
exacerbating business fluctuations, may actually serve to reduce
them.      (For a more extensive discussion of this paper, see
Stiglitz (1986).)
17

related to their current income, partly perhaps because current
income was a good forecast of future income, but partly because
of the lack of access to funds.          This failure to recognize
sufficiently the importance of capital market imperfections, and
the consequences which follow from that,      turns out to be his
most important error.



4.    Keynes needed, as we said, to find a source of fluctuations
in economic activity.          It was   apparent that   changes in
technology, in supply, could not account for what was occurring
in the Great Depression.         He therefore naturally turned to
changes in demand. Good economists brought up in the Marshallian
tradition had been taught to separate out disturbances to a
market into demand and supply disturbances.
     Keynes was correct in focusing on demand disturbances, but
his reliance on the Marshallian demand/supply framework posed
problems which he, and his followers, never satisfactorily
resolved. For the Marshallian theory suggested that equilibrium
ought to be at the intersection of demand and supply; if firms
were on their supply curve, real product wages should rise as
employment falls.       This     was one of the first empirical
propositions of Keynesian economics to fall by the way—side. But
just as Marxian economics was never abandoned by its proponents,
simply because its predictions turned out to be false, so too
Keynesian economics was not to be abandoned simply because one of
its important empirical predictions turned out to be wrong. As
18

always in economics, there are three ways of dealing with
uncomfortable facts:   (a)   to deny them, e.g. by asserting that
wages and prices are measured incorrectly (just as the New
Classical economists approach the unemployment problem by denying
the relevance of the unemployment statistics); (b) to provide a
new interpretation, e.g. by asserting what is relevant is not the

spot wage, because of the existence of long term (implicit
contracts), ignoring the fact that real product wages of newly
hired workers or workers on spot contracts also did not rise
significantly; (c) to assert that the empirical proposition was
not central to the theory. Thus, a large literature developed,

asserting   that   firms,    while    solving   quite   complicated
intertemporal maximization problems, acted as if the price and
quantities they faced were fixed.17    It was simply asserted that
firms did not use price policy to affect sales, an implausible
and counterfactual assumption.18



     '7This literature dates     back   to   the   sixties, with
contributions by Hansen (1951), Solow—Stiglitz (1967), and Barro—
Grossman (1971).     The subsequent fixed—price literature is
enormous.


     '8Models which    postulate imperfectly competitive firms
explain why real wages may not equal the value of the marginal
product; but    they have    little to   say about involuntary
unemployment or its fluctuations. (Indeed, in contrast to models
with classical unemployment, with real wages in excess of the
value of the marginal product, here real wages are less than the
value of the marginal product; whether employment is higher or
lower in equilibrium simply depends on the (uncompensated) labor
supply elasticities.)     Below, we provide an explanation for
cyclical variability in mark—ups. See also Stiglitz (1984).

                    The New Keynesian Economics



      The New Keynesian Economics begins with Keynes' basic
insights, but recognizes Keynes' excessive dependence on a
neoclassical framework, and his failure to fully recognize the
consequences of capital market imperfections, imperfections which
can be explained in terms of the costs of information.


      The major ingredients of this new perspective are the
following:



1.    The efficiency wage model, which explains why wages, while
not rigid, do not fall to market clearing levels (see above).


2.    Capital market     imperfections, derived   from imperfect
information.    There are asymmetries of information between
managers of firms and potential investors, asymmetries which can
give rise to what we shall call "equity rationing." Equity
rationing is important because it implies that if firms wish to
obtain more capital, to invest or to increase production, they
must borrow the funds; and even if they are able to do so, they
must expose themselves to considerable risk, including the risk
of bankruptcy, i.e. the risk of not being able to pay back the

promised amounts.


     The consequences of this are exacerbated by the absence of
20

futures markets.'9 Thus, firms cannot sell the goods which they
plan to produce until after they have produced them.2° Every
production decision is a risk decision, a risk which they (the
managers and equity holders) must bear, and which they cannot
easily shift on to others.     The absence of futures markets
implies that firms cannot sell their output at the time of
production.


     Thus, an analysis of firm behavior must focus on its
willingness to undertake these risks. Unexpected changes in its
working capital base (caused for instance by unexpected changes
in the prices at which it can sell its goods) could, for
instance, have a deleterious effect on its willingness to
produce.



3.   While at times this limits the amount that firms are willing

to produce, at other times, firms' access to capital is limited;

     l9Keynes did not explicitly comment on this, perhaps because
to him the absence was so obvious not to require comment. To
those brought up in the Arrow—Debrue framework, it has become a
ritual to attempt to identify in what ways the proposed model
differs from that paradigm
     20There are, of course, industries in which goods are
produced only on order.     This is particularly true of some
investment goods manufacturing industries.    Then, variations in
the level of production must be traced back to variations in the
demands which they face; and these are related to the willingness
of other producers to invest (produce.)         Thus, the supply
responses of some firms are reflected in demands facing other
firms.  This is another reason why the simple Keynesian dichotomy
into demand or supply disturbances may be somewhat misleading.
21

there is credit rationing. The reasons that suppliers of capital
do not raise interest rates in the presence of an excess demand
for capital are analogous to the reasons that firms do not lower
wages in the presence of an excess supply of labor:     increasing
interest rates may lower the expected return to the supplier of
capital, either because of selection effects          (the mix of
applicants changes adversely) or because of incentive effects
(borrowers are induced to undertake riskier actions.)


4. Monetary policy exerts its influence——when it does——not so
much through      the willingness of individuals to hold cash
balances, but through the availability of credit. Asymmetries of
information imply that if banks decide to lend less, there are
not other potential lenders who are perfect substitutes.    Banks'

decisions to lend are analogous to those determining firms'
willingness to produce.      The monetary authorities can take
actions which affect banks' willingness to lend (or the terms
under which they are willing to lend.) Though, depending on the
economic    circumstances,   other     lenders may take partially
offsetting actions, their actions can never be fully offsetting.

      The New Keynesian Economics provides a general theory of the

economy, derived     from micro—economic     principles (and thus
integrates the two sub—disciplines.)    It succeeds both in filling

the lacunae in traditional Keynesian theory (e.g. by explaining
partial wage rigidities, rather than simply assuming rigid wages)
and   resolving    the   paradoxes and inconsistencies of more
22


traditional   Keynesian theory (both the internal inconsistencies,

e.g.   concerning     how   expectations   are     formed,   and the
inconsistencies between its predictions and observations.)        It

provides an     explanation both for an equilibrium level of
unemployment (through the efficiency wage theories) and for
business fluctuations.2'    The theory of business fluctuations it

provides is simple:    in broad outline, certain shocks to the
economy affect the stock of working capital of firms. Even if
firms had perfect access to the credit markets (that is, they
could borrow as much as they wished, at the actuarially fair
interest rate), the amount they would be willing to borrow is
limited by their willingness to bear risk; the fixed commitments
associated with loan contracts imply that, as the working capital
which is available is reduced, the risk (bankruptcy probability)
associated with any level of borrowing increases. Thus, if their

working capital is reduced, their desired production level (given
that they do not have fixed commitments to sell their products22)
is reduced; and it takes a number of periods before the levels of

     21This is not to say that there are not important gaps in
the theory which remain.    The theory developed so far does not
provide an entirely endogenous business cyle; it only explains
how the economy responds to certain shocks.
     There remains    a controversy over whether an entirely
endogenous business cycle theory is required, or whether one
should be content with a theory which translates certain kinds of
shocks into disturbances in which the economy persists below
"full employment" for a number of periods.  We do not take a
position on that issue here.

     22Even if they have commitments, potential purchasers may
not honor those commitments, particularly in the event of their
bankruptcy.    In recessions, the risk           associated with any
"commitment" is increased.
23

working capital are restored to normal. The theory provides an
explanation not only for why aggregate shocks (like an unexpected
decrease in the price level, resulting from a monetary shock)
have an aggregative effect on the economy, but also why sectoral
shocks (like an unexpected shift in demand, or the unexpected
formation of an oil cartel) would have aggregative effects:
willingness to produce will, in general, be a concave function of
working capital, and hence a redistribution of working capital
will have aggregative effects.23

     In the discussion below, we shall show how this theory
provides an explanation for several of the phenomena which seemed
so hard for more traditional Keynesian theory to explain:   (a) it
explains why firms do not lower prices in recessions, i.e. it
explains cyclical movements in mark—ups;      (b)   it provides an
explanation of cyclical behavior of investment and inventories;
(c) it provides an explanation for why unemployed workers do not
succeed in getting hired by offering to work for lower wages, and

even in industries where efficiency wage considerations are not
important, it provides a partial explanation for why workers do

     23These redistribution effects seem to be more important
than the redistribution effects, e.g. sometimes postulated with
government debt policy (the change in the maturity structure of
the debt having either an intertemporal or an intrateinporal
redistribution effect) or with some forms of insurance.
     The redistribution resulting from insurance associated with
implicit labor contracts, a redistribution from the corporate to
the household sector, operates essentially through the mechanism
described above. In the presence of perfect capital markets, the
only effects arising from that redistribution would be those
associated with differing marginal   propensities to consume
between capitalists and workers.
24

not offer to work for lower wages, in return for the promise of
higher wages in the future; and (d) it provides an explanation
for why an unanticipated wage—price reduction might actually
serve to exacerbate the recession, rather than alleviate it (by
further deteriorating the working capita1 base of firms).
25

                         Keynes' Errors



     We have argued that Keynes' basic error was an excessive
reliance,   in    his    formal    modelling,      on    the   neo—

classical/Marshalijan tools which then, as now, were the style of
the day. The verbal stories which accompany the model captured
far more of his insights into what was going on.24        it may be
useful at this juncture to review what are,     in our perspective,

his fundamental errors, and to suggest how our theory corrects
these errors.    His most important errors lie,   in our judgment,
in his theory of the firm and in his explanation of the role of
money in determining the level of economic activity.       Both of
these can be related to his failure to understand fully the
nature of capital markets.

1. Keynes failed to recognize the importance of the distinction
between long term bonds and equities. He lumped the two together
as long term assets. Even in the absence of bankruptcy, the two
differ in their risk properties, with bonds rising in value in
recessions, equities falling.      The two securities are thus
complements, rather than substitutes, in individual's portfolios.
 For our purposes, however, this distinction is not as important
as the differences in the nature of the firms' commitment: with
bonds and loans, the firm is committed to paying back a certain

     24 He should not be judged too harshly: as we have said,
presumably he wished to make his ideas as palatable as he could
to his contemporaries, and to do this, he had to show that by
altering only a few of the basic assumptions of the standard
model, one could obtain dramatically different results.
26

amount on a particular date; with equities, no such commitment
exists. As a result, for firms as well as investors, these two
securities are far from perfect substitutes. Particularly in
recessionary periods, firms seldom resort to the equity market to

raise needed capital: investors suspect that any firm wishing to
do so is in bad straits, unable to obtain capital from banks or
other sources.     Elsewhere, we (Greenwald, Stiglitz, and Weiss
(1984)) have provided a simple adverse selection model (again, a
variant of the standard adverse selection model) showing that
only the worse firms will in fact resort to the equity market to

raise capital.



2.   Keynes' attempt to explain economic fluctuations in terms of

demand considerations alone not only posed the quandry we have
referred to before——why don't firms use price policy to increase
their sales——but posed another problem:   how could a small open
economy ever face Keynesian unemployment problems? Simply by
changing its exchange rate,   it could face unlimited demand for

its products.


     In our theory, there is not a clean distinction between
demand and supply. Firms would be willing to produce more, if
they could have an assured demand. In this sense, demand is
limiting production. Firms are not willing to produce more,
given the risks associated with production in the absence of an
assured demand.   In this sense, firms are on their supply curve.
27

     Our theory thus explains why the amount of goods firms are

willing to supply at any expected real product wage may change
over the business cycle.

     Our theory can also explain why firms, in setting their
prices, might attempt to have a higher mark-up over costs in
recessionary periods.      In markets with imperfect competition and
imperfect information, firms must recruit customers. They do so

partially by using price policies. They thus face a trade—off,
lower prices today leading to higher future sales, higher future
profits, but lower current profits.          The price they choose
depends on the implicit cost of capital (not the market rate of
interest), and in the presence of equity rationing, this may be

higher in recessionary periods.
3. Keynes argued that the primary determinant of the level of
investment, given a set of expectations, was the interest rate.
Though there has always been some ambiguity about whether this is

the real or nominal interest rate, the only sense that modern day
economists can make of this is that it must have been the real
interest rate.   But real market interest rates have fluctuated

relatively little (until the 80s).      A good theory should never
take a constant (or an almost constant) as an explanatory
variable.

     In our theory, credit availability at certain times is the
major determinant of the level of investment.    It is precisely at

those times that monetary policy can affect the level of economic

activity.
28

     In recessionary periods, however, banks may be willing to
lend to any "good" prospect at the going interest rate, but there
is a shortage of willing borrowers.          In such circumstances,

monetary policy is likely to be ineffective.

     The Keynesian—neoclassical theory simply cannot explain
inventory fluctuations, the fact that inventories serve to
exacerbate rather than to dampen fluctuations.    Our theory can.
Again, the increase in the effective cost of capital——the result
of equity rationing and the decrease in the supply of working

capital——implies     that    firms   will wish to decrease their
inventories in recessionary periods.
4. The mechanism by which the monetary authorities affected the
level of economic activity in Keynesian analysis is implausible.
There are three steps:      (a) the government takes actions which
affect the money supply; (b) given individuals' demand functions
for money (a function presumably of interest rates and income),
interest rates change; (c) as a result of interest rate changes,

investment changes.25
     There are problems with each of the steps:           while the



     25This is obviously an oversimplification. In some variants
of the theory, the demand for money depends only on income, and
hence, given rigid prices, a decrease in the supply of money must
be accompanied by a decrease in income.   No plausible mechanisms
by which this is effected have been put forward.
     In other theories, the demand for investment is a function
of expected future incomes, which in turn are a function of
current income.   The fluctuations in investment then become as
much a consequence as a cause of income fluctuations. It is hard
to reconcile       such naive    accelerator models with rational
behavior.
29

government may be able to affect the supply of outside money,
there are close near money substitutes, at least for transactions

purposes. Moreover, money is not required for most transactions,
only credit. (This is what makes those models which are based on
the cash—in—advance constraint so implausible.)          And to the
extent that money is required for transactions purposes, one must
explain why that is so.      Moreover, the relationship between
transactions and    income is tenuous:      many, perhaps most,
transactions are exchanges of assets, and the kinds of economic
changes associated with the business cycle are often accompanied
by changes in wealth, and hence in asset distribution.

     To the extent that money demand        is based      on asset
considerations, what is relevant, of course, is not income, but
wealth. And since there are short term bonds which are, except
for transactions purposes, perfect substitutes for money, the
relevant opportunity cost of holding money is the short term
money rate of interest; but if any interest rate is relevant for
investment, it should be the real rate of interest.26 Moreover,
as the recent development of Cash Management Accounts makes
clear,   it is clearly feasible to provide interest bearing
"money," in which case the only relevant question facing the

     26Jt is not clear whether it should be the long term or
short term real interest rate. When the question is, when should
a project be undertaken, the short term real interest rate is
presumably relevant; when the question is, should a project be
undertaken, it is presumably the long term real interest rate.
Since the information relevant to undertaking a project (the set
of suppliers, the prices at which factors can be purchased, etc.)
becomes obsolete so rapidly, in many cases at least the question
posed by firms is more the latter than the former.
30

individual is the maturity structure of the debt which he wishes

to hold.

     More recent Keynesians (e.g. Tobin) have proposed another
mechanism by which monetary policy affects economic activity: In
the general portfolio approach, different assets (short term,
long term bonds) are seen as imperfect substitutes, and changes
in the relative supply affect different interest rates, and, in

particular, the price of equities.         This can be criticized are

several grounds.     First, firms do not, for the most part, resort

to the equities market to raise capital.             Thus the price of
equities is not directly relevant.            How can we explain the
observed correlations? In our theory, optimistic expectations,
say about future sales, will be reflected in a high price of
equities (high future profits), and in managers' willingness to
produce. There is a correlation, but not causation.

     To put      it another way, what managers and controlling
stockholders are concerned about is not the price of equities
today, but the price of equities when they go to sell their
shares. The current price may be a good forecast of future
prices, but businessmen are more likely to base their judgments
concerning particular investment projects not on the judgments of
some relatively uninformed outsider, but on their better informed

insider views.

     Secondly, in theory, changes in the maturity structure of
the government's debt should have no effect on the market
equilibrium,     provided   that   there       are    not   significant
31

redistributive consequences of that change (and these seem
implausible. )   For those changes represent changes in the
(stochastic) future tax liabilities of individuals. Individuals,

in deciding on their optimal portfolios, should take into account

other aspects of the risks which they face, including wage and
tax risks; and if they do this correctly, there will be no
effects on real interest rates. The Tobin approach would, in a
perfect capital market, seem to rely on irrational behavior.
(See Stiglitz 1981)
     Tobin might object to this on two grounds: first, that
individuals do not     really   include   their   stochastic tax
liabilities in their portfolio analysis; and secondly, that our
analysis assumed a perfect capital market.   We are inclined to
agree27; as a result, we also agree that the government can
change market rates of interest. But we remain unconvinced that
this is (an important) mechanism by which the government controls

economic activity.     Rather, we would argue that government
monetary policy affects bank's willingness to lend (and the terms
on which they are willing to lend), and it is through this

     27This is not to say that individuals do not take some
account of their future tax liabilities; but what evidence there
is not does support the hypothesis that they take these future
tax liabilities "fully" into account.
     We have not indicated all of the relevant assumptions in the
"Irrelevance Theorems," only what we view to be the most
important. Thus, for instance, the irrelevance theorems assume
that taxation is non—distortionary. But taxes are distortionary.
Reducing taxes today and increasing taxes in the future may have
a real welfare effect; but it seems implausible that the
differences in these Harberger distortionary triangles, each of
themselves being small, can account for monetary policy having
any signficant effect.
32

mechanism that investment may be affected.
33

                          Concluding Remarks

      On methodology.     Capitalist economies are complicated. A
model is       supposed to capture their central features, not
reproduce them exactly. Decisions of individuals and firms today
are based on future expectations, and are affected by past
decisions. Individuals do not have perfect foresight or rational

expectations concerning the future.            The events which they
confront often appear to be unique, and there is no way that they
can    form    a     statistical model predicting the probability
distribution of outcomes. And there is little evidence that they
even attempt to do so.        At the same time, individuals are not
myopic. They do not simply assume that the future is like the

present.
      Markets are not perfect.      But markets do exist. Prices do
adjust. Wages fall in the presence of massive unemployment.
      These "facts" pose some important strategic decisions for
the modeler:       within the foreseeable future, it is not possible
to construct a dynamic model adequately reflecting all of them.
Polar cases are easier to study. Should one assume perfect wage
or price flexibility or no wage or price flexibility? Rational
expectations or myopia? Any set of choices is open to criticism,
but equally, can be defended as part of a long term research
strategy.
      In our view, the choices must be dictated by the phenomenon
to be studied. The central problem we are interested in is
explaining unemployment. Thus, to begin the analysis by assuming
34

market clearing is to assume away what is to be explained.

     While we agree about the importance of understanding the
dynamic maximization prob1eins individual and firms are engaged
in, ignoring the important constraints they face (e.g. on the
access to capital markets) results in models which are of little

relevance. We suspect that      in many instances, myopic models
focusing on the constraints are far better than "rational" models

ignoring them.   Indeed, in some cases, one can show that the
rational models with constraints look identical to the standard
myopic models (e.g. with rule driven behavior, all of profits and

none of wages saved. )28



     2. On policy. There has been a long standing controversy
over what governments should do in the face of unemployment: (a)

nothing; (b) encourage wage reductions; (c) use monetary policy;
or (d)     increase government expenditures.       The success of

     28The rational expectations school is often credited with
the observation that government policies, if anticipated, will
have affects quite different from those intended.    This seems to
be giving them more credit than is due.    In the 60's, during the
period in which dynamic      models   were    being   so actively
investigated, there was a considerable amount of work analyzing
perfect foresight models; included in these analyses was the
analysis of the consequences of fully anticipated government
actions. It was noted, for instance, that a temporary investment
tax credit would decrease investment prior to its effective date,
cause a surge of investment subsequently, cause another surge in
investment prior to its removal, and lead to depressed investment
immediately after its removal.
     The contribution of the rational expectations analyses was
to investigate these questions in a stochastic environment.
While this was an important extension of the non—stochastic
perfect foresight models, the basic insights——at least the one
noted above——remain the same.
35

Keynesian theory has much to do with the fact that it provided a
theoretical justification for those who wished to take the fourth
course. The success of the New Classical theory has much to do
with the fact that it has provided a theoretical justification
for those who wished the government to do nothing.

     In our view, Keynes' analysis was basically correct. Government policy can

affect the outcome; in recessionary periods, monetary policy is likely to be of
                                                     Z9
limited efficacy; and wage cuts may not be effective.




      3.     On the efficiency of the market economy. We agree with
Keynes that unemployment is a real problem facing capitalist
economies.      Though a half—century of experience may make us less

sanguine about the government's ability to eliminate business
fluctuations, a half—century of experience with alternative forms
of economic organization have made us even less sanguine about

     291n Keynesian theory, wage cuts reduce aggregate demand.
In more modern Keynesian theory, where consumption is based on
permanent income, such wage cuts might have a negligible effect
on demand. Our theory provides an explanation of why wage cuts
could have a significant effect:        imperfect capital markets
result in some individuals having to reduce their consumption.
   On the other hand, there are circumstances in our theory where
a wage cut would be effective:    when each firm chooses not to
reduce its wage, given the wages paid by other firms, a
coordinated wage change can increase the demand for labor.
      Our theory suggests, however,    that there   are other
circumstances where lowering real wages (below the efficiency
wage) would actually result in a reduction in the demand for
labor.
     To the extent that lower wages lead to lower prices, wage
reductions can have future deleterious effects, in reducing the
working capital available to firms, and in making them more
reluctant to produce, if they extrapolate current declines in
prices to continue in the future.
36

the ability of these alternatives to provide the basis of a more
efficient system of resource allocation. Like the emperor's new
clothes, we may not be able to see the invisible hand because it
is not there;    or perhaps more accurately, because it is so
invisible, we do not see how palsied it is.      Unemployment is
but the worse manifestation of pervasive market failures which
arise in the presence of imperfect information and incomplete
markets. But if the invisible hand of the market is palsied, the
visible hand of the government        be far worse. Voltairewas
wrong: we do not live in the best of all possible worlds. We
live in an imperfect world. And we must learn to live with those

imperfections.    Limited government intervention——correcting the
worse manifestations    of market failures, including massive
unemployment—-may, after all, improve the efficiency of market
economics. In the end, Keynes, and Keynesian policies, are
vindicated.
