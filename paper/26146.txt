                                         ABSTRACT

Surveys show majority U.S. support for a carbon tax. Yet none has been adopted. Why? We
study two failed carbon tax initiatives in Washington State in 2016 and 2018. Using a difference-
in-differences approach, we show that Washington's real-world campaigns reduced support by 20
percentage points. Resistance to higher energy prices explains opposition to these policies in the
average precinct, while ideology explains 90% of the variation in votes across precincts.
Conservatives preferred the 2016 revenue-neutral policy, while liberals preferred the 2018 green-
spending policy. Yet we forecast both initiatives would fail in other states, demonstrating that
surveys are overly optimistic.

1       Introduction
    Estimates for 2015 put the social cost of carbon at $11-$105 per metric ton of CO2 .1 A Pigouvian tax
on emissions can internalize the social cost of carbon--as can a system of tradable emissions permits ("cap-
and-trade"). Price incentives equalize the marginal cost of reducing emissions across different sources and
thereby minimize the total cost of meeting a given emissions target. Meanwhile, revenue from a carbon
tax can be used ("recycled") to lower other taxes or to mitigate impacts on low-income households and
energy-intensive industries. This logic appeals to economists from across the political spectrum, as well as
to many commentators and politicians, as exemplified by the informal Pigou Club and more formal Climate
Leadership Council.2 Yet these economic arguments inevitably must confront a key political hurdle: carbon
taxes lead to higher energy prices, which are highly unpopular (see e.g. Knittel 2014, for gas taxes). How then
could a carbon tax be passed? One argument is that forming a bipartisan coalition would be easier if carbon
taxes were more acceptable to conservatives who tend to favor limited government. Thus, this view supports
using carbon tax revenue to lower other taxes, i.e. a revenue-neutral policy. An alternative argument sees
the bipartisan approach as doomed to failure since the right would reject a carbon tax of any flavor, while the
left would actually prefer to increase government spending. Thus, this alternative view supports spending
carbon tax revenue on green projects and social programs to maximize liberal support.

    Running parallel to this economic and political debate, recent research in the social science literature
uses surveys to measure public support for environmental policies, including a carbon tax. This literature
often finds broad, majority support for a carbon tax--depending on how the tax revenue is used (Amdur,
Rabe, and Borick 2014; Kotchen, Turk, and Leiserowitz 2017). For example, 50% of Americans in a 2016
survey say they support reducing greenhouse gas emissions by taxing carbon-based fuels.3 Meanwhile, 68%
of Americans in a 2018 survey say they support requiring fossil-fuel companies to pay a carbon tax.4 This
number climbs to 72% in 2019.5 Yet to date, we have seen no carbon tax adopted in the United States, be
it a revenue-neutral policy or a tax-and-spend policy.6 What explains this disconnect? Are opinion surveys
reliable measures of voter preferences for a carbon tax? To what extent are voters actually willing to trade

    2 The "Pigou Club" is a designation credited to founding member and conservative economist, Greg Mankiw, and includes:

fellow economists such as Paul Krugman, Ed Glaeser, Kevin Hassett, and William Nordhaus; Democratic politicians such as
Al Gore; Republican politicians such as Rex Tillerson and Lindsey Graham; conservative/libertarian pundits such as David
Frum and Megan McArdle; liberal/progressive pundits such as Bill Nye and David Leonhardt; and many others from across the
political spectrum. The Climate Leadership Council is a bipartisan policy institute founded by Ted Halstead in 2017, which
counts former Federal Reserve chairs Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen among its founding members.

off higher energy prices for reduced emissions and tax rebates? Does the use of revenue matter politically in
the real world?

  To answer these questions, we study voting patterns in two recent, failed carbon tax initiatives in Wash-
ington State from 2016 and 2018. Initiative 732 (I-732) from 2016 would have lowered the state sales tax
from 6.5% to 5.5% and matched the federal Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) by 25%, while Initiative 1632
(I-1631) from 2018 would have devoted 95% of carbon tax revenue to green projects (e.g., renewable energy).
These policies were otherwise quite similar, i.e. with tax rates starting at $15/tCO2 and rising gradually
thereafter (see table 1). Thus, these initiatives offer an unprecedented opportunity to measure voter pref-
erences for two different flavors of a carbon tax based on actual voting. Our analysis relies on detailed,
precinct-level elections data from Washington State for 2016 and 2018. We complement these data with a
national survey of 3,000 people fielded on Amazon Mechanical Turk during the November 2018 election (but
before the election results were known).

  Our findings address five key questions.

  First: What drives differences in support for a carbon tax among voters? Overwhelmingly, we find it to
be ideology. This message emerges clearly from our analysis of precinct-level voting data and is confirmed
in our individual survey data. In both cases, we infer latent ideology from votes and opinions on other
policies (e.g., stricter gun laws or a higher minimum wage). Ideology alone explains 91% of the variation
in actual vote shares across precincts and predicts votes better than partisanship. In contrast, proxies for
higher tax incidence (e.g., car commute or home size), which correlate negatively with support for a carbon
tax, explain relatively little of the variation across precincts. Likewise, among individual survey respondents,
latent ideology explains two times more of the variation in support across respondents than party affiliation,
and the results barely budge when including proxies for the incidence of a carbon tax or other demographic
controls. The key takeaway is that ideology is the main driver of support for a state carbon tax in a
referendum.

  Second: Do voters prefer a revenue-neutral tax, or spending on green projects? Again, we find that the
answer depends on ideology. I-732 was designed by an economist to be revenue-neutral in an explicit appeal
to political moderates, while I-1631 was designed by a progressive coalition with social and environmental
justice objectives. Consistent with these different strategies, we find in precinct-level voting data that I-1631
performed better in liberal precincts, where it picked up 3.3 percentage points--but worse in conservative
precincts, where it lost 0.7 percentage points relative to I-732. Thus, while the green-spending policy
performed slightly better overall (43.4% for I-1631 versus 40.8% for I-732), it also failed to gain majority
support. This failure has less to do with opposition from conservatives, whose support fell slightly, than
tepid enthusiasm among progressives, whose support only grew modestly.



                                                       2
  Third: Do voters value the benefits of a carbon tax? While ideology is the main driver of voting on
the carbon tax, we find that tax incidence also matters on the margin, which allows us to back out the
distribution of willingness to pay (WTP) for the policy across precincts. We calculate the average incidence
of the carbon tax to be $266 per person per year. Meanwhile, we find that voters on average put little value
on the other aspects of a carbon tax policy, including the tax rebates built-in to the 2016 initiative. Thus,
for the average precinct, tax incidence is pivotal in driving opposition to the carbon tax. When we look
beyond the average, we find that WTP for the incidence of a carbon tax is similar across precincts (because
the predicted incidence is similar)--but that the WTP for the other aspects of the policy varies greatly.
This finding rationalizes why pocketbook issues explain so little of the variation in the vote shares across
precincts: voters across all precincts are similarly put-off by higher taxes, while political ideology differs
tremendously across precincts, driving large differences in support for a carbon tax.

  Fourth: What are the prospects for carbon taxes in other states? To answer this question, we use our
regression results from Washington to perform an out-of-sample forecast for vote shares in other states. We
find that the best chance for Pigou at the polls would be a carbon tax modeled on I-1631 in Massachusetts
(49.1% support). We forecast that this policy would actually pass in Vermont (50.2% support), but the
Green Mountain State lacks the popular initiative mechanism. Meanwhile, the best chance for a revenue-
neutral policy like I-732 is in California (46.5% support). Again, I-732 would do better in both New York
and Hawaii (46.8% and 47.3%), but neither state has the popular initiative. Across all states, we find that
our survey over-estimates support for a carbon tax relative to our forecasts based on Washington's actual
vote.

  Fifth and finally: Why do surveys overstate actual votes for a carbon tax? Using our individual survey
data, we estimate that support for I-1631 in Washington is 20 percentage points lower than in other states,
controlling for ideology and demographics--but find no such gap for eleven other environmental policies
(e.g., the Kyoto treaty). This comparison can be interpreted as a difference-in-differences estimate in which
Washington is the treated state, other states serve as controls, and we measure support for the I-1631
carbon tax relative to other environmental policies. We interpret the Washington penalty emerging from our
difference-in-differences estimator as a campaign effect: respondents exposed to Washington's two real-world
campaigns and actual vote on a carbon tax exhibit lower support than respondents considering a purely
hypothetical initiative. In addition, we find that our survey of Washington respondents over-predicts the
actual vote for a carbon tax in Washington, even after carefully re-weighting the data to match the party and
demographics of the voting population. In contrast, our re-weighted sample does yield accurate predictions
for U.S. House votes. We therefore infer that our survey is selected on unobservables that correlate with
support for a carbon tax but not partisanship. Thus, while the qualitative patterns in our survey data are
consistent with the actual vote in Washington--namely, that a carbon tax is more popular among liberal

voters--surveys may be unreliable guides to the absolute number of votes in a referendum.

  This paper contributes to the literature in public economics that uses votes in referendums to measure
preferences for public policy. The closest papers to ours are Kahn and Matsusaka (1997) and Burkhardt and
Chan (2017), who estimate demand for environmental policy using votes on a wide range of initiatives in
California--and Holian and Kahn (2015), who focus on California's cap-and-trade bill from 2006, drawing on
both actual votes and survey data.7 We are the first paper to analyze voting on a state-level carbon tax. Like
us, Burkhardt and Chan (2017) use aggregate voting data to estimate willingness to pay (WTP) for policies
separately from their fiscal cost, and conclude that ideology is more important than cost in explaining voting
patterns. Our main contribution here is to decompose WTP into a larger number of underlying components,
to show the full distribution of this WTP across precincts, and to show that ideology explains most of the
variation in WTP across precincts.8 Meanwhile, Holian and Kahn (2015) emphasize the strong correlation
between actual votes and survey data across geography. In contrast, we emphasize the large gap in the
average support implied by hypothetical survey questions versus actual votes. Our main contribution here
is to show that exposure to a real-world policy significantly dampens the support for a carbon tax. We
call this the campaign effect, i.e. all of the information to which people respond when a carbon tax is on
the ballot in a given constituency. These results contribute to the literature on the impact of campaigns in
direct democracy (Gerber 1999; Bowler and Donovan 2000; Lupia and Matsusaka 2004; De Figueiredo, Ji,
and Kousser 2011; Rogers and Middleton 2015; Dyck and Pearson-Merkowitz 2019). Our findings imply that
hypothetical votes in a survey likely overstate actual votes for a carbon tax in a real-world election.

  We also contribute to a broader social science literature that studies the determinants of public opinion
surrounding climate change, including preferences for carbon regulation and carbon taxes in particular. Egan
and Mullin (2017) thoroughly review the survey literature, showing that partisan affiliation (i.e., Democrat
vs. Republican) is the single-most important driver of support for climate regulation and that the partisan
gap has only widened in recent decades.9 Our main contribution here is to use actual voting data on a
carbon tax. Like the survey literature, we also find that partisanship is an important driver of support for
a carbon tax.10 However, we show that it is not partisanship per se that mainly drives support but rather
political ideology--which is strongly correlated with partisanship but measures something distinct.

  Finally, we contribute to a literature that studies the political feasibility and durability of carbon reg-
   7 Burkhardt    and Chan (2017) also estimate preferences for non-environmental public goods (e.g., children's hospitals), while
Holian and Kahn (2015) study a second low-carbon policy in California: high-speed rail.
    8 In addition, we compute tax incidence based on variation in energy costs rather than marginal income tax rates, measure

issues-based ideology separately from partisanship, and include a richer set of demographic controls.
    9 Egan and Mullin (2017) further emphasize (i) the importance of partisanship as a moderating variable for the effects of

education and framing, (ii) that beliefs are not particularly susceptible to information (i.e., the "information deficit" model
does not hold), and (iii) that belief in climate change does not necessarily lead to support for policy action.
   10 This result is consistent with Holian and Kahn (2015), who find partisanship to be an important driver of actual voting on

California's cap-and-trade policy in 2006. In contrast, Kahn and Matsusaka (1997) finds that partisanship is not an important
driver of voting on California's other forms of environmental regulation in the 1970s, 80s, and 90s.

ulation. See Rabe (2018) for a thorough review. One vein of this literature focuses on revenue-recycling
schemes for carbon taxes or cap-and-trade systems with permit auctions. Carattini, Baranzini, Thalmann,
Varone, and V¨
             ohringer (2017) find using a hypothetical choice experiment in Switzerland that people prefer
carbon tax revenue to be spent on green projects--but approve of revenue-neutral, lump-sum transfers when
informed about the distributional effects. In the United States, survey respondents also prefer green projects
to lump-sum transfers or reductions in other taxes (Amdur, Rabe, and Borick 2014; Kotchen, Turk, and
Leiserowitz 2017). Our paper is unique in using actual voting data for two policies that differ mainly in how
they propose to use carbon tax revenue. Thus, we provide the most direct evidence to date on how actual
voters perceive and react to different revenue-recycling schemes. We find that liberal voters prefer green
spending, while conservative voters prefer the revenue-neutral policy. Interestingly, our willingness-to-pay
framework implies that voters on average are not convinced that a revenue-neutral carbon tax will compen-
sate them for higher energy prices--and do not much value the spending in the green-spending version of
the carbon tax. Thus, for the average voter, tax incidence explains most of the opposition to the carbon
tax. Yet, beyond the average voter, more ideologically conservative voters tend to favor the revenue-neutral
version. It therefore appears that revenue recycling is more of an ideological than a pocketbook issue in the
eyes of voters. Thus, a carbon tax initiative with green spending will tend to do better in a liberal state like
Washington--but still not necessarily well enough to get the initiative passed.

    The rest of this paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 details the life of I-732 from its conception to the
November 2016 election--and then the life of follow-on initiative I-1631 through its failure in November
2018. Section 3 describes our data sources. Section 4 explores the relationship between ideology and support
for carbon taxes using precinct-level voting data and replicates these results using individual-level survey
data. Section 5 tests whether economic incidence has a detectable impact on support for a carbon tax and
estimates willingness-to-pay (WTP) for the policy's attributes. Section 6 forecasts vote shares for the two
carbon taxes in other states based on our precinct-level regressions from within Washington--and explores
why surveys tend to overstate these forecasts (as well as the actual vote in Washington). Finally, section 7
concludes with a discussion of lessons-learned and avenues for further research.

2      Washington State's two carbon tax proposals
    The I-732 campaign was spearheaded by Carbon Washington--a small grassroots organization led by
Yoram Bauman, a professional stand-up comedian and Ph.D. economist by training.11 Carbon Washington's
strategy was to appeal to political moderates and conservatives, as well as liberals, through a revenue-
neutral policy and targeted redistribution of carbon tax revenue. Thus, in addition to imposing a carbon
tax, their policy would have reduced the state sales tax (to benefit all voters), expanded the EITC (to

address distributional concerns), and reduced taxes on manufacturing businesses (to mitigate opposition
from energy-intensive industry). Meanwhile, the state's big player in carbon regulation over many years
was the Washington Alliance for Jobs and Clean Energy (henceforth "Alliance"). The Alliance comprised
a broad range of environmental, labor, and social justice advocacy groups, i.e. the progressive base. These
members included heavy-hitting, national-level environmental groups, such as Sierra Club and National
Resources Defense Council, along with various state and local environmental groups. The labor and social
justice groups reflected a similar range of national, state, and local advocacy groups--again including many
heavy-hitters (e.g., AFL-CIO).12 The Alliance's strategy was to explicitly tie carbon regulation to a program
of spending on green jobs, improved health, and climate adaptation in low-income, historically disadvantaged
communities. Thus, from the Alliance's perspective, any tax revenue should be targeted directly to these
priorities.

  The divergence between Carbon Washington and the Alliance highlights--in microcosm--a strategic fork in
the road for would-be crafters of climate policy: appeal to moderates and conservatives through a revenue-
neutral, market-based policy, or double-down on the left by spending revenue on the issues and identity
groups that liberals care about. Carbon Washington turned right--or rather, aimed for the middle--while
the Alliance was veering left.

  Carbon Washington unexpectedly gathered the signatures needed to put I-732 on the ballot (over 350,000).
The Alliance approached Carbon Washington to discuss a policy compromise that would satisfy both groups
and that would, in the Alliance's view, do better at the polls. However, after a complicated discussion
and some miscommunication, the two groups were unable to reach a compromise. Carbon Washington
proceeded to the polls with I-732, while most members of the Alliance either actively opposed or--like
the Sierra Club--declined to support I-732 (see appendix A for more information on the two initiatives'
supporters and opponents).

  The reasons for this opposition varied across groups but essentially boiled down to four issues: (1) concern
that I-732 might lose revenue and put other programs at risk;13 (2) a belief that carbon tax revenue should
be spent on issues important to the coalition (e.g., green jobs and climate adaptation); (3) a belief that
such spending schemes polled better; and (4) the perception that Bauman and Carbon Washington failed to
engage the broader social and environmental justice community in the design of I-732.

  After I-732 failed in 2016, the Alliance followed through in crafting and campaigning for I-1631 two years
later. Table 1 summarizes the key provisions of I-732 and I-1631. On the tax side, the two policies are
quite similar: a state carbon tax starting at $15/tCO2 and then rising gradually. However, on the revenue-
 12 See the Alliance's web page for a statement of principals and list of members: https://jobscleanenergywa.com.
 13 Independent   estimates of the revenue impacts varied, highlighting this uncertainty: the Washington Office of Financial
Management projected a 0.95% decrease in state revenue; Carbon Washington projected a 1.1% to 1.6% increase; and, the
Sightline Institute projected a -0.27% decrease.

recycling side, the two policies differ sharply. I-732 aims to be revenue-neutral, devoting most tax revenue
to a reduction in the state sales tax and an expansion of the EITC--to mitigate impacts on low-income
households.14 In contrast, I-1631 allocates 95% of tax revenue to green projects and 5% to local communities.
I-1631 tends to be a more ideologically liberal policy, since it spends revenue on green investment, while I-732
tends to be more conservative or moderate, since it is revenue-neutral.

    The Alliance hoped that I-1631 would outperform I-732 for at least two reasons. First and most impor-
tantly, they thought that progressives would support using revenue for clean energy, while a revenue-neutral
measure alienates those progressives and wins very few conservatives. Second, the I-1631 ballot language
avoids the dreaded word "tax" and instead describes a "fee" on carbon.

3      Actual and hypothetical voting data
    In this section we describe our data sources and procedures. Our main data record actual, precinct-level
election results from Washington State in the November 2016 and 2018 general elections. We complement
these data with hypothetical, individual-level voting data from a national online survey that we fielded on
election eve and election day in November 2018 on Amazon Mechanical Turk.

3.1     Precinct-level election data from Washington in November 2016 and 2018

    Our main data come from the State of Washington Secretary of State (WA SOS) and record precinct-
level results from the November 2016 and November 2018 general elections.15 These data record the total
number of votes cast for various candidates to elected office, as well as total votes cast for and against various
statewide ballot measures. We use these data to calculate--for each precinct--the share voting "yes" (vs.
"no") on the two carbon taxes (I-732 in 2016 and I-1631 in 2018), as well as the share voting Republican (vs.
Democrat; other small parties are not included in this calculation) in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.16
These data also record, in a separate file, the total number of registered voters and ballots cast in 2016
(these data are not available for 2018). We use these data to calculate the share of registered voters that
cast ballots in 2016 (turnout), as well as the share of ballots cast that recorded a vote either for or against
the carbon tax (roll-off).17

    To measure latent ideology, we conduct a principal component decomposition of the precinct-level vote
shares on twelve other ballot measures from November 2016 and 2018. These measures cover a wide range of
  14 Some  may argue that the EITC increase is not a revenue-neutral tax cut but rather an increase in spending.
  15 Available here: https://www.sos.wa.gov/elections/research/election-results-and-voters-pamphlets.aspx
  16 Our main results use a measure of Republican share based on the 2016 U.S. presidential election. For robustness checks,

we also calculate Republican share separately for 2016 and 2018 based on the two U.S. Senate elections in those years.
  17 In pooled regressions using both 2016 and 2018 data, we calculate roll-off as the the average number of votes cast for or

against the carbon tax in 2016 and 2018 divided by the total number of ballots cast in 2016. In regressions that use only 2016
or 2018 data, we calculate roll-off as the total number of votes cast for or against a carbon tax in that year divided by the total
number of ballots cast in 2016.

     F) other than the carbon tax from 2016 and 2018) vs. the Republican party vote share in the 2016 presidential

social, economic, and procedural issues.18 We take the first component from this decomposition as an index
measure of conservative ideology. We only include the first component, as this variable captures most of the
underlying variation in ideology. We linearly transform this index to range from zero (most liberal) to one
(most conservative). Figure 1 plots our measure of conservative ideology vs. the share voting Republican in
each precinct. The figure illustrates that these two measures are highly correlated. However, they are not
perfectly correlated. Indeed, at each level of Republican vote share, there are both relatively conservative
and relatively liberal precincts.

  We match these voting data to U.S. Census data as follows. First, we obtain data from WA SOS that
provides the distribution of each voting precinct's total population in 2010 across Washington's more than
100,000 census blocks (based on block centroids).19 We use these data to calculate, for each precinct, the
share of the population living in each of Washington's roughly 4,800 census blockgroups. Second, we match
  18 See appendix F for details of each measure and appendix figure 18 for scatter diagrams plotting vote shares on these other

state ballot measures versus the presidential vote share.

                                                                    9
these population shares to U.S. Census blockgroup aggregate data (e.g., share people age 40 and older or
share of households with incomes less than $50,000). Third, for each precinct, we calculate the population-
weighted averages of the blockgroup-level data. Finally, we match these precinct-level weighted averages of
the underlying blockgroup-level data to precinct-level election data.20

  U.S. Census data come from American Community Survey (ACS) 5-year estimates for 2012-2016. In
constructing population-weighted averages of blockgroup-level data, we do not rely on blockgroup-level
medians. Rather, we rely on blockgroup-level shares of people, households, workers, or commuters that
fall into narrow categories. For example, we use the share of people age 40-44 or the share of households
with incomes of $50,000-$59,999 rather than median age and median income.21 This approach leads to more
sensible data aggregation and allows us to more flexibly model the relationship between census covariates and
support for a carbon tax.22 Coefficients on these variables (e.g., population share age 40-44) intuitively have
the same interpretation as those on a dummy variable (i.e., probability shift for a voter age 40-44).

  We make several sample restrictions. First, we limit our analysis to precincts that did not experience
boundary changes between 2016 and 2018.23 This restriction omits 11% of precincts. Second, we limit our
analysis to precincts with at least 50 votes cast in the November 2016 presidential election to more precisely
estimate a precinct's latent partisanship and ideology.24 This restriction omits an additional 4% of precincts.
Finally, we focus on observations with complete census data. This restriction omits just 0.05% of precincts.
In the end, we are left with a sample size of 6,038 precincts for 12,076 pooled observations across our two
elections (2016 and 2018). Our final sample includes 84% of the 2016 precincts representing 85% of the
state's population and 85% of the voter turnout.
  20 We calculate for 2016 that 34% of precincts overlap with one block group, 37% overlap with two, 18% overlap with three,

7% overlap with four, 3% overlap with five, and the remaining 1% overlap with six, seven, or eight block groups. In total, 89%
of precincts overlap with three or fewer block groups.
  21 Our detailed census variables measure population shares by narrow category of: car commute time (for commuters); industry

(for workers); annual income, home value, and # of rooms (for households); and age, race, gender, and education (for all people).
  22 Consider a precinct that overlaps with multiple blockgroups indexed by j = 1, 2, . . . , J . Let µ be the share of the precinct's
                                                                                                       j
population in blockgroup j with J    i=1 µj = 1. Let j be the share of blockgroup j 's population in some demographic category
(e.g., age 40-44). Finally, assume that a blockgroup's population is distributed homogeneously through its geographic area
(e.g., the age 40-44 population is not concentrated in one part of the blockgroup or another). Then the share of the precinct in
the given demographic category is J     i=1 µj j , i.e. the population-weighted average of the blockgroup shares. In contrast, the
median value of some demographic variable (e.g., median age) in a precinct is not in general the population weighted-average
of the blockgroup-level medians, i.e. medians do not aggregate.
  23 Precincts experience boundary changes when they split (creating a new precinct and corresponding precinct code), merge

(eliminating an existing code), or shift boundaries to re-balance population (so that old codes correspond to different geographic
areas). WA SOS maintains GIS shapefiles that record precinct boundaries for each year. At our request, Nicholas Pharris at
WA SOS used these shapefiles to match each of the state's more than 100,000 census blocks to precinct boundaries in 2016 and
2018 (based on block centroids). Thus, we are able to identify precincts that experience boundary changes based on census
blocks that match to different precinct codes in 2016 and 2018.
  24 Small precincts yield noisy estimates of a precinct's latent partisanship and ideology, leading to multiple cases of 0% and

100% vote shares (e.g., for the Republican party or for a particular ballot measure). These extreme cases skew our regression
results. We found that omitting predicts with fewer than 50 presidential votes cast eliminated all such extreme cases. We omit
these precincts prior to calculating and re-scaling the latent ideology measures described above.




                                                                 10
3.2         Individual-level national survey data from November 2018

  We conducted an internet survey using Amazon's Mechanical Turk platform in fall 2018 on Election Eve
and Election Day (i.e., November 5-6, 2018), before election results were announced. We only surveyed U.S.
residents aged 18 years or older. We surveyed 4,125 respondents, of whom 3,904 had sufficient data to allow
us to estimate latent ideology (see below). Our primary question of interest is based directly on the approved
text of I-1631 from Washington State. Residents of Washington were asked:

        Washington's ballot initiative I-1631 concerns pollution. This measure would charge pollution
        fees on sources of greenhouse gas pollutants and use the revenue to reduce pollution, promote
        clean energy, and address climate impacts, under oversight of a public board. How do you think
        you will vote?

  Residents of the other states were instead asked in the final sentence: "How would you vote if such a
measure were put to the ballot in YOUR state?" A total of 3,760 respondents answered the carbon tax
question and had sufficient other data to estimate latent ideology.

  We measured party using a standard two-part question modeled on similar questions in the American
National Election Study (ANES)25 and the Cooperative Congressional Election Study (CCES). First, we
asked respondents to identify as Democrat, Republican, or independent. Next, we asked self-described
independents if they leaned more to one major party or another. Consistent with other work, we classified
respondents as independents only if they declined to identify as Democrat or Republican in both questions.
We classified respondents that admitted to leaning Democrat or Republican as partisans, along with those
that identified as such in the first question.26

3.2.1       Measuring individual-level ideology

  Generating valid measures of ideology for survey respondents is not straightforward. Even in an age of
polarized parties, party membership is only partly ideological. Indeed, individuals often hold ideological
positions that diverge from their party's platform. An alternative approach is to ask respondents to self-
identify their position on a left-right scale, ranging from very liberal to very conservative. While the political
science literature has used this approach for decades, it suffers from potentially severe measurement error
problems (Ansolabehere, Rodden, and Snyder 2008). Thus, the approach of most modern measurement
attempts--and the approach we take here--is to consider ideology as a latent variable to be estimated using
a variety of observable issue positions (Jessee 2012; Shor and Rogowski 2018).27
  25 Seehttps://electionstudies.org/
  26 See,for example, Keith, Magleby, Nelson, Orr, Westlye, and Wolfinger (1992). Also see https://www.people-press.org/
2014/06/12/appendix-b-why-we-include-leaners-with-partisans/.
  27 Achen (1978) laid the groundwork for this effort. Most scholars rely on public opinion surveys, which yield maximum control

over which questions are asked. Examples include Bafumi and Herron (2010), Jessee (2012), Tausanovitch and Warshaw (2013),
Shor and Rogowski (2018), and Kousser, Phillips, and Shor (2018). In contrast, Gerber and Lewis (2004) exploit the fact that



                                                              11
             Figure 2: Distributions of latent ideology by self-reported party and by self-reported ideology




Note: This figure plots the distribution of latent ideology estimated from responses to policy questions in our national-level
individual survey data. The left panel shows the distribution of ideological score conditional on self-reported party identification
(Democrat, Republican, and Independent). The right panel shows the distribution of ideological score conditional on self-
reported ideology on a 1-7 scale (where 1 = ultra-liberal and 7 = ultra-conservative).
Source: Our Amazon Mechanical Turk survey on November 5-6 in 2018.



  We use the responses to 53 issue questions asked elsewhere in our survey. Of these questions, a total of 11
pertain specifically to energy and environmental issues, while 42 pertain to non-environmental issues. We
list all 53 questions in appendix B. We estimate three separate measures of ideology: a combined measure,
one that includes only environmental issues, and one that includes only non-environmental issues. We
estimate these measures of ideology by fitting a one-dimensional item response theory (IRT) model (Clinton,
Jackman, and Rivers 2004) to each of the three sets of issue questions (i.e., combined, environmental, and
non-environmental).28 To ease interpretation, we rescale each of these ideology measures such that, in our
sample, they range from 0 (most liberal) to 1 (most conservative).29 Below, we find that while latent
environmental ideology predicts voting on the carbon tax better than other measures in some regressions,
the regression coefficients are similar across all three measures.

  Figure 2 shows the full distribution of estimated latent ideology. The left panel shows latent ideology condi-
tional on self-reported party identification. Though correlated with party, latent ideology is not fully captured
by partisanship. This finding makes sense, since partisanship represents much more than ideology. The right
panel shows latent ideology conditional on self-reported ideology. Though the means of the self-reported

states like California hold elections with multiple issue propositions. Analogous to our approach based on precinct-level data
above, they use individual-level ballot data from Los Angeles to estimate latent ideology based on actual votes in the 1992
election.
  28 IRT models are standard in political science research. These latent-measurement models take as inputs a series of dichoto-

mous responses and estimate a continuous measure for latent ideology. Any number of dimensions of latent ideology can be
estimated, but adding more dimensions typically does not increase explanatory power by much (Jessee 2012). That a single
dimension captures most variation in ideology implies that our survey respondents' policy preferences are highly constrained
and correlated with each other. We performed the actual estimation using the pscl package in R (Jackman 2011).
  29 That is, our rescaled measure of ideology for respondent i is x~i = [xi - min(x)]/[max(x) - min(x)], where xi is unscaled
ideology for respondent i and min(x) and max(x) are the sample minimum and maximum values.




                                                                12
categories line up as expected, the distributions of the categories are very wide. Strikingly, a substantial
share of self-reported ultra-liberals are more conservative than some self-reported ultra-conservatives, as
indicated by the overlap in the distributions for self-reported ideology categories 1 and 7. We should be
skeptical, then, of using self-reported measures of ideology to predict policy preferences.

3.2.2     Sampling bias and re-weighting

    Respondents recruited online through Amazon's MTurk platform obviously are not representative of the
general population. MTurkers are typically younger, more educated, and more Democratic and liberal than
the general population. Nevertheless, this bias is easily overstated (Berinsky, Huber, and Lenz 2012) and
the use of MTurk for survey and experimental work has expanded dramatically in the past decade, including
work on the ideological polarization around I-732 (Van Boven, Ehret, and Sherman 2018). This growth in
MTurk is partly a response to the high cost of obtaining a representative sample using more traditional
survey methods, as well as to rapidly dropping response rates and significant response bias for traditional
methods.

    To better approximate a nationally representative sample of individuals, we weight our survey data to
match self-reported partisanship and demographics from the 2018 exit poll conducted by Edison Research
and the National Election Pool.30 All individual-level models are estimated using these survey weights.
Later in the paper, we also aggregate to the state level. To do that, we use a different method of weighting
our survey data--multiple regression with poststratification (MRP)--which we describe in greater detail
below.

4       Who supports a carbon tax?
    In this section, we investigate the correlates of support for the carbon tax--first, using aggregate precinct-
level voting data for I-732 and I-1631, and second, using individual-level MTurk survey data for I-1631.

4.1      Evidence from precinct-level voting data

    Figure 3 shows the share voting "yes" on each of the two carbon taxes by decile of the Republican vote
share in the 2016 presidential election.31 Deciles for 2018 (solid line) are constructed such that they each
capture the same number of votes cast for or against the carbon tax in 2018, rather than the same number of
precincts--and similarly for 2016 (dashed line). Thus, the overall share voting "yes" on the carbon tax in a
given year can be read visually as the average height of the corresponding line. This figure illustrates clearly
  30 See https://www.cnn.com/election/2018/exit-polls. Specifically, we weight on sex, marital status, race, age, education,

religious observance, and political party. We use the iterative weighting procedure from DeBell and Krosnick (2009) (imple-
mented in the anesrake R package) which is commonly employed by political scientists studying public opinion. The estimated
weights ensure that the survey cross-tabs for any two of our chosen demographic variables (e.g., share of sample that is female-
married or Republican-college degree) match the population cross-tabs from the 2018 exit poll (for which two-way cross-tabs
are publicly available but more detailed data are not).
  31 See appendix figure 19 for the underlying precinct-level vote shares.

     Note: This figure plots the "yes" shares on I-1631 in 2018 (solid line) and I-732 in 2016 (dashed line) by decile of the
     Republican party vote share in the 2016 presidential election. Each decile contains precincts that together add up
     to one tenth of votes cast in 2016 and 2018 respectively. Deciles for 2018 are constructed from precinct-level data in
     the following way: sort precincts from the lowest to the highest Republican vote share, and then determine decile
     cutoffs. Deciles for 2016 (dashed line) are constructed similarly. Thus, the overall vote share can be visualized as
     the average height of the points.

that support for the carbon tax falls as the Republican share increases. The relationship is stronger in 2018
(solid line) than in 2016 (dashed line). Indeed, the most liberal precincts (on the left) tend to prefer the
2018 policy, while the most conservative precincts (on the right) tend to prefer the 2016 policy.32 , 33

  Table 2 presents OLS regression results for precinct-level carbon tax vote shares conditional on ideology,
partisanship, demographics, and turnout. These regressions pool voting outcomes from 2016 and 2018;
each regression includes a 2018 dummy, but the other explanatory variables are purely cross-sectional.34
Conservative ideology is a highly significant predictor of support for the carbon tax with an R-squared of
  32 This figure calculates deciles based on Republican share in 2016. To the extent that Republican share in 2016 is a noisy

measure of Republican share in 2018, this approach could understate the negative correlation between support for I-1631 and
Republican share in 2018. To explore this issue, we construct deciles using Republican share in the U.S. Senate races in 2016
and 2018, which allows us to match Republican share in 2016 to the carbon tax vote in 2016 (I-732) and Republican share in
2018 to the carbon tax vote in 2018 (I-1631). The resulting figure looks nearly identical. See appendix figure 20.
  33 Figure 21 in the appendix repeats this analysis using conservative ideology in place of the Republican vote share and leads

to similar conclusions. Also see appendix figure 22 for the underlying precinct-level vote shares by conservative ideology.
  34 This data structure explains why the coefficients and standard errors on the 2018 dummy are the same in each column.

Note: This table presents coefficient estimates from pooled precinct-level OLS regressions modeling the share voting "yes" for
the carbon tax in 2016 and 2018 as a function of ideology, demographics, and other factors. Conservatism measures ideology
on a 0-1 index, computed from the precinct's vote shares on 12 ballot measures in 2016 and 2018 (see appendix figure 18).
Republican measures the share voting for the Republican (vs. Democratic) party candidate in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
Endorsement indicates that the precinct's state legislator declared his or her support for I-732. Turnout is measured as the
total number of ballots cast in 2016 divided by the total number of registered voters. Voted on carbon tax measures the average
number of votes cast for or against the carbon tax in 2016 and 2018 divided by the total number of ballots cast in 2016. 2018
vote is an indicator for the 2018 carbon tax (I-1631). Models (3)-(7) build cumulatively on model (2). Model (3) controls for
detailed census variables (i.e., commute time by car, industry, home value, # rooms, income, gender, age, race, and education).
Model (4) then adds ideology. Model (5) then adds the endorsement variable. Model (6) then adds county fixed effects. Finally,
model (7) adds the two turnout variables. For all models, precincts are weighted by the total votes cast for the Republican or
Democratic candidate in the 2016 presidential election. Standard errors are clustered by county (39 clusters).

91.4% (column 1).35 On average, support for the carbon tax falls by 81 percentage points moving from the
most liberal to most conservative precinct. Meanwhile, the share voting Republican in the 2016 presidential
election is also a highly significant predictor of support for the carbon tax, but its overall predictive power
is slightly lower with an R-squared of 87% (column 2). On average, support falls by 73 percentage points
moving from a precinct that votes 100% Democratic to a precinct that votes 100% Republican. Adding a
slew of Census demographics to the Republican vote share bumps the R-squared up to 90.7% (column 3),
but conservative ideology alone still has slightly higher predictive power (column 1). Adding conservative
ideology on top of the Republican vote share and Census demographics further boosts the R-squared to
92.6% (column 4). More interesting, however, is the fact that the coefficient on Republican share shrinks
by a factor of five, while the coefficient on conservative ideology remains quite high; ideology is clearly the
  35 By itself, the 2018 dummy has an R-squared of just 0.6%. Thus, as an approximation, we wholly attribute the R-squared

values in this table to the other variables.

dominant driver of support for a carbon tax.36 The endorsement of I-732 by the precinct's state legislator
does not explain support for a carbon tax conditional on other variables (column 5), suggesting that local
elite support is superfluous in this context.

  We then test the robustness of our results to further controls. One potential concern is that we have omitted
important spatial demographic variables that are correlated with ideology and partisanship, undermining
our interpretation of these variables as the dominant drivers of support for a carbon tax. To address this
concern, we control for county-level fixed effects. We find that our coefficients on ideology and partisanship
do not change (column 6).37

  Another potential concern is that the correlations we estimate reflect both differences in underlying pref-
erences and differences in voter turnout for various ideological and demographic groups. For example, young
people may strongly support a carbon tax (positive effect on "yes" shares) but may be less likely to vote
(negative effect "yes" shares). If so, then the coefficients we estimate--while still valid for predicting ag-
gregate voting outcomes--would reflect neither the underlying preferences of the voting population nor the
preferences of the resident population. To address this concern, we control for voter turnout and voting on
the carbon tax (roll-off), such that our coefficients implicitly reflect the preferences of the resident popula-
tion (i.e., holding voter turnout fixed). Again, we find that our coefficients on ideology and partisanship do
not change (column 7).38 Interestingly, the coefficient estimates imply that precincts with higher turnout
are less likely to support the carbon tax, conditional on ideology and demographics.39 Thus, more active
voters seem to have different preferences on average (since the coefficient on turnout is negative), but this
fact does not change our interpretation for which specific groups most support carbon taxes (since the other
coefficients barely shift when turnout is included).

4.1.1    Looking under the hood of our ideological index

  As previously discussed, we exploit the presence of twelve statewide ballot measures considered by Wash-
ington voters in 2016 and 2018 (appendix F). We use vote shares on these measures across precincts to
calculate a precinct-level index of political ideology based on the first component from a principle-component
decomposition. This approach is based on the assumption that voting on these other measures is also ideo-
  36 One potential concern is that Republican is based on the presidential vote in 2016, while Conservatism is based on ballot

measures from both 2016 and 2018, which could complicate a direct comparison of these variables. To explore this issue, we
replicated models (1) and (2) using two different measures of Republican based on U.S. Senate elections in 2016 and 2018: the
Republican share in 2016 (similar to our current approach), and a weighted-average with 2/3 weight on the Republican share
in 2016 and a 1/3 weight on the Republican share in 2018 (to parallel the ideological index, which includes 8 ballot measures
from 2016 and 4 from 2018). The two approaches yield similar results, and both approaches indicate that ideology is the main
driver of support for a carbon tax. See appendix table 10.
  37 Full results for the census demographic variables, available upon request, show that coefficients on these variables also

barely shift when we include county fixed effects.
  38 Full results for the census demographic variables, available upon request, show that coefficients on these variables also

barely shift when we include the two turnout controls.
  39 Appendix tables 8 and 9 show that these results are mainly driven by voting in 2016, for which turnout was strongly

negatively correlated with support for I-732.

logical in nature and consistent across issues. Creating an index allows us to capture the effects of ideology
in a single, intuitive measure.

  To explore precinct-level ideology further, we estimate an additional regression model (8) that is not
reported in table 2. This model is identical to model (6) in the table but replaces the ideological index
(Conservatism) with "yes" vote shares for all twelve of the ballot measures (i.e., included simultaneously).
Figure 4 reports the coefficient estimates on these variables. At the bottom of the figure, note that support
for repealing a clean car subsidy and repealing an oil pipeline tax both correlate negatively with support

for a carbon tax. This is perhaps not surprising, given that these policies also have direct environmental
implications. What is noteworthy for our model of ideology, however, is that support for tighter gun con-
trol and higher minimum wages--largely or entirely unrelated social and economic policies--also correlate
(positively) with support for a carbon tax.

4.1.2      Comparing two flavors of the carbon tax

  Above, we study the overall level of support for carbon taxes. Here, we explore differences in support
for a green-spending policy (I-1631 in 2018) relative to a revenue-neutral policy (I-732 in 2016). To begin,
figure 5 plots the change in support for I-1631 relative to I-732 by decile of Republican vote share.40 The
progressive design of I-1631 worked as intended by its supporters--at least to a degree. Liberal precincts
increased their support for I-1631 relative to I-732. At the same time, conservative precincts decreased
their support. Specifically, I-1631 gained 3.35 percentage points in cumulative vote share relative to I-732
among more liberal precincts (deciles 1-6) and lost 0.66 percentage points among more conservative precincts
(deciles 7-10) for a net gain of 2.7 percentage points.41 , 42

  How effectively did I-1631 mobilize liberals? This green-spending policy gained 12.5 percentage points in
the most liberal (farthest left) decile. Had all of the left-leaning precincts (deciles 1-6) gained by the same
amount, then the overall gain would have been 6.8 percentage points (0.6 · 12.5 - 0.7), which would still only
bring the overall vote share to 47.6% (40.8 + 6.8). In other words, even had all of the left-leaning precincts
been as enthusiastic for I-1631 as the most liberal ones, the measure still would not have passed. Thus, the
failure of I-1631 had less to do with the fact that it turned off conservatives (though it did), but rather the
fact that it failed to galvanize enough liberals. The Alliance--who proposed I-1631 as a better alternative
to I-732--was broadly correct in thinking that liberal voters could be moved to vote in favor of a carbon
tax. However, the I-1631 package was not powerful enough in moving this constituency--at least not in
the throes of a heavily contested campaign with high levels of campaign spending. Indeed, total spending
in 2018 was $48 million--more than ten times larger than in 2016--and dominated by the "no" campaign,
which outspent the "yes" campaign by a factor of two. Meanwhile, total spending in 2016 was just $4.6
million and dominated by the "yes" campaign, which outspent the "no" campaign by a factor of two (see
table 1).

  Next, we regress changes in the precinct-level vote share on ideology, partisanship, demographics, and
other variables. Table 3 presents the OLS regression results--with positive coefficients indicating that a

  41 Again, this figure--and our conclusions about net gains and losses--are nearly identical when we construct deciles based
on Republican voting in the U.S. Senate races, which allows us to match Republican voting in 2016 to I-732 and Republican
voting in 2018 to I-1631. See appendix figure 20.
  42 Figure 21 in the appendix repeats this analysis using conservative ideology in place of the Republican vote share and leads

to similar conclusions. Also see appendix figure 22 for the underlying precinct-level changes in vote shares by conservative
ideology.

Note: This figure plots changes in average "yes" shares (I-1631 in 2018 relative to I-732 in 2016) by decile of the U.S. presidential
vote share (Republican) in 2016. Each decile contains precincts that together add up to one tenth of votes cast in 2016 and
2018 respectively. Deciles for 2018 are constructed from precinct-level data in the following way: sort precincts from the lowest
to the highest Republican vote share, and then determine decile cutoffs. Deciles for 2016 are constructed similarly. Thus, the
overall difference in vote shares between 2018 and 2016 can be visualized as the average height of the points.

given variable is associated with an increase in vote share for the green-spending package (I-1631 in 2018)
relative to the revenue-neutral policy (I-732 in 2016). Conservative ideology is a highly significant predictor
of the change in vote share with an R-squared of 51.4% (column 1). On average, the green-spending policy
loses 27.7 percentage points in relative support moving from the most liberal to the most conservative
precinct. Meanwhile, the share voting Republican in the 2016 presidential election is also a highly significant
predictor of the change in vote share, but its overall predictive power is lower with an R-squared of just 43.8%
(column 2). On average, the green-spending policy loses 23.5 percentage points in relative support moving
from a precinct that votes 100% Democratic to a precinct that votes 100% Republican. Adding Census
demographics increases the R-squared but has virtually no effect on the coefficient for Republican share
(column 3). Strikingly, upon adding precinct-level ideology, the share voting Republican totally vanishes
as a predictor of relative support, while the coefficient on ideology remains as high as ever (column 4).
Again, these inferences are robust to including county-level fixed effects and controls for turnout and roll-

Note: This table presents coefficient estimates from OLS regressions modeling the change in share voting "yes" for the carbon
tax in 2018 vs. 2016 as a function of ideology, demographics, and other factors. Conservatism measures ideology on a 0-1
index. Republican measures the share voting for the Republican (vs. Democratic) party candidate in the 2016 U.S. presidential
election. Endorsement indicates that the precinct's state legislator declared his or her support for I-732. Turnout is measured
as the total number of ballots cast in 2016 divided by the total number of registered voters. Voted on carbon tax measures the
average number of votes cast for or against the carbon tax in 2016 and 2018 divided by the total number of ballots cast in 2016.
Models (3)-(7) build cumulatively on model (2). Model (3) controls for detailed census variables (i.e., commute time by car,
industry, home value, # rooms, income, gender, age, race, and education). Model (4) then adds ideology. Model (5) then adds
the endorsement variable. Model (6) then adds county fixed effects. Finally, model (7) adds the two turnout variables. For
all models, precincts are weighted by the total votes cast for the Republican or Democratic candidate in the 2016 presidential
election. Standard errors are clustered by county (39 clusters).

off (columns 6 and 7). Our regression results are thus consistent with figure 5, showing that more liberal
districts prefer the green-spending version of a carbon tax, while conservatives prefer the revenue-neutral
policy. Further, our results establish that ideology is indeed the main driver of support for I-1631 relative
to I-732.

4.2     Evidence from individual-level survey data

  We now turn to the individual-level survey data. Our raw, unweighted data indicate that 77% of re-
spondents nationally would vote for a state carbon tax modeled on I-1631, while 23% would vote against.
Of course, our survey disproportionately samples young, liberal, and Democratic voters. Indeed, when we
re-weight our data to match the national demographics and party identification of the 2018 exit poll, we
find somewhat lower support: 67% of respondents nationally would vote for I-1631, while 33% would vote
against. Even after re-weighting, however, a large majority of voters favor the policy.




                                                              20
4.2.1        Overall results from individual-level survey data

  Next, we model individual-level, self-reported support for I-1631 using a linear probability model. Table 4
presents the OLS regression results.43 All regressions weight observations to make the data representative at
the national level using the official 2018 exit poll. In addition, all regressions include a dummy variable for
Washington State respondents, as well as a full set of individual-level demographic control variables.44

  We find that self-reported party identification and demographics together explain 17% of the variation in
individual-level support for I-1631 (column 1). Relative to Democrats with similar demographics, support
is 34 percentage points lower among Republicans and 22 percentage points lower among Independents.
Meanwhile, latent ideology and demographics together explain 30% of the variation in support (column
3), whereas self-reported ideology and demographics explain just 20% of the variation (column 2)--barely
better than the party-only model (column 1). Note that mean ideology for Republicans is 0.64, while mean
ideology for Democrats is 0.38, for a difference of 0.26. Thus, the coefficient of -1.28 on latent ideology
(column 3) implies that support for a carbon tax decreases by 0.26 · 128 = 33 percentage points on average,
moving from the ideology of a typical Democrat to that of a typical Republican. Appendix E presents full
regression results for the demographic variables, some of which are statistically significant at conventional
levels. In particular, women, African-Americans, Asian-Americans, and younger voters are all more likely to
support the I-1631 carbon tax. Overall, however, these controls explain very little of the variation in survey
responses, conditional on party and especially on ideology. Indeed, appendix E shows that latent conservative
ideology by itself explains 28% of the variation in individual-level support, while adding demographic controls
barely increases the R-squared to 30% (see column 3 here). When latent ideology and party are included
together, the coefficients on Republican and Independent shrink to near-zero, while the coefficient on latent
ideology holds steady, and the model R-squared barely budges (column 4). Again, these results all point to
ideology as the dominant driver of support for a carbon tax in the individual-level survey data--just as in
the precinct-level voting data above.

  What about respondents from Washington State, who--in the weeks leading up to our survey--were
exposed to real-world campaigns for and against the I-1631 carbon tax, followed by an actual vote? Strikingly,
we find across all specifications in table 4 that respondents from Washington State are about 20 percentage
points less likely to support I-1631 than respondents from other U.S. states. We explore this finding in
greater detail below.

  Above, we estimated a one-dimensional measure of ideology based on responses to all 53 dichotomous
issue questions. Here, we estimate and explore two separate versions of latent ideology: one measure based
  43 Logit results are available in appendix E and provide equivalent findings.
  44 There  are fewer observations in this table than the 3,904 respondents for whom we have valid ideology estimates. This gap
is due to a substantial number of missing values for at least one of the demographic control variables. Appendix E shows that
we obtain very similar results on the full sample that omits these control variables.

about the I-1631 ballot language. All models weight observations using inverse probability weights based on sex, marital
status, race, age, education, religious observance, and political party using the 2018 exit poll (using R's svyglm command). All

on environmental issues only (11 questions), and a second measure based on non-environmental issues only
(42 questions). Table 5 presents OLS regression results using these two different measures of ideology; all
regressions control for self-reported party affiliation, the Washington State dummy, and the full set of demo-
graphic control variables. We find that conservative environmental ideology performs substantially better
than conservative non-environmental ideology in explaining individual-level support for I-1631 (compare the
R-squared of 38% in column 2 to the R-squared of 26% in column 1). Meanwhile, adding non-environmental
ideology on top of environmental ideology does nothing to improve the model's fit (compare the R-squared
values in columns 3 and 2). At the same time, however, none of our qualitative conclusions change when
using a measure of latent ideology devoid of energy and environmental issues.

4.2.2    Why is support for I-1631 so much lower in Washington?

  What's the matter with Washington? Why is support for I-1631 so much lower there? Could it be
that Washington voters are simply more conservative on energy and environmental issues than would be
predicted by their ideology and demographics? In short: no. Rather, it appears that exposure to the
real-world campaigns of 2016 and 2018 actually depressed the support of Washington voters.

  To arrive at this answer, we repeat our regression analysis above, modeling support for I-1631 as a function
of latent ideology, demographic control variables, and the Washington State dummy (see model 3 in table

Note: This table summarizes the results of three separate linear probability (OLS) models of the survey response to a question
about the I-1631 ballot language. All models weight observations using inverse probability weights based on sex, marital status,
race, age, education, religious observance, and political party using the 2018 exit poll (using R's svyglm command). All models
include demographic controls. Non-Environmental Ideology estimates latent conservative ideology from 42 issue questions that
are not about the environment or energy. Environmental Ideology estimates latent conservative ideology from the 11 questions
on the environment and energy (appendix B).

4 above). We then replicate this regression, modeling support for 11 other energy and environmental issues
in place of I-1631 (all coded so that 1 is the liberal position and 0 is the conservative position). Figure 6
plots the resulting coefficient estimates on the Washington State dummy. Point estimates are represented
by dots, while 95% confidence intervals are represented by horizontal lines. As above, the coefficient for
I-1631 is -0.2 and statistically different from zero. However, for the 11 other energy and environmental
issues, the coefficient ranges narrowly from about -0.05 (opposition to opening ANWR for oil exploration)
to about 0.08 (opposition to the increased production of domestic fossil fuels). Only one such coefficient
(opposition to fossil fuels) is statistically different from zero, but it is positive (i.e., consistent with Washington
respondents being more liberal). Thus, while support for I-1631 is 20 percentage points lower in Washington,
we find no evidence that Washington voters are generically less likely to support the liberal position on other
environmental issues (conditional on ideology and demographics).

  We take these comparisons one step further by estimating 11 difference-in-differences models, in which
Washington is the treated state, other states serve as controls, and we measure support for the carbon tax
relative to the 11 other energy and environmental policy issues. Our dependent variable is the difference
in the individual dichotomous response on I-1631 and the responses on each of the 11 other issues (again,
re-coded so that 1 is liberal and 0 is conservative). Thus, for example, a respondent opposing the carbon tax

lower on average--and statistically different from zero (denoted by the vertical dashed line) in every case.

for I-1631 from being exposed to actual campaigns for and against the carbon tax, along with actual voting
in 2016 and 2018.

other states to be the "treated" group instead of Washington. No matter which of the 11 other environmental
policies we choose for comparison, Washington State's difference-in-differences estimate lies at the extreme
left end of the distribution (see figure 8). That is, Washington State respondents exhibit substantially lower
support for the carbon tax relative to other environmental issues, and this is true in comparison to every
other state.

  Why did the two real-world campaigns depress support for I-1631 in Washington? There are multiple


                                                                       26
possibilities. Our identification strategy does not allow us to disentangle their relative importance, since we
can only estimate an overall Washington effect. However, we can speculate about a few likely mechanisms,
given anecdotal evidence from Washington and prior research in political science.

  First, voters in Washington were exposed to extra information, which may have nudged them toward a
"no" vote. Consider the information environment at the start of the campaign. The "yes" side had every
advantage: strategically chosen ballot language, a carefully crafted message to frame their measure, and--
after many months gathering signatures and preparing for the vote--a well-organized team. Meanwhile,
the "no" side was not organized at all and was forced to hit the ground running. At the same time, since
"rationally ignorant" voters tune in quite late, the opposition had plenty of time to make up ground. One way
it did so was by providing information to voters. In particular, while the I-1631 ballot language strategically
described a "fee" on carbon emissions rather than a "tax," the opposition was free to inform voters that
I-1631 was in fact a tax increase.45 Moreover, moderate and conservative voters unfamiliar with the carbon
tax could be able, with more information, to place the measure as increasing the size and importance of
government in energy and environmental matters.46 Conservative and Republican support in Washington
dropped. Meanwhile, in other states, conservatives profess deep support for carbon taxes--likely a very
misleading result, since carbon taxes are typically not well-understood and no active campaigns exist to
inform these voters. If trusted elites were to transmit messages of opposition, support in these other states
would also likely fall (Zaller 1992).

  Second, the literature on direct democracy highlights a possible role for status-quo bias (Bowler and
Donovan 2000; De Figueiredo, Ji, and Kousser 2011). Because the status quo is known for certain, while
changes to the status quo are uncertain, risk-averse voters might rationally default to the status quo when
considering a policy change via initiative. While survey votes from respondents outside of Washington were
purely hypothetical, respondents in Washington faced an actual vote, which could have triggered feelings
of risk-aversion and status-quo bias. This interpretation is consistent with evidence that early support for
state initiatives tends to wane as the election draws near (De Figueiredo, Ji, and Kousser 2011).

  Third, campaign spending may have played an important role. The "no" campaign on I-1631 outspent
the "yes" campaign by a factor of two (see table 1), and prior literature finds significant causal effects
of campaign spending on ballot propositions (De Figueiredo, Ji, and Kousser 2011; Rogers and Middleton
2015). Data from California show that, when the opposition spends twice as much, initiatives that begin with
51% support later fail with just 40% support (De Figueiredo, Ji, and Kousser 2011). This result is broadly
consistent with the negative campaign effect we estimate for Washington and suggests that the campaign
  45 Indeed, the "no" campaign website prominently says: "I-1631 Imposes a New $2.3 Billion Energy Tax on Washington

Consumers". See here: https://votenoon1631.com/get-the-facts/.
  46 See, for example, Lupia (1994) on the ability of low-information voters to make reasonable choices when presented with

technically complex choices on initiatives.



                                                            27
against I-1631 was very effective. In contrast, spending on I-732 was much lower overall and was dominated
by the "yes" campaign (see table 1). Thus, it is plausible that I-1631 was handicapped at the polls relative
to I-732 due to lopsided spending by the "no" campaign. While I-1631 outperformed I-732, it also seems to
have galvanized the opposition, leading to increased effort and fundraising by its opponents. It is not at all
clear, then, that positioning I-1631 to the left had only positive effects.

5      Tax incidence and willingness-to-pay for a carbon tax
    To what extent does personal tax incidence drive opposition to the carbon tax? Voters with the highest
personal energy consumption--in particular, those consuming more gasoline to propel their cars, or more
electricity and natural gas to power and heat their homes--will tend to incur the largest direct costs from a
carbon tax. Thus, we might expect lower support from such voters, all else equal.

    To test this proposition, figure 9 reports the coefficient estimates on car commute time and home size
from model (8) described in section 4.1.1 above.47 These variables proxy for personal energy consumption.
Point estimates are represented by dots, while 95% confidence intervals are represented by vertical lines.
Overall, our results support the idea that voters facing higher direct costs are less likely to support the
carbon tax. The coefficients on the share of commuters with varying car commute times are all negative
(upper panel). Thus, relative to commuting by other means, car commutes of any length are associated
with lower support for the carbon tax. Especially long commute times are not associated with especially low
support--perhaps because total gasoline consumption does not scale proportionately with commute time.
Meanwhile, the coefficients on the share of households with three or more rooms are all negative (lower
panel). Thus, relative to homes with just one or two rooms, larger homes are associated with lower support
for the carbon tax. Moreover, support tends to decline as homes get larger, which is consistent with higher
energy consumption for larger homes.48

    What can this tradeoff between tax incidence and support for the carbon tax tell us about willingness-
to-pay (WTP) for the policy? To answer this question, we push our analysis several steps further by
measuring the economic incidence--in dollars--that Washington's proposed carbon taxes would have had on
car commuters and households residing in large homes. We then model the relationship between "yes" vote
shares and precinct-level economic incidence in a logistic regression derived from an individual-level random
utility model. Thus, we are able back out the average WTP for the policy in each precinct, which we can
   47 This model controls for the Republican vote share in the presidential election, the votes on the twelve individual ballot

measures (i.e., other than the carbon tax), the legislator endorsement variable, the 2018 dummy, the full suite of Census
demographic variables--including income and manufacturing industry, which may be necessary to control for the tax rebates
embedded in the I-732 package--and county fixed effects. Recall that this model omits the two turnout controls.
   48 Full results for the census demographic variables, available upon request, show that the coefficients on home size are not

especially sensitive to the inclusion of county fixed effects nor to the use of 12 individual ballot measures in place of the
ideological index. Meanwhile, coefficients on car commute times increase somewhat in magnitude with the inclusion of county
fixed effects and individual ballot measures.

  Note: These figures plot coefficient estimates from a pooled OLS regression modeling the share voting "yes" for the
  carbon tax in 2016 and 2018. The top panel plots coefficients on variables measuring the share of commuters with car
  commute times ranging 0-9 minutes (0), 10-14 minutes (10), 15-19 minutes (15), and so forth; the excluded category is
  implicitly commuters that do not commute by car. The bottom panel plots coefficients on variables measuring the share
  of households with various numbers of rooms in their home; the excluded category is implicitly homes with just one room.
  Point estimates are represented by dots, while 95% confidence intervals (based on standard errors clustered by county)
  are represented by vertical lines. Control variables (not shown) include the share voting "yes" on twelve other ballot
  measures (i.e., the basis for our index of ideology), the share voting Republican (vs. Democrat) in the 2016 presidential
  election, endorsement by a state legislator, the 2018 vote dummy, detailed census variables (i.e., industry, home value,
  income, gender, age, race, and education), and county fixed effects.

                                                                                                  29
then use to estimate the full distribution of average WTP across precincts. Consistent with our regression
results above, we find that ideology is the main driver of variation in WTP across precincts. However, for
the average precinct, tax incidence is pivotal in driving opposition to the carbon tax.

  Our analysis proceeds in several steps. First, we calculate average economic incidence for each precinct.
Using the carbon tax phase-in schedules described in the legislation for I-732 and I-1631, we calculate the
annualized average carbon tax rates implied by both policies to be approximately $50/tCO2. Meanwhile,
using data from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Residential Energy Consumption
Survey (RECS), we calculate average annual emissions associated with car ownership and home size (i.e.,
number of rooms). Thus, we are able to calculate implied economic incidence per car and per room. Finally,
we multiply the per-car incidence by the share of a precinct's commuters that commute by car, and we
multiply the per-room incidence by the average number of rooms per household in the precinct, to yield
precinct-average economic incidence in dollars.

  Second, we model voting on the carbon tax as a function of economic incidence and our full set of detailed
control variables in an OLS logistic regression. Our regression equation takes the form:

                                   yi =  · totaltaxi +  ideologyi +  otheri + i ,                                         (1)

where yi = ln(si /(1 - si )) and si is the share voting "yes" in precinct i, totaltax is measurable tax incidence
for the precinct (i.e., based on car ownership and home size) with corresponding coefficient , ideology is a
vector of precinct-level ideology variables (i.e., the Republican vote share plus vote shares in all twelve other
ballot measures) with corresponding coefficient vector  , other is a vector of all remaining precinct-level
control variables (i.e., census demographics and county dummies) with corresponding coefficient vector  ,
and    is a mean-zero precinct-level residual. We estimate this equation separately for 2016 and 2018 to yield
distinct coefficients for  in each year. We also estimate a pooled regression in which we stack both years
to yield a single coefficient  but allow different coefficients by year for all other variables (including the
intercept and county dummies). In these regressions, we weight precinct-years by the total number of votes
cast for or against a carbon tax. We interpret the coefficient  as the marginal utility of income, which
allows us to re-scale and express the fitted values from this regression as WTP in dollars.49

  Third and finally, we use the coefficient estimates and fitted values from our OLS logistic regression to
back out mean WTP for the policy in each precinct. Given our model, mean WTP in precinct i is given by:
  49 Note that this estimating equation for aggregate "yes" shares can be derived from an individual random utility model of

the form: uin =  · totaltaxi +  ideologyi +  otheri + i + in , where uin is the net utility that voter n in precinct i derives
from voting "yes" versus "no" in the referendum (i.e., assuming the voter is pivotal to the outcome). Coefficient  is the
(negative) marginal utility in the precinct from paying a higher average tax bill. Components  ideologyi and  otheri capture
systematic shifts in the precinct's net utility due to ideology and other observed variables (e.g., precinct demographics and
county dummies). The i is a precinct-level residual. Finally, the in is    an idiosyncratic error term distributed iid extreme
value across individual voters with mean zero and standard deviation / 3, where  = -1/. Given a large number of voters
within each precinct, aggregate "yes" shares can be modeled using the estimating equation above (i.e., a logistic regression
model).


                                                             30
yi /^ , i.e. net utility scaled by the estimated marginal utility of income. Further, given our linear model,
we can decompose WTP into each of its individual constituents: measurable economic incidence (totaltaxi ),
ideology (^ ideologyi /^ ), other non-tax variables (^
                                                      otheri /^ ), and the residual (^/^ ). For this exercise,
we re-center the ideological variables to equal zero at their sample mean vote shares.50 Thus, we implicitly
measure each component of WTP relative to a precinct with average ideology. Below, we report sample
means and standard deviations of these components across precincts (weighted by total votes cast for or
against a carbon tax) alongside our OLS coefficient estimates.

  Before presenting our results, we caution that our inferences about the mean and variance in WTP hinge
on a causal interpretation for the coefficient on total tax, i.e. no omitted variables bias. We have tried to
control for all relevant observables at our disposal. However, if the true all-else-equal coefficient on totaltax
(i.e., the marginal utility of income) were substantially bigger than we estimate, then the mean and variance
in WTP due to non-tax factors would both fall accordingly. Likewise, if the true coefficient were smaller,
then the mean and variance would rise.51 That said, we find in models (6) and (7) from table 2 above
that coefficients on car commuting and home size are unaffected by the inclusion of county fixed effects and
turnout controls, which partially ameliorates such concerns.

  Table 6 presents the results from this analysis. We present regression results separately for 2016 (columns
1-2) and 2018 (columns 3-4). We also present regression results when we pool data across years and impose
that the coefficients on tax incidence are the same across years--but allow all other coefficients to vary by
year (columns 5 and 6-7). Columns (1), (3), and (5) show results when we measure economic incidence on
commuters (car tax) separately from economic incidence on home size (room tax), while columns (2), (4),
and (6-7) show results when we measure the combined economic incidence for both commuters and home size
(total tax). Coefficients on estimated tax incidence are negative and statistically significant in all regressions,
suggesting that voters derive negative utility from higher taxes, all else equal. The coefficient on car tax is
smaller than the coefficient on room tax in all regressions, but they are of the same order of magnitude.52
Our preferred results use the combined measure of incidence in columns (2), (4), and (6-7).
  50 That is, we use re-centered variables v     ~i = vi - v
                                                           ¯, where v
                                                                    ¯ is the sample mean of ideology variable v . Our ideology variables
include the Republican vote share in the 2016 presidential election plus the vote shares on the twelve other ballot measures
from 2016 and 2018.
  51 Consider average net utility in precinct i: y = -tax + z , where  is the (positive) marginal utility of dollars, tax is the
                                                       i          i    i                                                         i
average tax bill, and zi is the average net utility due to all other factors. The portion of WTP due to the tax is given directly
by taxi . Meanwhile, the portion due to all non-tax factors can be written as zi = yi / + taxi . Then the sample average WTP
due to the tax bill across precincts is tax, while the average WTP due to all non-tax factors is z        ¯=y¯/ - tax. Thus, as  rises,
the mean WTP due to non-tax factors falls. Meanwhile, the sample variance in WTP due to the tax bill is var(taxi ), while
the variance due to non-tax factors is var(zi ) = var(yi )/2 + 2cov (yi , taxi )/ + var(taxi ). This variance falls monotonically
in  if cov (yi , taxi ) > 0. If cov (yi , taxi ) < 0, then the variance initially falls (i.e., starting from  = 0) and eventually rises.
We estimate var(yi ) = 0.4645 and cov (yi , taxi ) = -16.2248 in our data. Thus, the variance is falling up to about  = 0.0286,
which is more than 20 times larger than our estimate (divide the estimates in table 6 by 1000 to get the coefficient on total tax
measured in dollars).
  52 Coefficients could differ in magnitude for a variety of reasons, including differences in tax salience, scaling issues due to

different numbers of commuters vs. households vs. voters in an average precinct, or omitted variables bias.

     Note: This table presents coefficient estimates from OLS logistic regressions modeling share voting "yes" for the
     carbon tax in 2016 and 2018 as a function of measurable economic incidence and various controls. The dependent
     variable is the log-odds ratio: yit = ln(sit /(1 - sit )), where sit is the share voting "yes" in precinct i in year t. Car
     tax is the annual gasoline tax incidence due to car ownership as measured by car commuting (in $1000s). Room tax
     is the annual home energy bill tax incidence due to home size as measured by # rooms (in $1000s). Total tax is
     the sum of these two variables (in $1000s). All models include a full set of controls. Controls for ideology are: the
     share voting Republican (vs. Democrat) in the in 2016 presidential election, plus the full set of "yes" vote shares
     on the twelve other ballot measures from 2016 and 2018. Controls for other non-tax variables are: the endorsement
     dummy; detailed census variables (i.e., industry, home value, income, gender, age, race, and education); and county
     fixed effects. For all models, we weight precinct-years by the total votes cast for or against the carbon tax. The
     pooled regressions in columns (5) and (6-7) combine data from both years and impose that the coefficient on tax
     incidence is the same across years; these regressions additionally include a dummy variable for the 2018 vote, as
     well as its interaction with all control variables. Standard errors are clustered by county (39 clusters).
     Implied WTP calculations at bottom report sample mean and standard deviations for estimated precinct-level
     WTP (in $) and its underlying components (i.e., tax, ideology, other, and residual) after weighting by total votes
     cast for or against the carbon tax. Columns (6) and (7) are based on the the same pooled regression; we use two
     columns to report WTP calculations separately by year.

  We now turn to our estimates of precinct-level WTP reported at the bottom of the table. Mean total WTP
is negative $331-$347 in 2016 and negative $247-$260 in 2018. Across all models, mean WTP for measurable
tax incidence is negative $266, i.e. voters would pay $266 on average to avoid the carbon tax's incidence.
By construction, this statistic equals the average tax bill across precincts. Meanwhile, mean WTP based
on ideology is approximately zero--a direct consequence of our choice to re-center ideology to equal zero on
average.53 Finally, mean WTP based on other non-tax attributes is negative $64-$80 in 2016 and positive
  53 For taxes, both the absolute level and units have economic content in terms of WTP. For the other variables, however, all

that matters is relative ideology or relative demographics (e.g., age). Thus, the allocation of WTP between ideology and other
non-tax variables is inherently arbitrary.

$3-$16 in 2018. Note that our decomposition implicitly measures WTP for these other non-tax variables
relative to a precinct with average ideology.

  Taken at face value, these results imply that the average precinct's voters dislike the personal cost of higher
energy taxes--as expected--but seem barely to credit the potential benefits of a carbon tax. Indeed, the
results imply that the average voter actually values the other aspects of the 2016 policy negatively --including
an expanded EITC and lower state sales tax. These results contrast with the stated-preference estimates
of Kotchen, Turk, and Leiserowitz (2017), who find a positive WTP of $177 on average.54 Proponents of
the 2016 initiative hoped that returning carbon tax revenue to residents through a lower state sales tax and
expanded EITC would directly counteract voters' dislike for the carbon tax. However, our results imply that
this strategy did not work: apparently, voters on average were not convinced that what one hand takes, the
other hand gives back. This lack of trust in the management of the revenues by public authorities is one of
the issues believed to hinder the adoption of carbon taxes (Carattini, Carvalho, and Fankhauser 2018).

  Our results indicate that, for the average voter, pocketbook issues explain the overall negative WTP and
are pivotal in driving opposition to the carbon tax. However, the standard deviations in the precinct-level
tax bill ($35), other non-tax variables ($53-$69), and residual ($102-$113) are all swamped by the standard
deviation in WTP for ideology ($398-$690), which is consistent with our results above that ideology explains
most of the variation in voting across precincts.

  Figure 10 illustrates these points graphically with estimated marginal WTP curves (i.e., demand curves)
for the two carbon tax policies. These estimates are based on the pooled regression results reported in
columns (6) and (7) of table 6 above. We show both total mean WTP for the marginal precinct, as well
as a break-down of this WTP into its individual components, i.e. tax, ideology, other, and residual. The
WTP attributable to taxes, which averages -$266, is nearly constant throughout the distribution in both
years. This finding implies that the characteristics that drive tax incidence (i.e., car commuting and home
size) do not differ substantially across precincts with high vs. low support for the carbon tax. The WTP
attributable to the "other" category is also fairly constant across precincts, averaging -$80 in 2016 and $16
in 2018. The residual component is $0 on average but turns slightly positive in the left tail and slightly
negative in the right, i.e. unobservables tend to be relatively more important in explaining extreme voting
outcomes than average outcomes. Ideology is clearly the main driver of variation in WTP across precincts,
ranging from about -$1000 to $1000 in 2016 and about -$1200 to $1500 in 2018. The wider range in 2018
is consistent with our findings above that the 2018 policy was more ideologically salient, gaining support
in liberal precincts and losing support in conservative ones. Finally, note that if we focus on the median
precinct (i.e., 0.5 on the horizontal axis), we find that the WTP due to the tax remains near -$266 while

whereas we estimate average preferences in Washington for a state-level carbon tax.

carbon tax in each year. The vertical axis measures, for the marginal precinct, total WTP along with a
break-down of its individual components (i.e., tax, ideology, other, and residual). To estimate marginal WTP,
we sort precincts from lowest to highest WTP, divide them into percentiles, and calculate mean WTP within
each percentile. In constructing percentiles, we weight by total carbon tax votes cast; thus, each percentile
represents the same number of voters. Likewise, when calculating mean WTP within each percentile, we
weight by total votes cast.

the WTP due to all non-tax factors is near-zero. Thus, the figure clearly illustrates that, while ideology is
the main driver of variation in WTP across precincts, for the median precinct and average voter, aversion
to taxes dominates all other factors.

6      Could a carbon tax pass in other states?
    How would policies like I-732 and I-1631 fare in other states? This is a key question for carbon tax policy
entrepreneurs hoping to apply lessons from the Washington State experience to other states. In this section,
we use precinct-level voting data from Washington as well as survey data from our MTurk sample to forecast
support for I-732 and I-1631 in states other than Washington.

6.1     Forecast based on precinct-level voting in Washington

    We construct a set of 50 out-of-sample forecasts for the hypothetical statewide vote on I-732 and I-1631
by applying coefficients from a regression of the precinct-level vote in Washington State to the observed
state-level demographics and presidential vote shares in all 50 states.55 , 56 We base these forecasts on the
same specification as model (3) in table 2 above (i.e., Republican share plus census demographics) but
estimated separately for 2016 and 2018 (see appendix tables 8 and 9). This forecast implicitly assumes
that Washington's precincts are microcosms of U.S. states and that voters in other states are confronted
with identical ballot language, voter guides, media exposure, and so forth leading up to the 2016 and 2018
elections. The forecast further assumes that voters with certain characteristics in Washington vote in the
same way as voters with the same characteristics elsewhere, such that the coefficients can be applied to these
other states. Finally, the forecast abstracts away from the fact that measures identical to I-732 and I-1631
would be impossible in many states, e.g. due to the fact that popular initiatives are not allowed, or due to
pre-existing taxes or restrictions on how various sources of tax revenue may be used.

    Figure 11 plots the resulting state-level forecasts for "yes" on I-732 (hollow dots) and I-1631 (full dots)
versus the ranked Republican vote share in the 2016 presidential election. States that feature the popular
initiative are shown in black, while states that lack a popular initiative are shown in gray. Overall, states
with higher Republican vote shares would be less likely to pass these measures, which is consistent with
ideology driving the vote for a carbon tax. The individual state forecasts do not decrease monotonically
with Republican vote share due to variation in the composition of the electorate for variables other than the
  55 Our state-level demographics come from the U.S. Census and measure the same variables in the same years as our precinct-

level data from Washington but at the state level (e.g., share of people living in California aged 40-44). Our presidential voting
data come from the U.S. Federal Elections Commission and record statewide vote shares for various parties in the 2016 U.S.
presidential election. See here: https://transition.fec.gov/pubrec/fe2016/federalelections2016.pdf. We use these data
to calculate the share voting Republican (vs. Democrat) for each state.
  56 Recall that we define our variables based on shares of voters, people, households, and so forth living in different Washington

precincts. Thus, we can apply our regression coefficients directly to the corresponding state-level aggregate variables from other
states, and obtain the same forecast were we to instead apply our coefficients to the corresponding precinct-level variables from
other states (which we do not observe) and then aggregate to the state level.

Republican vote share.

  Which states would be most likely to pass a carbon tax? Figure 12 zooms in on the ten states with the
lowest Republican share and provides confidence intervals. Only three of these states--Washington, Mas-
sachusetts, and California--feature a popular initiative mechanism.57 Even ignoring that fact, we forecast
that no other state would pass I-732, while just one state--Vermont, which lacks a popular initiative--would
pass the more progressive I-1631. Of the initiative states, we forecast that Massachusetts comes closest to
passing I-1631 with 49.1% of votes in favor and a 95% confidence interval that reaches to 49.7%.
  57 Moreover,                               the difficulty in getting on the ballot is highly variable across states. Massachusetts is notoriously difficult to

Note: This figure plots out-of-sample forecasts by state for the share voting "yes" on I-732 in 2016 (hollow dots) and I-1631
in 2018 (full dots) versus the ranked Republican vote share in the 2016 presidential election. Forecasts are based on regression
model (3) in appendix table 8 (for 2016) and regression model (3) in appendix table 9 (for 2018). State forecasts are generated
by applying coefficients from these precinct-level regressions to the same variables measured at the state level in all 50 states.
States that feature a popular initiative mechanism are shown in black, while states that lack an initiative process are shown in
gray. Point estimates are represented by circles, while 95% confidence intervals are represented by vertical lines.

  Since I-1631 is more progressive than I-732, we should expect it to perform relatively better in liberal
states and relatively worse in conservative states. This hypothesis is borne out in figure 11. On the left side
of the figure (more liberal), the I-1631 forecast (full dots) tends to exceed the I-732 forecast (hollow dots).
Meanwhile, on the right side of the figure (more conservative), the pattern is reversed.58 However, there is
still important variation across states explained by other voter characteristics. For example, among the ten
most liberal states in figure 12, we forecast that I-1631 would do better than I-732 in Massachusetts and
Vermont but marginally worse in California and Hawaii.59

  Overall, the forecasts in figure 11 align closely with the status of carbon pricing across states: gener-

navigate, while Washington and California are easier.
  58 We confirm this pattern in appendix figure 23, which directly forecasts the difference in state vote shares based on model

(3) in table 3 above.
  59 Our forecast that I-1631 performs marginally worse in California and Hawaii is due, in part, to the high shares of Asians and

Pacific Islanders in these states--and the fact that, within Washington, I-1631 tends to perform worse than I-732 in precincts
with higher shares for these demographic groups. Indeed, when we omit our controls for race and ethnicity altogether, we
forecast that I-1631 performs better than I-732 in California and Hawaii.



                                                                                37
ally, states for which we forecast a higher vote share are already active in carbon regulation, even if not
through a carbon tax. California already has an economy-wide cap-and-trade program. Meanwhile, many
Northeastern states are participant to the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) and its cap-and-
trade program for electricity-sector emissions. These states include Vermont (highest forecasted vote share
for I-1631), Massachusetts, New York, Maryland, Rhode Island, Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, and New
Hampshire. The U.S. Climate Alliance--a coalition of states that has committed to meeting the Paris Cli-
mate Accord's abatement goals in the wake of the U.S. federal government's decision to withdraw--includes
California, six of nine RGGI states, and Hawaii, Washington, Oregon, Colorado, Virginia, Minnesota, and
North Carolina.60

6.2     Forecast based on individual-level survey data

  Our survey data allow us to estimate state-level support for the carbon tax more directly: instead of
relying on voting data only for Washington, we use our I-1631 survey question that residents from all states
answered. While our survey includes thousands of respondents from all 50 states, this sample is not large
enough to naively disaggregate the survey by state. Small states such as North Dakota and Alaska have far
too few respondents, while large states such as California and Texas may have enough.

  Multiple regression and poststratification (MRP) is a newly popular alternative for generating valid small-
area estimates with modest survey samples (Gelman and Little 1997; Park, Gelman, and Bafumi 2004;
Lax and Phillips 2009). This estimation procedure also helps to address the unrepresentative sampling in
our MTurk data. Indeed, Gelman, Goel, Rivers, and Rothschild (2016) use MRP to address even deeper
sampling problems in a survey fielded on the Xbox gaming console. Intuitively, the MRP procedure first
estimates a multilevel predictive model using respondents' observed covariates (i.e., demographics and par-
tisanship), along with state-specific effects. Then, the procedure generates state-level predictions based
on the covariates--re-weighted to match a given state's observed demographics and partisanship--plus the
estimated state-specific effect. Crucially, for this prediction, the procedure puts relatively less weight on
individual-level data for states with fewer observations, and more weight on the model. This is called
"borrowing strength" in the MRP literature.

  We use two alternative strategies for generating post-stratification weights for the state-level aggregate
data. Our first approach draws weights from the pooled American Community Survey from the U.S. Census
(2012-2017; 17 million observations), which is the most common approach in the MRP literature. However,
Census data only contain information on demographics and geography61 --not partisanship, which may
be particularly important in this context. Our second approach addresses this limitation by pooling all

org/. Maryland, Maine, and New Hampshire are the only RGGI states that are not alliance members--and note that Maine
and New Hampshire have the lowest forecast vote shares among RGGI states.
  61 Specifically, we poststratify on the interaction of race and sex, age, education, marital status, and state of residence.

Cooperate Congressional Election Study (CCES) surveys from 2006-2017, which comprises roughly 400,000
total observations. This smaller sample restricts the complexity of the multilevel regression model that we
can run.62 Thus, we obtain somewhat noisier poststratification weights for our geographic-demographic-
partisan cells.63 Nevertheless, if partisanship (or ideology) is the dominant predictor of individuals' specific
issue opinions, trading a smaller sample for the ability to poststratify on ideology or partisanship might be
worth it. In practice, both stratification approaches give similar results. The second approach (i.e., that
stratifies by partisanship) leads to a slight improvement in fit. Thus, we use this second approach to present
our results.

                We validate these estimates using a survey question about U.S. House vote expectation,64 which we then
compare to the actual state-level U.S. House popular vote. See figure 13, which plots the actual house vote
  62 Here, we poststratify on three-category party identification (i.e., Democrat, Republican, and non-major party/Independent),

race, age, and state of residence.
  63 An alternative approach for generating post-stratification weights that reflect partisanship would be to add extra stages to

MRP instead of choosing a different poststratification target (Kastellec, Lax, Malecki, and Phillips 2015).
  64 We obtain similar results using the U.S. House vote intention. For a comparison of expectation and intention, see Rothschild

and Wolfers (2013).

Note: The left panel plots the estimated `yes" vote share on the I-1631 carbon fee based on multilevel regression with post-
stratification (MRP) vs. the actual Republican House vote share, by state. For comparison, the right panel instead plots the
unadjusted "yes" vote share from the MTurk survey data vs. the actual Republican House vote share. In both panels, dashed
lines correspond to OLS fitted values.

versus our forecast. The black line represents a perfect fit. The right panel of figure 13 shows the results for
naive disaggregation by state. The disaggregated results are correlated with the actual election outcomes
(r=0.50), but they are pretty badly off (RMSE=0.14). Meanwhile, the left panel shows the results based on
our MRP procedure. Actual and estimated outcomes match closely in terms of both correlation (r=0.94)
and correspondence (RMSE=0.06). Thus, MRP has erased much of the bias in our MTurk survey and allows
us to predict House votes quite accurately.

                             Next, we switch to survey opinion on the I-1631 style carbon tax. See figure 14. Again, the left panel
shows the MRP estimates, while the right panel shows the naive disaggregated estimates. We focus on the
MRP results in the left panel. As expected, more liberal states such as Hawaii and Vermont show greater
support for the policy than conservative states such as Idaho and Wyoming. However, we note three striking
observations. First, the overall level of support is surprisingly high, exceeding 65% in every state. This is in
large part a reflection of the very high levels of national support for the policy in the survey, including from
Republicans and conservatives. Second, support in Washington is substantially lower than we would predict
based on the U.S. House Republican vote alone (the horizontal axis). This gap could be interpreted as the

impact of exposure to the actual electoral campaign of I-1631 (and I-732), in which opponents spent twice
as much as supporters. This result suggests that estimates of high support may be biased upward by the
hypothetical character of the carbon tax in states other than Washington. Third, the MRP estimate for I-
1631 in Washington is considerably higher than the actual outcome. Interestingly, the only published opinion
poll we could find on I-1631--the Elway Poll, conducted one month before the election--also overestimated
support for the initiative.65

  Why is support for I-1631 so low in Washington? Compare the gap in support for the carbon tax in
Washington relative to other states (figure 14, left panel) to the gap in support for the Kyoto treaty (figure
15).66 A traditional environmentally progressive position would be to sign the treaty. Figure 15 shows
that more conservative states are more likely to oppose ratifying Kyoto, as expected. At the same time,
Washington State is no outlier, as it was for the carbon tax question. The difference between the two
questions is obvious: Washington was exposed to a real-world campaign featuring strong arguments from
the opposition against the carbon tax, but not so for the Kyoto treaty. This comparison parallels the

signatory not to do so).

analysis in section 4.2.2 above, where we estimate a campaign effect of negative 20 percentage points using
a difference-in-differences approach.

  Why is the MRP approach over-predicting support for I-1631 in Washington compared to the actual vote
there in 2018? Could it be that the MRP process is somehow failing to fully adjust for the liberal MTurk
sample? To answer this question, we use MRP to model state-level support for repealing the Affordable
Care Act (ACA), President Obama's big health care reform package from 2009--an issue question we posed
to respondents in our MTurk survey. Figure 16 plots our state-level MRP estimates versus the actual U.S.
House vote in 2018. Support for repealing the ACA rises with the Republican share, just as we would expect.
Note that the average level of support across the states is about 50%. This result is consistent with high-
frequency, national-level polling data on the ACA by organizations such as the Kaiser Family Foundation,
which show that the country is split roughly equally between support and opposition.67 Thus, our MRP
estimates using MTurk data are not systematically biased, but are consistent with nationally representative
surveys--at least when focusing on well-known federal policy issues such as the Affordable Care Act.

  Overall, our MRP-adjusted national survey data predicts that, across states, support for a carbon tax falls

                                                                                                                     42
as the House Republican vote share increases. The states most likely to pass a carbon tax are Maryland,
New York, Massachusetts, Vermont, and Pennsylvania (see figure 14). These states are--with the exception
of Pennsylvania--all among the top ten most likely to pass a carbon tax according to our forecasts using
actual voting data (see figure 12). Overall, forecasts using national survey data and actual voting data from
Washington lead to similar rankings (compare figure 11 and figure 14). However, the forecast based on the
actual vote in Washington implies much lower levels of support, since it reflects Washington's actual voting
experience, including the negative campaign effect. The forecasts using voting data are likely to be more
realistic: they caution that passing a state carbon tax is going to be difficult but perhaps feasible in a handful
of liberal states such as Massachusetts.

7      Conclusion
    Climate policy is one of the most politically polarized topics in the United States, making the adoption of
federal legislation to limit greenhouse emissions especially difficult. States represent a potentially valuable
laboratory for learning about the politics of climate policy--including the politics of Pigouvian taxes on
carbon emissions, which are the subject of substantial research by economists.

    We analyze two failed carbon tax initiatives in Washington State using both precinct-level aggregate voting
data from Washington and carefully weighted MTurk survey data for the entire United States. Comparing
the carbon tax with other environmental policies across states, we show that the campaigns in Washington
State caused support for the carbon tax to fall by 20 percentage points. This difference-in-differences finding
is consistent with the "no" campaign spending twice as much as the "yes" campaign in 2018. We estimate
that the direct economic incidence of the carbon tax is similar across Washington's precincts on average.
Thus, for the median precinct, resistance to higher energy prices--combined with a near total disregard for
tax rebates and green spending--can explain why voters rejected the two carbon taxes. However, ideology
can easily overpower pocketbook concerns. Indeed, we show that that ideology is by far the best and most
important predictor of variation in support for the carbon tax across precincts, explaining more than 90%
of the variation in vote shares.

    What do our results imply about the prospects for carbon taxes at the state level? After all, nationwide
surveys--including ours--show strong majorities in favor and support that extends even to the most conser-
vative states in the country. However, we present evidence based on actual voting and survey data showing
that this support is shallow and can be significantly weakened through campaign spending. Overall, our
results suggest that a carbon tax modeled on recent policies from Washington State would--without deeper
efforts to inform and persuade voters--be unlikely to pass in the near term. The best prospects for a carbon
tax continue to be in liberal states, especially in Massachusetts, where voters are likely to prefer policies that
spend tax revenue on liberal objectives. However, even in a liberal state, positioning carbon taxes too far


                                                       43
left by eschewing revenue-neutrality may galvanize conservative and industry opposition, as seems to have
been the case for I-1631 in Washington.

  What political levers might carbon tax advocates pull to boost support and deflect opposition? Future
attempts to pass a carbon tax at the state level can learn from our estimates for the combined effects of
ideological positioning and campaigns. Washington's experience shows that a revenue-neutral policy can
appeal to moderates and conservatives--or at least limit their opposition--while a tax-and-spend policy can
appeal to liberals. But careful policy design does not seem to be enough, for both ends of the political
continuum were tried in Washington State, and both failed. For a revenue-neutral policy like I-732 to win at
the polls, voters must be informed and convinced that--though they will pay higher energy prices--they will
benefit from lower taxes elsewhere. Likewise, for a tax-and-spend policy like I-1631 to win, voters must be
convinced that the new spending has real value. Persuading voters could, in the end, prove too costly in the
short term. Alternatively, a traditional legislative strategy to adopt carbon taxes may prove promising. If
not, successful attempts may have to await further changes in public opinion (perhaps pushed by generational
change), or elite position change (more conservative elites changing their mind on climate).

  As can be seen, some environmental groups did not support I-732. Sierra Club's (Washington Chapter)
official position statement on I-732 contains a particularly cogent and explicit expression of this reasoning.
We reproduce this statement in its entirety here:

     September 2016
     Sierra Club has adopted a Do Not Support position concerning Initiative 732, rather than Sup-
     port, Neutral, or Oppose. Given the urgency of the climate crisis, this was not a decision reached

                                                       48
      lightly. Members of the Club expressed deep concerns that the initiative does not include all that
      is needed for an equitable climate policy and just transition to a clean energy economy, while at
      same time, other members of the Club worked tirelessly in support of the initiative. Sierra Club
      is taking a Do Not Support position because:
        · Communities of color and low-income people are almost always the ones most impacted
          by pollution and climate change, and as a result they need to be at the front and center
          of discussions for how to address the problem and mitigate the impacts of both climate
          change and environmental policy. That wasn't the approach taken by I-732. As a result,
          the initiative fails to affirmatively address any of the stated needs of those communities:
          more investment in green jobs, energy efficiency, transit, housing, and renewable energy
          infrastructure.
        · There remains justifiable concern about I-732's revenue projections. While I-732 was in-
          tended to be revenue neutral, the State Department of Revenue predicts I-732 will result in
          about $200 million of lost revenue per year in its first four years. A subsequent analysis by
          Sightline Institute, a respected environmental think tank, found flaws in the state forecast
          but still estimated a nearly $80 million annual revenue loss over the same time period. At
          a time when our state needs additional revenue to fund education, parks, environmental
          programs, and social services, we are concerned about any projected revenue cuts.
      Whether I-732 passes or not, the Sierra Club is committed to working together as a movement
      after the election with our allies in the labor, social justice, immigrant, and Tribal communities
      to support efforts to stop climate change and preserve a clean, healthy environment for future
      generations.

  What about elected officials? 24 of 147 elected state legislators made public endorsement decisions on
I-732. All were in favor of the initiative, so we compare endorsers with non-endorsers. Figure 17 shows this
comparison, divided by party. Democrats who endorsed I-732 hardly differed from their colleagues who made
no such pronouncements. On the other hand, Republicans who endorsed I-732 were decidedly more liberal
than those who refused to endorse. This suggests that these endorsements are cheap talk for Democrats but
a costly signal for Republicans.

  The only sitting legislator who had a position on I-1631 was Senator Reuven Carlyle, who is actually in
the most conservative quarter of his party. It is unclear why I-1631 attracted so much less attention from
state legislators than I-732.

Note: The top panel of this figure plots the "yes" shares on I-1631 in 2018 (solid line) and I-732 in 2016 (dashed line) by decile
of the Republican party vote share in the U.S. Senate election in the corresponding year. Each decile contains precincts that
together add up to one tenth of votes cast in 2016 and 2018 respectively. Deciles for 2018 are constructed from precinct-level
data in the following way: sort precincts from the lowest to the highest Republican vote share in 2018, and then determine
decile cutoffs. Deciles for 2016 (dashed line) are constructed similarly. Thus, the overall vote share can be visualized as the
average height of the points.
The bottom panel plots the difference by decile. Deciles are constructed for 2018 and 2016 as in the top panel. Thus, the
overall difference in vote shares between 2018 and 2016 can be visualized as the average height of the points.

Note: This figure plots out-of-sample forecasts by state for the change in share voting "yes" on a carbon tax (2018 vs. 2016)
versus the ranked Republican vote share in the 2016 presidential election. Forecasts are based on regression model (3) in table
3. State forecasts are generated by applying coefficients from this precinct-level regression to the same variables measured at
the state level in all 50 states. States that feature a popular initiative mechanism are shown in black, while states that lack an
initiative process are shown in gray. The top panel shows all states, while the bottom panel shows the ten states with the lowest
Republican vote share. Point estimates are represented by circles, while 95% confidence intervals are represented by vertical
lines.

Note: Note: This table presents coefficient estimates from precinct-level OLS regressions modeling the share voting "yes"
for the carbon tax in 2016 as a function of ideology, demographics, and other factors. Conservatism measures ideology
on a 0-1 index, computed from the precinct's vote shares on 12 ballot measures in 2016 and 2018 (see appendix figure 18).
Republican measures the share voting for the Republican (vs. Democratic) party candidate in the 2016 U.S. presidential
election. Endorsement indicates that the precinct's state legislator declared his or her support for I-732. Turnout is
measured as the total number of ballots cast in 2016 divided by the total number of registered voters. Voted on carbon tax
measures the total number of votes cast for or against the carbon tax in 2016 divided by the total number of ballots cast
in 2016. Models (3)-(7) build cumulatively on model (2). Model (3) controls for detailed census variables (i.e., commute
time by car, industry, home value, # rooms, income, gender, age, race, and education). Model (4) then adds ideology.
Model (5) then adds the endorsement variable. Model (6) then adds county fixed effects. Finally, model (7) adds the
two turnout variables. For all models, precincts are weighted by the total votes cast for the Republican or Democratic
candidate in the 2016 presidential election. Standard errors are clustered by county (39 clusters).

Note: This table presents coefficient estimates from precinct-level OLS regressions modeling the share voting "yes" for
the carbon tax in 2018 as a function of ideology, demographics, and other factors. Conservatism measures ideology on
a 0-1 index, computed from the precinct's vote shares on 12 ballot measures in 2016 and 2018 (see appendix figure 18).
Republican measures the share voting for the Republican (vs. Democratic) party candidate in the 2016 U.S. presidential
election. Endorsement indicates that the precinct's state legislator declared his or her support for I-732. Turnout is
measured as the total number of ballots cast in 2016 divided by the total number of registered voters. Voted on carbon tax
measures the total number of votes cast for or against the carbon tax in 2018 divided by the total number of ballots cast
in 2016. Models (3)-(7) build cumulatively on model (2). Model (3) controls for detailed census variables (i.e., commute
time by car, industry, home value, # rooms, income, gender, age, race, and education). Model (4) then adds ideology.
Model (5) then adds the endorsement variable. Model (6) then adds county fixed effects. Finally, model (7) adds the
two turnout variables. For all models, precincts are weighted by the total votes cast for the Republican or Democratic
candidate in the 2016 presidential election. Standard errors are clustered by county (39 clusters).

Note: This table presents coefficient estimates from pooled precinct-level OLS regressions modeling the share voting "yes"
for the carbon tax in 2016 and 2018 as a function of ideology, demographics, and other factors. Conservatism measures
ideology on a 0-1 index, computed from the precinct's vote shares on 12 ballot measures in 2016 and 2018 (see appendix
figure 18). Republican measures the share voting for the Republican (vs. Democratic) party candidate in one or more
U.S. Senate elections. 2018 vote is an indicator for the 2018 carbon tax (I-1631). Model (1) omits Republican share.
Models (2) and (3) relate voting on the carbon tax to the Republican share in the 2016 U.S. Senate election. Models (4)
and (5) relate voting on the carbon tax in a given year to the Republican share in the U.S. Senate election from the same
year (i.e., voting on I-732 is matched to the Republican share in the 2016 election and voting on I-1631 is matched to the
Republican share in the 2018 election). Models (6) and (7) relate voting on the carbon tax to a weighted average of the
Republican share in the U.S. Senate elections from 2016 (2/3 weight) and 2018 (1/3 weight). For all models, precincts are
weighted by the total votes cast for the Republican or Democratic candidate in the 2016 presidential election. Standard
errors are clustered by county (39 clusters).

Note: This table summarizes the results of five separate linear probability (OLS) models of the survey response to a question
about the I-1631 ballot language. All models weight observations using inverse probability weights based on sex, marital status,
race, age, education, religious observance, and political party using the 2018 exit poll (using R's svyglm command). Models
(3)-(5) include a measure of latent ideology estimated from 53 individual issue questions elsewhere in the survey (appendix B).

Note: This table summarizes the results of three separate logistic models of the survey response to a question about the I-
1631 ballot language. All models weight observations using inverse probability weights based on sex, marital status, race, age,
education, religious observance, and political party using the 2018 exit poll (using R's svyglm command). Non-Environmental
Ideology estimates latent ideology from 42 issue questions that are not about the environment or energy. Environmental Ideology
estimates latent ideology from the 11 questions on the environment and energy (appendix B).
