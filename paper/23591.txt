                                          ABSTRACT

We develop a demographically-based approach for estimating the utility discount rate (UDR)
portion of the Ramsey rule. We show how age-specific mortality rates and life expectancies
imply a natural UDR for individuals at each age in a population, and these can be aggregated into
a population-level social UDR. We then provide empirical estimates for nearly all countries and
for the world as a whole. A striking part of the analysis is how the estimated UDRs fall within the
range of those currently employed in the macroeconomics and climate change literatures. We use
our results to derive heterogenous social discount rates across countries and explore the
consequences for an integrated assessment model of climate change. We find that introducing
regional heterogeneity of UDRs into the RICE model has little impact on the business-as-usual
trajectory of global emissions. It does, however, change the trajectory of optimal emissions, the
corresponding optimal carbon tax, and the distribution of emission reductions across countries.

1         Introduction

Few topics in economics are as fundamental and generate as much controversy as discounting.
Bene t-cost analyses of long-lived public projectssuch as those related to environmental
protection, infrastructure, education, and healthrely heavily on social discounting. While
most regulatory agencies and sub- elds within economics have established procedures for
discounting future bene ts and costs, economists continue to debate what constitutes an
appropriate discount rate and, even more fundamentally, how discounting should be applied.
That the potential consequences of the debate are signi cant is well-known: because small
changes in the discount rate and procedures can have so much inuence on present value
calculations of long-lived projects, questions about discounting play a critical role in policy
evaluation.
        Within the last decade, economic analysis of climate change has brought many of the
important issues about long-term discounting to the fore, showing that whether more or
less aggressive climate policy passes a bene t-cost test depends critically on the social dis-
count rate. This is the central insight of the highly inuential and contrasting contributions
of Nicholas Stern (2007) and William Nordhaus (2007).1 Both employ the Ramsey-Cass-
Koopmans framework for discounting within integrated assessment models (IAMs) of cli-
mate change, yet they di¤er in an important way on their underlying assumptions about the
utility discount rate (UDR). In this context, the UDR represents a social planners rate of
pure time preference between generations irrespective of di¤erences in consumption.2 While
Stern uses a very low rate that supports more aggressive climate policy compared to Nord-
haus, the di¤erences in how they justify their assumptions are central the motivation of the
present paper. Stern follows classical economists and argues that the choice should be based
on ethical considerations, whereas Nordhaus argues that discounting should be consistent
with behavior reected in observable market interest rates.
    1
     Stern and Nordhaus have written several papers on the topic, but here we reference the original two
where the distinction and focus on the discount rate rst arose.
   2
     The UDR is a parameter of the Ramsey discounting equation that is sometimes referred to as the social
rate of pure time preference, in addition to other variants in the literature.



                                                    1
       The Stern-Nordhaus exchange rekindled a long-standing debate about prescriptive ver-
sus descriptive approaches to discounting (see, for example, Arrow et al. 1996), and sub-
sequent papers have sought to further clarify the role of normative and positive assumptions
implicit in the economics of climate change and discounting more generally.3 While the
existing literature furthers the understanding of conceptual issues surrounding the choice of
social discount rates, there remains relatively little empirical guidance on how to choose the
underlying parameters, especially with regard to the UDR in the standard Ramsey equa-
tion.4 As a result, researchers and policymakers are typically left to choose parameters based
on one of two approaches. The rst is a reliance on some ethical or normative criteria, many
of which push in opposite directions. The second is to back out values after calibrating to
observable parameters, including a priori assumptions about what the overall social discount
rate should be.
       In this paper, we develop an alternative, demographic approach for estimating the UDR
that serves as a useful benchmark. Rather than make a judgment about how a social planner
is to compare utilities across future generations, we exploit the fact that multiple generations
are extant in a population at any point in time, and the UDR can reect an aggregation over
how these generations care about their own future utility. We begin with the assumption
that individuals care about the future only to the extent that they live to enjoy it; that is,
individuals discount future utility according to their own mortality risk.5 We then derive
estimates of a mean and median social UDR based on the age structure of a population
and life expectancy at each age. Given actual life expectancies, the estimates inform periods
considered long-term for many policies (e.g., 50 to 80 years), and they can apply even further
into the future to the extent that population structures are stable.
       While our approach over-simpli es how individuals may, or may not, have preferences for
the distant future, arguments can be made in support of either over- or under-estimation.
   3
     Examples include Weitzman (2007), Dasgupta (2008), Goulder and Williams (2012), Arrow et al. (2012),
Schneider, Traeger, and Winkler (2012), and Gollier (2012).
   4
     The other parameters implicit in Ramsey discounting, which we will discuss in more detail later in the
paper, are the elasticity of the marginal utility of consumption and the rate of growth in consumption.
   5
     Note that this di¤ers from the risk of catastrophe at the population level, which has been discussed in
the literature as it relates to the UDR (e.g., Weitzman 2009; Dasgupta 2007; Goulder and Williams 2012).


                                                     2
Ones own concern for future generations would tend to lower the UDR, whereas general
impatience would tend to increase it. Unlike other approaches, however, the methodology
that we describe has an empirical and observable basis, thereby making it a useful point of
comparison for existing assumptions about the UDR in the literature. Indeed, our approach
shares the same basic structure as the macroeconomic literature on life-cycle models that
weight future utility based on survival probabilities.6 In e¤ect, the demographic basis of
our approach is descriptive at the individual level, and prescriptive in the population
aggregation, which is necessary to arrive at an overall social discount rate. We estimate
and discuss the two alternatives that we consider based on the mean or median of a pop-
ulation. Hence an advantage of our approach, as we will discuss, is that many normative
judgments about the discount rate can be anchored with an empirical basis and focus on
trade-o¤s among generations of the current population rather than assumptions about future
generations not yet born.
      We use the approach to empirically estimate UDRs for nearly all countries of the world
with detailed demographic data from the World Health Organization. A striking feature of
our results across countries is that they fall within the range economists generally employ
and consider reasonable. Overall, the approach yields global estimates of the UDR at 1.3
and 2.1 percent for the median and mean aggregation, respectively. When comparing the
results across countries, we emphasize the o¤setting role of two demographic e¤ects: age
and life expectancy. A younger age structure and longer life expectancy tends to decrease a
countrys UDR, because more years to live will cause individuals to discount the future less.
But, of course, a countrys age structure and life expectancies are closely related. Countries
that are younger tend to have shorter life expectancies (i.e., many developing countries),
whereas countries that are older tend to have longer life expectancies (i.e., many developed
countries). The result, as we will show, is that countries with very di¤erent demographic
pro les can have similar estimates of the UDR.
  6
    Yaari (1964) provides a seminal example, and recent papers use the same approach to explain patterns
of economic growth and observed interest rates (Carvalho, Ferrero, and Nechio 2016; Gagnon, Johannsen,
and Lopez-Salido 2016; Eggertsson, Mohrotra, and Robbins 2017).



                                                   3
      Our primary contribution is the demographically-based approach for estimating UDRs,
but we also place our empirical results in the context of deriving the overall social discount
rate, sometimes referred to as the consumption discount rate. Speci cally, we combine our
estimates of the UDR with estimates of the other parameters in the Ramsey equation. The
analysis is primarily illustrative, and we use a combination of expert opinion and country
speci c forecasts of economic growth. For example, based on Drupp et al.s (2015) survey of
experts on their views about consumption growth per capita (1.7 percent) and the elasticity
of marginal utility (1.35), our estimates of the worlds UDR imply social discount rates of
3.6 and 4.4 percent for the median and mean aggregation, respectively.7 In what follows, we
also estimate heterogenous social discount rates for each country based country-level UDRs
and forecasts of economic growth.
      Our approach provides a new methodology for deriving regionally-speci c UDRs, with
potential application to IAMs of climate change. We provide one such application using the
Regional Integrated Climate-Economy (RICE) model (Nordhaus and Yang 1996; Nordhaus
2010). We compare the results of two alternative calibrations: one where all 12 regions of
the model have the same global estimate of the UDR, and one where each region has its
own estimate of the UDR. We nd that introducing the heterogeneity has little a¤ect on
the business-as-usual trajectory of emissions. It does, however, have a meaningful e¤ect on
the e¢cient trajectory of emissions. We nd that adding the UDR heterogeneity results in
an e¢cient carbon tax that is 28 percent greater by the end of the century. Underlying the
aggregate e¤ects is a shift among countries such that those with lower UDRs reduce emissions
more. Not only does a lower UDR impose greater concern for future climate damages, as is
often noted in the literature, it also increases a countrys emissions trajectory as a result of
greater savings, capital accumulation, and output.
      The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. The next section develops our concep-
tual framework for deriving UDRs and contrasts it to previous approaches in the literature.
This includes papers by Eckstein (1961) and Kula (1985), in addition to the recent macore-
  7
    As we will discuss later, Drupp et al. (2015) also nd that the average estimate of the UDR among
economists is 1.1.

estimates: country-speci c and global results, along with an analysis of how demographic
trends over the last two decades a¤ect the estimates. Section 4 places our results in the con-
text of overall social (consumption) discount rates. Section 5 reports the results of our RICE
analysis. Finally, Section 6 concludes with a summary of our main results and a discussion
of broader implications.



2         Conceptual Framework

We begin with the standard motivation for long-term discounting of social welfare in the
Ramsey-Cass-Koopmans framework. There is an additively separable, utilitarian social wel-
fare function of the form
                                           1      t
                                          X     1
                                      W =             U (Ct ) ;                                            (1)
                                          t=0
                                               1+

where  is the UDR, and U () is assumed to be time invariant. The convention in this
literature is to assume a utility function that has a constant elasticity of the marginal utility
of consumption.8 Then, on the optimal growth path, where consumption grows at a constant
rate, di¤erentiating and rearranging (1) yields the well-known Ramsey equation:


                                                r =  + g;                                                (2)


where the long-term social discount rate r is the sum of two terms. The rst is the UDR,
often interpreted in this context as reecting the time discount rate across generations. The
second is the product of the elasticity of marginal utility , often interpreted as the degree
of inequality aversion across generations, and of the consumption growth rate g.
        Calibration of the Ramsey equation is fundamental to IAMs of climate change, as well
as long-term bene t cost analysis more generally. We will have more to say about  and g
later in the paper, but our primary concern for the time being is . As discussed previously,
    Speci cally, the functional form assumption is U (Ct ) = Ct1 =(1
    8
                                                                         ), where  is the constant elasticity
of the marginal utility of consumption.


                                                      5
a simpli ed assessment of the literature is that there are two camps for choosing values.
One side interprets  as an ethical parameter about concern for future generations, and this
perspective typically leads to values at or very close to zero (e.g., Stern 2007). The other side
emphasizes that r represents the real return on capital and should therefore be calibrated
to real-world interest and savings rates (e.g., Nordhaus 2007), and this perspective typically
favors higher values of the UDR after accounting simultaneously for  and g.
   Our approach di¤ers in that we seek to derive a mortality-based estimate of the utility
discount rate. Speci cally, we consider the UDR that a social planner might choose to
represent an existing population under the assumption that long-term discounting is based
on mortality risk. Note that we are not considering the risk to a population based on the
chances of a catastrophe, which is sometimes invoked as a justi cation for using a non-
zero UDR (e.g., Weitzman 2009; Dasgupta 2007; Goulder and Williams 2012). Instead, we
consider individual risks based on mortality rates and life expectancy. In doing so, we exploit
the fact that many generations are alive at any point in time, and the UDR can reect an
aggregation over how these generations care about their own future utility.
   Our aim is to provide an empirically-based estimate that can serve as a useful benchmark
for evaluating normative judgments and the potential importance of heterogeneity across
populations (e.g., countries). While the approach clearly misses other possible motives that
are likely to a¤ect long-term discounting, some of which we discuss later in the paper, we
argue that it provides a useful benchmark to a question in economics that generates much
controversy with little direction on how the debate should be resolved.
   It has long been recognized that uncertainty about survival a¤ects the way individuals
discount the future and therefore make intertemporal choices. Frederick, Loewenstein, and
ODonoghue (2002) provide a quotation from Rae (1834) that goes back almost a century
before Ramsey:

      When engaged in safe occupations, and living in healthy countries, men are much

      more apt to be frugal, than in unhealthy, or hazardous occupations, and in climates

      pernicious to human life. Sailors and soldiers are prodigals. In the West Indies, New

                                               6
         Orleans, the East Indies, the expenditure of the inhabitants is profuse. The same

         people, coming to reside in the healthy parts of Europe, and not getting into the

         vortex of extravagant fashion, live economically. War and pestilence have always waste

         and luxury, among the other evils that follow in their train (Rae 1834 p. 57).


More recently, Fisher (1930) is well-known for having shown how survival probabilities are
important for understanding trade-o¤s between present and future consumption, and Samuel-
son (1958) uses mortality as a foundation in his seminal life-cycle model of lending markets.
       Closely related to our approach in this paper, Eckstein (1961) describes a way that one
can quantitatively infer a mortality-based UDR. He writes that


         The utility to be enjoyed at each future moment must be multiplied by the probability

         of being alive at that time, and since this probability falls with the remoteness of the

         period, a kind of pure discount factor emerges (Eckstein 1961 p. 456).


Eckstein (1961) goes on to describe that while this approach assumes individuals place no
bequest value on wealth they leave behind upon death, it does suggest a pure rate of time
preference that can be used for comparative purposes across countries where mortality rates
may di¤er substantially.9
       To begin operationalizing the approach, assume that individuals have xed preferences
                                                                             i
over time, and a time varying discount factor, denoted                           (t). We can therefore write an
individuals intertemporal utility function as

                                                T i
                                                X
                                            i              i
                                          U =                  (t)u(cit ),                                      (3)
                                                 t=0


where T i is the individuals expected years left to live from year t = 0. Because we are
                                                                                          i
interested in a mortality-based discount factor, we can think of                              (t) as a probabilistic
survival function to year t, which is itself a function of the individuals probability of death
   9
    Beyond the general idea, our approach di¤ers from what Eckstein (1961) actually does in his application
to the United States and India. We describe how the approaches di¤er after establishing our framework.



                                                       7
                            i
at age in year t, denoted       (t). It follows that (3) can be expanded to

                                           T Yi
                                           X
                                         i                          i
                                       U =    (1                        (t))u(cit ).           (4)
                                             t=0    t


Note that as the probability of death increases with age (over time), the discount factor
decreases.
   The social planner is then tasked with choosing a long-term UDR, , for use in the social
welfare function speci ed in (1). We therefore seek an estimate of  i for i = 1; :::; n in the
population to represent each individuals preference for a long-run UDR, after which we
consider di¤erent aggregation rules the social planner could employ over the n individuals.
   To capture individual long-term preferences for ones own UDR, we need a statistic to
                                   i
summarize the time varying             (t) in equation (3) over ones expected lifetime. Under the
assumption of a constant rate, the natural solution is to take the geometric mean of the
mortality-based discount factors that the individual is expected to face over t = 0; : : : ; T i .
Speci cally, this implies a constant discount factor of

                                           2                               3   1

                                                                       

Raising both sides of this expression to T i , a useful property of the statistic is that

That is, our summary statistic of a constant discount factor implies the same probability of
survival in the year of life expectancy as the cumulative e¤ect of the time varying mortality
rates over the individuals expected life years remaining.
   With this estimate of the discount factor in hand, we can back out the implied UDR
for the individual, which as indicated above we denote as  i . By de nition, the UDR must




                                                        8
         i           i
satisfy ^ = 1=(1 + ^ ), and this implies


                                               ^ i = 1        1:                                      (7)
                                                      ^i

Implicitly, each individual has a mortality-based UDR that is a function of future mortality
rates at age and life expectancy.
       Returning now to the social planners perspective, there is the important question about
                   i
how to aggregate ^ for i = 1; :::; n into a single measure of  for use in the social welfare
function (1). Any aggregation requires a normative stance on the weighting across individ-
uals, and there is an existing literature on aggregating individuals time preferences into a
planners objective function.10 Here, however, we are generally agnostic about how such
weighting should occur, but consider two aggregation rules because of their simplicity and
frequent applicationmean and median. The mean UDR among individuals in the popula-
tion is simply
                                                           n
                                               = 1
                                                     X i
                                                         ^ :                                          (8)
                                                   n i=1

One justi cation for using the mean is that it represents the mortality-based rate of the
representative (i.e., expected) individual in the population. The median UDR is de ned as


                                        ~ = Median(^ 1 ; :::; ^ n ):                                (9)


While this approach provides a useful point of comparison, it can also be justi ed as consis-
tent with the democratic principle of majority rule.
       Regardless of the aggregation, the population estimates of the UDR built up in this
way can be interpreted in two ways. The rst is representative of the current population
from t = 0 to t ! 1. The second is a time-invariant estimate for a stable population
structure. The latter is compelling because future generations are implicitly taken into
  10
    Papers that focus on e¢ciency conditions include Li and Löfgren (2000) and Gollier and Zeckhauser
(2005). A recent paper by Millner and Heal (2014) compares economic and political approaches to aggregation
across information and commitment conditions.



                                                      9
account: as individuals age they are always replaced by those who are younger and face
the same mortality risks, resulting is a stable estimate of the UDR through time. Both
interpretations are consistent with frequent scenarios requiring a long-term discount rate,
and we examine the stability of estimates over time in the next section.

   Relation to previous studies.As mentioned previously, Eckstein (1961) derives an
estimate of the social UDR for select countries based on mortality rates, but his approach,
in addition to a subsequent application by Kula (1985), di¤ers from ours. Speci cally, they
estimate an individuals UDR as the geometric mean of expected mortality rates over the life
cycle, rather than the geometric mean of the implied discount factor. In our view, there is no
consistent basis for taking the geometric mean of the mortality rates, whereas there is for the
discount factor because it actually follows a geometric process (see equation 4). Moreover,
a mortality rate in any period will have a di¤erent interpretation than a discount rate. This
follows because we know that    =1      = 1=(1+), which implies  = =(1       ) and therefore
  <  rather than    = , which is what Eckstein (1961) and Kula (1985) implicitly assume.
This explains, in part, why our approach results in slightly higher estimates of the UDR for
the select countries that Eckstein and Kula consider (the United States and India, and the
United Kingdom, respectively) when using the same data. The other reason the estimates
di¤er is that our approach is calibrated to exactly match the mortality rates individuals
are expected to face at their life expectancy (see equation 6), whereas Eckstein and Kulas
approach substantially overestimates the probability of survival, which lowers the discount
rate as a consequence. More generally, our approach is also consistent with that taken in the
recent macroeconomics literature that seeks to account for survival probabilities in life-cycle
models (Carvalho, Ferrero, and Nechio 2016; Gagnon, Johannsen, and Lopez-Salido 2016;
Eggertsson, Mohrotra, and Robbins 2017).

3        Estimation of Social Utility Discount Rates

We now turn to estimating mortality-based UDRs for nearly all countries of the world and
for the world as a whole. We obtain demographic data from two sources. The rst is country-
speci c life tables from the Global Health Observatory (GHO) data repository of the World
Health Organization (WHO).11 These tables report age-speci c mortality rates by gender
and binned in the following age classes: < 1 year, 1-4 years, 5-9 years,. . . , 90-94 years, 95-
99 years, and 100+ years. They also include life expectancies at age (i.e., the expectation
of additional years to live) for each bin and gender. The life tables are available for 194
countries. We use the 2012 tables for our primary estimates, but also use tables for 1990
and 2000 to examine how the results have changed over time.
       The second source of data is country-speci c population estimates from the United Na-
tions Population Division.12 These include the number of people in each country by ve-year
age groups and by gender. The estimates are available every ve years. We associate these
data for the year 2010 with the 2012 WHO life tables. When conducting the same analysis
back to 1990 and 2000, we associate the UN and WHO data for that same year.13
       These two sources of data are su¢cient to estimate a population-level, social UDR as
described in the previous section for nearly all countries of the world. To see the precise
steps involved, rst consider how to derive the UDR for an individual of a particular age
within a speci c country. Take the example of a 52 year old female in the United States.
Based on the 2012 WHO life table for the United States, she has a remaining life expectancy
of 33.15 years; that is, she has a full life expectancy of 85.15 years conditional on having
reached age 52. For each of her expected remaining years, we also have an estimate of her
  11
     We obtained the data with queries through the GHOs web service, Athena. Links with instructions on
how to make data queries are available at http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.resources.api
  12
     The data are available at https://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/Download/Standard/Population/
  13
     When merging the two data sets, one adjustment is needed in the rst age bin. The WHO data on
mortality rates and life expectancy disaggregates the rst age bin (0-4 years) into two, providing data for
individuals <1 year old and individuals 1-4 years old. In the UN data, however, the population statistics are
for the whole bin of 0-4 years old. We can nevertheless decompose the population statistics in the UN data
using the mortality rates in the WHO data. After doing so, our analysis is based on bins from <1, 1-4, and
5-year increments all the way up to 100+.




                                                     11
survival probability from the WHO data, although the estimate is the same for each year
within an age bin. We can therefore take the geometric average as described in equation (5)
with the following numerical values:


       ^ i = [(0:994)3 (0:991)5 (0:987)5 (0:987)5 (0:980)5 (0:968)5 (0:946)5 (0:871):15 ]( 33:15
                                                                                             1
                                                                                                 )
                                                                                                   = 0:978;


where the numbers in parentheses are 1 minus the mortality rate for the corresponding year.
Using this estimate, we then solve for the individuals UDR using equation (7) to nd that
^ i = 0:022, or equivalently 2.2 percent.

       Our procedure for individuals in a population begins with the same steps for the median
age in each bin and by gender.14 This produces an estimate of the UDR for each age group
and gender. Population estimates are then derived using the aggregation rules in either
equation (8) or (9), that is, the mean or median, based on the UN population data. The
mean estimate is therefore a population weighted average of the UDRs across age groups and
gender. The median estimate is the gender-weighted, average UDR for the bin containing
the person with the 50th percentile UDR.


3.1        Country-Speci c Results

We estimate social UDRs for 182 countries, all of those for which complete data are available.
We report the mean and median results in Appendix Table 1 for the most recent year, 2012.
We report the results for 1990 and 2000 in Supplementary Material Table S1, and make
explicit comparisons with the 1990 results below. We begin our analysis with a focus on the
mean aggregation, before making comparisons to the median.
       Figure 1 (panel A) shows the distribution of the mean estimates across countries that
range from 1.44 (Cambodia) to 3.50 (Bulgaria).15 The distribution is left skewed, and the
  14
    For the rst two and last categories we do not use the median, but rather ages 0, 2, and 100, respectively.
  15
    Countries with the 10 lowest estimates, in ascending order, are Cambodia, Guatemala, Rwanda, Hon-
duras, Gambia, Kenya, Ethiopia, Tanzania, Syria, and Qatar. Countries with the 10 highest estimates, in
descending order, are Bulgaria, Ukraine, Latvia, Russia, Serbia, Belarus, Hungary, Romania, Croatia, and
Lithuania.



                                                       12
median across the mean estimates is 2.01 percent. Figure 1 (panel B) illustrates the ge-
ographic heterogeneity. There is a clear pattern of higher rates in the northern latitudes,
especially in the former Soviet Union countries. The lower rates tend to be clustered in
Africa, Central America, and the Middle East. Underlying these results are two o¤setting
yet related e¤ects. The rst is that countries with longer life expectancies will have lower
UDRs, all else equal. This follows because a longer life expectancy means more years over
which individuals experience high survival rates. Yet empirically these same countries also
tend to have older populations, and this is the second e¤ect that pushes in the opposite
direction. Older populations will have higher rates, all else equal, because there are fewer
years over which to live, and these years include those with low survival rates.
   It follows that two countries can have the same mortality-based UDR for very di¤erent
reasons. The United States and Lesotho provide an example. We nd that both countries
have mean UDRs of 2.4 percent, yet they di¤er substantially in their demographics. Life
expectancies at birth in the two countries are 78.6 and 48.8 years, respectively, while the
median ages are 37.2 and 20.1. The United States population is older and tends to live longer,
and these di¤erences o¤set each other in comparison to Lesothos younger population with
a shorter life expectancy at birth or any given age.
   Figure 2 illustrates the relationship between life expectancy, median age, and our esti-
mates of the UDR across countries. As one would expect, median age increases with life
expectancy. Longer life expectancy tends to decrease the UDR, holding median age constant,
while an older median age tends to increase the UDR, holding life expectancy constant. As
both are reduced (or increased), the gure shows how the UDRs change less, and something
close to level sets within the gures UDR bins emerge. Note, however, that median age is
only one possible indicator of a populations age distribution, and the estimated UDRs are a
function of life expectancies at age, rather than at birth. Nevertheless, the gure illustrates
how a populations demographic structure a¤ects the estimate. In particular, it explains
why di¤erences do not necessarily align with a countrys level of development. For the same
UDR, one country may be developed with a longer life expectancy and an older population,


                                             13
while another may be developing with a shorter life expectancy and younger population. A
second example of this phenomenon is Australia and South Africa with UDRs of 2.2 percent,
and respective life expectancies at birth of 81.8 and 59.3, and median ages of 37.0 and 24.3.
       We have thus far focused on the mean rate for the population aggregation rule in equation
(8), but we also consider the median rate for a population as described in equation (9). To
show how the estimates compare, Figure 3 (panel A) plots the median estimate against the
mean for all countries. In all cases the median is less than the mean, reecting the general
leftward skew of population distributions towards more younger people. Hence we nd that
using the median aggregation rule uniformly provides lower estimates of the mortality-based
UDR. The percentage point di¤erence is greater among countries with higher estimates of
the mean UDR. Figure 3 (panel B) shows the distribution across countries of the percentage
change in the estimate when converting from the mean to median aggregation rule. Many
of the smaller declines occur in the Middle East, whereas many of the larger declines occur
in Eastern Europe.16 The percentage decline tends to be greater in countries where the
population is older and life expectancy is shorter. On average across countries, the UDR
decreases 33 percent, and for 95 percent of the countries the decrease is greater than 25 per-
cent. These di¤erences illustrate how the aggregation rule can have important consequences,
and we return to this topic later in our discussion.


3.2       Global Results

We now turn to a global estimate of the mortality-based UDR. We follow the same procedure,
but now treat the world as a single population using the world data from the WHO and UN
data sets. Using the mean aggregation, we estimate a global UDR of 2.13 percent. Using
the median aggregation, we estimate a rate of 1.33 percent. Interestingly, these estimates
are surprisingly close to those employed in the literature when calibrating discount rates
  16
    Countries with the 10 lowest percentage declines, in ascending order, are United Arab Emirates, Qatar,
Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Lesotho, Cambodia, Libya, and Brunei Darussalam. Countries with
the 10 highest percentage declines, in descending order, are Hungary, Ukraine, Japan, Albania, Iceland,
Serbia, Armenia, Jamaica, Uruguay, and Czech Republic.

to the Ramsey rule with applications to climate change. As discussed previously, some use
rates at or near zero (e.g., Cline 1992; Arrow 1999; Stern 2007), but others employ rates
between 1 and 3 percent (e.g., Nordhaus and Yang 1996; Weitzman 2007; Nordhaus 2007,
2008). Moreover, a recent survey of expert opinion among economists nds a mean estimate
1.1 percent for the UDR, with a standard deviation of 1.47 and a range between 0 and 8
percent (Drupp et al. 2015).
   While these estimates are consistent with treating the world as a single population,
we note that other aggregation rules may be considered reasonable among countries. One
could, for example, use the median across countries of the mean or median country-speci c
estimates, yielding 2.01 and 1.37 percent, respectively. Alternatively, one could take some
weighted average of the country speci c-estimates, based on population or some other nor-
mative criteria. We nd, for example, a population-weighted mean of the mean and median
aggregation yields estimates of 2.25 and 1.53 percent, respectively.
   As mentioned previously, our aim here is not to advocate one aggregation rule over
another, either between countries or within countries. Instead, we employ the most basic
rules (means and medians) as benchmarks to compare against estimates currently used in
the literature. In doing so, our nding is that the choice of the UDR used for calibration
of the Ramsey rulewithin IAMs for climate change and more generallyare very much in
line with the estimates here based on demographic mortality risks.


3.3    Changes Over Time

Our estimates of the social UDR are based on a populations existing age structure and life
expectancies at each age. The aim is to develop a procedure for estimating long-term UDRs
that can serve as useful benchmarks. If the population age structure is constant over time,
our procedure generates estimates that are time invariant. It is nevertheless reasonable
to ask the empirical question: How do UDR estimates change over time? To make such
comparisons, we follow the same procedure and estimate UDRs with the UN and WHO data
for the years 1990 and 2000. The year 1990 is the earliest that comparable data is available

                                             15
for the broad sample of countries. We report the results for all countries, both years, and
aggregation rules in the Supplementary Material Table S1.
       We focus discussion here on the largest time span from 1990 to 2012. Figure 4 plots
the natural log of the 2012 estimate against the 1990 estimate for all countries, showing the
mean and median aggregation separately. The gure shows how the estimates both increase
and decrease across countries with nearly the same variance across the range of 1990 UDRs.
Over the 22 year period, the mean change across countries for the mean aggregation is an
increase of 2.4 percent with a standard deviation of 11.1. For the median aggregation, the
mean di¤erence is an increase of 4.2 percent with a standard deviation of 12.8. While we
interpret these results as showing a reasonable degree of stability for long-term discounting,
the di¤erences across countries are a function of how demographics have changed: a shift
towards a younger (older) population with longer (shorter) life expectancies will decrease (in-
crease) the estimated UDR.17 Other factors that may inuence the di¤erences are changes in
data availability within countries and adjustments to the methods of estimating parameters
of life tables.18
       When considering global estimates of the UDR, there is relatively little change over time.
For all three estimates in 1990, 2000, and 2012, the mean aggregation remains nearly constant
at 2.04, 2.10 and 2.13 percent, respectively. The same holds for the median aggregation with
UDRs of 1.27, 1.39, and 1.33 percent. The stability of these estimates builds further support
for using the demographic characteristics of the worlds existing population to inform long-
term discount rates.
  17
     Countries that make the bottom 10 for a decrease in the UDR for both the mean and median aggre-
gation are Zambia, Ethiopia, Antingua and Barbuda, Liberia, Rwanda, Angola, Eritrea, and Uganda. With
respect to the top 10 for an increase in the UDR, there is greater heterogeneity across the aggregation
rules. The top 10 for the mean aggregation are Lesotho, Montenegro, North Korea, Nicaragua, Armenia,
Algeria, Serbia, Uzbekistan, Philippines, and Macedonia. Those for the median aggregation are Lesotho,
China, Thailand, Montenegro, Cuba, Algeria, Saudi Arabia, Morocco, Lithuania, and Swaziland.

4        Relation to the Social (Consumption) Discount Rate

The primary focus of our analysis is on deriving demographically-based estimates of the UDR.
But this is only one component of the overall social (consumption) discount rate, de ned in
equation (2), that is used for economic evaluation of long-term projects. In this section, we
derive overall social discount rates using our estimates of the UDR as an input.19 The intent
is to place our results in context for exploring heterogenous social discount rates across
countries. In doing so, we combine estimates of the di¤erent parameters in the Ramsey
equation to produce an estimate of the overall social discount rate. In the next section,
however, we show how our estimates of the UDR can be used in a calibration exercise to
match observed interest rates.
       We use the following procedure to obtain estimates of the other parameters in the Ramsey
equation. The elasticity of the marginal utility of consumption  is the mean value of 1.35
from an expert opinion survey conducted by Drupp et al. (2015).20 For the growth rate of
per capita real consumption g, we use forecasts about real Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
per capita. Although consumption itself is the correct measure rather than GDP, such data
are only available for a small set of countries. Following Gollier (2012, 2015), we use the
International Macroeconomic Data Set constructed by the Economic Research Service of the
U.S. Department of Agriculture.21 The dataset provides historical and projected real GDP
per capita for 189 countries that account for more than 99 percent of the world economy.
For each country and the world as a whole, we take the arithmetic average of growth rates
for all years 2013 through 2030. We then use these estimates along with those for the UDRs
and  to examine heterogeneity in the overall social discount rates across countries. We use
the mean aggregation of the UDR for illustrative purposes and to be consistent with the
  19
     Clearly, we are following convention here and throughout the paper by assuming a constant social
discount rate. For recent discussions about the potential use of declining discount rates over time,.see Arrow
et al. (2013) and Cropper et al. (2014).
  20
     The survey responses range from 0 to 5, and it is straightforward to run alternate scenarios with di¤erent
values.

implicit averaging in GDP per capita.22
       Figure 5 (Panel A) shows the distribution of the most recent estimates across countries.
We also report the speci c estimate for each country in Appendix Table 1. The mean social
discount rate is 5.07 percent, with a range from -1.32 to 10.56 percent.23 The few negative
rates arise because of su¢ciently large forecasts of negative GDP growth through 2030.
Here again we nd that, in general, the results are well within the range of those used in the
academic literature and in practice. As a point of reference the U.S. O¢ce of Management
and Budget recommends using a social discount rate between 3 and 7 percent for regulatory
impact analysis (OMB 2003). Using our procedure to estimate the social discount rate for
the United States, we nd a rate of 4.32 percent. This is also very close to the overall world
estimate of 4.61 percent.
       Panel B of Figure 5 illustrates geographic heterogeneity of the social discount rates. The
highest rates tend to be clustered and China, India, and Southeast Asia, where forecasts of
GDP growth per capita tend to be large. More generally, however, we nd that the social
discount rates are not driven primarily by either the forecasts of GDP growth or the UDRs.
Both contribute somewhat equally because they have somewhat similar magnitudes, and 
at 1.35 provides a roughly equal weighting between the two. Finally, the estimates of  and
g are relatively uncorrelated, with a pairwise correlation coe¢cient of only 0.15.



5        Application to the RICE Model

We have previously discussed how much of the renewed debate about the choice of discount
rates stems from the importance of discounting in IAMs of climate change. In this section, we
consider how our heterogenous estimates of the UDR across countries a¤ect the results of one
  22
     It is nevertheless a simple exercise to generate comparable results using the median aggregation of the
UDR. In this case, however, one might also want to use a measure of median income growth for consistency.
This would imply in the United States, for example, a social discount rate approximately equal to the median
UDR because median income growth has been close to zero.

     Countries with the 10 lowest estimates, in ascending order, are Syria, Equatorial Guinea, Yemen,
Venezuela, Burundi, Libya, Brunei Darussalam, Central African Republic, Belize, and Cyprus. Countries

such model. Our illustration requires a regionally speci c model, and we use the archetype
and publicly available Regional Integrated Climate-Economy (RICE) model (Nordhaus and
Yang 1996; Nordhaus 2010). In contrast to the previous section where we derive social
discount rates from parameter estimates, the RICE application is a calibration to observed
interest rates by region subject to our estimates of the region-speci c UDRs.
       The RICE model is a dynamic, optimal growth model based on the Ramsey framework.
The models objective is to maximize present discounted utility of consumption through time.
Population and technology grow exogenously, but capital accumulation is endogenous, based
on the rate at which forgone consumption today is traded o¤ against increased consumption
in the future. The buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere causes economically
harmful climate damages. Investments in emission reductions operate in much the same way
as capital. Emission reductions are costly, they lower consumption today, but increase future
consumption possibilities by avoiding future climate damages. A key feature of the model
for our purposes is its parameterization to 12 di¤erent regions. In the original formulation,
Nordhaus and Yang (1996) compare a market scenario, where there is no correction for the
climate-change externality, to a globally optimal scenario, where emissions are controlled
e¢ciently across time and regions.
       We follow the same approach here, but instead compare the results of two di¤erent cali-
brations. The rst is one where all 12 regions of the model have the same global estimate of
the UDR, which is the case in Nordhaus and Yang (1996) and Nordhaus (2010). Speci cally,
we assume a UDR of 2.13 percent for all regions, corresponding with our 2012 global estimate
of . This scenario falls between previously published versions of the RICE model, where
Nordhaus and Yang (1996) use 3 percent in their original analysis and Nordhaus (2010)
subsequently uses 1.5 percent. The second calibration that we employ uses heterogeneous
estimates of the UDR for each of the 12 regions. To derive these estimates, we apply our pro-
cedure described previously to the pooled population demographics for all countries within
a region.24 Table 1 lists the 12 regions and the UDR for each used in our homogeneous and
  24
   Note that this is not a weighted average across countries, but rather a weighted average across age bins
and life expectancies for all individuals in the population de ned by the countries that comprise a RICE


                                                    19
heterogenous calibrations, along with the di¤erence. The heterogenous estimates range from
a low of 1.81 for Africa to a high of 3.33 for Russia. Compared to the homogeneous calibra-
tion, the heterogenous UDR is lower in four regions, Africa, Middle East, Latin America,
and Other.
   When adjusting the UDRs in the RICE model, globally and regionally, the calibration
also requires adjustments to the elasticity of the marginal utility of consumption . This
is done to match the same initial conditions of the model for the overall discount rate and
rate of consumption growth. Nordhaus (2007) follows a similar procedure to match observed
market conditions when calibrating the related DICE model using di¤erent values of  in
response to Stern (2007).
   Figure 6 (Panel A) shows the simulated annual emissions corresponding with the market
and optimal scenarios for both the homogeneous and heterogeneous calibrations. We nd
that introducing heterogeneity in the UDRs has very little a¤ect on the annual emissions for
the market scenario. The emissions pro le is also very similar for the optimal scenario until
about 2065, when emissions start to diverge and are lower with heterogeneous UDRs. Panel
B of the gure shows the uniform, optimal carbon tax for both calibrations. Consistent
with the di¤erences in optimal emissions, the carbon tax begins to be greater with the
heterogenous UDRs around 2065. The di¤erence is 28 percent higher by the end of the
century.
   Because aggregate emissions may mask some important heterogeneous e¤ects, we now
look at region-speci c results. Changes in the discount rate a¤ect both the market and
optimal scenarios, and it is helpful to look at how each regions emission pro le changes
even without climate policy. Figure 7 shows the percentage change in annual emissions for
each region when moving from the homogenous to heterogenous calibrations of the market
scenario. A clear pattern emerges whereby regions with lower UDRs increase emissions and
those with higher UDRs decrease emissions. The reason stems from the fact that a greater
UDR, for example, means less concern for the future compared to the present. This implies
region. In other words, a RICE region is treated as a population in the language of our model.



                                                   20
a lower savings rate, less capital accumulation, and a decrease in future in output. Then,
because emissions are proportional to output in the RICE model, we see a decrease (increase)
in emissions for regions that shift to a higher (lower) UDR. See, for example, how after an
initial adjustment Africa and the Middle East regions increase business as usual emissions by
about 1.5 percent, and Russia decreases its business as usual emissions more than 9 percent
by the end of the century.
   These results underscore the importance of macroeconomic adjustments to changes in the
parameters of the discount rate. While researchers focused on climate change often emphasize
how a lower UDR supports greater concern for future climate damages, these results also
illustrate how the lower UDR also changes the baseline to favor future consumption and
therefore future emissions.
   What do these di¤erences in the baseline emissions mean for optimal climate policy across
regions? Figure 8 shows the percentage change in optimal abatement across regions and over
time when moving from the homogenous to heterogenous UDRs. The panel for each region
is essentially a di¤erence-in-di¤erences calculation because abatement is the di¤erence in
emissions between the market and optimal scenarios. Here again there is a clear pattern.
Regions with lower UDRs, and therefore higher baseline emissions, abate more in all periods
after an initial adjustment, with the increase in abatement reaching about 15 percent by
centurys end. Regions with su¢ciently higher UDRs, which have lower base line emissions,
undertake less abatement until just before 2080. The regions with relatively little change
in the UDRi.e., India, Other High Income, United States, and Chinahave very little
change in abatement until it increases just before 2080. The di¤erences across regions o¤set
each other such that there is relatively little change in aggregate emissions between the
homogenous and heterogenous calibrations for the optimal scenarios prior to 2075 (see Panel
A of Figure 6). Yet aggregate emissions begin to diverge and are lower for the heterogenous
case later in the century, when the large emitting countries, including the United States and
China, begin increasing their abatement.

6     Concluding Remarks

The Ramsey discounting rule is a cornerstone of macroeconomic modeling. It is also funda-
mental to the economics of climate change through its use in IAMs. As originally conceived,
the Ramsey model is based on an in nitely lived representative agent. Its interpretation in
the climate change literature is generally still that of a representative agent, and the time
steps are taken to represent a sequence of non-overlapping generations. While the Ramsey
model provides an organizing framework for pulling together the di¤erent components of a
long-term discount rate, the di¢culty is that the framework itself provides little guidance
about how to calibrate the Ramsey rule in practice.
    The question of how to choose a social discount rate has long been a subject of de-
bate among economists and philosophers. Comparisons between the two primary schools
of thoughta prescriptive or descriptive approachidentify the fundamental di¤erence as
explicit or implicit assumptions about compensation among generations (Arrow et al. 1995).
This narrows the focus somewhat on the choice of the social UDR. Should the UDR be cho-
sen as an ethical parameter, or be backed out of a calibration exercise to match observable
market interest rates? The current state of a¤airs in economics remains one where applied
researchers must choose, or remain agnostic and undertake sensitivity analysis that covers
a wide range of values. One respect in which the options are particularly unsatisfactory is
that the choice between a prescriptive versus descriptive approach is typically inseparable
from whether one thinks the discount rate should be low or high, respectively.
    In this paper, we present an alternative, demographically-based approach that can serve
as a useful point of comparison. The starting point of our analysis is recognition that even
a representative agent must die. Speci cally, we show how age-speci c mortality rates and
life expectancy imply a natural UDR for individuals at each age in a population. This
part of the analysis is descriptive. The other part, where individual UDRs are aggregated
to the population level, is necessarily prescriptive because it implies weights among those
currently alive. For this step, we fall back on simple means and medians as an aggregation
rule, though note the possibility of others. The most striking part of the analysis is that the

                                              22
results across countries and for the world as a whole fall within the range of UDRs employed
in the literature. The results might therefore be interpreted as providing external validly
to much of the current practice, or at least showing how current practice aligns with the
implications of a basic demographic approach.
   We are aware that a leading criticism of our approach is that focusing only on mortality
risk oversimpli es the basis for individual pure rates of time preference. The criticism is cer-
tainly warranted, yet we contend that arguments can be made that the approach provides ei-
ther over- or under-estimates. That individuals are well-known to be impatient even without
mortality risk could be used to argue for a higher UDR. In contrast, the presence of bequest
motives for future generations would imply a lower UDR. While many other arguments are
certainly possible, the advantage of a purely mortality-based approach is transparency, an
empirical basis, and broad data availabilitythat is, the mortality-based approach gives a
non-arbitrary starting point for further adjustments. A further advantage of our approach
is that it facilitates transparency with respect to decisions about how di¤erent generations
are actually weighed.
   Indeed, we show how the approach can be used to explore heterogeneity of overall social
discount rates across countries, with application to IAMs for climate change. We nd that
introducing regional heterogeneity of UDRs into the RICE model has little a¤ect on the
business-as-usual trajectory of global emissions. It does, however, change the trajectory of
optimal emissions and the corresponding carbon tax. With heterogeneity, regions with lower
UDRs (e.g., Africa, the Middle East, and Latin America) would be responsible for greater
emission reductions, whereas those with higher UDRs (e.g., Japan, Eurasia, and Russia)
would be responsible for less. Although our intent here is primarily illustrative, such results
in future research can have important implications for understanding burden sharing across
countries and their willingness to participate in international climate agreements.
