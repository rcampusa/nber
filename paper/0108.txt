Introduction
        For many decades the "underpaid" health worker was a commonplace

figure in most discussions of the health industry. Not the physician,

of course, but other health workers, such as nurses, technicians, and

clerical and service employees, were said to be poorly paid relative to

similar workers in other industries. With few exceptions the allegations

about relative wage levels were rarely supported by systematic theoretical

or empirical analysis.1 Given the paucity of data about earnings in

health, this was not surprising. Nor was it surprising that initial

attention focused primarily on the earnings of physicians, who were

allegedly in a dominant monopoly position.2

        Several recent developments suggest the desirability of a closer

examination of the wages of allied health personnel. First, there is

the sheer size of the industry. Employment in health, excluding physi-

cians, dentists, and other highly trained professionals, now amounts

to over four million, approximately two—thirds of whom are employed in

hospitals. Second, there is the problem of the rapid escalation of

hospital costs, which have bpen growing by more than 10 percent per

annum f or the past decade. Hospitals, like other service industries,

are highly labor intensive, with payrolls accounting for about 60 percent

of total expenses. Finally, note should be taken of increasing union

activity in hospitals as well as the tendency for professional associa-

tions to press vigorously for higher wages.

       There is a clear need for a firm   statistical base   describing

the levels and rates of change of wages for various types of manpower

in hospitals and other health settings, and for analytical studies

designed to explain the causes and consequences of wage variation in

the health industry. This paper is intended to fill the first need,

and provide data for the second. With the rich detail provided in the

public use samples of the 1960 and 1970 Censuses of Population, it is

possible to calculate hourly earnings rates for all allied health

personnel classified by occupation, sex, schooling, geographical loca-

tion, and many other characteristics. Furthermore, it is possible to

compare these earnings with those of workers with similar characteristics

in other nonfarm industries. This descriptive paper will be followed

by others which attempt to explain cross—sectional variations in levels

and rates of change of earnings and to analyze the industry's response

to these variations.

        The next section describes the data and methods used in this

paper. It is followed by sections reporting the results for 1969 and the

changes from 1959 to 1969; then a section that concentrates on regional

differentials; and finally a brief section on changes since 1969. Some

of the questions addressed in this paper are: How do wages in health

compare with wages in other industries? Did wages rise more rapidly

in health than in other industries in the 1960's? Was this a "catching—

up"? How do wage levels and rates of change vary among different health

occupations and settings? How do they vary by region?

Data and Methods

        This study covers all wage and salary workers with less than

18 years of schooling employed in the Census week, 1970 (or 1960) who

had earnings in 1969 (or 1959). Wage and salary workers with 18 or

more years of schooling and all self—employed workers are excluded in

order to concentrate on the so—called allied health personnel. Data

for the health industry are obtained from the 1/100 samples of the

Censuses, which yield 34,489 observations in 1970 and 19,288 in 1960.

Data for all nonfarm industries are obtained from the 1/1000 samples,

which yield 61,584 and 50,349 observations, respectively.

        Workers are initially classified by sex, color (white and non-

white), age (14—19, 20—24, 25—34, 35—44, 45—54, 55—64, and 65+), and

years of schooling ( 8, 9—11, 12, 13—15, 16, 17). Average hourly

earnings for each sex—color—age—schooling cell are calculated by dividing

reported total amiual earnings in 1969 by an estimate of the total annual

hours worked in 1969. Annual hours for each worker are estimated by

multiplying the number of weeks worked in 1969 by the number of hours

worked in the Census reference week in 1970. It is important to esti-

mate hours for each worker individually and then sum across all workers

in a cell (rather than multiply the means of weeks worked and hours

per week) because there is a positive correlation between weeks per year

and hours per week across workers.

       With this approach workers can be grouped by industry, occupa-

tion, region or other variables, and their hourly earnings can be

compared to the national norm (defined as all nonfarm industries) in

the following way: an "expected" hourly earnings for each industry,
                                      4



occupation, etc. is calculated by multiplying the hourly earnings rate

for all nonfarm industries in each sex—color—age—schooling cell by the

total annual hours worked in each cell in the particularly industry,

occupation, etc., and dividing by the total annual hours for all cells.

That is,


           Expected hourly earnings =     WH1      +
                                                       H1

where W = average hourly earnings in U.S. nonfarm industries of wage
and salary workers in cell c and H1 =     total   hours worked in industry

or occupation i by workers in cell c. The ratio of actual to expected

earnings provides a wage index for I standardized for sex, color, age,

and schooling.

           While I believe these data and methods provide a richer picture

of the earnings of allied health manpower than is available from any

other source, there are clearly shortcomings and possible biases which

should be noted. First, the method of estimating annual hours, using

the weeks worked in 1969 (or 1959) and the hours worked in the Census

week in 1970 (or 1960), is appropriate only if the hours worked in the

Census week are a good approximation of average weekly hours in the

preceding year. For individual workers this will frequently not be the

case, but for large groups of workers individual differences tend to

cancel out.3 As a general rule of thumb, little confidence should be

placed in estimates based on fewer than 50 workers, and no such esti—

mates are presented. Indeed, any estimates based on fewer than 100

workers will be clearly identified.
                                   5




        Second, it should be noted that the average earnings calculated

is not a simple average of the hourly earnings of each worker, but it

is a weighted average where the weights are the annual hours of each

worker. I believe the weighted average is preferable for most purposes.

It tells us, for instance, what was the average wage paid for an hour

of nurses' services rather than the wage rate of the average nurse.

The former is likely to be estimated with greater accuracy because the

hourly earnings of those workers with very low annual hours are probably

estimated with considerable error. There are some applications, however,

such as estimation of supply functions, where the unweighted average

might be preferable.

        Another problem concerns the omission of fringe benefits from

the earnings estimates. The ratio of fringes to direct wages may vary

from occupation to occupation, or from region to region. To the extent

that it does, the hourly earnings data are an imperfect estimate of

labor costs to the employer or labor compensation to the employee.

        A fourth problem is that my method of calculation necessarily

omits persons who were employed in the year prior to the Census but not

employed during the Census week.4 Such persons who are, on average,

less continuously employed may well have lower than average hourly

earnings. If it were possible to include them in the estimates of hourly

earnings, it is possible that the overall average might be reduced by

a few percent,5 but I doubt whether the comparisons over time and space

would be much affected.

        Finally, it should be noted that when the wages of the workers

in one industry are shown relative to the wages of workers in all
                                  6




industries (i.e., actual + expected) a problem arises if the industry

in question accounts for a significant fraction of the all—industry

total. In such cases the ratio of wages in the industry to all other

industries could be significantly different from the ratio to all
              6
industries.




Results, 1969

        We begin with a comparison between the Health Industry as a

whole and all nonf arm industries, shown in Table 1. We note that overall

annual earnings and hourly earnings are substantially lower in Health,

but most of this differential disappears if comparisons are made within

color—sex categories. Approximately 80 percent of the labor hours of

allied health personnel are worked by females, compared with 35 percent

for the All Industries reference group. The last row of Table 1 shows

actual earnings divided by expected, i.e. the standardized wage index.

The value of .95 for All indicates that wages in Health, adjusted for

sex, color, age and schooling, were 5 percent below the All Industry

norm in 1969. This differential was entirely attributable to the

relatively low earnings of males in Health; female earnings were almost

exactly at the All Industry level.7 It should be noted that females in

Health work more hours per year than females in other industries,

whereas the reverse is true for males. This Is probably related to the

sex difference in the standardized wage index.

        In Table 2 we begin to disaggregate the Health Industry, first

into workers in Hospitals and those in Other Health settings, and then

for white females by years of schooling. One striking result is the

substantially higher earnings in Hospitals, especially for females.

Both white and non—white females in Hospitals make about 10 percent

more per hour than do females with similar age and schooling in other

parts of the Health Industry, such as physicians' offices and nursing

homes. Another striking result is the variation in the standardized

wage index by years of schooling. Females with 12 or 13—15 years of

schooling do particularly well in Health.

        Table 3 disaggregates by occupation and again some interesting

differences within the Health Industry emerge. Several non—health

occupations are also presented to sharpen the comparisons. Among the

professional allied health personnel, registered nurses stand out with

a wage index 19 percent above the All Industry norm. By contrast,

dieticians in Health make 13 percent less than expected, given their

age and schooling. Secretaries and other clerical workers in Health

have slightly higher expected earnings than their counterparts in other

industries, but their actual earnings are about 10 percent lower. In

the service group of occupations, practical nurses do surprisingly well,

with hourly earnings almost equal to expected. The other service

occupations in Health and other industries, have rather low earnings,

both absolutely and relative to expected.

        The two major male occupations show interesting and consistent

comparisons between Health and other industries. In both cases, the

expected earnings (reflecting the age—schooling mix) is somewhat higher

in Health, but actual earnings are lower, yielding a standardized wage

index 12 percent under the norm. One possible explanation, not explored

in this paper, is that males in these occupations in other industries

tend to be heavily unionized, but are much less so in Health.

        In Table 4 we disaggregate simultaneously by occupation and

health setting. For some occupations, notably secretaries and other

clerical, the setting is irrelevant; the standardized wage indexes are

almost identical. Standardized earnings tend to be appreciably higher

in hospitals for registered and practical nurses and nurses' aides, but

not for technologists and technicians. Whether these differentials were

also present in 1959 or emerged only during the course of the decade is

one of the questions to be examined in the next section.



Results: Changes from 1959 to 1969

        The ten years from 1959 to 1969 were very eventful ones for the

health industry. During the first half of the decade, prices and expen-

ditures were rising at a rapid pace, primarily as the result of the

development of more complex technology. After 1965 the pace accelerated

appreciably under the double impact of massive federal health insurance

programs and general economy—wide inflation. This decade also witnessed

the beginnings of militant union activity in hospitals, although the

fraction of hospital workers covered by collective bargaining agreements

in 1969 was still small compared with most industries.

        Comparison of the standardized wage indexes in 1959 and 1969

reveals that wages of allied health manpower rose faster than wages in

other industries, but the pace of increase was very uneven for different

groups within the Health Industry. The first row of Table 5 shows that

health workers were indeed poorly paid in 1959 relative to workers in

other industries; the standardized wage index was .86. The increase to

.95 by 1969 means that earnings in health relative to other industries

rose by 11 percent over the decide. Non—white workers in Health,

however, showed no improvement relative to non—white workers in other

industries because of the rapid gains made by non—whites in the economy

as a whole (reflected in the higher 1969/1959 indexes for expected

earnings).

        Table 5 also shows that the higher earnings of Hospital workers

relative to Other Health workers in 1969 was entirely the result of

changes during the decade. In 1959 the standardized wage indexes in the

two health sectors were at the same level. Hospital wages rose faster

than wages in All Industries by slightly more than one percent per annum.

While this differential cumulates to a substantial change in relative

wages over a decade (12 percent), it is small relative to the inflation

In hospital costs during that same period. The differential rate of

change between the Hospital component of the CPI and the total CPI was

over 6 percent per annum, 1959—1969. Thus, we see that the "catching—up"

of Hospital wages can account for only a small part of the explosion In

Hospital prices and expenditures. We also see in Table 5 that the rise

in Hospital wages was more rapid in the private sector than in government

hospitals.

        Changes in the wage indexes by occupation are presented in

Table 6. Nurses, both practical and registered, stand out among the

Health workers as having experienced very substantial wage gains. Among

the non—health occupations, only private household workers show a very

large increase in standardized earnings.

        It should be noted that every Health occupation improved its

relative position between 1959 and 1969, but for nurses' aides, clerical

workers and dieticians, the gains were minimal. The two white male

occupations showed substantial gains in wages, but still lagged behind

similar workers in other industries.

        The final table in this section (Table 7) shows changes by

occupation in Hospitals and in the rest of the Health Industry. Again

we note a mixed pattern, with some occupations experiencing much larger

increases in Hospitals and some showing about the same change in the

wage index regardless of setting. The gains made by practical and

registered nurses in Hospitals are particularly noteworthy and will be

given further scrutiny in the next section.



Regional Differentials in Hospital Wages, 1959 and 1969

        One of the advantages of estimating earnings from the public use

samples is that it is possible to calculate standardized wage Indexes

for different geographical areas within the U.S. Information concerning

regional differentials in levels and rates of change of wages is of

considerable Importance for policy purposes such as setting appropriate

reimbursement rates for Hospitals. These differentials also provide a

basis for analyzing the determinants of wages and the responsiveness of

Hospitals to differentials in wage rates.

        In Table 8 the standardized wage indexes of white females in the

nine Census divisions are presented in 1959 and 1969.8 The regional

comparisons in this section focus on white females in order to eliminate

the possibility that sample variations in sex mix would bias the

regional differentials. We know from Table 1 that the standardized wage

index for males in Health for the U.S. as a whole is substantially below
                                    25




        The data also indicate very clearly that this equality was

achieved since 1959. At that time the standardized wage indexes for

both Hospital workers and those in Other Health settings were 14 percent

below the All Industry norm. There was a substantial "catching—up" in

the 1960's and a persistence of this differential rate of growth, at

least for Hospitals, in the 1970's. The earnings of Hospital nurses,

both registered and practical, stand out as having experienced the most

rapid rates of increase.

        Another conclusion of this study is that geographical differen-

tials in Health wages are closely correlated with geographical differ-

entials in all nonfarm wages. If, for instance, we know the national

wage index for Hospital workers and the regional wage index for

all nonf arm workers, we can predict with considerable accuracy the

Hospital wage index in that region. There was, however, some significant

variation in the rate of growth of Hospital wages across regions, notably

wages in the East rose faster than in the mid— or far—West in the l960's.

The rapid wage gains were accompanied by above average rates of growth

in Hospital employment per capita in the Southeast, but by relatively

slow growth in the Northeast. The next task is to explain systematically

the variations in rates of change of Hospital wages across regions,

occupations and Health settings, and to analyze the industry's response

to these variations.

that of females. If a region happened, as a matter of chance, to have

relatively more males in its sample of Health workers, its standardized

wage index for Health would tend to be depressed on that account even

though wages for males and females taken separately were no different

than in other regions.

        One of the most powerful inferences to be drawn from Table 8 is

that the geographical differentials in earnings in Hospitals and Other

Health settings are very similar to the differentials for all nonf arm

industries. The coefficient of rank correlation between the All Industries

wage index and the Hospital wage index is .88 in 1959 and .90 in 1969.

The All Industry/Other Health coefficients are .90 and .80 respectively.

This means that the relative wages of health workers in an area are

determined by and large by the same forces that determine the general

level of wages in the area, even when there are special factors affecting

the national level of wages in Health.9 Thus, most of the ad hoc

theories about special institutional factors affecting geographical

differences in Health wages are probably superfluous.

        When we look at the rate of change of wages, however, as reflected

in columns 7, 8 and 9 of Table 8, we see that special factors probably

have been at work in some areas during the decade. The coefficients of

rank correlation across the nine divisions for changes in wage indexes

is .54 between Other Health and All Industries, and only .30 between

Hospitals and All Industries. In particular, Hospital wages in the

northeast (New England and Middle Atlantic) and the southeast (South

Atlantic and East South Central) have risen faster than in the rest of

the country. The change in the West South Central was similar to that
                                  20




in the Mountain and Pacific and these three divisions are grouped as

the West' in subsequent tables.

       When the differential pattern of change is explored in greater

detail (Table 9), we see that wages rose more rapidly in the two eastern

regions than in the rest of the country in every major Hospital occupa-

tion. The magnitude of the geographical differential, however, was very

different across occupations. For registered nurses the rate of wage

increase was similar across the country, varying by only .3 percent per

annum from the highest to the lowest region. For other professional and

managerial workers and for practical nurses, however, the differential

was more than 2 percent per annum. The other two occupations show

differences of over 1 percent per annum between the fastest and slowest

growing regions.

        The more rapid growth of Hospital wages in the east revealed in

the public use samples is confirmed in two other independent sources of

data. From American Hospital Association statistics it is possible to

calculate average annual earnings per full—time—equivalent personnel in

1959 and 1969. The average annual percentage rate of change of this

measure is: Northeast 5.8, North Central 4.9, Southeast 5.2, and West' 4.8.

Martin Feldstein has used Bureau of Labor Statistics wage survey statistics

to calculate indexes of weekly wages for four metropolitan areas (one in

each region) in 1960 and 1969.10 The implied average annual percentage

rate of change is: New York City 7.8, Cleveland 6.0, Baltimore 7.2, and

San Francisco 5.9. The differentials across the metropolitan areas are

similar to those revealed in the Census data and the ABA statistics, but

the rates of change are appreciably higher in the BLS data. This

discrepancy should be investigated.

                                   22



       One of the reasons given by Feldstein for the rapid growth of

hospital wages in general is the rapid expansion in demand for hospital

staff. The national data are consistent with this view. Between 1959

and 1969 the number of hospital workers per capita in the U.S. grew at

3.4 percent per annum compared to an increase of only 1.4 percent per

annum for total non—agricultural wage and salary employment. The regional

differentials in hospital employment growth, however, suggest that changes

in demand are only a partial explanation. The Northeast, which had above

average growth in Hospital wages, had the slowest growth of Hospital

employment per capita in the country.

        Feldstein presents indexes by occupation for each metropolitan

area that tend to confirm the results presented in Table 9——namely

above average increases in nursing wages and below average increases

for clerical personnel. The one major discrepancy is that "housekeeping"

wages rise faster than the all—hospital average in three of the four

metropolitan areas, whereas the "other service" wage indexes shown in

Table 9 rise less rapidly than the all—hospital average in three of the

four regions. This may be because in Feldstein's calculations hourly

wage rates were used for housekeeping and weekly wage rates for the other

occupations.



Changes Since 1969

        One of the major limitations of the public use samples is that

they appear only once every ten years. We have seen that Health workers,

starting at a relatively low wage level in 1959, had by 1969 risen to a

point of almost parity with other industries. Indeed, some Health
                                   23




workers, especially those in Hospitals and particularly registered

nurses, had by 1969 standardized wage indexes far above unity. We have

also seen how Hospital wages have tended to rise faster in the East

than in the mid— or far—West.

        What has happened since 1969? To answer that question, we

introduce a few measures from the American Hospital Association data on

Hospital payrolls and the U.S. Department of Labor estimates of earnings

in private non—agricultural industries. Table 10 shows Hospital wages

rising 1.2 percent per annum faster during 1959—69 and continuing with a

.5 percent differential during 1969—74. The ABA regional data show that

hospital wages continued to rise particularly rapidly after 1969 in the

Northeast, but rose less rapidly in the Southeast than in the country

as a whole. The West (including the West South Central) continued to

rise at the slowest rate.



Conclusion

       The data presented in this paper permit a fairly unambiguous

answer to the question posed in the title. Health workers are not, on

average, underpaid, compared with workers of the same sex, color, age

and schooling in other nonf arm industries. This average equality does

encompass some relative differentials within the Health field: e.g.,

females do relatively better than males, Hospital workers do better

than workers in other Health settings, and some occupations, especially

registered nurses, earn much more than other occupations even after

standardization for years of schooling.

        The data also indicate very clearly that this equality was

achieved since 1959. At that time the standardized wage indexes for

both Hospital workers and those in Other Health settings were 14 percent

below the All Industry norm. There was a substantial "catching—up" in

the 1960's and a persistence of this differential rate of growth, at

least for Hospitals, in the 1970's. The earnings of Hospital nurses,

both registered and practical, stand out as having experienced the most

rapid rates of increase.

        Another conclusion of this study is that geographical differen-

tials in Health wages are closely correlated with geographical differ-

entials in all nonfarm wages. If, for instance, we know the national

wage index for Hospital workers and the regional wage index for

all nonf arm workers, we can predict with considerable accuracy the

Hospital wage index in that region. There was, however, some significant

variation in the rate of growth of Hospital wages across regions, notably

wages in the East rose faster than in the mid— or far—West in the l960's.

The rapid wage gains were accompanied by above average rates of growth

in Hospital employment per capita in the Southeast, but by relatively

slow growth in the Northeast. The next task is to explain systematically

the variations in rates of change of Hospital wages across regions,

occupations and Health settings, and to analyze the industry's response

to these variations.

        1. See, however, studies by Altman [1970], Benham [1971],

Ehrenberg [1974], M. Feldstein [1971], and Yett [1970].

        2. The pioneering work of Friedman and Kuznets [1945] was

followed by many other studies, e.g. Hansen [1964], Benham, Maurizi and

Reder [1968], and Sloan [1970].

        3. Except for very young workers. See Michael Hurd [1971].

        4. This point was made to me by Giora Hanoch.

        5. Assume that 15 percent of the workers who had earnings in

1969 were not employed in the Census week in 1970. Assume that compared

to those workers who were employed both in 1969 and the Census week in

1970, their annual hours were 40 percent less and their average hourly

earnings were 25 percent less. Their inclusion, if possible, would have

lowered average hourly earnings by a bit over 2 percent.

        6. If we know the ratio to all industries (X) and we know the

fraction of total employment (n) accounted for by the industry in question,

then the ratio to all other industries (A) is given by


        A = (X—nX)(1—nX).

If X is fairly close to one and n is fairly close to zero, then the ratio

to all other industries is approximately


        A       X+n(X-l).

Thus, if X =   1.10 and n = .1, then A = 1.112.             If X =   1.10, n = .2,   then

A = 1.128.     If X =   1.20,   n =   .1,   then A =   1.227.   For the Health Industry
                                      27




as a whole, n =   .06,   but for the category "white females, 13—15 years

of schoolingt' n =   .18.
        7. The tendency for male earnings to be low in industries and

occupations that are predominantly female is not limited to the Health

field. In an earlier study of sex differentials in earnings across 46

industries, I found that, ceteris paribus, hourly earnings of males

decreased .2 percent for every one percentage point increase in the

female share of industry employment. [Fuchs, 1971]

        8. For the actual and expected hourly earnings by division, see

Appendix Table D.

        9. The major exception is Hospital wages in New England in 1969,

which were the highest in the country, although wages in other New

England industries were at the national average.
