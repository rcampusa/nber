       This   paper attempts to provide a framework for analyzing the inter-

action between real decisions (concerning investment and factor inputs)

and financial decisions (concerning debt and new share issues) of a cor-

poration. The model carries a rich menu of tax rates and explicitly in-

corporates bankruptcy and default. The firm's multi—period optimization

problem is set up where real and financial decisions are simultaneously

determined     to maximize the value of the firm which is the market price of
uncertain future dividends. The main results of the paper are as follows:
if   the   firm's after—tax profits are small relative to investment, the firm
finances    new investment by retentions and debt; if they are large relative

to investment, financing additional investment is done through new shares

and debt; in the intermediate case, additional investment is financed

entirely    by debt.

1. Introduction

     This paper is an attempt to provide an analytical frame-
work for studying the interaction between corporate invest-
ment and financial policy. Almost all of the huge literature
on investment has been concerned with the optimal level of
investment or capital stock taking the firmts financial
policy as given and independent of the level of investment.
The theory which posits that investment is a function of
Tobin's(l969) q assumes either that investment is financed
entirely with retentions (Hayashi(l982)) or that a constant
fraction of investment is financed with debt (Summers(1981)

and Poterba and Sumrners(l992)). The theory which posits that
the optimal capital stock (as opposed to optimal investment)
is determined at the equality of the "cost of capital" and
the marginal product of capital makes similar assumptions to
derive the expression for the cost of capital (see,    e.g.,
Chirinko and Kinq(1982)].     On the other hand, much of the
equally large literature on corporate finance (with possible
exceptions of Gordon(1981) and Auerbach(l982)) has been
concerned with corporate financial structure taking the
firm's investment and other real decisions as given.

    Those who are accustomed to the tradition of Modigliani

and Miller might think that investment is independent of how
it is financed.   This is indeed true if there are no taxes
(Modigliani and Miller(l958) and Stiglitz(l969)] or if there
 are no bankruptcies and the corporate tax rate is equal to
 the individual marginal tax rate (with the dividend tax and
 the capital gains tax rates being zero) tMiller(1977fl.      But
if both taxes and bankruptcies are present, the value of the

firm is not independent of its financial structure and the
firm's investment and financial decisions are interrelated.

     Using the Capital Asset Pricing Model with taxes, Cordon
(1981) has analyzed the interaction between the        optimal
capital stock and the optimal debt—capital ratio.     However,
he appears to assume that profits are proportional the stock

of capital without allowing for adjustment costs associated

with investment, so the optimal capital stock is actually
indeterminate in his model.   He also appears to assume the
fraction of new investment financed by debt is independent of
the capital stock. Auerbach(1982) has considered a determin-
istic model of a value maximizing firm where profits are a

additively separable function of the stream of past invest-
ments and where the corporate bond rate increases with the
debt—capital ratio.   He derived a few results on the inter-
action between the level of investment and the way it is
financed for special cases.

    The stochastic model of a corporation to be developed in
this paper explicitly incorporates bankruptcy and default
while allowing a rich menu of tax rates.   The model assumes
that the firm detemirjes investment and financial policies so
                            —3—




as to maximize its share price.     The model is very general
with respect to how the firm's uncertain future dividends are

priced; no assumptions like certainty equivalence, constant
risk premium, or the capital asset pricing model w111 be
made.   with a minimal set of assumptions on the pricing
mechanism, we will derive fairly sharp results concerning how
the firm finances investment and how the level of investment
is affected by the way it is financed.   The main results can
be summarized as follows.     If the firm's after—tax profits
are small relative to the level of investment, the firm
finances investment by retentions and debt.      If they are
large relative to the level of investment, addtional invest-

ment projects are financed with new shares and debt. In the
intermediate case, additional finance comes entirely through
debt.    Somewhat surprizingly, these results are broadly
consistent with Auerbach(l982) 's results which were derived
for a model different from ours.

    The organization of the paper is as follows.    Section 2
presents a very general pricing formula for the shares of the
firm under uncertainty with bankruptcy and default.       The
pricing formula is a considerable generalization of that in
Auerbach(l979).   Section 3 formulates the firm's problem of
maximizing its share price and derives the associated dynamic
programing algorithm. Section 4 makes a brief detour to the
taxless world and verifies the Modigliani—Miller theorem.

Sections 5 and 6 consider what we call the homogeneous case

where production and adjustment costs associated with invest-
ment exibit constant returns to scale and where the firm is

competitive. It is shown in section 5 that the value of the
firm is proportional to its debt and capital stock.    The
results in section 6 on the interaction between investment
and financial policy are sharp: the ratio of debt to the
end—of—period capital stock is independent of investment or
else the fraction of additional investment financed by debt
is 100%.   In section 7, we derive similar but less       sharp
results for the case without adjustment costs. We will also

show in section 7 that the notion of "cost of capital" loses
its usefulness in a model such as ours where bankruptcy is

explicitly incorporated. We will not consider the case with
adjustment costs and without constant returns to scale, since
it is a straightforward combination of the two cases analyzed

in sections 5, 6 and 7. Section 8 lists qualifications.

2. Pricing Formula with Bankruptcy and Default
     We consider the behavior of a firm in a discrete time,
Stochastic model. The firm is assumed to act so as to maximi-
ze its shareholders' wealth. At the beginning of the period,
the firm decides whether or not to go bankrupt. If it decides
not to go bankrupt (i.e., if the bankruptcy dummy Mt =       1),
the (cum—dividend) share price at the beginning of the period
        Let      stand for the number of pre—existing shares.
At the beginning of the period, the firm issues         units of
new shares at the ex—thvidend price p, issues new debt
                                                           Bt
(which, for the sake of simplicity we take to have a maturity
of one period), pays interest and principal
                                          (l+it,)sti on
corporate debt, and distributes total dividends dtot to
pre—existing shareholders.  After all this happens, new
information hits the stock market and the ex—dividend price

p becomes Mt+lptl at the end of period t (i.e., the begin-
ning of period t+l).      If the firm decides to go bankrupt
(i.e., if Mt = 0),     shareholders receive nothing and bond-
holders take over the firm.' Dividends are taxed at rate       0

at the personal level.        Capital gains are taxed at a lower
rate c. All stockholders face the same tax rates, 0 and c.2
     The equilibrium condition that links the cum—dividend
price Pt and the ex—dividend price p is the following:3


         Pt =   (l_et)d   +
                              p   —
                                      c(pL   —
                                         —6--




 i.e.,

 (2.1)         Pt =   mtdt    +    p,     where rn =
                                                       (l—et)/1_ct.

The ratio mt is less than one Since                     <
                                                            8•    Dividends per
share, dt, can be written as


 (2.2)                        +
            dt =      Xt/Qt
where
(2.3)           =
                    (i_ut)   TTt        (l_kt)vtFt +

                    — Cl+(l_ut)iti)Bti
                =   cash flow + new debt issue

         fl =   before—tax profits where variabie factor inputs
                are already maximized out,
         F =    investment,
         k =    rate    of investment tax credit,
         v =    price   of investment goods,
         u =    corporate         tax rate,
         B = new issues of debt,
         i =    corporate      bond rate.

Using (2.i) and (2.2) we can easily derive


(2.4)     Pt =       mx/Q          + (1 +



    Associated with before—tax profits                       in
                                                        '         (2.3) is the
                               —7—




production function Gt(Kt,Nt,Ft,et), where N is a vector of
variable factor inputs and e is the shock to technology. Here

we follow Lucas(1967) and allow output to depend negatively
on investment F: aG/aF .s o.         This is how we introduce adjust-
ment costs associated with investment. The firm's investment
activity of volting down investment goods within the firm is
a resource—using activity; as F increases, more and more
fraction of K and N must be directed to the investment activi-

ty and as a result output goes down. We assume convex adjust-
ment costs, i.e., GFF < 0.           Therefore the first and second
partial derivatives of l1      with    respect to Ft is nonpositive:


(2.5)        =                       c 0, and 9TFF <   0.
                 lTt(Ft,Kt),   TIF



The profit function should also involve the technology shock
   and the parameters that characterize the demand and supply
functions (for output and factor inpits) that the firm faces.
If, in particular, the firm is competitive in the markets for
output and factors of production, the profit function will
involve output and factor prices as well as F and K.             The
dependence of profits on those variables is left implicit in
the profit function.

        Let L(xt+.) be the price that would be given by the
asset market as of t for an asset which pays (possibly sto-
chastic) tax—free          dollars at t+j.     Thus L is a mapping
                              —8—-




 from the space of random variables to real numbers.5                 By def-
 inition, L(Xt) =     Xt, and L(l) =    l/(l+r.)     where r is the
 nominal rate on a tax—free i—period default—free bond.                   Ross
 (1978) has proved that if there are no arbitrage opportuni-
 ties left, the operator Lt satisfies



 (1) linearity: L(p1x + p2y) =       p1L(X)   +
                                                  u2L(y)           for any
                    nonstochastic    and

 (2) iterative property: L(L+j(xt+. k3 =

                                                           j   ,   k>O.


Using this pricing operator, the relationship between p. and
t+l is given by


          L(Mt÷ipti — Ct+i(Mt+ipt+1_pP) =
i.e.,
(2.6)     p =   L(at+ipt÷i),
where
(2.7)           =



By doing recursion on (2.4) and (2.6) and using the above

properties of Lt. we can derive (see Appendix 1):


(2.8)           =

where
                     io L(vt.   rn. Xt÷.),
                                     —9—

 (2.10)     t+j = (1 +                              +



We   note that Tt,j =       0   if Mt+k =      0   for some k such that j>k>l.
     One simple way to allow for defaults is the following.
Bondholders can receive full amount (l+it)Bt if the firm is
not bankrupt at t+l.             In the event of bankruptcy in period
t+l, bondholders take over the firm and attempt to sell the
firm to the highest bidders. The market value of the firm at
t+l without obligation to pay interest and principal (l+it)Bt
is clearly equal to:



(2.11)      t+1t+l +            tl+(l_ut÷i)it)Bt.

This is what the bondholders can receive in period t+l in the
event of bankruptcy.            Letting 8' stand for the tax rate on
interest income, the corporate bond rate i must satisfy


(2.12)     1 =

 3. The Firm's Optimization Problem

     With the pricing formula (2.8) at hand, we can now formal-
 ize the firm's optimization behavior.     Our formulation will
 closely parallel Lucas and Sargent(lgl)•      We begin with a
 few definitions.   The exogenous variables are the variables
that the firm cannot influence their values.      They include;
tax rates (u,e,e',c,k), the technology shock (e), and the
parameters characterizing the demand and supply functions
 (for output, factor inputs and investment goods) that the
firm faces.6 We assume that these exogenous variables are
part of a larger set of variables z which follow a Markov
process.7 The Vector Z will be referred to as the state of

nature, because it determines not only the stochastic proper-

ties of the exogenous variables that the firm will face in
the future but also the functional form of the pricing opera-

tor L (j>0).8 The current return mx in (2.8) depends on:
the current value of the
                          exogenous variables, Et, Ft, itl,
Bti, and      The last three variables are called the firm's
state variables as they are historically given to the firm at
the beginning of the period.      The information set in period
t, I, consists of the state of nature           and the firm's
state variables itl,Bti,Tc. We assume that         is known to
both the stock market and the firm at the beginning of period
t.   The firm's action is a vector                     and the
associated variable factor inputs.     The firm determines its
                                        —11—




current action as a function of                     This function is called
the firm's decision rule and is denoted by                       Since   the

number of pre—existing shares,                      is historically given,
maximizing Pt is equivalent to maximizing the value of the
firm, Vt =               whose expression is given by (2.8).          Since
the current information set                    and a sequence of decision
rules                        completely determine the nature of the
stochastic process for                              (j0), the value of the
firm depends only on I and t't+l'•--• We assume the
firm knows the pricing operator Lt, so that it can correctly
evaluate how the stock market would react to any hypothetical

action contemplated by the firm.

        Let Vt(It) be the value of Vt that is maximized over
                )   conditional    on Mt =     1.   shareholders' wealth is

Vt(It) if the firm stays in business in period t, and zero if
it goes broke. Thus the firm's bankruptcy decision is simply
the following:



                     1 if Vt(It) ) 0
(3.1)           =
           Mt
                     0    otherwise.



This and (2.11) imply that the amount that bondholders can
receive in the event of bankruptcy in period t is always less

than the full amount (1÷it1)3t1 that they can receive if
                                     —12—



 the firm is in operation. Clearly, the probability of bank-
 ruptcy in period t increases with                              It is for this
                                                   Bt,.
 reasorf that the corporate bond rate
                                                 i increases with Et.
     If the firm stays in business, the firm's optimization
problem is to find a sequance              (with Mt = 1) of
                                      (uut+i....)
optimal decision rules that maximizes                          But there are a
                                                    v..
few constraints that the firm is subject to.                       The first is
that (per share) dividends dt must be greater than or equal
to some lower bound U.         (if          =    0, this constraint simply
says dividends must be nonnegative. )                     In     some countries
(e.g., Japan and the United Kingdom) repurchase of equity is
illegal.         The second constraint, therefore, is that g be
nonnegative.'0          The third constraint is, of                course, the
capital accumulation constraint. Thus the (currently operat-
ing) firm's problem is



(3.2)        max             subject to dt÷ a

where V is given by (2.8), ó is the exponential rate of
phisical depreciation of capital, and                          constrained such
that Mt = 1.        The value of Vt evaluated at the sequence of
optimal decision rules       (p,p11..) (with Mt = 1) is, of
course, v /
           ti'
                                    —13—



    Now, it immediately follows from (2.8) that


(3.3)       Vt =   mX    + tL(at+iVt+i).


We note here that L(at+iVt+1(It1)), which is the value of
L(at+iVt+1) evaluated at the optimal future decision rules
                   ),   is a function of Bt, Kt÷l and                We
submerge the dependence of            on    in the functional form
and write


(3.4)    Wt(Bt,Kt÷i) =      L(at+1Vt+1(I+1)).

It is clear from (2.6) and (2.8) that this W is equal to
tt+l Although it is a function of the future optimal
decision rules, the value of W is independent of current
decision rule           as long as the values       St and Kt+l are
given.   Furthermore, the current return mx is not influen-
ced by the firm's future actionj2            Therefore, the firm's
current action                   implied by the optimal decision
rule u (with Mt = 1) solves the familiar DP (dynamic program-
ming) algorithm:


(3.) Vt(It) =        max    (mX +
                    g,B,F
                               subject to dt
                                           g > 0,
                                                =             + F.

    What restrictions can we place on         An increase in Bt
(with      held constant) affects       in four ways. The first
is its direct effect on X1: x1 decreases as interest and

principal payments increases.         Second, it increases the
probability of bankruptcy in t+l, which lowers the discount-
ing factor Tt+lj (j>l) for any realization of              (j>O).
Third, it follows from (2.12) that the increased likelihood
of bankruptcy raises the corporate bond rate,        Fourth, it
becomes more likely that the constraint a >       is binding in
period t+1. An increase in Kt+l affects          in exactly the
opposite directions.     Therefore, Wt(Bt,Kt+1) decreases with
Bt and increases with Kt÷1. If Bt is sufficiently small, the
probability of bankruptcy will be zero.       The corporate bond
will then be default—free, so (l_e)i must be equal to

the nominal interest rate on a safe, tax—free one—period
bond. Furthermore, the constraint d > a will not be binding.
So the only effect of         W. is its direct effect on
                        Bt
It then follows that W(Bic+1) has the following separable
form (at least asymptotically) when      is sufficiently small:


(3.6)                             —
        Wt(B,ic+1) =    w(Kt+i)

(3.7)   w=    L(at+lmt+i(l+(l_ut1)it)).
Since Mti =   1   with probability one when     is sufficiently
                                      —15—



small, at+l is independent of Bt and Kt÷i. Thus w is exoge-
nous to the firm, implying that Wt(Bt;Kt+i) is a linear
function of B when          is sufficiently small. These informa-
tion on the functional form of Wt(Bt,Kt+i) will turn out to
be useful in later sections.

        The DP algorithm (3.5) can be simplified somewhat if we
notice



(3.8)       dtQt =      +

                        + YtWt(BtRt+1
where
              =



Thus (3.5) reduces to



(3.10) max (mtX(B,F) + (l_Y+mty)wt(s,(l_o)xc-s-F))

 4. The Taxless Case

        It is useful at this stage to pause briefly and see what
happens if there are no taxes while bankruptcy and default
are possible. We prove here that the Modigliani—Miller(lg5)
theorem holds for this case by following the arguments in
Stiglitz(1969) and Ross(1978).                 This exercise will put the
results in the following sections in a proper perspective.

      We first note from (3.10) that corporate equity policy is
irrelevant in the taxless world as              m =   1, so the constraint
xt +    yW   >         is   irrelevant. Proving the Modigliani—Miller
proposition that the value of the firm is independent of
leverage in the taxless world amounts to showing that
Wt(Bt,Kt+1) can be written in a separable form (for any value
of       and Kt+lf not just for small


(4.1)                                     —
             Wt(Bt,Kt÷1) =     W(Kt+i)

for   it follows from this that Vt =               + Wt is independent of
Bt. To prove (4.1), we note that Ct+l =
                                                      Mt+i in the taxiess
world, so


(4.2)        Wt(BtKt+1) =      L[Mt+1Vt1(It1))
                 =
                     L(Ytj)    —
                                   L((l_Mt+i)Yt÷1)    —
                                                          (l+it)BtL(Mt1),
where
                                   —17—




                =
(4.3)
                    vt+i(xt÷i)   + (l+it)Bt

                t+i —   (1_kt÷i)vt+iFt+i   + Bt÷l +


Since in the taxiess world (2.12) becomes



(4.4)    Bt =    (1+i)BI4(M1)       + L((1_Mt+1)Yt+i),


(4.2) reduces to (4.1) with W(Kt+i) =
                                                  L(Yt+1)J   This
completes the proof of the Modigliani—Miller theorem.

 5. The Homogeneity Assumption

      Properties of the solution to (3.10) depend1 of course,
 on the functional form of the value
                                           function wt(Btxt÷1). In
 this section and the next, we focus on the case where the
 firm is a price—taker and the production function G(K,N,F,e)

 is linearly homogeneous in K,N,F for any given e)4            The
 immediate implication of this is that the associated profit

 function is linearly homogeneous in F,K and satisfies


 (5.1) UtFt;Kt) =
                     t(ft)Kt,     Wt' 1 o,        S   0,


where     =
              Ft/1ct)5     It then seems clear that the value
function, too, is linearly homogeneous in
                                               BtIKti:

(5.2)    Wt(Bt,Kt+1) =


where At =
           Bt/1<t÷i =    Bt/((l_6+ft)xt)    w-ll be referred to as
the debt—capital ratio.   The intuition for (5.2) is quite
simplej6 When the initial
                             condition is (2Bt,2Kt1) it is
feasible for the firm to double the future level of invest-
ment, employment and corporate debt that are optimal if the
initial condition is              Since the probability of
                      (BtiIct1).
bankruptcy remains unchanged if the same corporate equity
policy is followed, the value of the firm under this decision
rule with (2Bl2ic) is at least twice
                                     wt(BtKt1), i.e., it
                               —19—




must be that Wt(2Bt,2Kt+i) >
                                2w(B9ic÷1).      Apply the same
argument in the opposite direction to obtain
  wt(BttKt÷i)/2. Thus we have Wt(2Bti2lct+i) =
                                                   2Wt(BtKt÷1).
This result, which is a generalization of Lucas and Prescott

(1971) and Hayashi(1982), is proved in Appendix 2.      We note
from (2.6), (2.8) and (3.4) that ht as defined by (5.2) is
equal to the ex—dividend value of the firm divided by

namely PQt+i/Kt+i. So the result states that Tobin's(l969)
"marginal g",   awt/(vtaKt+i), is equal to the "average q",
Wt/(vt}(t+i).
    This assumption of homogeneity has been popular but often
implicit in the corporate finance literature.      For example
Nodigliani and Miller(1963) stated in their footnote        15:

"...we are referring in principle only to investments which
increase the scale of the firm. That is, the new assets must
be in the same 'class' as the old." (Italics original) Since

the "return" of new assets is the same as that of the exist-
ing assets, an increase in the value of the firm due to
investment, aW/a}(+1, must be equal to the average value of
the firm, wt/Kt+1. In Gordon and Malkiel(1981), the marginal
return on real investment is represented by s.    But the same
symbol represents the return from investing a dollar in
equity. Their footnote 33 states: "Assume that the firm pays
out as dividends p percent of its after—tax profits and
reinvests the rest.   Also assume that the investor with a
                                —20—




marginal tax rate of m on interest payments has a marginal
tax rate of n on dividends..., When investing a dollar in
equity, the investor receives as dividends ps(1—t)(l—n) after
tax." (t is the corporate tax rate.)       Unless all assets in
the firm share the same return, this would not happen.
       We have seen in section 3 that Wt(Bt,Kt+1) decreases with
      and increases with       and that W. is linear in      Bt at
least asymptotically when Et is small.      So ht(At) must be a
decreasing function of the debt—capital ratio A and (at
least asymptoical1y) linear when A. is small.          We assume
that ht(At) comes down to zero as A reaches I.        If   ht does
not come down to zero or if it does so only asymptotically,
the firm's optimization problem wIll have no finite solution.
When At is greater than or equal to this I,   the firm is bound
to be bankrupt.      Then nobody buys the corporate bond issued
by the firm, because the rate of return on such bonds is
dominated by that on a safe, tax—free bond. So the feasible
debt—capital ratio must be less than X,     i.e.,   A c I.    The
graph of ht(At) is illustrated in Figure 1.
      With these restrictions on ht, we are now ready to solve
the   DI' algorithm (3.10).   without loss of generality we can
set      =    and   convert the DP algorithm into the following
"per—capital" form:

                       Bt/Xt,    f =

 6. Financing Decisions and the Investment Equation

     Probably the most instructive way to solve the DP algori-
 thm (53) is first calculate as functions of f the optimal

 financing package b(f),y(f) that maximizes the                  objective
 function for a given value of f and then change f to find the

optimum of the objective function that is maximized out over
b and y, although the optimization problem can alternatively

be solved by choosing b,y,f simultaneously.    For the most
part, we will assume that m = (l—e)/(l—c) is less than one.

The following three cases can arise.                Case 1: y > 0 is bind-
ing but d > a is not. Case 2: both constraints are binding.
Case 3; d > a is binding but y > 0 is not.    At least one
constraint must be binding because otherwise the firm always

gets better off by reducing new share issues.


Case 1:   If d > a and y = 0, (5.3) reduces



(6.1)     max mx(b,f) +
          b, f
                                    (l—o+f)h(b/(l.o+f))

The first order condition with respect to b is


(6.2)     m +    h'(X)       = 0,



where A is the debt—capital ratio                          So the optimal

 (6.3)   b1(f) = (1—o+f)x1,
where
 (6.4)   h'(X1) =   —in.




The first order condition with respect to f with b =
                                                                       b1(f)   is



(6.5)    h(X1)/m + A1 = (1—k)v —              (l—uulT'(f),
i.e.,

(6.6)    £ =


               PQt+i/mt       +   Bt   —   (1_kt)vt
                 '1                           1


where u is the inverse function of —ir'(f).                        This is the
investment equation derived by Poterba and Summers(1g82) for
the capitalizatjon hypothesis" which assumes that the firm
never issues new shares.          In their derivation, the constant
debt—capital ratio A1 is exogenous].y given; here, the ratio
turns out to be constant as a result of optimization.

    We note that w also depends on current output and factor
prices and the technology shock, since ir'                   is   a function of
them as well as f.         If the production function G takes the
separable form G(K,N,F,e) = G1(K,N,e) — G2(K,F,e),                      then w
does not involve output and factor prices.

Case 2. If both constraints are binding, (5.3) reduces to


 (6.7)    max      (1—o+f)h(b/(1_o+f))       subject to x(b,f) = a.
          b,f
The optimal debt given f is determined by the binding const-
raint    = a. Thus

(6.8)    b2(f) =    a - Rt/xt   —   (l—u)ir(f)    +   (1—k)vf.


This is a convex function of f since 71"           1 0.    The first order
condition with respect to f with b =
                                             b2(f)     gives


(6.9)    —   h[A(ffl/h'[X(f))   +   X(f)   = (1—k)v —
i.e.,
(6.10)       f=

where X(f) is the debt—capital ratio
                                                 b2(f)/(l—o+f).   Compar-
ing (6.6) and (6.10) we can see that hf in (6.10) plays
the role of m in (6.6). This —h'(f) is essentially unobserv-
able since in the present case there is no marginal condition

involving h'(X).
                                    —25-.




Case 3.   If d >   a is binding but y >        0   is not, (5.3) reduces
to


(6.11)    max      x(b,f) +    (1—6+f)h[b/(1—+f))      +   (m—1)a.
          b,f


The first order condition with respect to b is


(6.12)    1 +   h'(A)   = 0,



so that the optimal debt given f is



(6.13)
          b3(f)= (1—o±f)x3,
where
(6.14)    h'(X3) = —1.


The first order condition with respect to f with b =
                                                                     b3(f)
yields



(6.15)    h(k3) + A3 = (1—k)v —        (1—u)ir'(f),
i.e.,

(6.16)    f=

                          +
            —                  Bt — (1_kt)vt

                                   —26—




 This is the equation derived by Poterba and Suulmers(1982) for

 the "double tax view" which assumes that dividends are a
 constant fraction of profits and investment is financed with
 new share issues whenever necessary.
                                       In their derivation, a
 constant debt—capital ratio is assumed; in our derivation, it
 is a result of optimization.
                                Given b3(f), the optimal value
 of y is determined by the binding constraint x+y(l—+f)h =
                                                           a:

 (6.17)       y(f) =
                       ca-xcb3(f),f)],((1Ô+f)h(k))

This may or may not be an
                         increasing function of f, but it is
easy to show that the value of new shares issued,          =
          increases with f.



    It is easy to prove that A3 >
                                  A1 if m=(l—e)/(lc) c 1.17
Thus only three cases can happen concerning the ordering of

                                          b3, and (c) b1 c
b11b21b3: (a) b2 c b1 c b3, (b) b1 c b2
<
  b2. These three cases are illustrated in panels (a)—(c) of
Figure 2.   It is clear that Cases 1,2,3 corresponds to cases

(a),(b),(c), respectively. Therefore the graph of the optimal
debt b(f) consists of pieces of
                                b1(f), b2(f), b3(f), and will
look like the solid line in Figure 3, panel (i).18 The
                                                        graph
of y(f) is drawn in panel (ii) of Figure 3.

    The interpretation of the results concerning the optimal
                              —27—




financing package b(f),y(f) we have just derived is quite
clear.    If dividends are greater than the lower bound a, the
firm finances additional investment projects by cutting
dividends and issuing A1 dollars (per a dollar's worth of
investment) of corporate bonds.      If dividends cannot be cut
any further, financing additional investment projects is done
entirely by corporate debt. However, as soon as debt reachs
a critical level, the rate of increase of bond issues will be

cut back to A3 and marginal finance is done with new equity
and debt.    The graph of b2(f) represents the amount of debt
that is necessary for the firm to deliver per share dividends
a without resorting to new share issues.         Therefore the
vertical difference between b2(f) and the solid line b(f) for
f >
      f2 is the amount of funds raised by flew equity,
Note that it is not the firm's optimal policy to finance
investment entirely by cutting dividends even when it is
feasible. This is because the increase in capital stock due
to current investment makes bankruptcy less likely for any
given level of debt; what determines the likelihood of bank-
ruptcy in the homogeneous case is the debt—capital ratio At =
              This is also why debt finance coexists with
equity finance in Case 3.    We also note from panel Cc) of

policy, even if repurchase of existing shares is legal.

    It may be useful at this point to briefly look at the role

 Of what we call the firm's cash income (l—u)m(f) —           in
                                                      Rt/Kt
 financing decisions.   If this increases by one dollar, the
 graph of b2(f) shifts downwards by exactly one dollar.  If
 the increase in cash income does not change the functional
 form of h(A) —— which is what happens if,
                                            e.g., the increase
 is due to a purely transitory
                                technology shock ——, then the
graphs of b1(f) and b3(f) do not shift; so that the critical
levels of investment
                     f1 and f3 that divide the three Cases in
Figure 3 will both increase, making Case 3 less likely.

     Turning now to the determination of investment given the

financing package, we first note that the optimal investment
must satisfy the marginal condition (6.5) for Case 1, (6.9)
for Case 2, and (6.15) for Case 3. A natural way to interpret

this marginal condition is to take the LBS (left hand side)
as the marginal "benefit" of investment and the right hand
side —— investment
                   expenditure plus profits foregone due to
investment —— as the marginal "cost" of investment.20
                                                          Since
h(X) decreases with A and since
                                A1 c b2(f)/(l—o+f) c A3, the
LBS of (6.5) is always greater than that of (6.15), and the
LBS of (6.9) lies between the two in Case 2.21        This is
illustrated in Figure 4, panel (i).     The upper horizontal
line, labelled Line 1, is the graph of the LHS of (6.5) and
Line 3 that lies below it is the graph of the LBS of (6.15).
                                —29—



The downward sloping line, lebelled Line 2, that cuts Line 1
and Line 3 from above is the graph of the LHS of (6.9).      Thus
the graph of the marginal benefit of investment consists of
pieces of these three lines and is represented by the solid
line in Figure 4.     The graph of the marginal cost of invest-
ment is the upward sloping curve whose intercept is (l—k)v —
ir'(Q)   and whose slope is —(l—uyir"(f)>o.   The optimal invest-
ment f* is determined at the intersection of the two curves.
In panel (i), Case 2 is occuring. Now let's see what happens
if there is an increase in the firm's cash income (l—u)7T(f) -

Rt/K.    To make the story simple, suppose that the increase is
caused by a (positive) technology shock of purely temporary
nature that enters the current profit function  additively,
                                                   it



so that the shock shifts neither Lines 1 and 3 through its
effect on h(X) nor the marginal cost curve through its effect
on ir'(f).   Under these conditions Line 2 will slide horizon-
tally to the right along Line 1 and Line 3, as the critical
levels of investment f1 and f2 move to the right.        This is
illustrated in panel (ii) of Figure 4 where the new optimal
investment is f** which is greater than the old level f*•     We
can thus conclude that a windfall gain which increases the
firm's cash income but which is totally unrelated to the
future exogenous variables can increase current investment.
This may explain why corporate investment in the U.S. appears
to be too sensitive to current profits.

     We close this section by quickly looking at the case
where m = 1.        As was noted in footnote 3, this case arises
if dealers in securities can deduct unlimited amounts of
short—term capital losses against ordinary income and the
stock prices are set by these dealers.         It is clear from
(5.3) that when m = 1 the objective function is independent

of y and hence the optimal amount of new issues is indeter-
minate as long as the implied value of d is greater than or
equal to a.    In   particular, it is a rational behavior of the
firm to simultaneously pay dividends and issue new shares.
However, the optimal debt—capital ratio is determinate at
                                                              A3
and independent of investment,           clearly, the investment
equation is given by (6.16) and the graph of the marginal
benefit of investmtnt collapses to Line 3 in Figure 4.

7. Real and Financial Decisions without Adjustment Costs

         We now go back to (3.10) and investigate the firms
optimal decisions without adjustment costs. Thus the product-
ion function G and the associated profit function TI do not
involve investment F.          In order to make the optimization
problem well—defined, we assume that the value function
                  is concave in Kt+1; otherwise there will be no
solution to the firm's optimization problem. Although unable
to prove, we conjecture that a sufficient condition for the
concavity is that the profit function is cancave in the
capital stock.

        It will be convenient and instructive to write the first

order conditions in terms of marginal q, which we recall was
defined to be



(7.1)             =



As   in the homogeneous case, three cases arise.          (In what
follows the time subscript will be dropped whenever no confu-.
sions should arise.



Case 1: If y =        0   and X + yw > dQ, (3.10) reduces to


(7.2)       max mX(B,F)
            B,F
                                      —32—




  The first order condition
                               with respect •to B is


  (7.3)    m + Wfl
                     f(1_ó)1(f) = 0,


 where WE is the partial derivative of
                                       Wt(Bt,Ktj) with res-
 pect to B•     This implicitly defines the optima], level of
 debt, B1(p), as a function of F.
                                    The first order condition
 with respect to F with B =      yields
                               B1(F)

 (7.4)    /(1—k) =

i.e.,  the end—of—period capital stock
                                         Kt+l is optimal when
marginal q adjusted for investment tax credits is equal to
                                                                       m.


Case 2: If both constraints
                                are binding, (3.10) reduces to


(7.5)     max wcBt(l_o)xt÷F)     subject to X(B,F) =
          B,F

Since the level of debt must satisfy x =
                                         aQ, we have


(7.6)     B2(F) =    - (1—u)   'ff(Ic) + (1—k)vF —
                                                      Rt           -




which is a linear function of     F.         The first order condition
with respect to F with B =             is
                              B2(F)
                                   —33—




 (7.7)        /(l—k) =     wB1_6+F:h
An interpretation of this marginal condition will be given
shortly.



Case3: If X=aQ and y>0, (3.10) reduces to


(7.8)         max X(B,F) +w(fl,(l—o)+F) + (m—l)aQ.
              B,F


The first order condition with respect to B is


(7.9)         1 + WB(BI(l_flK+F) = 0,



which defines the optimal level of debt, B3(F), as a function
of F.     The first order condition with respect to F with B =

33(F)    is



(7.10)        q/(1—k) = 1,


i.e., marginal q (adjusted for investment tax credits) must
equal one at the optimum.        This is the condition derived by
Gordon(1981) for the case where the firm can           repurchase
pre—existing shares.
                                     -34—




       As we have seen in section
                                               affects wt(B1ic+1)
 four ways and
                     Kt+i affects Wt(Bt,}(t1) in exactly the opposi-
 te directions. So it is reasonable to assume:


 (7.11)
                   2Wt(Bt,xtl)/(2saK) <0.

It then follows from (7.3) and (7.9) that B1(F) and
                                                    B3(F) are
increasing functions of F.   Furthermore, it is easy to show
that B1(F) s B3(F) for any value of F.22 If B1(F) and
are continuou functions of F, the optimal financing package
B(F),y(F) w1ll typically look like the solid lines in Figure
5.     So the basic conclusion ——           that   marginal investment
projects are financed by retentions and by debt if the firm's
after—tax profits are large relative to investment, by new
shares and debt if they are small relative to investment, and
by debt alone in the intermediate case —— is the same as in

the homogeneous case.          If B1(F) and B3(F) are discontinuous
functions of F, "case reversals" can occur. A typical example
of case reversals is illustrated in Figure 6 where Case 2 is
followed by Case 1 as F passes
     If itt   is   equal to one, the situation is basically the same
as in the homogeneous case; from the viewpoint of the value
maximizing firm, issuing new shares and cutting dividends are
two perfectly indifferent ways of financing investment; the
                              —35—




only difference from the homogeneous case is that the optimal

debt—capital ratio B3(F) is not independent of investment.
     The above discussion of the firm's real and financial
decisions evolves around marginal q and we have not mentioned
the "cost of capital" or the "return to investment" which are
familiar concepts in the corporate finance literature.         A
natural question is whether or not they can be related to the
above derivation of the necessary conditions for optimality.

The answer is yes, with some important reservations.       It is
evident in the above derivation that (7.7) must hold in
either case.23    It turns out, not surprisingly, that        ——

which is the decrese in the ex—dividend value of the firm
         when debt is increased by one dollar ——     is   closely
connected to the "cost of capital" and q/(l—k) to the "return
to investment."    However, they cannot be expressed in terms
of the corporate bond rate and the marginal value product of
capital, unless Bt is small relative to Kt+l.    If it is, the
probability of bankruptcy in period t+l is almost zero and
Case 1 is bound to happen in t-i-1.    What happens if it is
known with certainty in period t that Mt+l = 1 and Case 1
occurs in period t-1-l? It follows from (3.4) that



(7.12)     Wt(BtKt+1) =   L((l_ct+1)V+1]/(l_L(c÷1))1
                               —36—




 so that (assuming the order of taking derivatives and apply-
 ing the pricing operator can be interchanged)


 (7.13)    WB(Bt,Ktl) =    L((l_ct+l)avtl/a5)/(1_L1(c))
 and

 (7.14)   wx(Bt,Kti) =
                          L((1_ct+l)avtl/aKtl)/(l_Ll(c))
where WK(Bt,Ktl) is the partial derivative of
with respect to Kt+l. But it is easy to show that



(7.15)    avlnB = _mt+l(l+(1_ut1)i)
and

(7.16)

            =
                mt÷l((l_ut l 1r÷l/aK+l + (l—6)(l_kt+i)vt÷1J,

if Case 1 holds in period t+i.24      This result —— which holds
for any value of
                      and K1 (not just for small         for the
case without adjustment costs ——      is   proved in Appendix 3•
Combining (7.13) through (7.16) we can conclude that


(7.17)      =
and
            =
(7.18)
                L((l_ct   i)mtic(l_u )(
                      + (1_6)(l_k)vJ)/(1_Ll(c))
                                      —37--




If we further assume that c41 =               0   and that
                                                                    Ut+l, kt÷i
and v1 are known with certainty in period t, then (7.17)
and (7.18) simplify to



(7.19)
                          1 +


and
                                                        + (l_5)(l_kt+i)vt+iJ
(7.20)       WK=                          l+r
where rt is the nominal interest rate on a safe, tax—free one
period bond, MVP is the expected value of the marginal value
product of capital:25



(7.21)       ?4IJPt =



and      is a sort of risk premium associated with the uncer-
tain marginal value product of capital                  m+l/?K+1 as it is
defined by



(7.22)
            L(t+1/axt1)           =


Thus the optimality condition q/(l—k) =                     reduces to

                                      +

                                _t t
                                                  = 1
                                                        + (l_u1)i
                                    —38—




 If, on top of all this, we assume kt+i =
                                                        kt and v1 =
 then this simplifies to the familiar
                                      expression:


           MVPt/(l+tst)
 (7.24)                   =     +
             (l_kt)vt

 This is (approximately) equivalent to the following
                                                                   express-
 ion which is even more familiar:



 (7.25)    Etfl t+i/Kt÷j)
               (l_kt)vt
                                =
                                    i   +   At +

The left hand side is the "return
                                                   to investment" and the
right hand side is the "cost of capital."

    However, apart from the assumptions (on tax rates and the
price of investment goods) we have made, this familiar equal-

ity (7.25) will never hold at the optimum.               If      is suffi-
ciently small, the value function
                                            Wt(Bt,Kti) is linear in
(as (7.19) shows), so that the objective function
                                                  mx                 +
is linear in       This implies that the optimal debt                    is
either infinitely negative or large enough to make (7.13) and
(7.14) (from which (7.25) was derived) invalid.26
                                                     If    is
not small, neither        nor           (and hence q =
                                                              Wx/vt) has a
simple expression like (7.13) or (7.14), because.a chang in

   or in Kt+i alters the
                              probability distribution (as of t)

                                                        will
                               '—39—




occur in t+l.      Consequently, the cost of capital and the
return to investment that
                             appear in (7.25) capture Only one
effect of an increase in     and Kt+i on w, namely the direct
effect On
             X1. They do not capture the other three effects
——   the   resulting change in the discounting factor
(j>O) (which affects the share price), in the corporate bond
rate, and in the likelihood of
                                dt+l =         This seems to
be a serious omission,
                           Particularly because the corporate
bond rate in the real world does depend on leverage.

8. Qualifications

     Although it carries a rich menu of tax rates, the model

does not consider depreciation allowances for tax purposes on
investment expenditure.   We could incorporate them into the
model along the line indicated in Hayashi(l982), but doing so

would greatly complicate the analysis without altering the
main results of the paper.     It should however be noted that
the sharp results we obtained in section 6 will not carry
over to the case with depreciation allowances. The reason
for this is as follows.    Included in the firm's future cash
flow is depreciation allowances for tax purposes yet to be
claimed on past investments.      If the market value of this
stream of depreciation allowances were exogenous to the firm,
we could subtract this market value from the firm's share
price and carry out exactly the same analysis as we did in
section 6. This will in fact be the case if there is a full
loss offset and if shareholders can somehow secure that
market value of depreciation allowances in the event of bank-
ruptcy.   Otherwise the firm's future action does influence
the market value of depreciation allowances as it can alter
the probability of bankruptcy.    This is an element that was
absent in the analysis in section 6.

    The corporate bonds in our model have only one maturity.
Relaxing this seems to be a rather straightforward task whose
                               —41—




main part would be to formalize a rule to specify the shares
of bondholders of various maturities in the event of
                                                     bankrupt-
cy.

      Our analysis is a partial equilibrium one in the sense

that the pricing mechnism in the asset market is taken as
given.  In order to analyze, for example, the effect of a
change in tax rates or in the inflation rate on corporate
behavior, we have to know how the pricing formula is affected

by such changes. Analyzing it would require (like any other
studies on the effect of taxes and inflation on
                                                  corporate
behavior) a complete specification
                                      of preference, technology
and expectations formation,
                              which clearly is well beyond the
scope of the paper.

 Footnotes
 1.  It is assumed for simplicity that the liquidation value
 of the firm is zero.  In particular, as long as the liquida-
 tion value is proportional to the firm's capital stock, the
 analysis in sections 5 and 6 remains unchanged.
 2.   This is true in Japan where the dividend tax rate is .2

and the capital gains tax rate is zero for individuals.                 If
the dividend tax rate depends on the shareholders' income, U

represents the marginal tax rate for the shareholders.                 See
Miller(l977)

buy it back ex—dividend.           If the reverse inequality holds,
individuals can buy the stock cum—dividend and sell it ex-

price is set by these individual arbitragers.
                                               However, for
corporations in most countries capital gains and losses are
part of their corporate income.
                                              Furthermore, in the U.S. at
least, short term capital gains for individuals are taxed as
ordinary income.  Thus a sizable fraction of the agents in
the stock market are those for which   =

price is set by such agents, then m in (2.1) should be one,
See Kalay(l982) for more detaiLs.                  Most empirical studies
(see Auerbach(1982) and Kalay(l982)               foc a survey) show that
stock prices drop by siinificantly less than the value of the
dividend on the exrdividend day, implying that                m is less

 rn is written as (l—9t)/(l_c), but that m is less than one.
 We will consider separately the case where             =
 4.   We assume a full loss offset, so the firm can qualify for
 a rebate of utitlBti dallars when profits for tax purposes,
 (l_utr'ff —     (l+it1)sti,        is negative.     This assumption can
 easily be relaxed. Just define a dummy variable Dt for the
 sign of profits for tax purposes and
                                      replace u by utDt; the
 formal analysis in this paper will hold without any modifica-
 tions.

S. The capital asset pricing model is a special case of this.

Anothe.r example is the so—called consumption based capital
asset pricing model which implies L(xt+.) =
where
                                                            Et(yt.xt.)
         is the conditional expectation operator and                  =

and C = consumption.   -


6.    If the firm is a price taker, output and factor prices
and the price pf investment goods are the parameters that
characterize the demand and supply functions.
7.    The Markovness assumption is not really crucial for the
analysis that follows, but it clarifies it.

                (l—6)Kt+Ft effectively is in I.

 absent.

 11. It is also a function of
                                 i, but, as (2.12) shows, i. in
 turn is a function of
                         Bt.Kt+11Zt, and                ).
 12.    Otherwise the problem of time inconsistency (Lucas and
Sargent(19l)) will arise.
13. To prove that L(Yt+1) is independent of Et would require

mathematical induction starting from the terminal period of
the firm's horizon.   The entire result of the paper will
carry over to the case where the firm's planning horizon is
finite rather than infinite.

14. This does not necessarily mean that the technology shock
is multiplicative.
15.    This it' should not be confused with the marginal value

product of capital. Note that 71 also depends on the technolo-
gy shock and output and factor prices.
16. The same line of proof was independently found by Andrew
B. Abel.

17.    Since A1 maximizes mx + h(x) and A3 maximizes m + h(X),
we have mA1 + h(X1) >               and
                       mA3 + h(A3)       A3 + h(A3) > A1 +
h(A1). This and in c 1 imply A1 < A3• We are assuming here
that the maximizer of mx + h(A)        or   A + h(A)   is unique,
which is a reasonable assumption since the functional form of
h depends only on        it will be only by accident that the

 maximizer of mx + h(A)      or      x +   h(X)   is not unique.    We
 also assume that A1 is positive. A sufficient condition for

 this is that the function h(x) is linear for nonpositive A
 and its slope for nonpositive A, which is equal to w in
 (3.7), is less than ni (in absolute value).

 13. Since A1 and x3 are unique maximizer of mA +
                                                    h(A)           and
 A + h(A), respectively, "case reversals" cannot occur.
                                                                   For
 example, it cannot happen that Case 2 is followed by Case 1
 as f keeps increasing.
 19.   So the corporate bond rate i depends on
                                                            and Kt+1

non—homogeneous case.
20.    Note that ir'(f) is negative.        The cost of investment
must not be confused with the "cost of capital" which we will
define in the next section.

21. The proof is similar to the argument in footnote 17.
22. The proof is essentially the same as footnote 17.

23. For example for Case 1, (7.3) and (7.4) imply (7.7).
24.   If Case 3 holds in period t+1, (7.15) and (7.16) hold

with m+1 replaced by one.         (7.15) holds also for the case
with adjustment costs.
25.    If the firm is a price taker, air/aK is equal to the
marginal product of capital multiplied by the output price.
26. Of course, in the knife edge case where m÷1 is equal to
the riyht hand side of (7.17), the optimal debt Bt is indeter-
minate.

                             APPENDIX 1


     This appendix presents a formal definition of the pricing

 operator Lt and a proof of the pricing formula (2.8).                 The
 former closely parallels Ross(1978)          and Hansen, Richard and
Singleton(l992) and the latter Brock(1978).

     Let Mt+. be a set of random nominal after—tax payoffs in
period t+j. More formally, let zj (t=o,1,2.•. be a sequen-
ce of random vectors defined on a probability space U?,
                                                                 3,p).
We call the sequence up to t,                           the information
                                      Z0,z1,..,z    ,




set at t and denote it by               Let
                               I.e.                be the sigma field
generated by I.      Mt÷. is a set of functions from Q to R that
are %t÷5_measurable. By definition, Mt+. is a linear space.
Associated with     and    is a mapping L from Mt+ to R.
We assume:


(Al.l) Lt is a linear operator so that


      L(utxt+. + Xtyt+.) =
                              t1xt+)          +


      for any       and A in 1 (i.e., any 1j and            that are
          it_measurable.


Since L.(xt) is in Mt.. it can be priced by L. We
assume:
                                  —47—



 (A1.2)     L(L+.(xt÷.k)) =      Lk(xt+.+k).
 Ross(].976) has proved (1) that if M is a set of payoffs that
 can be spanned by available marketed assets and if L(x) is
 the market price of an asset whose payoff is x, then the
 absence of arbitrage opportunities implies that L satisfies

 (Al.1) and (Al.2), and (ii) that L can be extended to the
space of payoffs that includes non—marketed assets as well as

marketed assets (although the extension is not unique).

     We now prove (2.8). By multiplying both sides of (2.4)
by       and using t+l =
                              (l+)Q,   we obtain


(Al.3)           =        +


From (2.6) we get


(Al.4)      tt+l =

                     = L(atiptiQti)         (since   is in It).


Thus from (A1.3) and (Al.4) we obtain


                =
(Al.5)
                     mX   +


By shifting time forward by one period on (Al.3) and
                                                     multiply—
                                       —48--




 ing both sides by tCt+l we obtain


                          =
                              Btat+imt+ix+i        +


Apply       4 on   this to get


            tat+lPt÷lQt÷l) =     4( tat+lmt÷iXt+i)
                                   +


This    last term equals



            L(tatllL1(apQ))                                      (by AL4)

        =
                                                                 (by Al.l)
        =
            L(Yt2Pt+2Qt+2).                            [by A1.2 and (2.9))


Thus we have


    L(YtlPt+lQt+i) =          L(Yt     1mt+ix+1 +      L(vt2pt+2Qt+2)
By the sane argument we can easily show that


(Al.6
              L(Yt.pt.Qt.)
                           in  X
                        t.j t+j t+j            t
                             —49—




BY summing (Al.6) over i' we obtain


         =
             :: L(Yt   m+X÷.) ÷ L(YtNPt+NQt+N).

If we assume the transversality condition


      uirnL(ypQ) =           0,

we obtain the desired result (2.8).

          This appendix proves the following theorem:

 Theorem.          If the production function

                                                                         be the

 any realization of z and for all j>O, so that the discounting
 factor            (jo)   takes the same value under the two
 decision rules h* and hA for all          j>O.    Therefore we can
conclude that:



 the value of the firm with (AB1,xic) under hA
                                           =
                                               t   t—l' t' t

But since the left hand side is less than or equal to the
value of the firm with (AB1,xK) under the optimal decision
rule h*, we have



           Vt(XBi,XIc°;zt) -   AVt(B1iK7zt)

Exactly the same argument gives



          Vt(Bi,Ic;zt) >


These two inequalities imply the desired result.


Remark 1. To implement the decision rule hA at time t+j, the
firm (with the initial condition                       has to know
          and      which are functions of
                                              (ztizt1t...,zt.1).
So if the firm knows just               but not its past realized
values, the decision rule hA cannot be implemented.            We can
avoid this difficulty by redefining z to be (z0,z11...

Remark .       Since                =
                                        Lt(at÷lvtl(Bt,Kti;zti))
(see equation (3.6)    in the text) and since          does not
depend on the size of the firm (see (2.7) and (3.1)), our
Theorem immediately implies that Wt(Bt,Kti) also is linearly

homogeneous.

                            APPENDIX 3


      This section proves the following theorem:

 Theorem.  Suppose the value function (for the case without
 adjustment costs) Vt(Btl,Kt;zt) is a concave function in

 (Rti,ic) in a neighborhood of (Blic) and suppose the
 profit function Trt(Kt) is concave and differentiable in
                                                          Kt.
 Then Vt is a differentiable function of
                                         Bti,Jct at
 if either Case 1 or Case 2 occurs in the neighborhood of

             The derivatives are given by:

                            =
                                _mt(l+(l_ut)it1)
and

      avt(BliK;zt)flxt =                        +
                                                    (l—6)(l_kt)vt),
if Case 1 occurs in period t, and


      Vt(Bl,K0;z)/B         =

                            (l_ut)aRt/aK    +

if Case 3 Occurs ii period t.
    The proof of this theorem is essentially the same as the
proof of Theorem 1 in Benveniste
                                 and Scheinkrnan(l979), so we
do not repeat it here. We merely point out that
