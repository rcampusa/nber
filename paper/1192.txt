           International R&D Rivalry and Industrial Strategy


                               ABSTRACT



This paper presents a theory of government intervention which provides

an explanation for "industrial strategy" policies such as R&D or export

subsidies in imperfectly competitive international markets. Each pro-

ducing country has an incentive to try to capture a greater share of

rent-earning industries using subsidies, but the subsidy-ridden inter-

national equilibrium is jointly suboptimal. The equilibrium in the

strategic game involving firms and governments is modelled as a three

stage subgame perfect Nash equilibrium. The assumption that the gov-

ernment is the first player in this game allows it to influence equilibrium

industry outcomes by altering the set of credible actions open to firms.

1. Introduction

        National governments in a number of countries subsidize research and

development (R & D) activities of domestic firms, particularly in

industries in which foreign and domesticly owned firms are in compet-

ition for international markets. This paper presents a positive theory

to explain such industrial strategy policies in the context of an

imperfectly        comeptitive world where the R & U rivalry between firms plays
an important role. It is shown that a government which has the objective
of   maximizing domestic welfare has an incentive to introduce such sub-

sidies.


        We   focus on possible subsidization of cost—reducing or "process"
RR     fl cijch   as, for example, the recent Japanese and French subsidiza-
tion    of robotics in automobile assembly. Export subsidies are        also
considered.        We show that with export subsidies available, countries

would not choose to subsidize R & U.        Nevertheless, because GATT codes

effectively restrict direct export subsidies, we view the setting in

which only R & U subsidies are available as the most relevant case.
                                   -2—


     R   & 0 is assumed to be undertaken before the associated output is

produced, with firms anticipating the effect of R & 0 on the resolution

of output shares. Thus R & D serves as a commitment or credible threat,

along the lines considered in Spence (1977, 1979), Friedman (1979),

Dixit (1980) and Eaton and Lipsey (1980, 1981). In contrast to these

papers, however, where an established firm   acts   first1, we use a model

developed in Brander and Spencer (1983) where firms have equal opportun—

assumption that a government can credibly

(or output) subsidies before the R & 0 decisions are made by private

firms. We would like to emphasize that this is an example of a more

      principle in understanding government policy: the government
general

becomes the first player in a multi-stage game and can influence the

equilibrium   outcome of the game played by private agents by altering

the set of credible actions open to them.

                                                            is that it is to

                                           industries operating in inter-
of imperfectly competitive rent earning

national markets. It is well known that monopoly power in international

 trade provides incentives for governments to carry out policies designed

 to extract rent from foreign trade.    This includes the monopoly tariff

 argument (as in Johnson (1953)), the use of export taxes and encourage-
                                                          of domestic firms

  (as in, for example, Auquier and Caves (1979)), or the use of tariffs

  to extract rent from foreign imperfectly competitive firms (as, for

  example, in Brander and Spencer (1981)). The capture idea is somewhat

  different and is more closely related to the classic infant industry

 argument in trade theory. The difference here is    that   national

 incentives   do not arise from positive externalities or because capital
 markets are imperfect, but simply from obtaining a larger domestic
 share of internationally profitable industries.


 2: Overview

       The model of firm behaviour is based on a two stage game played by

 two competing firms, which we imagine to be located in different

 countries. In the first stage firms choose R & D levels, and in the

 second stage, output levels. The second stage equilibrium is a Nash

equilibrium in outputs, taking R & D levels as given by the preceeding

stage. Using this second stage solution we can then write down the

payoff   functions for the game played at the preceding stage: the
profits of each firm are written as a function of the pair of R & D
levels chosen. We seek a Nash equilibrium in that game. This gives
rise   to a subgame perfect equilibrium in the two stage game3, which is

characterized by inefficiently high levels of R & D for the output

levels chosen.


    This basic game is subsequently extended in several ways. First,

the government of one country is allowed to make a prior corrinitment to

subsidize R & D. Then, both governments are allowed to simultaneously
                                      -4-


set such R & D subsidies. Finally •both governments make simultaneous

moves to subsidize (or tax) R & D, and are allowed to announce export

sUbsidies. In each case we examine the subganie perfect equilibrium for

the extended three stage game.

      The principle results are as follows. With a single government

allowed to subsidize R & D we get an outcome equivalent to that which

would obtain if a leader—follower equilibrium were used in the basic

game at the "choice of R & D" stage. If both governments can subsidize

R & D both will do so. Finally, if R & D and output taxes or subsidies

are available, both governments will tax R & D, thereby achieving

production efficiency, and will accompany this by a subsidy on exports.

      Section 3 contains the basic model, the government is introduced

and the main results are developed in section 4, and section 5 contains

concluding remarks.


3.    The Basic Model


     We begin by analysing the last stage (the choice of output stage)

in the firms' rivalry. Each firm i produces output y1 at variable

cost C1, which includes all costs except R & D, and earns revenue R1.

The R & D level of firm i is denoted x1 and costs v1 per unit. Profit

     of firm i is then


                 112 i
                ir (y ,y ;x )   = Ri(y 12
                                       ,y ) - C (y ;x )
                                               1  i  I
                                                          - vii
                                                              x     (1)



     Outputs y1 and y2 are substitutes and we also assume that increasing

the output of one good decreases the marginal revenue of the other.

Using subscripts to denote derivatives, this implies
                                              -5—


                                   R1. < 0    ; R. < 0                                      (2)



  The effect of increasing cost-reducing R & D is, of course, to reduce

  C1 given y1, and the rate of decrease delcines as x1 increases.

  Marginal cost           is denoted c1 and is assumed to fall as x'

  increases:


                  C < 0       ;    C'   > 0    ;    c       > 0 ;
                                                                          c   < 0           (3)


      The Nash equilibrium in outputs is characterized by first order

 We also assume that own effects of output on marginal profit dominate

 cross effects, giving rise to the following condition:

                          A
                                    12 12

                                   117122 —                     > 0                     (6,


This conditions holds for most demand and cost structures, and is a

fairly standard condition in noncooperative models because, if it holds

globally, it insures uniquiness and global stability of the equilibrium.4

    The solutions, y and y2 to (4) depend on x and x2 and can be

written as

                   y1 =       112 ; y 2 q212
                          q (x ,x )       (x ,x )       =
                                                                                        (7)
Output (and market share) depend on marginal cost, which depends on x'.
An increase in cost-reducing R & 0 by firm                  1    will lower C',     shift   its

reaction function outward and increase its output and market share, as

illustrated in Figure 1 by the move from A to B. The reaction functions

in the diagram are downward sloping. This follows from total different-

iation of (4) with respect to y1 and y2 holding x1 and x2 constant,

which yields the slope of the reaction function, dy1/dy3 =


which is negative from (2) and (5).


                                                  Figure 1


     The algebra corresponding to Figure 1 comes from total differentiation

-of (4)           respect to y' ,          y2 and x1. Using (5) and (6) it follows

that a firm's Nash equilibrium level of output is increasing in own

R & D and decreasing in the other firm's R & ft.


     q = dy1/dx'         =   cr/A > 0                                           (8)

               dy3/dx1       _c1T/A
     This completes the analysis of the output stage in which R & D

levels are treated as exogenous. We now analyse the preceeding stage,

in which firms choose R & D leels. Firms are aware of the dependence

(via (7)) of output on R & U levels. Therefore, profits can be

written       as functions of x1 and x2. Let g1 (for gain) represent the
profit function for firm i.

The Nash equilibrium in R & D levels using (1), (4), and (10) is

 Crditicn (13) implies that own effects of R & D on marginal profit

 dominate cross effects. As was the case with condition (6), (13) ensures

 stability with the standard adjustment mechanism and ensures uniqueness, provided

 (13)   holds     globally.


        The sign of                is important for some of the comparative static

 results. From examination of its terms (see (13)),                    would normally
be negative5; an increase In the other firm's R & 0 normally reduces the

effect of own R & D on own profit. Unless otherwise indicated we will

assume this is the case

        gj c 0
                                                                                (14)

Also inspection of the expressions for                   and 9j (12) and (13) shows
that existence and uniqueness of equilibrium can be a problem in two-

stage models. At least one of the terms of                     is positive, making it

difficult to ensure that the second order condition for an interior profit

maximum holds. Nevertheless (12) and (13) will hold if C Is relatively
                                    -8-

     large, that Is, if the marginal cost reducing effect of    R   & D declines

 relatively rapidly. The study of existence, uniqueness and stability of

 perfect equilibrium is an interesting and nontrivial matter, but Is not

 something which we wish to pursue here given our emphasis on the comparative

 static properties of well behaved cases.



          We conclude this section by noting that firms do not minimize costs in

     this model. The condition for overall cost minimization is




          C4vEO                                                           (15)

     by (11), (2) and (9). Indeed, since      > 0 (which is the second order
     condition for cost minimization), R & 0 Is overused in that more R & 0 15

     used than required to minimize total costs for the output chosen.6

4.     industrial Strategy
        In this section we demonstrate that industrial strategy, in the
form of R & D subsidies or export subsidies, can enable a domestic
firm to capture a larger share of the world market so as to increase
profits and rent, net of subsidy, to the domestic country. We should
also point cut that the variable x could be interpreted as capital,
leading to a theory of investment subsidies. In any case, our
approach is to characterize the subsidies that would maximize rent.
In    practise, of course, governments have   neither   the information nor

the singlemindedness necessary to implement such finely tuned policies.
                                   —9-


 Nevertheless,   the arguments presented here seem to capture one
 significant aspect of real government incentives and behaviour.

      The government is introduced as an agent that can set subsidy
 rates on R & D expenditure at a period before the firms spend on
R & D. The assumption that the government can pre-commit itself to
such subsidies is essential to the analysis, and our conclusions are

tied to it. We do feel, however, that the assumption that the govern-

ment can act in this leadership role is fairly natural.

     There are   at   least two major reasons for such an assumption. One

is simple bureaurcratic sluggishness. The government's technology

for changing tax rates, once set, is relatively slow: the inflexib-

ility ofgovernment gives it its strength, placing it naturally in a

leadership role. A second point is that the government has a large

number of taxes and subsidies to set (and, for that matter, many other

policies as well) and is concerned with maintaining its reputation

for future policies.1 The model would not, in the words of a referee,

apply to a crude Marxian image of a banana republic, where the

government follows the directions of a corporation.

     The setting is as follows. There are two firms in the industry,

one located in the "domestic" country and one located in a foreign

country. In order to focus on the purely rent-seeking rationale     for
industrial   strategy we assume that all output is for export to other

countries. The possibility of domesticconsumption would generally

strengthen any incentives for subsidization of the domestic finn
                                          — 10 -




since   it tends to increase quantities and decrease prices, but we do

not analyze that issue here.         The domestic government wishes to

maximize net rent      accruing   to the domestic country, which in this

simple context is just the profit of the domestic firm minus the

cost of any policies carried out.


R & D Subsidies


        The first type of policy to consider is a subsidy (or tax) on

R & 0 by itself. This subsidy affects the levels of R & 0 committed

by firms   but   not the resolution of the output game given R & 0 levels

wiiiih iS epreseiLedby y1 =         q(x1,x2).8       Therefore, with a subsidy,

s, per unit of R & 0, the profit of the domestic from is (from (1)

and (10)),


                                                     — (v1—s)x1                   (17)

                                                       the effects of the subsidy on R & 0
         The first point of interest concerns

 levels. The subsidy shifts out the R & D reaction function of
                                          its equilibrium R & D and reducing
                                                                               the R 8 D

 Proposition     1

 A domestic R & 0 subsidy Increases domestic R & D and,
                                                           provided g c 0,
 reduces foreign R & D. If g > 0, foreign R & 0 rises.
                          21
 We might note that the relationship between the comparative static effects

      and x Is just x -x(g1/g2). Since the slope of the foreign firm's

 reaction function Is given by dx2/dx1 _1f92 it follows that

               x dx2/dx'                                             (19)


The Optimal Domestic R & D Subsidy

       The optimal subsidy is found by maximizing net domestic benefit B1,

which Is the profit of the domestic finn less the cost of the subsidy.

                 g(x1,x2;s) — 5X1                                    (20)
       81(s)

From   (17),   the domestic benefit (20), wIth a subsidy, Is just the profit of
the             firm (earned from exports) when there is no subsidy. The

question arises as to why subsidization could ever be called for, since,

after all, the firm wishes to maximize its own profit. What Is It that

the governt can do by subsidizing R & 0 that the finn cannot do for
Itself?
                                       — 12 —




         The answer lies in the nature of the firm actions which are compatible

with the subgame.. perfect equllibriLan. The level of R & D chosen by

the domestic firm is the level which maximizes its profit within the

confines of the behaviourwhich characterizes the two-stage Nash equil-

ibrium. If a finn violates this equilibrium it risks the possibility It

will earn lower profit In the unstable situation which follows. By

providing a subsidy to firms, the government alters the perceived cost

structure and thus changes the set of actions which are compatible with the two-

stage Nash equilibrium. This allows the domestic firm to earn higher profit

net of the subsidy. In essence the goverranent perceives an advantage from

introducing   an earlier stage of pre-coninitinent. The government corrrnits itself
to lowering the cost of pre-corrinitmen by domestic firms.



       It is simply not credible for the finn      to   do this by itself. For
example, just as a firm cannot deter entry by threatening to produce
a large output should entry occur, it     'fs   not credible for the firm to
pursuade other finns not to expand, by announcing         that It Is subsidizing,

in   some sense, its own R & D.   Without an actual subsidy, this is not

profit   maximizing behaviour given the level of costs and the nature of

the equilibrium. On the other hand, the government is assumed able to

offer a credible R & D subsidy, and can therefore influence the final

equilibrium.9

          There is, of course, nothing to stop the government in the other

country from acting in a similar manner. Later in the paper we discuss
                                              — 13 —




the noncooperative equilibrium that would arise with both governments
involved. For the present, however, we examine the incentives facing
a single government. We might also mention that the use of benefit
function       (20) involves the usual assumptions necessary for partial

equilibrium surplus analysis. In particular if R & 0 is not subsidized

the private cost of R & 0 reflects its full social opportunity cost.

           From (20) the first order condition for the welfare maximizing subsidy

 Is



           dB1/ds gx +         gx + g - x' - sx           0                                   (21)



           The partial derivative g x' from (17). Also g 0 from                    (ii)   and


      a    X1 dx2/dx1 from (19) so (21) reduces to


           dB1/ds (g (dx2/dx1) —        s)x    a   0


                  S
                          g   dx2/dx1                                                             (22)



The optimal R & D subsidy Is equal to the increase In own                 profit   from

a reduction In the foreign firm's R & D brought about by an increase In

own    R   & D.


ppostlon 2

          The optimal subsidy is positive.

Proof:

                      +   4q from   (10) (or (17)). Since              0 (by(4)), 4       R   <   0.

by (2), and           >   0 by (8), It follows that g Rq < 0.             Since by (12)

nd L14 dx2/dx1             -g2/g2 c 0, s      is   positive by (22).
                                          — 14 -


      Another way of looking at this point is simply to observe that       dB1/ds

 is positive at S      0, indicating that there is a rent-capturing incentive for

 the government to subsidize R & 0, despite the fact that the subsidy increases

 the bias toward excess use of R & 0 for any given level of output.1° Of

 course, In the unusual but not impossible case in which the foreign firm's

  reaction firctionis positively sloped (g1 > 0), then the domestic country has

 an incentive to tax domestic R & 0.



  Proposition 3

      The optimal R & D subsidy maximizes domestic rent earned from exports

 by moving the domestic firmi to what would have been the Stackelberg leader-

 follower point in R & D space with no subsidy.

 Proof:

      Suppose the domestic firiii   were a Stackelberg leader In R & D space
 and s =   0.   The first order condition for a profit maximum, taking account

 of the reaction of the foreign firm, is


     g(x1, X2; 0) 4 g(x1, x2;O) (dx2/dx1)          0                 (23)

With a subsidy the firm's profit is increased by sx so g1(x1, x2;s)

g1(x1, x2;O) + sx. The first order condition for the domestic firm

in the first staoe Nash R & 0 game, taking subsidy s
                                                           gdx2/dx1 as given
is g(x1,x2;O) + s       0, or g(x1,x2;O) + g(x1, x2;sXdx2/dx1)      0,

which Is the same as (23) since from the
                                             proof of Proposition 2, g Rq which
is independent of s.      That Is, Stackelberg leader—follower behaviour without

a subsidy gives rise to the same situation as Nash behaviour with    the   optimal
subsidy, which proves the result.
                                       — 15 —



         The optimal R & D subsidy is Illustrated in Figure 2. R & D reaction

 functions are drawn sloping downward. Without a subsidy, both reaction

 functions are satisfied at point N. Isoprofit contours show combinations

 of x1   and x2 that would yield   equal profit to firm 1. The most profitable

 position for firm 1, given the reaction function of firm 2,    is S, the
 Stackelberg leader—follower point. The subsidy shifts the reaction function

 of firm I so that It intersects the rectio function of firm 2 at the

 Stackelberg pDint.


                                      Figure   2



     The goverrmient does for the domestic firm what the firm cannot do
for ltself.1 The domestic firm might have the same understanding of
Industry   structure as the government but the subsidy can allow the firm to

achieve the profit maximizing Stackelberg leader point without disturbing

the Nash equllibrlLsnbehavioUrof the private firms. In addition, the domestic

firm would naturally prefer to be moved to the Stackelberg point by a govern-

ment subsidy since, without offsetting taxes, the subsidy results In a

redistribution of Income from   taxpayers to the shareholders of the   firm.

Persuading the goverrtient that subsidization of R & D will lead to a domestic

benefit from a greater share of the world market allows firms to enjoy

a higher level of profits without the risk of the price wars which might

result from the breakdown of the perfect Nash equilibrium.



    An alternative interpretation is that the government knows the structure

of Industry behaviour while the naive firms do not, or simply that the
                                  -16-




government has a different) possibly incorrect, view than do the firms.

This interpretation is not without interest or relevance but_is not really

in the spirit of the paper.



     The incentive for the goverment to subsidize R & D would still remain

(and perhaps be enhanced) If we had not assumed finns use R & D strategically.

The subsidy would still induce the domestic firm   to   use additional R & D

shifting out its output reaction function, and increasing its market share.

Furthermore the incentive to subsidize R & D remains If the foreign govern-

ment has announced credible R & D subsidies.


Noncooperative International Equilibrium

     This R & 0 rivalry does have a beggar_thy_neighbour aspect. By imposing

a subsidy, country 1 gains at the expense of country 2. (This follows easily

since dg2/ds gx c 0 from (18) and the proof of Proposition 2). Nevertheless,

the international non-cooperative equilibrium which would occur if each

country acted independently given the subsidy imposed by the other, does

Involve positive subsidies.



    To show this consider the net benefit


    B1(s1, 2) g1(x1, x2; i) — s1x1                                  (24)


earned by each country when both have subsidized R & D. This Is the

same form as (20) since the subsidy of country 2, s2, affects the profit

of firm 1 only indirectly through its impact on R & D levels. The non-

cooperative equilibrium occurs where BB1/s1    0 and 3B2/as2 0 and

implies positive subsidies (see the proof of Proposition 2),.
                                       —17—




              g(dx/dx1)                                                 (25)

  Although (25) has the same form as the single country subsld (22), the

  values of gj and dx'1/dx will be different at the noncooperative equilibriLzn.



        If each firm had attempted to be a Stackelberg leader In R & D space the

 outcome would not be informationally consistent and could not be a reasonable

 candidate for an equilibrium structure (hence the term Stackelberg dis-

 equilibrium). However, if we think of goverrEnents setting credible subsidy

 levels, then firms   setting   R 8 D levels given subsidy levels, and finally

 setting output given R & D levels, the new equilibriui is essentially an

 informationally consistent3 stage perfect equilibrium. This should make

 clear the role of the government in being able to credibly set subsidies.



       It should be emphasized that this structure is suboptimal for the

two countries   taken together. If we define B(s1, s2)       B1 + B2 and max-.

imize B by setting B/s' 0, SB/as'             0 it follows C see Appendix A)

that


                                                                       (26)

The jointly optimal policy Is to tax R & D so as to just offset the negative

effect of own R & D on the other firm's profit.



       If the two finns are similar, total rent Is lower and both countries

earn less rent at the noncooperative equilibrium than they would If they

had been able to come to an agreement not to subsidize R & 0 (see Appendix A).
                                  - 18   -




Both producing countries are then worse off by their subsidization of

R & 0 rivalry. Consuming countries, of course, gain from the fall in

prices which results from greater production.


        Attention is restricted to symmetric cases. However three

kinds of asymmetry should be mentioned. First, of course, there may be

exogenous asymmetry in demand for the two products or in costs, and it

is possible that in a very assmetric case one country could be better

off in the noncooperative subsidy equilibrium than at the subsidy-free

position. Secondly, a less restricted version of the model would admit

multiple equilibria, including asymmetric equilibria, even if the

exogenous structure were symmetric (along the lines of Flaherty (1980)).

This raises the possibility of one country obtaining an ex poste

advantage by admissible strategic moves. Finally, of course, •one country

might have a timing advantage and be able to gain an advantage by

acting firsts



txport Subsidies

     The second tool of industrial strategy to consider is the export subsidy.

The export subsidy could be announced either before p1' after R & 0 has

occurred and could be used in conjunction with an R & D tax or subsidy, or

by itself. This creates a fairly large taxonomy of possible cases.       The case

we wish to examine In some detail is the case in which the export subsidy is

announced before R & D is in place and is used simultaneously with an R       D

tax or subsidy.
                                          — 19      -




        First, however, it is useful to consider the simplest case: a subsidy
per   unit of exports after R & D has taken place. In general the Nash equil-
ibrium      levels of production are a function of the levels of R &                   D and the
                                                                                                      In
export      subsidy, denoted z : y1           q(x1,.x2 , z) andy2 q2(x1, x2,
this case           and x2 are   fixed and the         export subsidy by reducing          marginal
cost   serves to Increase the domestic firints share of the export market.

This holds since the partial derivatives q and                        are respectively positive

and negative holding x1 and x2 fixed (see Appendix B(i)). The net domestic

benefit now depends on x as follows


        B1(x1. x2;z) — g1(x1, x2;z)            —
                                                   zy1                                      (27)


 where

               R1   (y, 2) - c 1y1 ;x1)       -    v1x + zy

         If R & D expenditures are already sunk, the subsidy cannot affect them,
 and the first order condition for maximization of (27) is

       B1/3z         g — y — zq       —   0                                                 (28)

 From (27) it is easily seen that                  —    i4q +          since      —   0.   Then,

 since 4             and ii1/z — y1    we have z —
                                                           Rq/q.        The export subsidy

 shifts out the reaction function of               the domestic firm In        output space.

 It   does not affect the reaction function               of the foreign firm.         Therefore,

        q(dy2/dy1)
                        so the rent maximizing subsidy

        2     R(dy2/dy1) > 0                                                                (29)

 is positive by (2) and (5). Given any R & D level, this subsidy                            moves the

 domestic     firm   to what would be the Stackelberg position in output pace, much

 as the R &     D subsidy moves the domestic firm               to   the Stackelberg point in

 R & D space.
                                      - 20   -




       Now consider the more difficult case in which R & D and export subsidies

can be imposed before R & D take place. This is more complicated because

the export subsidy affects both the choice of output given R & D and R & D

directly. The profit function of the domestic firm              is
                                                                             (30)
       g1(x1,   x2;s,   z)   R1&1, y2) — c1(y1;x1) +      zy     (l_5)x

where y1      q1(x,     x?;z),y2=   q2(x1, x2;z)   and x1 and x2 themselves depend

on z and s.      The benefit function is



        B (sz)      g (x , x ;s,z          .zy — sx                              (31)

Taking     the derivative of B1 with respect to s and solving fr S yields
(See Appendix B (iii))

                                                                                 (32)
       s    g(dx2/dx1) — zdy1/dx1

Looking at (22), which gives the R & D subsidy            in Isolation, we   see

that   this naturally coincides with (32) if z            0. However If z    >    0,
the optimum subsidy on R & D is reduced by the term zdy1/dx1 where

dy1/dx1, the total derivative of y1              q1 (x1, x2, z) with respect to

is positive since dx2/dx1 < 0 by (12) and (14), This term reflects the effect

uf unit increase in R & D on the cost of the export subsidy to the

government.      Similarly,   the first order condition for the export subsidy

z yields

       z (gx + RqY(dy1/dz)             -
                                           sx/(dy1/dz)                           (33)


       Expressions (32) and (33) must be solved simultaneously. It is

no longer clear that both s and z will be positive. The solution is

derived in aDpendix B.

                                                                                 (34)

ProposItion   4

      The optimum export subsidy, z, Is positive, but the optimal R & D

subsidy is neqative. R & D should be taxed. The tax on R & D is exactly

as required to undo the R & D bias and induce the domestic firm to minimize

costs.


Proof: The sian of a s follows from           (2) and (9). z can be sianed usinq (2).
(8). (9). (12). (13) and (14). That s exactly offsets the f& D bias

Is   clear from   (16)   since the firm now   sets   C + (v-s) 4q or        +v
as required to minimize cost for a given level of output.


      Because the export subsidy and the R & D tax        can   be credibly imposed
before   Investment in    R & B takes place, they can be used to move the
domestic firm to the best position given that the foreign government does

not retaliate. The export subsidy increases domestic exports while the

R & B tax restores production efficiency. The noncooperative International

equilibrium would have both countries imposing export subsidies and R & B

taxes,and overall productIon efficiency would result. As in the case of

an R & B subsidy alone, noncooperativebehavibur reduces the total rent

to be divided relative to the rent at the collusive output level. Never-

theless the additional output from subsidization allows the consuming

nations to gain.

                        !. Concluding          Remarks
     National governments clearly play a major role in certain international

industries, particularly high technology and high investment industries.

Such industries often have only a few firms, or at least, are characterized

by some national cooperation so that there are few competitive units in the

market. These firms themselves normally have a clear understanding that

they are involved in a strategic game in which foreign firms and national

governments are players.

     This is a view of the world that is displayed prominently, perhaps

too prominently, in business and financial magazines. This paper is a

step toward understanding such a world. Our approach is to assume that

governments can   credibly   commit themselves to policies which alter the

set of credible actions open to private players in subsequent strategic

games. In this setting we show that there are national incentives to

subsidize R & 0 if export subsidies are not available.

     The strategic game played by firms leads them to overuse R & D

in the absence of government policy. If the government can use both

export subsidies and R & 0 subsidies (or taxes), a fairly striking

result is obtained: the government has an incentive tax R & D to

restore   domestic production efficiencf, and to use an export subsidy
to enable the domestic firm to capture a larger share of the industry
than it would unaided. Thus a prediction of the model is that a
relaxation of GATT restrictions on export subsidies would cause an

      We   have not examined entry deterrence but It is fairly clear that

the   policies   and structure outlined here makes it possible to deter entry

while leaving current participants with strictly positive profits. Also; syrrne-

trically expanding, the number of firms in each country to more than-I is a con-

ceptually minor (although aigebraical-ly major) extension. Similarly, one could

modify the precise nature of final stage competition. In particular moving

to price-Nash rather than quantity-Nash does not change the nature 0f the

results, provided products are slightly differentiated. (The choice of

quantity versus price Nash for the final stage is, of course, not arbitrary

in any specific case; rather it arises naturally from the type of production

rnress._ Involved. At the level of modelli, however, the quantity version

is slightly more convenient).



      Finally, we should emphasize that the analysis presented here is

not in any sense a recomendation that "industrial strategy" nolicies be used.

In the first place, any policy advocating subsidies should be viewed with

suspicion because the oportunIty cost of government revenue may be much

higher than value of unity asstzned in simple surplus analysis.       Also,

of course, we have been characterizing the incentives for noncooperative

internationalbhaviour. Such behaviourwill naturally be welfare in-

ferior to the jointmaximizing optimum. Indeed the positive prediction for

government behaviour Is that a government will undertake Industrial strategy

If no other government does, but be willing to negotiate limitations

on such policies in the event of retaliation.

Solving (4A) and (5A) simultaneously and cancelling terms we obtain (26)

         and s2 =
                     g,       which implies both         and 2 are negative.
Response of   total   rent to positive subsidies

     We show here that If firms are Identical total rent B           B1 + B2 falls

for any small     increase in the equal positive R & D subsidies. Since the
subsidies (see(25)) are       positive   at the noncooperative equllibritin this

implies that both countries earn less rent at the noncooperative equil-

Ibrium than if neither had subsidized R & D.



     For any small changes in s and
                                                                            (6A)

ds ds2. Substituting (2A) and (3A) into (6A), using dx1/ds1                dx2/ds2

and gathering terms we obtain

                                                                            (7A)
     dB 4(—s2)(1+(dx2/dx1)) +            (g_sl)(l+l/dx2)J(dxl/dsl)dsl
Since g < 0 and froci (13), dxu/dxuI_gj/gjjIc L dB < 0 If s S2                      0.




    The intuition of this result is that, with zero or positive subsidies,

duopoly firms already produce more than the collusive output and use more

than the collusive amount of R & D. Further subsidies just push them further

away from   the   joint profit maximum.

                 Static effects of the Export Subsidy



 (1) Effects of the Export Subsidy on Output

         In order to obtain the solutions for s and z, (34) and (35) respectively,

 we require the partial derivatives q 3q1(x1, x2;z)/z. By total          differentiation
 of the first order conditions, 71
                                         R
                                             —   c   + z   0 and 4   - C2      o

with respect to y1, y2 and z, holding x1 and x2 fixed we obtain


         q '-42/A and q 41/A                                           (1B)


Since 7r2      < 0 by (5), A> 0 by (6) and ,r R1 < 0 by (2), q > 0       and

   <     0.   An increase in the export subsidy increases own output and reduces

the output of the foreign firm. Also from dy2/dy1 —4]'42 we have


               qdy2/dy1                                               (2B)

Further from the expressions (8) and (9) of the text for q and q, and

from   (1B),

               .-q/c and   q -q/c                                     (3B)




(ii) Effects of the Export Subsidy on R & D

       For the purposes of the simultaneous solution for s and z, we also reouire

the relationship,

       x2      (dx/ dx1)(x -   (l/c))                                 (4B)


The effect of the export subsidy on the R & D level of 1irm 2, x, depends

not only on Its effect on the R & D of firm 1, but on changes In the resolution

of the output game,        and q (as In Appendix B (I)). We now prove expression

(4-B).
                                             -27—




        The subsidies, s and z, affect the profit of firm 2 only Indirectly

 through effects on y and             so

        g(x1, x2, s, z) R(y1, y2)4(x1, x2, z) —                                    o

where y1        q1(x1, x2, z) and x1 —       x1(sz).
From    total   differentiation of (5B) with respect to x, x2 and z, we have


        dg g1 dx1 + g2dx2+gdz                 0                                  (6B)


Rearranging we obtain

        2 _g21fg22ix
           2 2l — 22/22              2
                                                                                 (7B)

                                    q2(dR/dz)

    To simplify (7B) we need to axpress g in terms of g. Since

                   +          and from (3B),
dR/dz =    R1q         R2q,
    dR/dz (R1q +

                  -(dR/dx)c                                                      (9B)



Also since from (38), q —        —q/c,       we have q2 -   —. q2fc,

Substituting (9B), q from (3B) and q= q2 into (8B), we obtain

           =
                -(Rq1 + q(dRfdx1.)       .
                                             cq)/c                               (lOB)


           —
                —g,c
Substituting (lOB) Into (7B) and using dx2/dx1 —            —g1/g2
we obtain expression (4B).
 (iii) Solution for the Optimal Combined P & D and Export Subsidies

        We first obtain expression (32) for s. The first order conditions

for   the optlmal choice of s and z are B1/s         0 and 3B1/az   0. From

 differentiation    of (31),
                  (g-s)x + gx +        — x — zdy1/ds         0          (11B)


where dy1/ds qx + qx
Using (19), x2       (dx2/dx1)x we have dy1/ds       (dy1/dx1)x
where      dy1/dx q + q(dx2/dx1). Since              0 and g x1 from   (17), (11B)

becomes


               = —sx + (g(dx2/dx1) — zdy1/dx1)x                         (12B)
      ,Stti à7
which imlies expression (32),

                                                                        (13B)
       s     g(dx2/dx1) — zdy1/dx1



      We obtain expression (33) for z in a similar manner. From differentiation

of   (31),

                 (g-s)x   +
                               gx +   — y1— zdy1/dz      0              (14B)


Recognizing that          0, from partial differentiation of (30), we have
                                  -
g1zRq2+y1.
Substituting    this Into (14B) and recognizing that g 0, we obtain

                _sx +   gx + Rq - zdy1/dz        0                      (1SB)


which rearranged yields (33).
                                       -29-



     We   now   derive   expressions (34) and (35) for s and z. Substituting

(32) or (13B) for s , (4B) for         and (3B) for        into (15B)—and cancelling,

we obtain


     aB/z       z((dy1/dx1)x — dy1/dz) —      (gdx2/dx1
                                                          +               0   (16B)


ow dy1/dz qx +           qx +      and dy1/dx1 q      +
                                                          qdx2/dx1
so the   first tern   of (16B)


     (dy1/dx1)x — dy1/dz         -q(x —(dx2/dx1) x) -                         (17B)

Using (4B) and (3B), (17B) reduces to (dy1/dx1)/4. Substituting this

Into (16B) and rearranging we obtain

     z                                                                        (18B)
          (gdx2/iix1 +     Rq)f(dy1/dx1)
which is expression (35). The expression (34), s =
                                                              -Rq    is then obtained

by substituting (35) into (32) of the text.

Acknowlegement: We have received many useful comments on this paper.

     In particular, James Friedman, Sandy Moroz, Robert Willig, and

    the referees were very helpful. Shortcomings,of course, remain

    our responsibility. The paper has benefitted considerably from

    exposure at conferences on 'Trade Theory Post Heckscher—Ohlin" at

    the University of Western Ontario, on "Monopolistic Competition in

    International TradeH    at the Graduate Institute   of International

    Studies   in   Geneva and at the 1982 NBER Sumer Institute. J. Brander

    wishes to acknoi1ege gratefully financial support from a Social

    Sciences and Humanities Research    Council of Canada post—doctoral
    fellowship.
1. Prescott and Visscher (1977) have     a similar structure except that it

    is the product type or location decision which constitutes a commit-

    ment rather than investment or R & D.

2. Equal opportunity product choice commitment models have been ara1yzed

    by Shaked and Sutton (1982a, 1982b). Attention should also be drawn

    to Flaherty (1980), where distinct capital and output decisions

   are made by firms with equal opportunity in a dynamic setting.

3. The subgame perfect Nash equilibrium has been fairly widely used

   in the literature and is an example of a "closed-loop" solution for

   the players involved. It is an attractive concept because the

   equilibrium is self—enforcing at each stage in that there are no

   incentives to cheat, and secondly because the equilibrium is not

   characterized by systemtic errors about the levels of strategy

   variables to be chosen by rivals: the model confirms expectations

   in equilibrium.

4.    Uniqueness follows from direct application of Gale-Nikaido global

      univalence, provided (6) holds globally. (See Nikaido (1968), ch. 7,

      p. 371). This is also the Rouh-Hurwitz condition for stability of

      the standard adjustment mechanism. That is, (6) is the condition for

      the reaction function diagram to be stable.

      Letting i = 1 and j   = 2,   the term dR/dx2 =         +
                                                       R1q       R2q   is positive from

      (2), (8) and (9) in the normal case in which R2         0; an increase in y2
      reduces R1 but at a diminishing rate. This ensures that the second term

      of       is negative. Since the third term is negative from (3) and (9),

      g2 < 0   if the first term         is not too positive. From differentiation

     of (9), q2 0 if demand is linear and marginal cost c1 is constant with

     respect to output.

6. This result can be regarded as art extension of Dixit (1980).         It is

      reported in Brander and Spencer (1983) along with a number of other

      results concerning the comparison with a corresponding one-stage

      (or non-strategic) model. Output in the industry is higher and

     prices and profits are lower in the two-stage model. Although R & D

     is not used efficiently, for many cases, overall welfare actually

     is higher.

7. This discussion follows some helpful comments by a referee who also

     pointed out that the sluggishness idea appears in Schelling (1960),

     and that reputation effects can give rise to credible threats even

     in finite horizon models as in, for example, Kreps and Wilson (1982).


     The sluggishness point seems particularly relevant to the R & D

     subsidy since the R & D phase is presumably relatively short in real

     time so the subsidy would not have to be maintained for very long. This

     is a second reason, in addition to GAIT restrictions, for taking

     the R & D subsidy as more relevant than the export subsidy.
                                            — 32 —



 8.    This fact permits a fairly straightforward generalization of the

       analysis of R & D subsidies: any second stage game giving rise to

       q' functions with appropriate reasonable properties could be

       incorporated in the analysis.


9. A recent paper by Paul Krugman £1983) has the government engaging in

      similar behaviour. By guaranteeing a "home market" for domestic firms

      those firms believe, as do their rivals, that they are guaranteed some

      kind of learning economy (or other econczny of scale) which gives domestic

      firms an advantage in export markets as well.

10. With an R & D subsidy, the first order conditions for profit maximization

      reduce to c +   v   =
                              Rq   +   s.    Since, without an R & D subsidy, c +   V1 Rq
      (see (16)), the effect of a positive s is to increase the positive value of

      c +     which (for a given output) implies a greater deviation from the

      cost-minimiZirg solution: c +                  = 0.


      This Stackelberg leader-follower equilibrium is the equilibrium that would

      emerge if the Prescott—Visscher (1977) first stage sequential entry with fore-

      sight concept were used. In this case, since the domestic f-jrm could

      undertake its R & D (or install its capital) first, its position would be

      credible. If, on the other hand1 it was the foreign firm who had the

      opportunity to act first then the domestic government would have an in-

      centive to announce R & D subsidies before the R & D chosen by the foreign

      firm was determined.
