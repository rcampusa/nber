             The Demand for Health Inputs and Their Impact on
               the Black Neonatal Mortality Rate -in the U.S.



                                ABSTRACT


      Relatively high birth rates among black adolescents and
unmarried women as well as inadequate access to medical care are
considered primary reasons why the black neonatal mortality rate
is almost double that of whites. Using household production
theory, this paper examines the determinants of input utilization
and estimates the impact of utilization on the survival of black
infants across large counties in the U.S. in 1977. The results
indicate that expanding the availability of family planning
clinics increases the number of teenagers served resulting in a
lower neonatal mortality rate. Accessibility to abortion services
operates in a similar manner. Moreover, the use of neonatal
intensive care, which is strongly related to its availability, is
an important determinant of newborn survivability whereas the
initiation of early prenatal care is not. Overall, the results
suggest that lowering the incidence of low weight and preterm
births among blacks by helping women to avoid an unwanted birth,
may be the moat cost-effective way of improving black infant
health.

      Black infants die in the first month of life at almost double the

 rate of white infants. Despite dramatic declines in the neonatal Mortality

 rate for both races over the past twenty years, the gap between whites and




                                cy' 2!
 blacks remains. In a comprehensive summary of the literature   on infant
health, the Report                                   2! !2
Health (Department of Health and Human Services 1986) related the     poor
birth outcomes of minorities to low socioeconomic status and differential

patterns of childbearing. The Report concluded by recommending that ef-

forts be increased to reduce the number of unintended pregnancies and that

more prenatal and perinatal services be made accessible to high—risk
women.

     The Report's conclusions, like much of the literature on birth out.—

comes, failed to examine in a comprehensive way all the relevant etiologi—

cal pathways. For instance, numerous studies have documented an associa—

tion between teenage childbearing and adverse birth outcomes (Taffel 1980;

McCormick et al. 1984); others have found the use of abortion and   family
planning services to be inversely related to the birth rates of adolescent

and unmarried women (Forrest el al. 1981; Brann 1979; Berkov and Skiar

1973). Still other research has linked the availability of abortion and

family planning services to lower infant death rates (Corman and Grossman

1985). Lacking, however, has been an attempt to trace out the various

hypothesized pathways from availability to use and from utilization to
birth outcomes.

     The purpose of thia paper is to apply a more unified framework to

assess the relative potential of various strategies for reducing the

difference in white and black infant health. In particular, to what extent




                                    1
                                                                      —2---




do variations in the availability of abortion and family planning services

alter their utilization and to what extent do these differences in

utilization result in healthier black infants. Attention is also focused

on how variations in schooling levels, poverty, and programs such as Aid

to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) and Medicaid affect the demand

for prenatal and neonatal care and the impact of these differences on the

early infant death rate among blacks.

    The empirical framwork is based on the economic model of infant

health developed by Rosenzweig and Schultz (1983a, 1983b>. A structural

relationship, or production function, exists between the use of an input,

such as medical care, and the health of the offspring. Utilization of the

input is constrained by its price and availability, the parents' income or

command over resources, their tastes, and their expectation as to the

probable birth outcome. Roaenzweig and Schultz argue that parents with

poor endowed reproductive capability may attempt to offset these un-

favorable prospects by utilizing more health inputs. Thus, the use of

inputs not only affects the outcome, but the anticipated outcome may also

affect utilization. To overcome the potential reverse causality, the

production function and input demand equations are estimated jointly. The

end result is a more unified approach from which to obtain unbiased es-

timates of various policy interventions.

     Rosenzweig and Schultz (1983a, 1983b) were unable to examine black

birth outcomes due to limitations in their data. Moverover, they did not

control for a number of inputs that in light of the Secretary's Re2ort,

may hold the greatest potential for reducing the adverse birth outcomes of

minorities. Conspicuous among them were the use of abortion and family

planning services, and the application of neonatal technology to ill and

premature infants.
                                                                          -3--.




      The empirical analysis is based on a cross—section of U.S counties in

 1977. The black neonatal mortality rate (deaths of black infants within

 the first 27 days of life per thousand live births) is the principal birth

 outcome and the percentage of low-birth       weight births (less than 5.5
 pounds) among blacks is the intermediate birth outcome. This     allows the
 total effect of an input on neonatal mortality to be decomposed into its

 direct and indirect components, the latter being its effect on low birth

 weight.


                II. Analytical Framework and Empirical Model


     Economic models of the family developed by Becker and Lewis (1973)

and Willis (1973) have been used by numerous authors in    theoretical and
empirical studies of the determinants of birth outcomes (Roaerzzweig and

Schultz l982,1983a,1983b; Corman and Grossman 1985) Accordingly, I assume

that the parents' utility function depends on their own consumption, the

number of births, and the health of each child at birth.       Moveover, the
infant health production function depends on the quality and quantity of

medical care, the mother's own time, and the mother's     reproductive ef-
ficiency. The latter factor includes an unobserved genetic component which

is frequently referred to as the infant's health endowment (Roaenzweig and

Schultz 1982). Maximization of the utility function aub3ect to the produc-

tion and resource constraints yields a demand function for infant health.

The interaction between the demand for and production of       infant health

generates the derived demands for medical care and the other inputs.

     An empirical model of infant survival is complicated by the existence

of intermediate birth outcomes. Specifically, there is overwhelming

evidence that birth weight is the most important predictor of neonatal

mortality (Institute of Medicine 1985). Furthermore, a newborn's weight is
                                                                      -4—


closely related to gestational age (Rosenzweig and Schultz 1982). Conse—

quently, to understand how an input such as medical care impacts on sur-

vival, it is important to measure its indirect effects through the inter-

vening birth outcomes and risk factors. To clarify these ideas, the em-

pirical model can be written as follows:



                                               (1)
              d=f1(n,m,a,c,b,z,e)
                                               (2)
              b=f2(m,a,c,s,r,g,ze)

              gf3(m,a,c,s,r,z, e)              (3)

                                               (4)
              rf4(a,e,x,z,e)
              n,m,a,c,sf(p,y,x,z,e) j=5,..9          (5)—(9)


     The probability that an infant's health deteriorates to the point

that he or she does not survive the first month of life is represented by

equation (1). Equations (2) and (3) give the likelihood that a newborn is

of low weight or preterm (less than 37 weeks gestation) respectively. The

basic set of inputs used in the production of infant he,alth are neonatal

intensive care (n), prenatal care (a), abortion (a), organized family

planning use Cc), and smoking (a). The other variables are (z), a measure

of environmental conditions; Cr), a vector of endogenous risk factors such

as age, marital status, parity, and spacing between births;        (x), a

demographic measure that determines the age of a mother at the time of

birth; and (e), the unobserved health endowment.

     Equations (1)—(4) are the production functions and they constitute

the structural equations of the model. Equations (5)-(9) are the input

demand functions for they relate the use of an input to its price and

availability (p), income and resource constraints Cy), and the other

exogenous determinants mentioned previously.

     The empirical focus in this paper is twofold: first, to understand
                                                                          —5--



 the factors which determine the utilization of health inputs among blacks

 (equations (5)-(9)1; and second, to measure the impact of these inputs on

 early infant survival (equation (1)]. }Iowever, to assess the indirect

 effect of an input on neonatal mortality, birth weight (b) in equation (1)

 is replaced by its endogenous determinants.1 In   particular, substituting
 equation (4) into (3), equations (3) and (4) into equation (2), and this

 altered version of equation (2) into equation (1) yields what will be

 referred to in this paper as the quasi—structural production function:


               df10(n, a,c,m,s,x,z,e)           (10)


      The estimation of equation (10) in conjunction with equation (1)

allows a more refined understanding of the mechanisms through which an

input operates. For instance, evidence suggests (see above) that abortion

and family planning have their primary impact of early infant survival by

reducing the rates of adolescent childbearing (equation 4). Reductions in

these high-risk births results in lower rates of   low—weight and preterm
births (equations 2 and 3) which In turn enhance the probability of sur-

vival. Therefore, equation (10) measures the total effect of an input on

neonatal mortality while equation (1) captures the direct effect.


                      III. Empirical Implementation
A. Data and Measurement of Variblea

     Table 1 contains a description of the variables used in the produc-

tion functions as well as the input demand    equations. The five basic
inputs utilized in the production of infant health are the use of neonatal

intensive facilities, prenatal care, the abortion rate, the use of family

planning clinics by teenagers, and adult per capita smoking.2   Except for
smoking, all the inputs should be negatively related to the neonatal

mortality rate in the quasi—structural production function (equation 10).
                                                                       -6—


However, except for neonatal intensive care, the other inputs should have

their primary impact on neonatal mortality through low birth weight.

Nevertheless, they may evidence a sizeable direct effect if other relevant

inputs are missing. For instance, early prenatal care has been linked to

an increases in newborn survivability by prolonging gestation and enhanc—

ing birth weight (Harris 1982; Institute of Medicine 1985) Yet, early

prenatal care may be directly related to the quality and quantity of

perinatal care. If measures of the latter are lacking or insufficient, as

in this study, then prenatal care may have a direct effect on neonatal

mortality.3 Finally, the natural logarithm of population density is in—

cluded in the the structural equations to control for variations in ur—

banization. The pollution and stress associated with overcrowding and poor

housing conditions has been linked to poor birth outcomes (Lave and Seskiri

1973; Bakketeig et al. 1984)

     With respect to the input demand equations, the use of an input

should be positively related to its availability. As Corman and Grossman

(1985) argue, the more available an input the lower the direct and in-

direct coat of obtaining it. This may be especially true of the medical

resources examined in this study. Private health insurance, Medicaid and

government subsidies often reduce or eliminate the fees associated with

their consumption. Utilization of an input should also vary directly with

income, or more broadly, the command over resources. Thus, measures of

Medicaid as well as AFDC benefits per recipient are included as deter—

minants. Finally, women with greater schooling levels may be more aware of

the relationship between early prenatal care and healthy birth outcomes.

Hence, even controlling for income, education may have a positive effect

on the demand for prenatal care.

     Counties are used as the unit of observation instead of states or
                                                                           -7—


 SMSA's because they are more homogenous with respect to socioeconomic

 characteristics and medical resources. However, small counties present two

 potential problems: first, people may travel outside the county for medi-

 cal services and second, sparsely populated counties with few births may

 show large fluctuations in mortality due to random movements. To minimize

 these difficulties, only counties with a 1970 population of 50,000 or more

 in which there were at least 5,000 blacks are included in the sample. This

 yields a sample 357 counties which represents approximately 80 percent of

 the black population in the U.S.4

 B. Estimation

      Following Roaenzweig and Schultz (1983b), it is anticipated that the

 residuals in the structural equations will be correlated with the health

 inputs. This   expectation   is based on the assumption that individuals have

 some information concerning their genetic health endowment which is un-

known to the researcher but which causes the parents to alter their be-

havior with respect to their use of inputs. For example, ultrasound and

amniocentesis are direct methods of obtaining information     concerning the
health of the fetus, Responses to such informatIon range from abortion to

intensified prenatal and perinatal care. Such remedial behavior creates a

correlation between the use of the health inputs and the unobserved endow-

ment term imbedded in the residuals. In short, the use of health inputs

nay not only affect the birth outcome, but the anticipated birth outcome

may also affect utilization. Because of the reverse causality, ordinary

least squares may yield biased and inconsistent estimates.5

     The need for an instumental or two-stage estimation     procedure links
the estimation of the production function to the input demand equations.

In the first stage, family planning, abortion, neonatal intensive care,

prenatal care, and birth weight are regressed on the set of reduced form
                                                                      -8—


determinants (see Table 1).6 The predicted values from the input demand

equations are used to obtain the structural estimates. The underlying

assumption of this two-stage procedure is that the         resource   and

availability measures vary independently of the health endowment.7

     Finally, the infant health production functions are assumed to be

linear. All regressions are weighted by the number of black births between

1976 and 1978. Work by Joyce (1985) with similar data found that a Cobb—

Douglas and logistic functional form generated results with little

qualitative difference.

                                IV. Results

     Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) estimates of the input demand equations

are presented in Table 2. Estimates of the structural as well as quasi—

structural production functions are displayed in Table 3. These results

are obtained by OLS and Two-Stage Least SquareB (TSLS). The coefficients

from the quasi—structural production functions measure the total effect of

an input on neonatal mortality. Estimates of the direct effect of an input

are from the specifications that include the percentage of low—birth

weight births. Subtracting the latter coefficients from the former yields

the indirect effects (through low birth weight) of an input on early

inf ant deaths

     Table 2 reveals that the hypothesized relationship between input use

and input availability is well-supported by the data. Increases in family

planning clinics, abortion providers, neonatal intensive care hospitals,

and community health centers are strongly and positively associated with

increased teenage family planning use, the abortion rate, the number of

inpatient days in an NIC unit and the percentage of women who initiate

prenatal care in the first trimester respectively. In short, the own

shadow price effects are as hypothesized.
                                                                            -9-


       Schooling and poverty play a significant role in the demand for early

  prenatal care. The greater the percentage of     black women with a high
  school education, the greater the percentage of women who intitate care in

  the first trimester. Women of childbearing age with income less than 200

  percent of the poverty level are less likely to begin prenatal care in the

  first three months of their pregnancy.

      Generous AFDC benefits are associated with a lower probability of

 organized teenage family planning use as well as a lower probability of

 abortion. The latter relationship is not
                                             statistically significant. This
 suggests that relatively generous AFDC programs may lower the incentives

 to avoid an unplanned birth.8 At the same time, better funded AFDC

 programs enhance access to early prenatal care and the more costly neona-

 tal intensive care. This latter result
                                           has important, implications for the
 survival of black infants as will be seen when the estimates of the

 production function are examined below.

      The Medicaid measures may be too imprecise and too highly correlated

 to safely interpret. Nevertheless, the null hypothesis that the coeffi-

cients of all five Medicaid variables
                                        are zero is re3ected at the .01
level in all four equations.

     The Wu statistic in Table 3 indicates that the null hypothesis of

zero correlation between the health inputs and the error term is never

accepted at conventional levels. Comparison of the estimates obtained by

OLS as opposed to TSLS supports the
                                      contention of Rosenzweig and Schultz
(1982, 1983a, 1983b) that direct correlation methods may mask the impact

of inputs on infant health. In particular, the TSLS coefficient for

teenage family planning use and neonatal intensive care is at least three

time greater than its OLS counterpart. The same is true qualitatively for

abortion: OLS understates its impact on neonatal mortality. Consequently,
                                                                       -10—


all subsequent discussion of the production function results focuses on

the TSLS estimates.

     Estimates of the quasi—structural production functions are as an-

ticipated (regression 3—2). Each input has the hypothesized sign but only

abortion, family planning use and neontal intensive care are statistically

significant at the one percent level. The smoking measure is neither race—

nor sex-specific. This may account for its lack of significance.

     The moat surprising result is the absence of a relationship between

early prenatal care and neonatal mortality (regression 3—2). Rosenzweig

and Schultz (1983a), for example, report a statisitically significant

effect of prenatal care on infant mortality with individual          births.

However, their specification differed in several important aspects than

the one presented in this paper which may account for     the contrasting

results. For instance, they lacked a measure of neonatal intensive care.

 This omission is probably serious given the evidence linking    the decline

 in the U.S. neonatal mortality to improvements in birth weight—specific

 survival. Advances in the management of unhealthy neonates is     considered

 the moat compelling explanation for the improved survivability (Lee et al.

 1980; NcCormick 1985). The results of this study with respect to neonatal

 intensive care (regressions 3—2 and 3—4) are consistent with    this inter-

 pretation. Second, Rosenzweig and Schultz were       unable to estimate a

 separate production function for blacks. However, since black infants are

 twice as likely as white infants to be low weight or preterm, variations

 in the black neonatal mortality rate should be more     sensitive to the

 utilization of such specialized neonatal care.9

      A comparison of the estimated quasi—structural and structural equa-

 tions (regressions 3—2 and 3—4) distinguishes the direct       from indirect

 effect of an input on neonatal mortality. In particular, the abortion
                                                                           —11—


  coefficient falls by 47 percent when the percentage of low—birth weight

  births is held constant. This indirect effect
                                                    is as expected. By allowing
  women to avoid an unwanted birth, abortion improves the
                                                              distribution of
  births among high—risk groups (Skiar and Berkov 1973; Shelton 1977; Brann

  1979>. This "healthier" cohort lowers the likelihood of a low-birth weight

  birth.

       There is also evidence that abortion
                                                  effects mortality directly
  (regression 3—4). This suggest that the process of fetal selection en-

 couraged by abortion enhances the survivability of
                                                       risk-specific births as
 well as reduces the incidence of low birth weight. The former effect may

 be the result of births being better planned or "more wanted" (see foot-

 note 3). It is noteworthy that the "wantedness"       of blacks births as
 measured by the National Center for Health Statistics (1985) has increased

 more rapidly for blacks than whites since 1973, the year the Supreme Court

 legalized abortion nationally.

      Teenage family planning use is an important determinant of black

 neonatal mortality. However, it operates somewhat inconsistently for its

 impact on mortality increases slightly when the percentage of low-birth

weight births is held constant. Put differently, the
                                                         indirect effect of
family planning use among adolescents is essentially zero. One explanation

is that a high percentage of teenage users may be indicative of a rela-

tively high proportion of sexually active adolescents. Even if family

planning use is effective in preventing
                                                 pregnancies among users, the
fraction of teens who give birth may still be greater in these high—use

counties tha in counties where both adolescent sexual activity and or-

ganized family planning use are less frequent.

     At the same time Chamie at al. (1982)
                                             report that family planning
clinics in counties that serve a relatively high proportion of women at
                                                                     -12-


risk of pregnancy are more likely to provide supportive services such as

prenatal care than clinics in counties that serve a smaller proportion of

such women. Consequently, a relatively large fraction of teenage family

planning users may be indicative of a population that has been integrated

into a networ1 of prenatal and perinatal care. Births to these young women

may still be problematic (that is, premature or light), but with   better

support and care their offspring may be more likely to survive.


                                 V. Discussion

     This study has analyzed the determinants of black neonatal mortality

using an economic model of infant health that emphasizes the determinants

of input utilization as well as the impact of these inputs on survival.

This unified approach outlines the mechanisms by which various interven-

tions operate on neonatal mortality. For example, The              2
  gy' I!! E2ce 2 Black and Minority Heal recommended that the
promotion of pregnancy planning be a primary focus of infant health policy

(DNHS 1986). The estimates obtained from this study indicate that a ten

percent increase in the number of family planning clinics per women aged

15 to 44 would increase adolescent utilization of family planning clinics

by one percent. This in turn would result in five fewer neonatal    deaths

per 100,000 live births.

     A more controversial finding is that the same increase in abortion

availability would have a similar impact (2 deaths saved per 100,000 live

births). Moreover, if more public funds were available to cover the cost

 of abortion for indigent women, the impact would be   greater.9 Few would

 argue that averting unintended pregnancies is a preferable strategy for

 reducing unwanted births. However, only one—third of all sexually active

 teenagers use contraception consistently (Zelnik and Kantner 1980). Fur-

 ther, contraceptive use among black teenagers is inversely related     to
                                                                       —13—


 social class and neighborhood quality (Hogan et al. 1986). In short,
 abortion will remain an important option for many black and minority women

 trying to avoid an unwanted birth.

      The utilization of neonatal intensive care is shown to   be a major
determinant of black neonatal mortality. Such care, however, is extremely

expensive. Budetti (1981) estimates the average cost per patient for such

specialized care to be approximately S8,000 in 1978 dollars. When inflated

by the Medical Component of the Consumer Price Index to reflect 1984

prices, this figure becomes 13,616. Clearly, in a period of fiscal    con-

straint, the cost—effectiveness of neonatal intensive care relative to

strategies designed to prevent low-birth weight births should be an impor-

tant focus of future research.

     Finally, a methodological note, this study supports the proposition

of Roaenzweig and Schultz that the correlation between the health inputa

and the unobserved endowment term tends to mask the effect     of the be-
havioral inputs on infant health. This source of bias may become increas-

ing more important as rapidly advancing techniques of prenatal diagnosis,

such as amniocentesis and ultra sonography, are more routinely employed.

Such procedures enhance the information known to parents and physicians

about the health of the fetus. Decisions to abort, or to intensify prena-

tal and perinatal care, based on this information increase the correlation

between the use of these inputs and the endowment term.

*All variables are calculated for counties unless otherwise specified. The
mean Cx) and standard deviation (a) for each variable is in parentheses.
All are weighted by the three year sum of black births in 1976—1978. Data
on births by weight from 1976 through 1978 are from the National Center
for Health Statistics (NCHS) Natality Tape. Neonatal deaths over the same
period are from the NCHS Mortality Tape. Socioeconomic characteristics are
taken from the Census of Population, and data on neonatal intensive care
are from the American Hospital Association and from Ross Planning Associa-
tion of Ross Labratories (1982). Information relating to family planning
and abortion are from the Alan Guttmacher Institute. Finally, measures
pertaining to the services and programs used in the reduced form input
demand equations are from Area Resource File and Corman
b
   The estimates of teenage family planning use were adjusted by the Alan
Guttmacher Institute to compensate for cross—county utilization. However,
in 26 counties the figures appeared abnormally high (above 50 percent or
greater than 2.5 standard deviations from the mean adjusted for the
outliers). In these cases the state mean was substituted.
c
   Four states, Kansas, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Virginia have data on the
percentage of women who initiated prenatal care in one of the first three
months for 1978 only. Because this variable has trended upwards nation-
ally, data for 1976 and 1977 by county in these particular states were
estimated by deflating the 1978 figures by the national rates of growth
between 1976 and 1978. The three—year average for the counties in these
states incorporated these estimates for 1976 and 1977.
d
   The smoking variable is taken from Lewit (1982) who estimated it from a
micro—level study of the demand for cigarettes (Lewit and Coate 1982).
Lewit applied the coefficients of the fitted demand functions to state
means of the independent variables to arrive at the figures used here. The
advantage of Lewit's variable over the readily—available tax-paid sales
per state is that his measure adjusts for the substantial 'bootlegglng" of
cigarettes at both the individual and group level. Because of this smug-
gling, data from tax—paid sales underestimate consumption in high—tax
states and overestimate it in low-tax states.

      To clarify the notion of a direct and indirect effect consider the
 following model:

                 d =        +         +
                       a0       a1X       a2b
                 b =        +
                       c0       c1X
where d is neonatal mortality, b is birth weight, and X is an input such
as prenatal care. The direct effect of prenatal care on neonatal mortality
is a1. The total effect, a1 +
                              c1a2, is obtained by substituting for b in
the mortality equation; it is the sum of the direct and indirect effects.

  This study focuses on teenage family planning use as opposed to the
utilization of family planning clinics by all women of childbearing age
for several reasons. First, only the former measure is race—specific.
Second, teenagers are disproportionate users of family planning clinics
(Torres and Forrest 1983). Third, adolescent births and births to un-
married teenagers have well—documented, above average risks of prematurity
and neonatal mortality (Taffe]. 1980; Elater 1984). Moreover, Forrest et
al. (1981) report that for every ten adolescents enrolled in family plan-
ning clinics in 1976, three pregnancies were averted the following year.
Consequently, measures of infant health may be more sensitive to organized
teenage family planning use than to variations in use by all women.

  The same argument pertains to abortion. Consider adolescents who become
pregnant. Those with strong educational and employment goals may have a
high propensity to abort. Subsequent pregnancies are likely to be better
planned ('more wanted") and to receive large quantities of unmeasured
inputs that improve survival.

     Three—year averages are also used to attenuate the effect   of random
elements arising in counties with few infant deaths.

   To test whether a significant correlation between the production func-
tion residuals and the health inputs does exist, Wu's T2 statistic (Wu
1973) as described by Nakamura and Nakamura (1981) is applied. Where the
null hypothesis of zero correlation between the error term and the regres-
sors is rejected, two—stage least squares (TSLS) is used to estimate the
birth outcome production functions.
   Cigarette smoking is 8180 endogenous but is excluded from the first
stage becuaae the measure used is already a predicted value generated from
a micro reduced form demand function for cigarettes. Technically, this
procedure amounts to assuming that the quantity of cigarettes consumed
depends only on the predictors employed by Lewit (income, price, educa-
tion, age, sex and race) and not on the availability measures of the other
inputs.

   Of the four structural equations presented in the text, only equations
(1) and (4) satisfy the rank and order conditions for indentification.
Equation (4) is not estimated in this study. With respect to equation (1),
the percentage of preterm births, the percentage of births to high—risk
women and smoking per capita are excluded. All three risk factors are
primary correlates of low birth weight and would be expected to have
little impact on neonatal mortality in a specification that controled for
the p centage of low-birth weight births (Institute of Medicine 198G).
8
   Leibowitz et al. (1986), using individual data and a model that treated
abortion as one of three alternatives for pregnant teenagers, found that
AFDC was positively related to the decision to remain unmarried and carry
the pregnancy to term. The determinants of teenage sexual activity and
contraceptive use are more complicated and the link between relatively
generous AFDC benefits and unmarried childbearing is less convincing
(Jones et al. 1985).
9
    Corman and Grossman (1985), for instance, found that the availability of
neonatal intensive care was twice as effective at reducing the early
infant death rate among blacks as opposed to whites.
10
   The Hyde Ammendment, which restricted the use of federal funds for
legal abortions is estimated to have prevented between 18,000 and 30,000
Medicaid—eligible women from obtaining an abortion (Henahaw et al. 1981).
In fact, the nonwhite abortion rate fell on average 2.4 percent per year
between 1977 and 1979 (Henshaw 1983). Based on the coefficients in the
production function this would result in 20 extra black neonatal deaths
per 100,000 black births.
