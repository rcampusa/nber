1. Introduction


         The recent behavior of the stock market has been highly unusual in many ways. The

stock prices of technology firms have fluctuated wildly at times when more traditional industrial

firms have been relatively stable. The after-market performance of many initial public offerings

(IPOs) has also been dramatic, with large positive returns followed later by equally large

declines. The goal of this paper is to investigate the characteristics of this recent market

behavior as a first step in understanding what has occurred.

         The focus in this paper will be to identify the sectors of the market that have behaved

unusually. In some ways, this motivation is similar to the recent paper by Campbell, Lettau,

Malkiel, and Xu (2001), who find that firm-specific (idiosyncratic) volatility rose steadily from

1962-97, even though market and industry volatility did not. My focus, however, will be on the

data since 1997, where the most unusual behavior has occurred.

         Figure 1a shows the rolling 21-day standard deviation of returns to the Standard & Poor’s

(S&P) composite portfolio and to the Nasdaq composite portfolio from January 1973 through

July 25, 2001, both adjusted to an annual rate by multiplying by the square root of the number of

trading days in the year, 253,

         σ(Rt) = [253      Σ    (Rt-k – µ)2 / 20 ] ½                                                                 (1)
                          k=1

where µ is the sample mean over the same 21-day window.1 Figure 1b shows the ratio of the

standard deviation of the Nasdaq portfolio to the standard deviation of the S&P portfolio. These

graphs clearly show that the Nasdaq portfolio has become unusually volatile compared with the

  French and Roll (1986) show that weekend volatility for portfolio returns is approximately the same as any other
trading day, and since daily returns are not highly autocorrelated, an estimate of the variance of annual returns is just
the number of trading days in the year times the variance of a daily return.


                                                           1
                                    Schwert, Nasdaq Volatility

S&P portfolio since mid-1999. There was also an episode during the last half of 1995 when the

Nasdaq portfolio was unusually volatile relative to the S&P portfolio, but the relative level of

these volatility indexes remained stable from 1996 through mid-1999.

       The volatility of the S&P portfolios rose in mid-1998 at the time of the Japanese and

Russian financial crises, but it returned to more normal levels by early 1999. There have been

brief increases in S&P volatility in early and late 2000, but nothing compared with the rise in

Nasdaq volatility. Given that some of the large technology firms that influence Nasdaq volatility

are also included in the S&P portfolio (including Cisco, Microsoft, Intel, and Oracle which

comprised over 17% of the index in November 2000), it is surprising that S&P volatility has not

increased more.

       What kinds of factors could lead to uncertainty in one sector of the market? Some might

point to a bubble in the stock prices of technology-related growth stocks that burst. It is not

unusual to find large increases in volatility following big drops in prices. French, Schwert, and

Stambaugh (1987), Schwert (1989a), and Pagan and Schwert (1990) were among the early

papers showing that this effect is broad and pervasive at the market level.

       The association between price drops and volatility is not necessarily evidence that an

irrational bubble has burst. There has been much recent discussion of an economic slowdown.

To the extent that the boom in the economy in recent years is concentrated in the technology

sector, it would not be surprising if negative news about future growth could have much stronger

effects on technology stocks.

       In addition to Nasdaq and technology, I also investigate the association between firm size

(equity capitalization) and recent volatility. As a generalization, smaller firms tend to be less




                                                 2
                                       Schwert, Nasdaq Volatility

diversified and younger, so they tend to be riskier than larger firms in the same industry.

However, the recent evidence seems to contradict this generalization.

        Section 2 analyzes Nasdaq volatility using several alternative methods, including

volatility measures implied by the prices of put and call options on the Nasdaq and S&P

portfolios.   Section 3 analyzes New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and American Stock

Exchange (Amex) volatility using measures that are similar to the Nasdaq measures in Section 2.

Section 4 evaluates some of the plausible explanations for recent volatility. Section 5 concludes

and speculates about the implications of this evidence for economic policy.


2. Nasdaq Volatility


Measuring Historical Volatility


        The simple rolling standard deviation in figure 1a closely approximates the forecast of

volatility from the kinds of complicated econometric models that are often used to model

conditional volatility. To show this, figure 2a plots the rolling standard deviation and the

estimates of the conditional standard deviation from a GARCH (1,1) model estimated using

Nasdaq composite return data from January 1986 through July 25, 2001.2 With the exception of

the October 1987 stock market crash, where the GARCH measure of volatility is much larger

than the rolling standard deviation, the two measures track each other closely. This occurs

because the GARCH forecast equation is essentially an exponentially weighted average of past

squared returns, with slowly declining weights, and this is similar to the rolling variance, which

is a simple average of the last 21 squared returns (abstracting from the negligible effects of

subtracting the daily mean return).

2
 Bollerslev (1986) developed the GARCH model. Pagan and Schwert (1990) show that this model performs well in
comparison with many alternative methods for modeling conditional volatility of stock returns.


                                                     3
                                    Schwert, Nasdaq Volatility

       Figure 2b shows the same comparison of the GARCH standard deviation and the rolling

standard deviation for the S&P composite portfolio. In this case the two estimates are close

throughout the entire period, including the 1987 crash.

       Table 1 shows the estimates of the GARCH(1,1) models for the Nasdaq and S&P

composite portfolio returns from January 1986- July 25, 2001.           These models show that

conditional volatility is persistent over time, as the GARCH parameter φ is between .75 and .91.

Table 1 also shows estimates where the level of the conditional variance is allowed to differ after

1998. The estimates of the variance shift parameter, a1, are positive and for the Nasdaq portfolio

reliably greater than zero, with a robust t-statistic of 3.45. Thus, the estimates of the formal

GARCH model for conditional volatility confirm the visual impression from figures 1 and 2:

Nasdaq volatility rose significantly after 1998.

       In the remainder of the paper I will focus on graphical analysis of rolling standard

deviation estimates.


Implied volatility


       One of the major determinants of the value of put and call options is the volatility that

option traders expect for the returns to the underlying stock during the life of the option. Since

the other factors that determine option value in the Black-Scholes (1973) model are known and

measurable, it has become common practice to invert observed option prices to determine an

estimate of the volatility of the underlying stock (“implied volatility”). In fact, the Chicago

Board Options Exchange (CBOE) reports implied volatility for the S&P 100 portfolio (OEX)

beginning in 1986 and distributes it using the ticker symbol VIX. It is calculated by taking a

weighted average of the implied volatilities of eight OEX calls and puts. The chosen options

have an average time to maturity of 30 days. Fleming, Ostdiek, and Whaley (1995) describe and


                                                   4
                                         Schwert, Nasdaq Volatility

analyze this volatility measure. Recently, the CBOE has begun to compute and report a similar

measure for the technology dominated Nasdaq 100 portfolio (ticker symbol VXN).

        Figure 3a shows the implied volatility indexes for the Standard & Poor’s 100 portfolio

(VIX) and for the Nasdaq 100 portfolio (VXN), from 1995 through July 25, 2001.3 Figure 3b

shows the ratio of VXN to VIX. These graphs confirm the earlier analysis of historical volatility

in figure 1. The Nasdaq 100 index has become unusually volatile compared with the S&P 100

portfolio since mid-1999. There was also an episode during the last half of 1995 when the VXN

was unusually high relative to the VIX, but the relative level of these volatility indexes remained

stable from 1996 through mid-1999.


Actual versus Implied Volatility


        It is important to remember that actual and implied volatility measure different things.

Actual volatility reflects what has happened in the last month, whereas implied volatility reflects

what option traders expect will happen over the next month. Therefore, figure 4 plots the ratio of

the actual volatility over the next 21 trading days (about one month) to the implied volatility for

both the S&P and the Nasdaq portfolios. In a sense, this is a plot of actual outcomes divided by

forecasts. The ratios vary around 100% indicating that the forecasts are roughly unbiased. The

peaks and troughs in figure 4 reflect actual volatility that was much higher or lower than the

market forecast, and it is apparent that these forecast errors are strongly correlated across the

Nasdaq and S&P portfolios, since the two lines move together.




3
  These data are available at http://www.cboe.com/tools/historical/vix.htm. I have adjusted the officially reported
data based on personal communication with Robert Whaley, multiplying the annualized standard deviations by the
square root of ratio of the number of trading days divided by the number of calendar days in a year, (253/365)½, so
that the implied volatility measures are on a similar scale as the historical volatility estimates.


                                                        5
                                           Schwert, Nasdaq Volatility

          It would be interesting to study the properties of the VIX and VXN as forecasts of market

volatility in more depth, but that is beyond the scope of this paper.4 For the purposes of the

subsequent analysis, I interpret the results in figure 4 as supporting the measures of implied

volatility from the CBOE as indicative that Nasdaq stocks have become much more volatile than

the broader S&P portfolio.


CRSP Nasdaq Portfolios


          To determine why Nasdaq stock volatility has increased recently it is useful to examine

the behavior of some different sets of Nasdaq stocks. Figure 5a shows the historical volatility of

the value-weighted (VW) and equal-weighted (EW) portfolios of Nasdaq stocks from the Center

for Research in Security Prices at the University of Chicago (CRSP) from 1995-2000.

Throughout this period, the volatility of the value-weighted portfolio is higher than for the equal-

weighted portfolio, but this difference is much more noticeable since mid-1998.

          Figure 5b shows the historical volatility of the CRSP equal-weighted portfolios of

Nasdaq stocks sorted by equity capitalization from 1995-2000. Decile 10 represents the largest

firms and decile 1 represents the smallest firms. As implied by the higher volatility of the value-

weighted portfolio in figure 5a, the large-firm portfolio is much more volatile than the small-firm

portfolio. As noted in the introduction, many of the largest Nasdaq stocks are also large

compared with NYSE stocks. For example, four large Nasdaq tocks, Cisco, Microsoft, Intel, and

Oracle, comprised over 17% of the value-weighted S&P composite index in November 2000.

          Taken together, the results in figures 5a and 5b show that the unusually high volatility of

Nasdaq stocks since mid-1998 is concentrated among the largest Nasdaq stocks.                              This is

somewhat surprising, since historically the small-firm portfolio of NYSE stocks from CRSP has

    Indeed, from correspondence with Robert Whaley, I understand that he is currently working on this topic.

                                    Schwert, Nasdaq Volatility

been more volatile than the large-firm portfolio of NYSE stocks. Section 3 will see whether the

most recent period has reversed this result.


3. NYSE and Amex Volatility


       Figure 6a shows the historical volatility of the CRSP value-weighted (VW) and equal-

weighted (EW) portfolios of NYSE stocks from 1995-2000. Figures 6 (NYSE) and 7 (Amex)

are drawn to the same scale as figures 5a and 5b to ease comparison with the results for the

Nasdaq portfolios. Since 1996, the volatility of the value-weighted portfolio is higher than for

the equal-weighted portfolio, but this difference is much smaller than was true on Nasdaq in

figure 5a.

       Figure 6b shows the historical volatility of the CRSP equal-weighted portfolios of NYSE

stocks sorted by equity capitalization from 1995-2000. Decile 10 represents the largest firms and

decile 1 represents the smallest firms. As implied by the higher volatility of the value-weighted

portfolio in figure 6a, the large-firm portfolio is more volatile than the small-firm portfolio.

Again, however, the differences and absolute levels of large firm volatility are much smaller than

for the Nasdaq portfolios in figure 5b.

       Figure 7a shows the historical volatility of the CRSP value-weighted (VW) and equal-

weighted (EW) portfolios of Amex stocks from 1995-2000. Interestingly, there is not much

difference between the volatilities of these portfolios and there has not been a pronounced

increase in volatility for either of these Amex portfolios since 1998.

       Figure 7b shows the historical volatility of the CRSP equal-weighted portfolios of Amex

stocks sorted by equity capitalization from 1995-2000. Decile 10 represents the largest firms and

decile 1 represents the smallest firms. Unlike Nasdaq and the NYSE, the volatility of the small




                                                 7
                                      Schwert, Nasdaq Volatility

firm decile portfolio is larger than for the large firm portfolio throughout most of the 1995-2000

period, although the differences between the Amex portfolio volatilities are not large.

        These figures show that the unusual volatility of large Nasdaq firms since mid-1998 is

not a phenomenon of firm size, since it does not show up for Amex stocks and it is considerably

muted for NYSE stocks. It is likely that it is the types of Nasdaq firms that have large equity

capitalization that explains this result.


4. Plausible Explanations


Technology Portfolios


        Many of the large firms on Nasdaq, including Amgen, Cisco, Dell, Intel, Microsoft,

Oracle, and Sun are identified as technology firms. To see whether the factor explaining unusual

behavior is related to Nasdaq or to technology, I analyze the volatility of returns to several

technology portfolios available from Datastream. Standard & Poor’s has a Technology Sector

index (SPHTEC) that is part of its 500 stock composite index. Nasdaq reports three technology

indexes, a Computer index (NASCMPT), a Biotechnology index (NASBIOT), and a

Telecommunications index (NASTELC).

        Figure 8 shows the historical volatility of the returns to the four technology portfolios

from January 1991 – July 25, 2001. As with the earlier graphs, it is apparent that the volatility of

these portfolios has increased dramatically since mid-1998.                It is interesting that the

biotechnology portfolio behaves in much the same way as the computer and telecommunications

portfolios, since it is hard to think of similarities in the demand for the products of these firms.

Moreover, it is clear that it is not just “Internet fever” that has raised the volatility of these firms.




                                                   8
                                                 Schwert, Nasdaq Volatility

Indeed, there is a period in mid-2000 when the volatility of the biotechnology portfolio is

noticeably higher than for the computer and telecommunications portfolios.


Recent IPOs


            Another aspect of financial markets that has attracted a lot of attention in recent years is

the very active IPO market. Figure 9 shows the number of IPOs per month in the US since 1960

and the average initial returns to IPO investors from buying at the IPO price and selling within

the next month in the secondary market. These data are available on Jay Ritter’s web page5 and

they are described in Ibbotson, Sindelar and Ritter (1988, 1994). Lowry and Schwert (2001)

study and try to explain the dynamics of the apparent IPO cycles.                         They find that

contemporaneous correlated news shocks affect similar IPOs during the multi-month periods

when they are being marketed to investors. Benveniste and Spindt (1989) argue that issuing firms

and investment banks must share the value of new information learned from informed

institutional investors during the pre-IPO marketing process, or else investors will not have

incentives to reveal this information.                 The effects of these shocks, along with the partial

adjustment of the IPO price to favorable information that is implied by Benveniste and Spindt,

causes average initial IPO returns to be correlated over time.

            While the number of IPOs since 1998 has not been unusually high compared with the rest

of the 1990s, the average initial return to IPO investors has been very high since mid-1998,

averaging about 51% since July 1998 compared with 18% for the entire January 1960-May 2001

period. Thus, issuing firms and their investment banks systematically under-valued the stock of

IPO firms when setting IPO prices, especially in the last few years.

                                                             9
                                   Schwert, Nasdaq Volatility

       Ritter (1991) and Loughran and Ritter (1995) argue that the initial returns to IPO

investors represent excess enthusiasm by the after-market, rather than under-pricing by

investment bankers. They show that returns realized by purchasing recent IPOs in the secondary

market are lower than for investments in other more-seasoned stocks. On the other hand, Brav

and Gompers (1997) show that the after-market performance of IPO stocks is similar to more

seasoned stocks that are matched on firm size and market/book ratios.

       Since initial IPO returns have been so high in recent years, and since many of these firms

were technology stocks listed on Nasdaq, it is possible that part of the recent rise in Nasdaq

volatility is related to (or even caused by) the after-market pricing of IPO stocks. To examine

this question, I created three equal-weighted portfolios of stocks that had recently had IPOs using

information from the Securities Data Corporation (SDC) database. The “All IPOs” portfolio

contains all stocks that had an IPO at least one month before, but no more than one year before,

the trading day in question. The exclusion of the first month of after-market trading avoids the

problem of after-market price support (which happens in some but not all IPOs) that can distort

the volatility of returns. The “Technology IPOs” portfolio includes stocks that are categorized as

technology stocks by SDC, and the “Non-technology IPOs” portfolio contains the remainder of

the IPO stocks.

       Figure 10a shows the historical volatility of the three portfolios of IPO stocks from

January 1984 – December 2000. It is surprising to me that the volatility of recent IPO stocks is

so low from 1984-mid-1987 and from 1992-1996. For most of the 1984-2001 period, the

volatility of the technology portfolio was higher than for the non-technology portfolio, but for

most of this period the volatility measures move together closely.

       Figure 10b shows the historical volatility of the three portfolios of IPO stocks from

January 1995 – December 2000. It is easier to see from this graph that the volatility of both

technology and non-technology IPO stocks rose in mid-1998, but that the volatility of technology

stocks remained high in 1999, while non-technology IPO stock volatility returned to lower

levels. By mid-2000, the two series again have similar levels. At the end of 2000, the volatility

of the non-technology IPO portfolio jumps dramatically.

       To put these data into perspective, figure 11 shows the ratio of the volatility of the

technology IPO portfolio to the volatility of the value-weighted CRSP Nasdaq portfolio from

1984-2000. It is startling (to me) that this ratio is so close to 100% since 1993 (the average is

110%). Thus, it looks as though the volatility of the prices of recent IPOs is remarkably similar

to much larger more seasoned Nasdaq securities.


Big Price Changes


       The analysis thus far has focused on the standard deviation of returns (volatility), but the

characteristic of recent Nasdaq behavior that has attracted the most public attention has been the

days when large negative returns have occurred (somehow people don’t seem to write or talk as

much about comparably large positive returns).

       Table 2a shows the largest percentage changes in the Nasdaq Composite portfolio between

January 1995 and July 2001 in column (1). The corresponding returns to the S&P 500, S&P Technology,

Nasdaq Computer, and Nasdaq Biotechnology portfolios are in columns (2) through (5). Columns (6) and

(8) contain the implied volatilities for the S&P 100 (VIX) and Nasdaq 100 (VXN) portfolios from option

prices on the CBOE. Columns (7) and (9) contain the changes in the implied volatilities from the prior

day, ∆VIX and ∆VXN. Table 2b contains the same information for the days of the 25 largest percentage

increases in the Nasdaq Composite portfolio from 1995-2001.



                                                 11
                                       Schwert, Nasdaq Volatility

        Several patterns are clear from these tables. First, the distribution of positive and negative returns

is similar; there has been no tendency to have larger negative returns in this period. Second, there is a

clustering of large returns of indeterminate sign from mid-October 2000 through April 2001 (13 negative

returns and 13 positive returns). Similarly, from early April to early June 2000, there were 6 negative and

6 positive returns on these lists. Thus, about three quarters of the most extreme daily returns during this

six-year period occurred in two spans of about eight months in total. These patterns are exactly what one

would expect if the volatility of the distribution generating stocks returns was changing and persistent

over time.

        What were the triggering events for these bursts of volatility? It is always dangerous to use 20-20

hindsight to diagnose the movements of stock prices, since there are potentially many explanations for the

factors that cause daily fluctuations. Moreover, simple explanations are often too simple (see, for

example, Cutler, Poterba, and Summers (1989)). Nevertheless, I searched Dow Jones News Retrieval

(DJNR) for Wall Street Journal stories about Nasdaq prices on the days listed in tables 2a and 2b to see

what reporters were saying about the causes of price movements on Nasdaq. The big story about April 3,

2000, the first day of the Spring episode, was the break-down in the negotiations between Microsoft and

the Antitrust Division of the Justice Department trying to settle their lawsuit. Bittlingmayer and Hazlett

(2000) argue that the Microsoft antitrust lawsuit had substantial common implications for many other

firms in the computer industry, so it may not be surprising that broad groups of technology stocks would

move together in response to this news.

        The Fall 2000 episode centers on the presidential election that dragged on into early December

before the uncertainty about its outcome was resolved. However, in both April and October there were

many stories about earnings announcements, speculation about changes in Federal Reserve policy, and a

variety of stories about macroeconomic indicators that foreshadowed slower growth in future months.

Interestingly, stories about lower earnings and slower growth were used by reporters and analysts to

explain both large negative and large positive movements in market prices.




                                                     12

        Another pattern that emerges strongly from table 2a and 2b is that volatility and prices moved in

opposite directions. When prices fell in table 2a, the implied volatility of the Nasdaq 100 portfolio rose

dramatically (∆VXN in column (9)). It is also apparent that for most of the days in table 2a, the

performance of the Nasdaq portfolio was driven by technology stocks, since the S&P 500 return in

column (2) was generally much smaller than the returns to the technology portfolios in columns (3)

through (5). The implied volatility of the S&P 100 portfolio also rose on most of these days (∆VIX in

column (7)), but the size of the rise was smaller than for ∆VXN.

        The results in table 2b for increases in the prices of Nasdaq stocks parallel the results in

table 2a. The biggest returns are driven by technology stocks and volatility decreases when

prices rise.

        As mentioned previously, the opposite contemporaneous movement in volatility and

returns is often seen in stock returns and it has been studied extensively. The fact that there are

similarly large positive and negative daily returns in tables 2a and 2b suggest that high volatility

is the dominant characteristic of this period, not just a few big drops in prices. In many ways,

this is more like the behavior of market indexes during the Great Depression, when there were

prolonged periods of high volatility, than the brief episodes of volatility that surrounded the

October 1987 crash (see Schwert (1990a, 1990b) for comparison).


World Stock Market Conditions


        As a final check on the conclusion that the recent episodes of Nasdaq volatility have been

concentrated in the technology sector, figure 12a shows the historical volatility of the Morgan-

Stanley Capital International (MSCI) World portfolio from January 1980 through July 25, 2001.

Figure 12b shows volatility of the MSCI World portfolio from January 1995 through July 25,

2001 on the same scale.



                                                   13
                                         Schwert, Nasdaq Volatility

        Several things are apparent from figures 12a and 12b. First, the recent volatility of the

world portfolio is small by comparison with the 1987 market crash, where the volatility estimate

peaked at over 60%. Second, the volatility associated with the mid-1998 Japanese and Russian

crises, which was followed by the collapse of Long-term Capital Management, was substantially

higher than what occurred in most of 1999 and 2000. This is a stark difference from the

behavior of the Nasdaq technology stocks shown above, so the explanation for the behavior of

the Nasdaq stocks cannot be related to general market conditions.


5. Conclusions


        Are there any policy implications from the recent episodes of volatility in the technology

sector of the market?


An Impeding Recession?


        At the aggregate level, there is much evidence that stock volatility is a leading indicator

for economic activity, with heightened volatility often associated with recessions (see Schwert

(1989a, 1989b) and Campbell, Lettau, Malkiel, and Xu (2001) for examples). It is an interesting

question whether the extent that the recent growth in Nasdaq volatility foreshadows a dramatic slowdown

in the technology sector of the economy. To the best of my knowledge, no one has studied the relation

between industrial stock return volatility and real activity in that industry. If there is such a link, the very

high recent levels of volatility in the technology sector of the stock market could foreshadow a massive

recession in this area of the economy.

Too Much Leverage?


           In terms of financial regulation, many proposals have arisen in the past in response to

perceptions that volatility was “too large.” For example, Hardouvelis (1990) suggests increasing

margin requirements as a way to discourage investors from trading in stocks. Schwert (1989a,

1989c) and Hsieh and Miller (1990) argue that Hardouvelis finds statistical associations between

margin requirements and aggregate volatility because the Fed had increased margin requirements

in the past when stock prices fell and that volatility also rose when prices fell, so there is no

causal link between the regulatory changes and observed volatility.6 It is interesting that despite

arguments such as those made by Hardouvelis (who was working at the New York Fed at the

time), the Federal Reserve Board has not changed the level of margin requirements since 1974,

which strongly suggests that the Fed is skeptical about the efficacy of margin requirements as a

policy tool.


Too Much Trading?


           Another related theme that has often arisen is that the costs of trading have become too

low so that investors can trade in and out of stocks quickly and frequently without bearing

substantial transaction costs. Of course, for this to be a problem, it must be that there are lots of

“noise traders” taking advantage of this opportunity and their trading influences prices in an

important way.

           One variant on this theme is that the availability of derivative securities, such as options

or futures contracts on individual stocks, or on portfolios of stocks, such as the Nasdaq 100,

allow investors to place large risky bets on the movements of a small subset of stocks. The

existing evidence, however, shows that volatility of the returns to the underlying security

typically declines after the introduction of derivatives trading (e.g., Skinner (1989)).7

           There has also been much recent discussion about “day trading” by relatively small

individual investors and the potential effect of this trading on the volatility of market prices.

During the Clinton administration, there were significant advocates for taxes on securities

transactions (STTs) to “throw sand in the gears” of financial markets, including Joseph Stiglitz

(1989) and Lawrence Summers (with Victoria Summers, 1989), who were the chair of the

Council of Economic Advisors and the Secretary of the Treasury, respectively (although not at

the time they were advocating securities transactions taxes). There are many reasons to think

that STTs are a bad idea and, fortunately, they have never been enacted in the United States.

Where they have been enacted, trading typically just moves to another venue with lower

transaction costs (see Schwert and Seguin (1993) for a more extensive review of the arguments

for and against STTs).

           It is well known that trading volume and volatility occur together, and the trading volume

of large Nasdaq technology stocks has been high during the period when Nasdaq volatility has

been high. It would be naïve, however, to conclude that this association is causal, so that

reducing trading by increasing transactions costs would somehow make volatility go away. To

the extent that volatility is associated with differences in beliefs, it is not surprising that volume

and volatility occur together. See Karpoff (1987) for a survey of the literature linking volume

and volatility.

           In short, it is not clear to me what the implications of recent Nasdaq volatility are for the

macroeconomy. Likewise, it is not clear to me that we need to do anything about it. It is clear to

me that these data deserve more study.
