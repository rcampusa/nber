                                           ABSTRACT

Product-recall data and information on stock-price reactions to recalls are used to estimate the
value of reputation in a model in which product quality is not contractible. A recall is the result of
a product defect that signals low effort. The recall triggers a reduction in the firm's product price
and value which then both rise steadily until its next defect occurs. We estimate that reputation
accounts for 8.3 percent of firm value and that welfare is 26 percent of its first best level. A
policy intervention that attains first best is a recall tax accompanied by a flow subsidy.

          Product-recall data and information on stock-price reactions to recalls are used
      to estimate the value of reputation in a model in which product quality is not
      contractible. A recall is the result of a product defect that signals low e¤ort. The
      recall triggers a reduction in the ...rm'

      steadily until its next defect occurs. We estimate that reputation accounts for 8.3
      percent of ...rm value and that welfare is 26 percent of its ...rst best level. A policy
      intervention that attains ...rst best is a recall tax accompanied by a ow subsidy.



1     Introduction
This paper estimates the value of a reputation using product-recall data from the trans-
portation equipment sector and information about stock price movements in response to
product-recall announcements. Reputation causes the values of ...rms to rise above the
reproduction value of their physical assets. While previous research has documented the
large losses in ...rm value associated with recalls and while there is even more theoretical
research on reputation concerns, the present paper appears to be the ...rst linking the two.
    The model is that of a market for a homogenous, non-durable good with a continuum
of buyers and sellers. Firms experience occasional shocks to product quality or "defects."
Defects are contractible and the law requires that a ...rm must at least fully compensate
its customers for them. Otherwise the quality of a seller's output is not observed before
purchase and is not contractible; payment is up front. Interactions between buyers and
sellers are short-term ­there are no repeat meetings or long-term contacts. Costly e¤ort
reduces the probability that a defect will occur but if it does, the ...rm'
                                                                          s revenue drops
and then recovers gradually until the episode repeats itself. A defect signals that e¤ort

                                          s "reputation"is the history of its public signals,
i.e., of its past defects or recalls.
    Reputation, by our estimate, accounted for about 8.3 percent of ...rms'values in the
transportation-equipment sector over the 1978-2007 period. This estimate derives from
how much a ...rm'   s value falls when it recalls one of its products. Stock prices of publicly
traded ...rms show this mechanism at work. Product recalls are common, but still rare
enough that a recall represents signi...cant news that produces a negative stock-price
impact, often far larger than the direct costs associated with a recall, and this excess we
interpret as reputational loss. A declining hazard of product recalls re     ects the build-up
of reputation and a rising e¤ort on the part of the ...rm to maintain its reputation. The
model ...ts the recall hazard, under a constraint on the stock-price impact of recalls ­
speci...cally the stock-price drop relative to direct recall costs; Jarrell & Peltzman (1985)
estimate that value falls by twelve times the direct costs surrounding the recall. Other
papers that estimate the e¤ect of recalls on ...rm values are Ho¤er, Pruitt and Reilly
(1988), Barber and Darrough (1996) and Rupp (2004).
    The decreasing hazard seems compatible with facts documented by Cabral and Hor-
tacsu (2010) for eBay sellers. Sellers' sales drop signi...cantly after the ...rst negative
feedback, consistent with the prediction that bad news leads to a large drop in the ...rm
value. Moreover, subsequent negative feedback arrives more rapidly after the ...rst nega-
tive feedback-- ...rms decrease their e¤ort level after public bad news.
      We analyze a market in a steady state in which the product price per unit of quality is
constant while prices of physical units rise and fall re ecting their reputations. Free entry
of ...rms means that all the welfare gains go to the consumers. Firm values depart from
the reproduction cost of their capital arises for roughly the same reason as in Hopenhayn
(1992), but the model has multiple steady states. Consumer welfare and average repu-
tation are positively correlated across these states, and welfare is negatively related to
the price of the product. In other words, equilibria that feature higher reward to good
performance yield higher social welfare ­not surprisingly. Welfare is estimated to be 26
percent of its ...rst-best level. Although estimates indicate that the reputational loss is up
to twelve times higher than their direct recall cost, it is not large enough to correct for
the ine¢ ciency. The welfare analysis indicates that recalls should be taxed by an even
larger multiple of their direct cost: The recall tax that is accompanied by a production
subsidy, and it attains ...rst best. Recall costs are a noisy signal of ...rms'hidden e¤ort,
but since ...rms are risk neutral, incentives can be restored by a policy that raises the
sensitivity of compensation to the signal. As a result, a tax of sixty percent of average
...rm values restores ...rst best.

sellers relative to their capital stocks. In other words it is the excess of market value over

book value. The mean is 8.3 percent of book value.
   This estimate is for the 1978-2007 period and for the transportation-equipment sector.
Now, Hall (2001) reports an intangible capital value of 90 percent for that sector in 1998,
but that was a year when market valuations in all sectors were unusually high.
   Relation to the literature.-- Reputation is but one of several intangibles. Bhandari and
McGrattan (2018) report a value of intangibles of 65 percent of GDP ­much larger than
my estimate of the value of reputation. Gourio and Rudanko (2014) model the value of a
customer base, Butters (1977) and Milgrom and Roberts (1986) model advertising, and
Pakes (1985) studies how a ...rm' s stock price reacts to changes in its patents.
    There is a large literature in dynamic games in which a long lived agents with unknown
types interact with short-term customers. Holmstrom (1999) has not only a hidden action
but exogenous types. Board and Meyer-ter-Vehn (2013 henceforth BM13) model an agent
who has a hidden investment in an evolving state and periodically generates a public
signal. Cisternas (2018) models an evolving state with a produce-or-invest technology,
with a privately chosen e¤ort, and a publicly observed output. Tadelis (1999) and Mailath
and Samuelson (2001) also feature models where types di¤er. Watson (1999, 2002) studies
repeated interactions in which the level of trust starts at a low level and gradually rises
as in the equilibria I focus on.
   Related are models of governments that wish to borrow money or to refrain from
con...scatory taxation, but have no ability to commit ­Kydland and Prescott (1977) and
Phelan and Stacchetti (2001). Organizational equilibrium studied by Basseto, Ho and
Rios-Rull (2018) is similar in that value rises as a reward for good behavior except that
government actions are observable and the equilibrium exhibits no on-path punishments.
In Horner (2002) the threat of exit induces ...rms to choose high e¤ort. And bandit models
have sometimes assumed bad news events, "breakdowns"as in Keller and Rady (2015).
   Closest to the model is Rob and Fishman (2005) who also have no types and who also

                                                                                            s
last public bad-news signal. A technical di¤erence is that the model is cast in continuous
time and can be solved by hand. The solutions are simple and easy to estimate. The
imperfect bad-news version of BM13 has types and has some similar implications but does
not produce a monotone recall hazard or a monotone stock market penalty for recalls, as
we shall explain later.
   Azoulay, Bonatti and Krieger (2017, henceforth ABK) show that citations data can be
explained by a model where learning about exogenously given types occurs via periodic
bad-news signals. ABK is the only paper I am aware of where this general type of model
has been estimated, and I discuss it in more detail at the end of the extensions section.
    Section 2 lays out the model and its implications for the value of reputation and for
optimal policy, Section 3 describes the data, the estimation, and the implications of the
estimates for the magnitude of reputation capital and for policy. Section 4 discusses some
extensions of the model and Section 5 concludes. Some mathematical proofs are in the
Appendix.


2       Model
There is a continuum of buyers and sellers of a homogeneous good.

    Buyers.-- A buyer has a utility function U (q; z ) de...ned over consumption of quality
units q of a "reputation good,"and on the number of physical units z of an outside good.
A buyer'  s income each period is m; he takes as given the price p per unit of the reputation
good q , i.e., the price of quality. Both m and p are measured units of the numeraire good
z: The buyer faces the period budget constraint z + pq m. A single customer'        s demand
for quality then is
                            D (p) = arg    max    fU (q; m pq )g :                        (1)
                                           q 2[0;(m z )=p]

There is a continuum of buyers of measure one so that market demand also is D (p) : We
assume that limq!0 @U=@q = +1.

    Sellers.-- Sellers are risk neutral with discount rate r. Each can sell up to one divisible
physical unit per period1 that is bought by many customers. Payment is in advance and
between the continuum of customers and ...rms there are no repeat interactions. The
quality of the output is equal to a seller'   s e¤ort, x. E¤ort is unobserved, and the price
per physical unit sold is px , where x is e¤ort that buyers expect the seller to exert. The
      s cost of e¤ort is x2 =2. All ...rms get the same price per unit of quality supplied,
seller'
    1
    Proposition 4 shows that the results extend to the case where ...rms di¤er in their physical scale as
long as returns to scale are constant.

   Defects.-- A customer can buy from various sellers. Periodically, the seller's output
has a defect. A defective product reduces a customer'
                                                    s utility by an amount c per physical
unit purchased. If defects were not compensated, a buyer i'  s utility would be

where i;j is the number of physical units customer i bought from ...rm j; where j 2
f1; 2; :::; Mi g, the latter being the set of sellers to customer i, and where c is a parameter.

    Compensation for defects.-- A seller must, by law, compensate each customer by the
full amount of the loss; if seller j sells quantities ( i;j )N j
                                                             i=1 to Nj customers and if he has
a recall, his total recall cost is

           PN
because i j i;j = 1; i.e., his physical quantity is unity. This payment restores each of
seller j '
         s customers'utilities to their no-defect level of U (q; z ). There is, in other words,
a full warranty; a seller must honor it if the product turns out to be defective, and the
customer is fully insured2 .

    Public histories.-- Buyers cannot share their consumption experience. The only way
they learn about a seller's performance is through public signals. A seller can try to avoid
a recall by exerting e¤ort x. Conditional on an e¤ort path (x )1    =0 , the waiting time
until the next defect has CDF
                                                    Z t
                    Pr (    t) F (t) = 1 exp            (    x )+ d .                    (4)
                                                                  0


Thus, the defect hazard is max (0; (      x)), where > 0 is a parameter. There are no
inherent di¤erences among sellers, but their public histories will generally di¤er, and may
in uence buyers'expectations.
    Public signals and reputation.-- A defect is the only public signal about the seller'  s
e¤ort. Let t denote time elapsed since the last defect or, if the seller has had no defects
yet, since the date of entry. We will focus on equilibria in which buyers do not distinguish
new entrants from incumbents with recent recalls. Reputation matters if xt depends on

    Strict products liability is now established law throughout the U. S. and the E.U. (Geisfeld 1988,
2012). Until Sec. 4.5 the full-insurance warranty is treated as exogenous.

t. When its next defect occurs, the price of the seller'
                                                       s output will fall and its market
value will drop to k .3

    The Hamilton Jacobi Bellman (HJB) equation.-- Suppose that t is the only variable
determining quality and not, for instance, the number of past recalls. Conditional on
(xt )1
     0 , the Bellman equation for the lifetime value v is


                                            x2                                  dv
                      rvt = max pxt                (        x) (vt   k + c) +        :                 (5)
                              x             2                                   dt
The problem is concave in x and the seller'
                                          s ...rst-order condition is

                                            xt = vt        k + c:                                      (6)

    Free entry of sellers.-- The supply of entrants is in...nitely elastic at the value k . The
initial condition in Eq. (5) reads
                                           v0 = k;                                           (7)

and it embodies two assumptions: A free entry condition at the cost k , and the assumption
that the seller can sell the business to a new entrant for the price of k . If an incumbent'
                                                                                           s
                                                                                      4
value ever dropped below k; it would be taken over by an entrant, and therefore

                                                 vt        k:                                          (8)

A seller cannot escape the cost of recall, however, regardless of whether or not it is taken
over5 .

    The stationary distribution (t).-- Industry supply depends on the long-run distrib-
ution of x. In equilibrium, xt depends on t which, in turn, follows a renewal process with
inter-arrival distribution F . Let (t) be the pdf of sellers for whom the time elapsed
since the last recall is t. The "age since last recall"distribution di¤ers from f (t) because
unlike a recall (which is an event), age is a state which is reached only if no recall has
taken place by then. Thus the pdf is proportional to 1 F (t), and it is the long-run age
   3
      If the ...rm can continue to operate under a new name without having to pay k again, its value cannot
fall below k . Smaller punishments and more complicated history dependence are both possible equilibria.
We shall assume, however, reputation works exclusively via the pair (t; k ). The drop in value at recall is
an on-path punishment, roughly as in Green and Porter (1984).
    4
      The transaction involves the purchase of the capital along, implicitly, with the reputation of a new
entrant. Tadelis (1999) discusses the market for reputation.
    5
      A product recall often results in a takeover of the ...rm in question. Some examples are listed in
online Appendix B. Jovanovic and Rousseau (2002) introduce takeovers into a Hopenhayn (1992) type of
model and treat the value of acquired capital as k net of a "salvage cost."The salvage cost represents the
costs of transferring the capital to new owners, a process that often involves a private equity ...rm. See
online Appendix and particularly Table A1 for examples where a takeover occurred following a product
recall.

Then, the average quality per seller, x; is:
                                                Z    1
                                          x=             xt (t) dt:                                    (10)
                                                 0


    Market clearing.-- Individual sellers'behavior was solved conditional on p, and that
also implies x in Eq. (10). Given the price p, the number of sellers, n; is determined by
the market-clearing condition:
                                        D (p) = xn;                                  (11)

where q = D (p) is the argmax in Eq. (1). When t does a¤ect x, quality varies over
sellers. The parameters are (r; m; c; k; ; U ) : We consider a steady state in which the
aggregates (q; p; n) are ...xed.

   Prices of physical units.-- A ...rm sells its one physical unit at the price pxt . Variation
of vt over ...rms induces a cross-section price distribution, similar to the distributions
depicted in Fig. 1. The total number of physical units sold is n, their average quality is
x and the total quality supplied is xn.

   Market shares.-- Market sales volume is constant at pnx, and therefore t periods after
the ...rm'
         s last recall,
                                              pxt     1
                            market share =        =     xt                           (12)
                                             pnx     nx
and so if xt rises with t, so does the ...rm'
                                            s share of aggregate sales.

    The distribution of customers over ...rms.-- Buyers are homogeneous, and each buyer
buys q units in total, generally not all from the same ...rm. A ...rm is indi¤erent as to how
many customers buy from it because the recall compensation is prorated to the quantity
sold, so that the total recall compensation is always c. Similarly, a customer is indi¤erent
as to how many ...rms it buys from, the total cost of a number of quality units q is always
pq:


2.1     Equilibrium
De...nition.-- Equilibrium consists of the triple (q; p; n) and the pair of real-valued func-
tions (xt ; vt )1
                t=0 such that for all t 0, (i) vt  k satis...es (5), (ii) xt   0 satis...es (6),
   6
     Eq. (9) is a restatement of Eq. (3) in Cox (1962), p. 61. The renewal theory term for this distribution
is the backward recurrence time or the age of the component in use. online Appendix provides examples
of (f; ) pairs.


                                                         7
(iii) buyers'expectations are correct in that xt = xt , (iv ) the market clears so that given
p and the supply per ...rm, x de...ned in Eq. (10), determines the number of ...rms n.
    The ODE for xt .-- We now use parts (ii) and (iii) of the de...nition of equilibrium to
express (5) in terms of xt . From (6), dv=dt = dx=dt, and so

                            dx                                          1 2
                               = r (k     c) + ( r +        p) x          x:            (13)
                            dt                                          2

Since v0 = k ; the initial condition is x0 = c. Let x1 and x2 be the two roots of x at which
the RHS of (13) is zero:
                                    q
                 x1 = r +      p        (r +         p)2 + 2r (k        c) < 0;   and   (14)
                                  q
                 x2 = r +      p + (r +              p)2 + 2r (k        c) > 0:         (15)

To guarantee that the roots are real and that x1 < 0 < x2 , we shall assume that the entry
cost exceeds the recall cost,
                                        k c > 0:                                      (16)

   Recalls.-- Since v    k , for the solution for xt in Eq. (6) to generate recalls, we need
that
                                               c< ;                                     (17)

otherwise the optimum would be at xt = , and a zero recall hazard. Moreover, for
xt < for all t; we require that x2 < , i.e., that

                                r (k     c) <    p      r           :                   (18)
                                                            2

   Then Appendix proves

Proposition 1 If and only if Eqs. (17) and (18) hold, the ODE (13) has the solution

                                                 x2 x1
                        xt = x1 +        x2 c        1                      <           (19)
                                    1+   c x1
                                                expf 2 (x2         x1 )tg

for all t   0, with
                                        x1 < 0 < x2 < :                                 (20)

    Thus xt rises and the recall hazard declines monotonically as a function of time elapsed
since the last recall. The right panel of Fig. 2 shows that x2 < is the maximal value
of xt reached as t ! 1 if no defect occurs, and since x2 < the hazard remains positive
and a recall must eventually occur.
    Typical equilibrium play is illustrated in Fig. 2. Since k > c, we have x1 < 0 < x2 ,

2.2     Equilibria and Welfare
The equilibrium xt in (19) depends on p through its in       uence on x1 and x2 . If > c;
there is a continuum of equilibria indexed by p 2 [pmin ; pmax ]; we shall solve for pmin and
pmax presently. Since sellers get zero rents, all rents go to the buyers. Welfare therefore
declines with p ­the equilibria are Pareto ranked. Even in the most e¢ cient equilibrium,
pmin , welfare is below its maximum level.

2.2.1    The no-reputation equilibrium at pmax

The ...rm must compensate its customers for recall disutilities and this induces a minimal
level of e¤ort at which (x; v ) are constant. It entails xt = c and vt = k for all t. Eqs. (5),
(7), and the fact that dv=dt = 0 imply that pmax solves rk = pmax c c2 =2 (               c) c =
pmax c + c2 =2   c, so that the ...rm'
                                     s discounted pro...ts equal its entry cost plus discounted
expected recall costs. This gives us the no-reputation equilibrium price

                                                  rk          c
                                         pmax =      +          ;                                      (21)
                                                   c          2

which is increasing in : And pmax is decreasing in c because c raises x, and therefore the
...rm's sales, px* , rise by more than the production and recall costs do.
     The no-reputation equilibrium entails the smallest welfare and the highest p. This
equilibrium exists if pmax      0. If the RHS of (21) is negative, there is no positive price
   7
    As x varies on the horizontal x axis, dx=dt in (13) is inverted-U-shaped and it peaks at x = r +     p:
A larger view of Eq. ( 13) is shown in Panel 1 of Fig. 5.



                                                    9
at which the ...rm'
                  s rents can cover its entry cost and the market shuts down if there are
no reputations.

2.2.2     The highest-welfare equilibrium at pmin

Next, Eq. (15) implies that

                            dx2                    r+           p
                                =   1    q                                     < 0:           (22)
                            dp
                                          (r +          p)2 + 2r (k       c)

and since equilibrium requires that x2                  , the lowest admissible p is one at which
x2 = .8 This yields
                                                        k   c
                                    pmin = r 1 +                    + :                       (23)
                                                                     2
    The equilibrium set.-- The size of the set of equilibria that Proposition 1 covers,
[pmin ; pmax ], depends mostly on the di¤erence between and c: Simple algebra shows
that
                                   1 rk c
                     pmax pmin =     +          (    c) & 0 as c % :              (24)
                                   2       c

2.2.3     The ...rst-best, contractible-x equilibrium at p
                                                         ^

The optimum could be decentralized if x was contractible; intervention would then be
unnecessary. The market would then be complete with the risk-averse consumer fully
insured against c by risk-neutral ...rms. The ...rst welfare theorem would apply and equi-
librium coincides with the Pareto optimal outcome.
    The complete market equilibrium would be summarized by the triple (^        n; x  ^) that
                                                                                   ^; p
solves (25), (26), and (27) as follows. Price of quality, p
                                                          ^, then equals its marginal utility:

                            Uq (xn; m    pnx)
                     p=                                 (consumer optimization):              (25)
                            Uz (xn; m    pnx)

The social opportunity cost of an additional seller is k . Equating k to the discounted net
bene...t of the seller'
                      s output yields

                                    x2
                rk = max px               (      x) c               (free entry condition).   (26)
                        x           2

In (26) x is chosen optimally:

                              x=p+c             (...rms optimize over x )                     (27)

      The unique solution for (^
                               n; x                                             p + c)2 =2
                                     ^) :-- Substituting for x into (26), rk = (^
                                  ^; p                                                          c,

      See Appendix for the argument why x2 cannot exceed .


                                                   10
which together with (27) implies that
                             p                                               p
                        p
                        ^=       2 (rk + c)           c       and x
                                                                  ^=          2 (rk + c):     (28)


2.3       Optimal policy intervention
A simple tax-subsidy scheme attains ...rst best. It consists of
       a) A tax T at each recall,
       b) A   ow subsidy S paid to each ...rm per period,
       c) Full compensation by ...rms to consumers for defects.
The tax raises ...rms' e¤ort to its ...rst-best level x
                                                      ^, but at the ...rst-best price p
                                                                                      ^ ...rms
would then be making a loss, because in addition to compensating customers for recall
they would be facing the additional expense T , adding up in expectation to (           x) T:
We have the following characterization:
Proposition 2 The tax-subsidy scheme that attains ...rst best is

                                     T = p
                                         ^;                                                   (29)
                                     S = (                    c    p
                                                                   ^) T > 0:                  (30)

Proof. Since c < , p
                   ^ > 0 ) T > 0. The HJB Eq. now is

                                                              x2
                          rk = S + max pxt                           (           x)(c + T )   (31)
                                         x                    2

and the FOC is
                                                     xt = c + T                               (32)

Eqs. (27) and (29) imply that x = x  ^. Substituting for x and for S into (31), the latter
reads
                                           ^2
                                           x
                                 rk = px
                                       ^        (     x
                                                      ^)c;
                                            2
which is identical to (26) evaluated at x = x ^. Finally, x = p^ + c, and therefore S =
(    x) T: Existence of equilibrium requires that > x; and so S > 0:

3      Estimation
3.1     Data and Identi...cation
Product-recall data.-- We use the auto recall data from the Department of Transportation,
obtaining 48,000 observations covering the period 1978-2007. The data cover only recalled
products. We measure "age at recall"as the di¤erence between the product'        s recall date
and the "start of manufacture" of the product. Let nt be the fraction of all recalled
products that were recalled at age t. The average age at recall is 4.14 years.10 The
resulting data are portrayed in Fig. 3 which shows the frequency distribution nt of the
ages of the products at recall, and the annualized hazard rate h   ^ (t) = nt = 1 Pt 1 n .
                                                                                       =1
Details are in online Appendix A.
    Recall costs.-- Recall costs are included in warranty expenses; they are not a separate
line item. The 10Ks and 10Qs (the o¢ cial ...nancial reports ...led with the SEC) sometimes
include information on large recalls, but recall costs are not mandated disclosure items.
  10
     Automobile manufacturers are required to correct a safety defect at no charge to the owner only
for vehicles that are less than 10 years old ­see https://www-odi.nhtsa.dot.gov/recalls/recallprocess.cfm
Hence some of the observations on defects are less likely to show up in the recall data after 10 years.



                                                                           12
We therefore rely on the estimates of several studies of the stock-price impact of recalls
and other public bad news. The ...rst to estimate this were Jarrell and Peltzman who
report (1985, p. 521) that for publicly traded ...rms value loss is twelve times recall costs.
Armour, Meyer and Polo (2009) estimate ...nancial losses to be nine times as large as
the ...nes imposed for ...nancial misconduct. Ho¤er, Pruitt and Reilly (1988), Barber and
Darrough (1996) and Rupp (2004) estimate abnormal percentage returns associated with
recalls, but the percentages understate the loss relative to revenues from the product in
question because ...rms typically sell more than one product. A summary of the ...ndings
is in online Appendix C, Table A.2. Some recent examples are portrayed graphically in
online Appendix B.
    The model interprets a ...rm'  s reputation as the value of its t ­the time since the last
recall. The model explains the decreasing hazard as follows: Incentives after a recall are
at their minimal level since a second recall (if it happened right away) would not reduce
the ...rm's value any further. As time passes and if recalls do not happen, xt keeps rising
and along with it the ...rm' s market share xt =x: The recall hazard steadily declines. And
since vt rises with t, price declines should rise as a function of time elapsed since the last
recall. Thus

   1. Impact of recalls on market shares.-- Since xt rises with t, the higher is a ...rm'
                                                                                        s rep-
      utation, larger should be its loss of market share when a recall occurs. Supporting
      evidence is in Rhee and Haunschild (2006) who combine the same recall data with
      measures of reputation measured as quality ratings and as       eet depreciation rates.
      They ...nd that when its product is recalled, a ...rm with a high reputation su¤ers
      more market penalties in terms of subsequent sales of their products than would a
      ...rm with a poor reputation.

   2. Impact of recalls on ...rm value.-- Since vt rises with t, the larger should be its
      absolute and its percentage stock price decline. When several recalls occur over a
      period of time, each should have a smaller impact on the ...rm'  s value. Table 1 of
                                                               11
      Barber and Darrough (1998) shows this to be the case. In the above equilibrium
      incentives after a recall are zero since a second recall does not take the ...rm any
      further below v = k . This o¤ers a contrast to the imperfect bad news version of
      BM13 Sec. 5.2 which has e¤ort/investment taking on values of either 0 or 1, that
      are a non-monotonic step function of beliefs (0 for extreme beliefs and 1 for middle
      beliefs about quality) as described in Fig. 4 of their paper. When reputation is
  11
    The variables in columns 1 and 4 of their Table 1 are negatively correlated. Comparing the small
price impact of GM'  s frequent recalls when compared to Toyota' s isolated recall Brauer (2014) writes:
"Toyota' s history of uninterrupted success in the U.S. market had established very high expectations
for the brand. When the unintended acceleration recall hit in 2009 it hit Toyota hard in the image
department..... By comparison, GM doesn'     t have the same infallible reputation Toyota possessed in
2008, meaning a recall (even a massive one) doesn' t impact GM to the same degree."

         high, one bad news shock may matter little, but then the ...rm starts investing a
         lot since another bad news shock would ...nish it o¤ by pushing e¤ort to zero. The
         drop in value due to a second recall (shortly after a ...rst one) is small in my model,
         but large in BM13.

     Equilibrium implies that reputation is related to the slope of the recall hazard; a recall
is judged to be less likely to occur if it has not occurred for a long time.
     Assuming that c is ...nanced by debt or from future pro...ts, we may interpret vt + c k
as the stock-price reduction at the time of the recall, and we now calculate its distribution
in the population of all recalls. From (6), the loss is equal to xt , and so we shall need the
distribution of xt conditional on recall.
     A summary of what we shall do is as follows: We estimate the parameter k and the
equilibrium price p, from recall data in the transportation equipment sector; the interest
rate will be pre-set, and the recall cost c will be restricted so that the expected drop in
...rm value at a recall E [vt + c k ] = E G (x) equals 6c (or 12c), to ...t previous ...ndings
by Jarrell and Peltzman (1985), relating direct recall costs to loss in stock market value.
Furthermore, (k; ; p; c) will be estimated alternatively by maximum likelihood and by
and nonlinear OLS to ...t the distribution of product age at recall.
     Distribution of t conditional on recall occurring at age t.-- Suppose we had a collection
of N products on [0; T ] each with an initial date starting at zero, and if the ...rst k products
had a single recall ti < T while the remaining N k products had no recall. If the re-
                                                                    Q
call dates were identically distributed, the likelihood would be k    i=1 f (ti ) [1   F (T )]N k .
This would be the likelihood if, upon failing, the product never again reappeared in the
sample.12
     Our sample consists only of recalled products, however, and the equilibrium involves
a re-initialization, with the inter-arrival CDF F de...ned in (4). The long-run product-age
density is (t) in Eq. (9), and 0 (t) < 0 re      ects the fact that young products are over-
represented. Being an unconditional age distribution, it acts as the prior on t. Using
Bayes rule, the likelihood of a recalled product having age t is

with B (t) =       0

Proposition 3 With (t) given in Eq. (9), if the two pdfs, b(t) and f (t) satisfy (35)
then the CDFs B (t) and F (t) , is

                                        B (t) = 1      (1   F (t))2 ;                                (36)

which is equivalent to the hazard of b being twice that of f :

    The model thus predicts a hazard that declines from 2 (             c) to 2 (   x2 ). The CDF
of x conditional on recall then is

                                        G ( x)     B (t (x)) ;                               (38)

with density denoted by g (x) :

3.1.1   Identi...cation

We have no data on prices of physical units. The parameter r is pre set at 0.05. We can
identify the remaining four parameters (p; ; k; c) as follows: Eq. (36) gives a one-to-one
relation between B and F . We interpret B as the CDF of a product'   s age at time of recall,
and hence G (x) in Eq. (38) as the distribution of x at time of recall. To constrain the
ML estimates , by the average stock-price drop at recall, we shall use the two alternatives:
                                            Z
                                 G
                             E (x) =            xdG (x) 2 f6c; 12cg :                        (39)

Using (13) and the fact that x (0) = c, simple algebra shows that the level, slope and
curvature of the hazard    x at t = 0 are

           intercept   = 2(          c) ,                                                    (40)

           curvature   =         2 2      = 2 (c + p r    )        > 0:                      (42)
                                   dt t=0                   dt t=0

These are three additional independent restrictions. Informally, one can think of Eqs.
(39) and (40) identifying (c; ), (42) then identifying p, and (41) identifying k .
   Caveats.-- Two maintained assumptions a¤ect the implications: (i) unit-elastic prod-
uct demand and (ii) quadratic cost of e¤ort.
   (i) Unit-elastic D.-- We cannot identify n or the parameters of the demand curve
D ( ) ; the welfare conclusions hinge on the assumption that D (p) is unit elastic. The
smaller is the elasticity of substitution between z and q in U; the smaller is the ...rst
best welfare gain because under ...rst best a lower p yields less additional q and less
additional utility. Even in the the Leontief case, however, the welfare gain is positive
because although the ratio q=z does not change, z and q are both higher.
   (ii) Quadratic e¤ort cost.-- Other functional forms for costs could signi...cantly change

the welfare implications. For example, if c (x) = !    , as ! 1; c (x) ! 0 for x < !
and c (x) ! 1 for x > ! ; we would get lim !1 xt ! ! for all t > 0; the hazard would
become    at at 2(    ! ) and equilibrium welfare would converge to 100%. Of course a
 at hazard is not what the data show and it would be hard to accurately estimate two
additional parameters using B ( ) and and (39) alone. Appendix reports the ODE for xt
for the form c (x) = x1+ = (1 + ), but we cannot obtain analytically the solution for xt .


3.2      Estimates for one market
The ...rst round of estimates presumes that all sellers share the same parameters (r; ; p; k; c).
The ML procedure is13

   There are two sets of estimates. Line 1 reports estimates constrained by a value-drop-
recall ratio of 6, so as to reect the estimate averaged over the various papers cited above.
Line two of the table reports the estimates constrained by value-drop-to-recall-cost ratio
12 as reported by Jarrell and Peltzman (1985 p. 521). Visually, the plots in Fig. 4 favor
the estimates in Line 1 which will be used in subsequent calculations.14 Since x0 = c, Eq.

     Jarrell and Peltzman focused on major recalls, this may explain their higher estimate of ...rms losing
12 times their recall costs. If smaller recalls get less publicity, it is not surprising that Figure 4 shows a

(37) implies that the intercept of the hazard of B is 2 (          c). The model overpredicts
the intercept and underpredicts the decline in the hazard even for the case E (x) = 6.
    As a reality check on our estimate of c, note that that warranty expenses are an upper
bound on recall costs. Cohen et al. (2011) report that warranty expenses are from 1.45
and 1.82 percent of sales revenue in the industries they studied. Our estimates say that
relative to sales recall costs, c=p; are between 0:34 (using row 2) and 0.5 (row 1) percent
of sales revenue, i.e., at most about one third of all warranty expenses.

estimates in the top row of Table 1. Panel 1 is an expanded version of Fig. 2, where we

    Panel 2 shows that x approaches x2 and as x rises, v also rises. Additionally, v rises
because the hazard rate 2 (       x) declines, reducing the likelihood of a reversion to v0 = k .
Panel 4 shows the distribution of x conditional on a recall which, by Eq. (6), is equal to
c plus the loss in value.

where m is income per head. Panel 1 and plots the value of n as a function of p. We use
(9), (11) and the solution for xt in (19). Once p is speci...ed, equations (9), (11) and our
xt do not depend on the demand parameters. Because the entry cost is constant at k , n
is proportional to A and so we set A = 1. The other parameters used in Fig 6 are listed
better ...t for the MLE for 6c than for 12c.

3.2.1   Consistency of the estimates with the assumptions made on the para-
        meter values

positive and decreasing in x as shown in Fig. 2. A larger version of the equation system
is in Fig. 5
    On the existence of the equilibrium at pmax .-- The RHS of (21) is estimated to be
positive which means that the pmax equilibrium exists.
                                                                                  p
    Checking that equilibrium p exceeds ...rst best p.-- Eq. (28) implies that p > 2 (rk + c)
c; and this is indeed so at the estimates in Table 1.
    Checking condition (16).-- and the condition (16) is met so that Proposition 1 and
the solution for x in Eq. (6) is valid.

3.2.2   Fitting the hazard by OLS instead

The ML estimator targets the density, not the hazard, hence the left panel in Fig. 4
shows a much better ...t than the right panel. To get better ...t for the hazard rate itself,
we estimate ( ; p; k; c) that ...ts the model to the empirical hazard by least squares, i.e.,
                                           X
                                   min      (h(ti )           ^ (ti ))2 ;

   The hazard, pictured in Fig. ?? is only slightly steeper compared to that generated
by the ML estimate.


3.3     Unobserved heterogeneity: Two markets
Our estimated hazard rates tend to be too     at. Now, unobserved di¤erences in hazard
rates are known to create a steeper hazard for the group, as the movers leave and the
stayers remain. Suppose then that there are two groups and estimate p; k; c; separately
across groups, treating them as separate markets. We assume that the customers know
the ...rm types but that the econometrician does not. We also estimate the fraction 1 of
the observations that fall in group 1, with the remaining fraction 2 falling in group 2.
With two s the procedure is

        This is a simpli...ed version of a method that Kiefer and Wolfowitz (1956) proposed and that Heckman
    and Singer (1984) have used. It does not require that the data be arranged into groups (in this case
    two), the groups are chosen so that the likelihood is maximized. It amounts to raising the number of
    parameters in the likelihood from one (i.e., ) to three: ( 1 ; 2 ; 1 ).



                                                                21
3.4     Implications of the estimates
We now refer back to the model and the issues it raises in light of these estimates. We
shall focus on the estimates in Table 1 except for the welfare results where we also include
the two-market results reported in Table 3.

3.4.1   Welfare

We shall use the estimates of the ...rst row of Table 1, and Table 3. Thus in Table 4
for the two market case, pmin and pmax are calculated in each market using its estimated
parameters ( ; k; c) reported in Table 3.

     The two markets have higher welfare than the one-market estimates, and the estimated
...rst-best level is also higher. In both cases welfare is estimated to be about 25 percent
of its ...rst-best level. With two values, the estimated reputation building is slightly
higher because the individual hazards are somewhat steeper than the combined hazard.

3.4.2   Estimate of the optimal policy intervention

Evaluating (29) and (30) at the parameter estimates in Table 1, we derive the estimates
of the optimal policy in Table 5:

   Note ...rst, that T is 55-60 percent of the average market value; it is high because
recalls are relatively infrequent and the policy has to leverage them to induce higher
e¤ort in all periods. Second, compared to equilibrium, recalls are much smaller under
the optimal policy, especially if the market punishment is only 6 times costs.
   Since the proposed policy is quite simple, we would expect it to be already in place,
and there is some evidence that this is so, at least qualitatively. Recall-related ...nes are
imposed in several countries and jurisdictions. In the U.S., the FDA can exact civil ...nes
when it can demonstrate that a Federal law was violated.16 Additionally, in the U.S.,
GM was ...ned $900 million after it' s ignition switch scandal.17
   In the U.K., ...nes are imposed on ...rms that engaged in ...nancial "misconduct"which
we can think of as a defective ...nancial service. Armour, Meyer & Polo (2017) and
Karpo¤ (2012) summarize the stock-price impact which, relative to the ...nes imposed,
have reputational e¤ects similar in size to those that product recalls have relative to
the direct recall costs ­ their results are listed in online Appendix C Table A2. Online
Appendix D Table A3 lists more examples of ...nes and provides details. Online Appendix
D also includes more examples of ...nes as well as examples of o¤setting     ow subsidies ­
counterparts of S .


3.5       The value of a reputation
Fig. 9 shows the stationary distribution of w in two equilibria, and Table 6 summarizes
the ...ndings.
    From Eq. (15) we ...nd that x2 is decreasing in p, which means that welfare is positively
related to the value of reputation. The larger is x2 , the greater the tendency for ...rms
to be bunched near the maximum where the recall hazard is at its lowest, and we ...nd
in Appendix that limw!wmax (w) = 1 if 2 + x1 < 3x2 , which holds at the estimated
parameter values.

similar to those in Panel E and Panel F of BM18'  s Fig. 1, but once again their reputation
density does not rise as steeply on the right because their investment is not monotone in
reputation, it declines as reputation rises towards its highest value.


4     Discussion and extensions
Several issues are addressed in this section. First, in the model sellers are homogenous; but
we will show within a market some heterogeneity in ...rms'scale can be handled with no
change in the implications. Second, we estimated one particular equilibrium of the game,
but there are other equilibria some of which we outline. Third, ...rms may not want to
announce their defects and generate recalls right away ­the recall decision is endogenous.
Fourth, transportation equipment is durable and we show how the model extends to this
case. Fifth, if ...rms can commit to warranty payments in excess of coverage of defects,
they may be able to raise their values. Sixth, there may be other information channels
that a¤ect reputation. The seventh and last subsection discusses three mechanisms other
than reputational concerns that motivate e¤ort.


4.1    Heterogeneity of ...rm scale
The data include recalls of transportation equipment ranging from cars to windshield
wipers. There are trivial recalls that customers do not respond to, perhaps because
c is much smaller for such recalls. Then there are major recalls involving automobile
safety. Firms also di¤er in their size, which in this model would amount to di¤erences
in the total amount of quality they supply. We now show that if the parameters are
scaled in a particular way, the model can accommodate a speci...c form of one-dimensional
heterogeneity with no change in the recall hazard.


                                                 24
    Let us assume that the industry has an integer-valued number of ...rms n (instead of
a continuum of measure n), but that n is large enough that ...rms take p as ...xed and
constant. This simpli...es the exposition. Now the quality consumed, q , is an aggregate
of individual ...rms'qualities Xi :
                                           X
                                           n
                                      qt =   Xi;t ;                                 (47)
                                                i=1

Eq. (1) holds at the market-clearing price p with the consumers'FOC for q still satisfying
Uq =Uz = p: The unit price of quality is the same for all ...rms, and ...rm i'
                                                                             s revenue is pXi .
Let i denote an exogenous characteristic of ...rm i 2 f1; :::; ng that we shall refer to as
the "scale"of ...rm i. The solution of the previous section survives if heterogeneity is one
dimensional as follows:
    Supply of product i.-- For product i, let Xi2 =(2 i ) = e¤ort cost,        Xi = i = recall
hazard, Ki = entry cost, and Ci = recall cost. Firm i'   s Bellman equation reads

                                    1 2                   X                                 dVi;t
            rVi;t = max pXi;t          X                          (Vi;t      K i + Ci ) +           (48)
                     X             2 i                        i                              dt

with the FOC
                                    Xi;t = Vi;t         Ki + Ci                                     (49)

Then in Appendix we prove

Proposition 4 If Ki =      ik   and Ci =        i c;   then

                                Xi;t =   i xt     and     Vi;t =      i vt                          (50)

will solve equations (47), (48), and (49), and each ...rm's recall hazard will be                    xt ,
where (xt ; vt ) satisfy Eqs. (5) and (19).

    Under these assumptions we can ...t a common hazard function to the data as plotted
in Fig. 3

Other types of heterogeneity Some variation in types cannot, however, be handled
in the way outlined above, and this is true both even when types are exogenous, as well
as when they are endogenous:
    (i) Exogenous types.-- Let'  s start with ABK who assume that high types have lower
but still a positive likelihood of retractions, and we may assume that high types have
higher values for consumers. The conditional probability of a retraction falls in the
absence of a retraction and jumps up following a retraction. In contrast to what happens
in my model, these hazard dynamics are purely a function of selection ­the probability,
call it p, that the ...rm'
                         s type is high, rises the longer it has been since the last retraction
­see ABK'    s Fig. 2.

                                                  25
    Now the estimates in Sec. 3.3 are for two types and we found in Panel 2 of Fig. 8 that
even conditional on market type the hazard rate declines. This suggests that if, contrary
to my model, the hazard conditional on type was constant, the ...rm'   s type would need to
change, so as to generate the decreasing type-speci...c hazards that Fig. 8 shows.
    (ii) Endogenous types.-- This is what BM13 adds; there the investment in quality is
chosen continually but only matters at random dates. The perfect bad news version of
BM13 does produce a monotone recall hazard rate and monotone valuation penalties for
recalls: The ...rm exerts e¤ort when its reputation lies above some cuto¤ and shirks below
this cuto¤. In some of their perfect bad news equilibria ...rms start out with low e¤ort
but, if they su¤er no breakdowns, beliefs about the ...rm'   s type drift up into the region
where high e¤ort (which is even less likely or not-at-all likely to lead to a breakdown)
becomes optimal and the hazard rate drops.18


4.2     Other equilibria
So far we have assumed that a ...rm'  s value at a recall coincides with new entrant'
                                                                                    s value
k and that the evolution of value and of quality is thereafter deterministic. We shall
now brie   y discuss the consequences of dropping these two assumptions. First we de...ne
a class of equilibria in which behavior is random, and then equilibria in which upon recall
vt drops to a value other than k:

4.2.1   Equilibria indexed by reversion to vR 6= k at recall

Takeovers limit punishment values to no lower than k . E¤ectively, the ...rm erases its
reputation by selling its hard assets to a newcomer. This assumes that the ...rm'    s capital
is salvageable. If the punishment following a recall can force its value to some vR 6= k , and
then behavior would be as described in the previous sections, but with the HJB equation

                                        x2                                dv
                    rv = max px              (        x) (v   vR + c) +        ;
                          x             2                                 dt

An ...rm's initial condition is still v0 = k and the decline in the recall hazard would be
larger the lower is vR :
                                                                               j
    Further equilibria entail punishments that depend on recall order. Let vR    denote the
                                                                                    j
value following the j th recall. Starting with v0 > k , any decreasing sequence vR    j 1
                                                                                          is
                                                                2
an equilibrium. And when the second punishment entails vR = 0; this would resemble
one of the the outcomes in the imperfect bad news version of BM13 pp. 2411-2 in which
the second piece of bad news in a shirk-work-shirk equilibrium reduces reputation by so
much as to eliminate investment altogether.
  18
    Board and Meyer-ter-Vehn (2018) extends BM13 in some ways, but assumes only good news signals
and thus does not apply to events such as recalls.


                                                 26
4.2.2   Equilibria in which ...rm quality evolves randomly

Assume that, following a recall vt drops to k and stays there until a Poisson shock hits,
upon which it rises to vH > k . Assume that during the punishment phase (also the
immediate-post-entry phase) quality is assumed to be xL = c for a period of random
duration (independent over ...rms) distributed exponentially with hazard rate , following
which action is assumed to revert to

                                       xH = c + vH                      k                             (51)

                       rvH = pxH               (    xH ) (vH k + c)                                   (53)
                                           2

where v0 = k is the ...rm's value in the punishment phase, and vH is its value when in
the normal phase. Each ...rm's recall hazard would then jump up to        xL after a recall
(as in the equilibrium discussed above and estimated), and remain constant until the
punishment phase was over at which point it would jump down to         xH . The aggregate
hazard would mix over the ...rms of the two types and over the random length of the
punishment.

The ML estimation procedure then uses (35)-(43), except there are only two values of x
so that xL = c and vH and xH solve (51) and (53).
    This type of equilibrium seems to be unique in its class ­Eq. (52) gives us p which
seems uniquely determined. So, in total there are 3 unknowns (xH ; vH ; p). This has
implications similar to the two-action model of BM13 when, with perfect bad news signals,
incentives increase in reputation and the bad-news hazard is lower the longer it has been
since the previous one. The recall data do seem to favor a gradually rising xt along the
equilibrium path,


4.3     Endogeneity of recall announcements
Why would a ...rm disclose the defect and announce a costly recall? Perhaps to forestall
lawsuits that would result in certain cases such as defects (e.g., death due to brake




                                                    27
failure).19 Thus, even if the car was not sold under warranty, the companies must recall
the car or face legal action. Table A.3 reports recall related ...nes, but ...nes are also
imposed for non-reporting defects. For example, GM was ...ned $900 million after its
ignition switch scandal because GM knew about the problem for over a decade before
issuing the recall.20
    The question of when one would report bad news about oneself has been studied
more generally. In the absence of any legal sanctions, a pure adverse selection argument
suggests that defects will always be disclosed, as Grossman (1981) and Milgrom (1981)
showed. Suppose that a defect was publicly known to have occurred, but that its magni-
tude was unknown so that the c that the ...rm would incur to ...x it was uncertain. Buyers
would then expect that any product information withheld by a ...rm is unfavorable to his
product which causes unraveling and everyone discloses. That is, lowest-c type would
always disclose and this would then induce the next-to-lowest-c type to disclose and so
on until every type discloses.


4.4       Durable goods
We now interpret q as durable-good services. Assume as before that the manufacturer
must replace a failed product at the cost c in units of z , but that recalls a¤ect only the
latest generation of products. If past generations of the product were also a¤ected and
customers hold a stock that was revealed to be in some way defective, the following would
not apply.21
    Consumers.-- Then (1) still applies with the following modi...cation: Investment by
consumers in durables is I; measured in quality units and services of durables consumed
in quality units are                    Z                     1
                                                                       s
                                                   qt =           e        It s ds:
                                                          0

Since bad products are replaced, recalls do not appear in the above equation. The budget
constraint is m = pI + z . In steady state q = 1 I is a constant and assuming all income
m is spent each period, the consumer'   s FOC is
                    Z    1
                                 (r+ )(s t)          I                             1      I

cations again go through subject to a reinterpretation of p as given in (55).


4.5     Warranties
So far we assumed that a ...rm is legally liable to cover the recall damage and pay c.
If, however, a ...rm can o¤er a larger payment in the event of a recall, this becomes a
substitute for contractible quality of output because both the quality and the probability
of recall are governed by the same e¤ort variable, x.22 The ...rm can then raise its payo¤
and the only equilibrium then coincides with the ...rst best described in Sec. 2.2.3.
    If the warranty w exceeds c, the customer is e¤ectively getting an expected premium
for each physical unit purchased. Note ...rst that since n is the number of ...rms and also
the total number of physical units sold, and since the number of customers is normalized
to one, n = # of physical units that each customer buys. We ...rst establish:

Lemma 1 In units of z the customer's expected premium for each physical unit purchased
would equal
                  physical unit premium = (w c) (            x) :                 (56)

Proof.     Using Eq. (2), if Mi is large, customer i'
                                                    s expected bene...t from defective
products is, by the SLLN,

                      Mi
                      X                                          a.s..
                             (wj   c)   i;j Ifj was recalled g   !(          x) (w   c) n;      (57)
                      j =1


in which case (56) follows because the expression in (57) is deterministic.
   The customer is buying n physical units but the ...rm sells only one unit and therefore
each ...rm receives a premium of (    x) (w c) for the one unit that it has sold. If, in
addition w was set so that
                                       w = p + c;                                     (58)

the excess recall reimbursement, w c, would play the same exact role as the recall tax
T in Sec. 3.4.2 provided that p = p
                                  ^ and the equilibrium would be ...rst best. Formally,
Appendix proves

Proposition 5 If
                                          ^ and
                                        p=p                 w       c = T;                      (59)

then (i) condition (56) is the same as (30), and (58) is the same as (29); (ii) w is the
...rms'optimal warranty under commitment. (iii) The equilibrium at ^p is unique.
  22
    Chu and Chintagunta (2009) ...nd that better warranty coverage correlates positively with product
prices.




                                                       29
      In other words the warranty exceeds c by an amount equaling the recall tax and the
planner'     s optimal subsidy equals the warranty premium customers are willing to pay.
This happens because of the assumption that customers are diversi...ed and therefore
e¤ectively risk neutral with respect to w c. The warranty can then serve two functions:
a) compensating customers and b) providing incentives to the ...rm. As MacLeod (2007)
points out, when the buyer and seller are risk neutral, as long as the signal of performance
is informative, one can achieve the ...rst best. In our case the buyer draws utility from two
outputs of an agent with e¤ort a¤ecting both, then it is enough to be able to condition
on only one of them as long as the agent and principal are both risk neutral ­ the risk
neutrality is what the diversi...cation assumption delivers.
      If ...rms' qualities di¤ered and were privately known by the ...rms, warranties would
naturally emerge as signals that would separate the types (Spence 1977). Warranties are
costly to a seller and their costs increase with product liability. This would likely lead
quality to be re      ected in the ...rms'stock prices and a recall itself would then not be news
about the ...rm'    s quality and not cause a ...rm' s stock price to drop beyond the direct cost
of ...xing the recall.23


4.6     Other information channels that may a¤ect reputation
There are signals of quality other than product recalls; word-of-mouth information di¤u-
sion, on-line-reviews and so on. A tractable way to incorporate them is to have a second
bad news signal with hazard rate         x that does not entail a recall cost but that still
re  ects x. If, moreover, the signal prompts a drop in v again to k , we will have an equi-
librium with the only state being t time since the last signal (of either type), the HJB
equation

                                  x2                                                  dv
       rvt =       max      pxt        (    x) (vt   k + c)       (   x) (vt   k) +        ;
               x   min( ; )       2                                                   dt

and the FOC
                                   xt = (1 + ) (vt     k ) + c;                                (60)

which reduces to (6) when = 0. For the FOC (60) to hold for all t where both hazard
rates are positive, instead of (18) we now need x2 min ;         : The initial condition is
still x0 = c but the response of x to reputation as measured by v k is now higher which
implies a higher reputational e¤ect on e¤ort x. The social optimum x    ^ in (28) remains
the same and now x grow faster and further towards it absent any bad news signal. At
  = = 0 we have the original structure with x2 given in Eq. (15) and Appendix derives
x2 and proves that a small additional signal raises it:
  23
   Cohen, Darrough, Huang and Zach (2011) ...nd that stock prices are indeed positively related to
measures of warranty coverage measured relative to the industry median.


                                               30
Proposition 6
                               @x2                        x2 c
                                            =                         > 0:                      (61)
                               @     = =0       x2        (r +   p)

   This result does not imply that welfare will rise because conditional on x the signals
are now more frequent and this forces x to revert more often to c.24


4.7     Mechanisms other than reputation
Several other mechanisms could be at work to explain the declining recall hazard and the
large stock price impact of recall. These would be complementary hypotheses. We list
three here: (a) Prevention of possible defects as a product ages, (b) Random, autocorre-
lated recall costs, and (c) multi-product ...rms.
     (a) The declining hazard may in part be caused by a gradual discovery process on the
part of the manufacturer; the pattern in Fig. 3 could arise if obvious defects are manifest
from early on, and the less obvious ones take time before the company can gather enough
evidence. As time passes, the product is therefore improved and further defects are less
likely, hence the declining recall hazard. To the ABK model, for instance, one could add a
discovery mechanism whereby the probability of defects declines perhaps by checking the
components of the product one at a time, so that their hazard declines even conditional
on type. In that case more complex products would show a stronger decline in the hazard.
     (b) To explain why stock prices fall much more than the direct recall costs alone one
could add uncertainty over the magnitude of c itself (in addition to its uncertain timing).
An autocorrelated stochastic process for c would lead investors to interpret a large recall
as a signal that such recalls were more likely in the future. In other words, the market
may be concerned that the ...rm may have systemic problems in quality control that will
a¤ect its future operating pro...ts and its future stream of recalls, as in the standard
bandit model with unknown payo¤s. To maintain an e¤ect of recall news on the value
of the ...rm as the ...rm gets older (e.g., Toyota was founded in 1937), there would need
to be periodic exogenous shifts in the underlying quality of the ...rm (perhaps as a result
of new product introductions or changes in management) so that the market never fully
learns the ...rm's quality.
     (c) Another reason why stock prices fall much more than the direct recall costs alone
could be that the ...rm produces more than one product. A recall of one product could
signals poor management practices that may spill over to a¤ect the quality of all of the
...rm's products.
  24
    In repeated games with moral hazard, a shorter the delay with which actions are observed need not
produce equilibria with higher welfare ­see Abreu, Milgrom and Pearce (1991).

5     Conclusion
The paper has structurally estimated model of reputation building in a market in which
...rm reputations consist of the public histories of their product recalls. On-path punish-
ments were periodic, arriving through a sequence of defects interpreted as product recalls.
Product recalls ­ when made by publicly traded ...rms ­ are typically accompanied by
stock price reductions. The recall data and information from the stock-prices were used
to estimate the model. The model ...ts the recall data fairly well and we ...nd that rep-
utation accounts for about 8.3 percent of ...rm value. We then drew welfare and policy
conclusions. These conclusions pertain to the transportation-equipment sector only.
     Welfare was estimated at 25 percent of ...rst best, but an easily implementable policy
can attain ...rst best. First best is attained by a recall tax that is substantially larger than
the direct recall cost; to maintain the right incentives for ...rms to enter, the tax has to
be accompanied by a subsidy that can be paid every period. Such a policy is currently
used sporadically by the FDA in the U.S. and in other countries; if the ...nes were higher
and more broadly applied, that would bring recall rates down by an order of magnitude
and raise quality of goods produced to its ...rst best level.
     Several extensions and alternative mechanisms are listed at the end of the previous
section, and it is clear that our welfare estimate may change considerably when they
are taken into account, most notably other information channels and warranties, both
of which are common in many industries, including the automobile industry, as well
as di¤erent costs of e¤ort. It is hoped that future work will assess how much they may
contribute to explaining the phenomena that we have described in this paper and possibly
modifying its welfare conclusions.

We solve (13) using separation of variables. We can write (13) as dx=dt = (x x1 )(x x2 ),
             1
where = 2      . This is equivalent to

                                  1                1                 1

Integrating both sides, and using x1 < x < x2 , we have

Using the initial condition x(0) = c, we get exp f (x2 x1 )C g = (x2                  c) = (c   x1 ). This
implies that

or, alternatively
                                                        x2 x1
                            xt = x1 +           x2 c

which implies (19) since = 1=2. Notice that xt is strictly increasing in t, because
the denominator is strictly decreasing (using the ...rst de...nition for xt and remembering
x1 < 0 < x2 ). Also, xt ! x2 implies vt ! k c + x2 .
    The necessity of x2 < ; i.e., of Eq. (18) ­ Assume, on the contrary, that an equi-

t = t where x reaches . Suppose, on the contrary, that vt is continuous at t .

this is equivalent to (r p)2 + 2 (r p) + 2 + 2r(k c) > (p r)2 : Canceling, this leaves

But at (64) and (63) imply that Eq. (65) should hold as an equality, a contradiction.

                1          f (t) (t)             f (t) (t)         f (t) [1 F (t)]

                                                  33
Integration by parts in the denominator yields
                    Z        1                                                             1

Canceling 1             F (t) from top and bottom of the ratio yields (37). We then have

A.3       The ODE for x1+ = (1 + )
Replacing x2 =2 by x1+ = (1 + ) in Eq. (5), we get the FOC x = (v k + c)1= and
v=x      c + k , so that dv
                         dt
                            = x 1 dx
                                  dt
                                     . Substituting into Eq. (5) and rearranging yields
the ODE

                       = (k c) x1         x            x +         x               (67)

with initial condition x0 = c1= . The overall decline in the hazard is 2 x
                                                                         ^2 c1= ., where
^2 is the analog of x2 that we would obtain by setting the RHS of (67) equal to zero.
x
After dividing by x= and rearranging we ...nd that

                                    r (k     c) x           px1                   x + (r + ) = 0

A.5           Proof of Proposition 4
Substitute into (48) to get

                                                                                 36
and after canceling , we get (5). Substituting into the (49) we have (6). Eq. (50) states
that ...rms with larger i will have higher Vi ; but they also a correspondingly higher entry
cost so that Vi;0 = Ki .
   Then Xi;t = i xt , and since xt is common to all ...rms, instead of D (p) = xn in (11),
we have
                                                  Xn
                                      D (p) = x        i

Next, pmax and pmin remain the same. About p max ; Evaluating (78) at v = k and
dv=dt = 0 to get the no-reputation equilibrium at pmax , once again i cancels and we
                   2
have rk = pmax c c2   (    c) c; i.e., (21). With 'i = i ; equilibrium exists as long as
1
  Xi < which (50) implies is the same as Eq. (18).

A.6       Proof of Proposition 5
(i) follows by inspection. (ii) Conditional on w and assuming that vt = k is a constant,
the ...rm chooses its ex-post optimal value of x; the FOC w.r.t. x is x = w, and w then
maximize the ...rm' s constant expected  ow payo¤ in units of z :

with the FOC w = p + c, i.e., (58), which proves (ii).
   (iii) The proof consists of showing that if p 6= p

Substituting the  ow pro...t from (79) into ...rm'
                                                 s HJB (5) gives:

Evidently, only p = p
                    ^ satis...es the above equation as the RHS is monotone in p.


A.7       Derivation of Eq. (61)
From (60); dv

              =     1 dx
                   1+ dt
                         :   Substituting from (60) into the proceeding HJB equation gives

and rearranging,

dx                                                               x2

dt                                                               2
                                                                                1

                                                    37
   Since v0 = k ; the initial condition is x0 = c. Let x1 and x2 be the two roots of x at
which the RHS of dx=dt is zero:
                             q
x1 = r +      +    (1 + ) p    (r + +                  (1 + ) p)2 + 2 ((1 + ) rk + c (                r)) (1 + )
                             q
x2 = r +      +    (1 + ) p + (r + +                   (1 + ) p)2 + 2 ((1 + ) rk + c (                r)) (1 + ) ;

Then

       @x2                                     (r +   +          (1 + ) p)     c (1 + )

                         (r +    +         (1 + ) p)2 + 2 ((1 + ) rk + c (                    r)) (1 + )
@x2                             r+         p     c                     r+           p   c         x2 c

       = =0              (r +        p) + 2 r ( k         c)

i.e., Eq. (61). If r +     p     c > 0, then @x
                                             @
