                                 ABSTRACT



    Previous models of rules versus discretion are extended to include

uncertainty about the policymaker's "type." When people observe low

inflation, they raise the possibility that the policymaker is committed to

low inflation (type 1). This enhancement of reputation gives the uncommitted

policymaker (type 2) an incentive to masquerade as the committed type. In

the equilibrium the policymaker of type 1 delIvers surprisingly low

inflation——with corresponding costs to the economy--over an extended

interval. The type 2 person mimics this outcome for awhile, but shifts

eventually to high Inflation. This high inflation is surprising initially,

but subsequently becomes anticipated.

     in previous research David Gordon and I (1983b) built on the work of

Kydland and Prescott (1977) and others to distinguish rules versus discretion

 in monetary policy. When the policymaker could make binding commitments

 (rules), it was feasible to achieve low average inflation. This result was

superior to that attainable with no commitments (discretion), where Inflation

tended to be high, but not surprisingly high. Because of the incentive to

create inflation surprises ex post (stemming from a desire to relieve some

existing distortions in the economy), only high inflation turned out to be

incentive—compatible for the policymaker who was not bound by a rule.

    In some subsequent work (Barro and Gordon, 1983a), we considered

reputational forces that might substitute for formal rules. When future

inflationary expectations were tied to current actions, the discretionary

policymaker was motivated to keep inflation down. Thereby we found that an

equilibrium entailed lower inflation, which corresponded to a weighted

average of the outcome under a rule and that under discretion. However,

there were two shortcomings of this approach. First, the reputational

possibility hinged on an infinite horizon (otherwise the guaranteed cheating

in the last period leads to an unraveling of the solution). Second, the

equilibrium was not unique.1 From the positive standpoint of using the model

to predict the policymaker's behavior—-and thereby to predict monetary growth

and Inflation——this last feature is at least unfortunate.

    Kreps and Wilson (1982) and Mllgrom and Roberts (1982) have dealt with

analogous problems in the area of industrial organization by introducing

uncertainty about one of the player's objectives. In the present context

there could be uncertainty about either the policymakers preferences or

about his technology for making commitments. Then the extent of reputation

or credibility would correspond to an outside observer's subjective

probability that the policymaker Is of one type or another. In general,

current policy actions influence this probability and thereby affect the way

that people learn about the policymaker's true type. In addition, the

policvmaker takes this learning process into account when deciding how to

perform. Aside from giving content to notions of reputation and learning,

this approach has the advantage of not depending on an infinite horizon and

of sometimes delivering a unique perfect equilibrium. In the following I

apply this analysis to the setting of monetary policy.2



Setup of the Model

    As in previous models (Barro and Gordon, 1983a, b), costs for period t

depend on actual and unexpected inflation,



                                                —
                             (1) z = z(1r,


where    Is actual Inflation for period t and       is the representative

person's forecast of    as of the beginning of period t.     I assume

         >   0 and       -   ic) < 0   In the relevant range. Thus, costs rise

with the magnitude of inflation, j1rJ, but fall with surprise inflation,

     The benefit from surprise Inflation can reflect some existing



2Prevlous discussions of this approach in the context of monetary policy
include Barro and Gordon (1983a, p. 119), Backus and DrIffill (1984, 1985),
TabellIni (1983), and Horn and Persson (1985, Section 6).
                                                                                                 3


distortions, such as taxation of market income or unemployment insurance,

that lead to Inefficiently low levels of employment and output. Through the

standard mechanism of the expectational Phillips Curve, surprise inflation

(reflecting surprise monetary expansion) raises output and Is thereby

beneficial. Alternatively, the use of surprise inflation as a capital levy

on nominally-denominated government obligations is desirable because it

lessens the need for distorting income taxes or other types of non—lump-sum

taxes (see Barro, 1983). For a given value of surprise inflation,                            —


the minimum of costs in equation (1) occurs at                 =       0.   (The model can

readily be modified so that the minimum obtains at an arbitrary value ir.)

    The policymaker strives to minimize the expected present value of costs,



                   E[z ÷ zti/(l +    r)   i-   .. . •' zT/(l       +    r) T-t ],


where r > 0 is the exogenous and constant real discount rate and T is the

terminal period, which is discussed below. Since everybody agrees on the

merits of this objective, there Is no principal-agent problem In the model.

    In the case where the policymaker makes a serious advance commitment to

inflation——so that     =   follows   at once from general knowledge of this

commitment——the cost-minimizing value of the inflation rate Is                       = 0 for all

periods. The corresponding cost for each period is normalized to zero--that

is, z(0, 0) = 0.

    In a discretionary situation--where commitments are precluded—-the

policymaker takes current and future Inflationary expectations as givens.

Then the cost-minimizing Inflation rate for period t Is some value
                                                                                      , which
generally depends on --that is,
                                                                                        4


                                  (2)     =




Since people understand the policymaker's behavior, It also follows here that
      =   = #(,), so    that surprise Inflation,    -
                                                        7c, is zero. For a given
form of' the cost function in equation (1) (with appropriate curvature

properties), the equilibrium determines some number, , which is such that
  =   (i).   This result is the discretionary equilibrium as discussed in

previous research. The cost for each period in this equilibrium is



                             (3) z z =    z(7r, 0) > 0.



Hence, the outcome is higher costs than under the zero-inflation rule. This

result follows because the absence of commitments leads to Inflation that Is

high but not surprisingly high.

      Suppose now that there are two types of policymakers.         Type 1 is capable

of commitments and binds himself to the outcome           =   0 for each period. Type

2 has no capacity to make commitments and simply strives at each date t to

minimize the expected present value of costs, E(zt + z1/(l +           r)   +   ... +
zT/(l ÷   r)T_t),   where costs for each period satisfy equation (i). Although

the policymaker knows his own type, the private agents cannot discern this

type directly. Instead they attempt to infer the true type from observed




3it Is basically equivalent if the policymakers differ by their relative
weights for the costs and benefits of inflation. But in the present
formulation each policymaker has the same tastes, which ,just reflect the
preferences of the "representative person." The suggestion of uncertainty
about whether one player has or has not made a commitment appears In Mllgrom
and Roberts (1982, p. 303) and has also been used by TabellIni (1983).

 performance,   which means that they learn from experience. The poilcymaker of

 type 2, who is not bound by commitments, understands this
                                                                   learning process
 and may be motivated to exploit it when making choices of inflation rates.

 Throughout I assume that the parameters of the cost function in equation (1),

 as well as the real interest rate r, are time-invariant and common knowledge.

     The poiicymaker is installed at the beginning of period 0 and remains in

 power through period T.    Thus, the game between the policymaker and the

 private agents has a known, finIte horIzon.4 (The value of T is common

 knowledge.) In some circumstances the horizon can be identified with the

 term of office. However, that perspective may be too narrow, since various

mechanisms can motivate lame-duck officeholders to behave.             The horizon can

also be Interpreted in terms of the persistence of differences across

policymakers with respect to capacity for commitments (or preferences about

Inflation).     In other words, the distinction between type 1 and type 2 may

not be permanent. Then a large value of T signifies that this designation by

type holds up for a long time. The form of the subsequent results continues

to apply when the horizon becomes arbitrarily long.

     If people knew that the pol.icymaker was of type 2, then the (perfect,

Nash) equilibrium would be the discretionary one,
                                                    1r
                                                         =   i,   as   described

before.5 Further, since the type-i person always picks            =    0,   the

policymaker of type 2 can conceal his identity only by choosing zero

inflation. The motivation for doing this is to hold down subsequent

discussed In Barro and Gordon (1983a, p. 110), effectively adds to the
discount rate, r, in the objective function.

5This result holds with a known, finite horizon. With an Infinite horizon
there are other "reputatlonal" equilibria, as considered in Barro and Gordon
(1983a).
                                                                                       6


inflationary expectations, which helps to keep down future costs. However,

since the game ends in period T, there is no gain from masquerading as a

type-i person after this period. Therefore, the poilcymaker of type 2

definitely picks        =    In period T.

       Suppose that there is an interval (r, T—l) for some r > 0, during which

the policymaker of type 2 randomizes the choice of inflation between 0 and

                                            minimizes costs for period t when
   =
       #(r).      (Recall that the value

expectations are glvenj The motIvation for randomizing can arise only if

the true type has not yet been revealed—-specifically, if                 0 applied in

each prior period. Accordingly, let Pt be the probability that a type—2

policymaker sets        =   0, conditional on having chosen zero inflation in all
previous periods. Then the conditional probability of picking                =    is   I —

        The period (r, T-l) Is the one where 0 < Pt <    1   is supposed to apply.

In this interval the probability of selecting i       =0     is neither zero nor one,

but is in the Interior of this range.

       Let      be the representative person's subjective probability as of the

start of period t that the policymaker is of type 1. The probability for

period 0, a, Is a given value and Is common knowledge. In the absence of

other information,          would be the fraction of the population of potential

policymakers who are capable of commitments (and are therefore of type 1).

       The two possible outcomes for inflation at date t are          =   0 or    =        =

             The former occurs If the policymaker is of type 1 (probability a) or

if the policymaker is of type 2 (probability I -             but masquerades as a

 t is




                                              - a)(l_p).

     Equation (4) indicates the best forecast of period t's inflation rate,

 Rt given a and          Note that, since there are a large number of private

 agents, no individual has the incentive to pretend that his expectations are

 different from this value of           In particular, each person takes as givens

 the policymaker's behavior and everyone else's method for formulating

expectations. It follows that there is no reason for atomistic agents to

behave strategically——each one just aims for the best forecast of inflation,

given how everyone else is acting.6 (Presumably, accurate forecasts of

inflation aid in other individual decisions, which are unnecessary to detail

for present purposes.)




6Backus and Driffill (1985) treat         as a dichotomous variable, which in our

context would take on only the values 0 or           In this case       cannot be
interpreted as expected Inflation. rn another paper, Backus and Driffill
 (1984) consider a two-sided game in which the private sector and the
policymaker each behave strategically. This setting Is Inappropriate if the
private sector consists of a large number of independent agents, as I assume
In the present paper. The assumption of a monolithic private sector might be
applicable to a monopoly trade union that bargains for an economy-wide wage
rate—-which is the setting imagined by Horn and Persson (1985, Section 6).
However, if the private sector acts collectively, then it Is unclear why
there Is an existing distortion (externality) that underlies the benefit from
unexpected inflation in equation (1).
                                                                                                  8


     As people observe 'good behavior" from the policymaker——that is,

0--they revise upward the probability that the policymaker Is of type 1. The

adaptation formula follows from Bayes Law as

observation of          = 0 raises the probability that the policymaker is of type

1.   From the standpoint of a type—2 policymaker, this learning process means

that masquerading as a type—i person builds up one?s Image as someone who is

committed to low inflation.



The Incentives of Policymakers

     Consider now the Incentives of a policymaker of type 2. Let V(a) be

the minimized expected present value of costs from date t onward, E(zt ÷

zt÷i/(l +   r)   +   . .. + zT/(l   +   r)TtJ,    conditional on having chosen zero

Inflation In all previous periods. In this case the policymaker has a

certain amount of current reputation, as summarized by the value of a. The

overall cost, V(a). equals the expected cost for period t, E(z), plus the

expected present value of costs from date t÷i onward. With probability Pt

the policymaker sets           =    0, whIch generates the amount of reputation a+1

 shown in equation (5).         In this case the minimized expected present value of

 costs beginning at date ti-i is       V1(a1). With probability                      the

 policymaker sets      =            Then the reputation is lost (a÷                             =
                                                                                  a÷2 =
 0) and the costs each period are the discretionary ones z from equation (3).

 The present value (expressed in terms of period t units) of this flow from

 date ti-i through date T is (z/r)s[1 —       i/(i   +   r)TtJ.    Putting these results

 together implies

                      minimizes period t's costs for given inflationary

expectations.

    The policymaker of type 2 selects Pt at the start of period t in order to

mjmjmize the expected present value of costs. At the same time——that is,

without seeing the value for Pt or the realization of --the representative

person perceives that the probability of a type-2 pollcyinaker choosing zero

Inflation is        However, there is nothing to constrain the policymaker at a

point in time to set Pt =             The policymaker does not commit himself In

advance to pick zero Inflation with some designated probability--In fact,
                                                                                         10



there is no commitment even to pursuing a mixed strategy. Further, the

private agents cannot verify ex post what probability the policymaker used.

If people could observe this probability (and hence verify it), then they

would know that the policymaker was of type 2. (The type 1 person does not

pursue a mixed strategy.)7 Therefore, the analysis will go through only if

the probability,             is unobservable to the public, even ex post. The only

thing that people observe——at the start of the next period——is the value of

   from the previous period. At a point in time the uncommitted policymaker

of picking            0 or     =     with   probability 1. Thus, the outcome       =

today (refer to Barro and Gordon, 1983a, p. 107) by setting                          =           rather
than          =   0.       (The difference in costs is positive since the value

minimizes todayTs cost.) The right side is the "enforcement power," which

motivates the policymaker to maintain a low-inflation reputation today by

choosing               =   0.   The gain from deferring high Inflation is the difference

between the discretionary cost z (which arises in period t÷1 f'                              =          and

Properties of the Equilibrium

       Equation (11) prescribes a time path for expected Inflation that must

hold in order for the poilcymaker of type 2 to be willing to randomize at

each date t. Thus far, I have explored In detail the Implications of this

condition only for the case of the simple cost function that I used

previously (Barro and Gordon, 1983a). Namely the cost function from equation

(1) Is now specialized to

 main results are not very sensitive to modifications of this cost function.

        Using the specification of costs from equation (12), the inflation rate

 that minimizes costs for given expectations is

Then the condition for the path of expected inflation in equation (11)

becomes

for r   ÷I   <   t   <   'F, where recall that b/a = ic                    in   this model. For the cost

function given in equation (12), randomization requires that expected

Inflation be constant.
                                                                                       14


    Equation (4) implIes that expected inflation must also satisfy




                                   (15) i     (b/a)(l.at)(l_p).

Here I have substituted the actual probability Pt for the perceived

probability                 That is, since the policymaker of type 2 is guaranteed to be

Indifferent over the choice of probabilities, I look at the behavior that is

consistent with people's perceptions. The question of why an agent would be

motivated to pursue just the right mixed strategy seems to arise whenever

behavior Is not committed and the equilibrium entails randomization.

However, the resulting equilibrium will satisfy the condition that the

policymaker not prefer any other course of action.

    Equations (14) and (15) dictate a relationship over time between the

probability               that the policymaker Is of type I and the probability Pt that

the type-2 person masquerades as a type 1, namely



                                                         (1—r)

for r +   I   <   t   <   T.   It is apparent from equation (16) that a rising path of

reputation            (from the updating formula In equation (5)) must be accompanied

by a declining path of                As the type-2 person builds reputation via good

past performance (a rises as long as zero inflation is observed), It must be

that the probability of continued good performance by a type—2 person,
                                                                                 Pt,

diminishes. Note also that the left side of equation (18) is positive, which

requires r < 1 on the right side. If r > 1, the discount rate Is so high

type—2 person to select zero inflation. Hence,                         =   = b/a    =       0) emerges
from the start if r > 1.         Some further discussion of this result appears

below.

    The determination of the equilibrium path of a and Pt follows by

combining equation (16) with Bayes' rule for updating a. The latter

condition, stated In equation (5), is




                                 (17) a t÷1    =




for r <   t   <   T-l.   With the addition of the boundary condition,                   =   0,
equations (16) and (17) determine the path of a and Pt for t =                     r-l,

    The computations involve a first-order linear difference equation in

 Pt falls. As t -ø T, Pt approaches 0, whIle                     tends toward the value

 the horizon, T, and the initial probability                     of being type 1.      Consider the

Their other findings differ somewhat from mine because they view the private

                                                      a0.    The resulting probability            r is
 somewhat above that indicated in equation (19) (plugging in t =                            r),   unless

 the value t in equation (20) happens to be exactly an Integer.

       Assuming that r > 0, the policyinaker of type 2 sets                        =   0 with

 probability 1 at dates prior to r (beginning with the starting date 0).                               In

this situation the horizon is long enough so that the pollcymaker prefers

Pt
        1. to randomization. Since Pt =           1   during this interval, expected
inflation             is zero. Therefore, the costs are those associated with a full

commitment to zero inflation, namely z(0, 0) = 0.                     Since Pt = 1, It also

follows (from equation (17)) that there is no updating of beliefs about the

policyinaker during this period. That is,                   a = a0   for 0 <   t   <   7.
       If   the prior probability a0 is very low and/or the horizon T is

relatively          short, then a0 <            would hold. In this case there is no

interval during which Pt = 1 obtains. The starting point for randomization

is then r = 0, but the formulas for
                                    a and Pt in equations (18) and (19)
continue to apply for 0 <          t < T.
       In this situation the initial probability of masquerading p0 must be such

        In one sense the solutions for (ar.                         in equations (18) and (19) apply

no matter how small the Initial probability a0 that the policymaker is of

type 1. However, as a0 - 0,            p0 -.   0 in equation (23). Therefore, it becomes

Increasingly likely that           =        = b/a,        which means that the discretionary

outcome would obtain in all succeeding periods. Further, as an -, 0 and po

0 ,   It   also follows that       =
                                        ir(1-a0)(1—p0) tends to i = b/a.                                Accordingly,

for very small values of a0, it becomes likely that a close approximation to

the discretionary result will emerge from the outset.

      A small value of a0 does have to be weighed against the length of the
                                                                                       T

horizon T, since the relevant condition is a0 < —--j                                       .    For any finite a0,

an infinite horizon T rules out this inequality. Therefore, with an infinite

horizon, the condition a0 > 0 implies that there will be a starting interval

(of infinite length) during which Pt                  1 applies.

      As the horizon T approaches infinity, the situation approaches that of a

fully committed rule where             =         =0   obtains for all t.                         In this case the

present value of costs approaches zero. The policymaker of type 2 retains

the option of cheating today (or in any period) by setting                                          =   , thereby

of his identity implies that the subsequent outcomes are the discretionary

ones,       =    = ;,   with z =           = p2/a. With                an infinite horizon, the net

effect of cheating In the current period on the present value of costs is

The previously mentioned condition r < 1 ensures that cheating delivers a

higher present value of costs than that from setting                          =       0 for all finite t.

 In other words, if T -,         and r <   1, the potential loss of reputation is
sufficient to enforce the low-Inflation outcome for a type-2 policymaker.2

     The final possibility is a very high starting probability of being type

i——specifically, a >          (1÷r)/2   in expression (21). In this case (if r <                                   1),
the policymaker sets Pt =         1   for the entire interval, 0 <                t       <   T-1, before
switching to T = 0 in the last period. Thus, there is no period of

randomization——or of accumulation of reputation in the sense of a rising

value of ar__when the policymaker starts with a level of reputation                                             that

exceeds the critical level, (1÷r)/2.

period    =       = 0.    Then at date r there is a discrete decline i'                                         but

has not yet changed. From date r ÷1 onward the probability                                      of

masquerading as a type-i person follows the declining path shown in equation

(19), while the probability             of being type 1 follows the rising path given

by equation (18). Along this path expected inflation                              is the constant



       result did not obtain in Barro and Gordon (1983a) because the loss of
reputation lasted for only one period in that model. Since cheating reveals
one's identity in the present case, the punishment interval is effectively
infinite when the horizon is infinite.

result demonstrates that Pt = 0 leads to Pt                        1.   It follows that             is
irrational for all t ( T if             > 0 and r < 1.              Similarly, it is possible to

rule out Pt < 1 for t < r or             = 1 for t > r.

value of reputation and thereby decreases the length of the period, (0, r—l),

during which low inflation arises for sure. Table 1 shows the length of the

interval, T—r, (in numbers of "periods") from equation (24) for various

values of the parameters a0 and r.      (The numbers apply subject to the

condition that each be less than or equal to the value T—1.)

    Note that a change in a0 alters the length of the randomization interval,

T-r, but does not change the path of (ar,        during this interval. The main

consequence of a higher value of a is the increase in the length of the

period, (0, r—1), during which actual and expected inflation equal zero.14

Correspondingly, there is a decrease in the length of the period, (r ÷ 1, T),

for which expected inflation Is the higher amount e =        (1-r)b/a.       These

effects mean that the cost realized by either a type-i or type—2 policymaker

are lower the higher the value of a0. Therefore, the greater the fraction of

committed persons in the population of potential policymakers the better the

outcomes for either type of policyniaker.

    This finding does not mean that the results improve If the policymaker

turns out, ex post, to be of type 1.      Before date r the outcomes are

identical (at    =    = 0)   for either type. From date r onward the results

continue to be the same for each as long as the policymaker of type 2

masquerades by choosing zero Inflation. But at some point the type-2 person

"cheats" by setting    =     = b/a,   which exceeds the expectation      =

discretionary ones, where                    =    = ir.   To see the implications for overall

costs, recall that a policymaker of type 2 employs a mixed strategy only

because the present value of costs is invariant to the time of cheating,

except that cheating surely occurs by date T. Therefore, pretend that

cheating (7tt
                     =   i for   the first time) occurs exactly at date T.          In this case

the outcomes for type 1 and type 2 coincide through date T-l. Then at date

                                                           =

lower costs at date T.              (The value ir minimizes costs for given expectations,

which is the case here.) It follows that the overall present value of costs

is lower if the policymaker turns out to be of type 2.                     Because of the

benefit from the one period of surprisingly high inflation, the outcomes are

better if the randomly selected policymaker happens to be the kind that is

incapable of commitments.

     Ex ante, the expected costs weigh the type-i realization by the

probability a and the type-2 by                           It turns out that these expected

costs are lower the higher the value of a0.5 Outcomes are better on average

if the policymakers come from a pool that contains a higher fraction of those

who are capable of commitments. This result is consistent with the previous

conclusion that costs are smaller if the realization for the choice of

policymaker is type 2.




       can be shown by direct calculation of the present value of costs for
the two types, pretending now that the type—2 person cheats In period r (that
is, sets    =
               r

     I have assumed that the policymaker of type 1 always sets inflation at

 the committed value 0. Zero inflation is optimal with the assumed cost

 function if commitments are not only made but are also fully believed. In

 the present context credibility is tempered by the possibility that the

 policymaker Is type 2.     In this case the best value to commit to need no

 longer be zero inflation. It would be possible to determine the sequence of

 committed values,    =
                          ir.,   which minimizes the overall expected present value

of costs (weighing type-i outcomes by a and type-2 by l—aj. Conceivably

these values would then be the ones announced each period by both types of

policymakers, where type 1 makes a serious commitment and type 2 only

masquerades with some probability. However, I have not yet made much

progress in figuring out the properties of the resulting path of



Alternative Cost Functions

    A surprising aspect of the result is that expected inflation remains

constant during the period after date r. That is,
                                                         e
                                                             =   e
                                                                     =   fl-r —
                                                                              b as
                                                                                   long

as people observe zero Inflation. The cholceof zero inflation does enhance

credibility in the sense that the probability         of being type 1 rises over

time. But the failing probability Pt of good behavior by a type-2

policymaker offsets this effect and keeps expected inflation constant. Thus,

the results are discouraging from the perspective of relying on reputation to

lower inflationary expectations.

    In order to see whether these results depend on the simplified cost

function in equation (12). I modified the function to include a quadratic

term in unexpected inflation. The new specification is
                                                                                                        24

                                                                      -      +
                                                                                  (ir   -
                                                                                            e)2




The last term, with c > 0, could represent the distortion from incorrect

information about the general price level. Now unexpected inflation conveys

benefits on net (by relieving other distortions) only if the surprise is not

too large—-specifically, if                       -            < 2b/c.


       The new cost function in equation (25) does imply that the discretionary

Inflation rate,               rises with expected inflation——specifically,



                                      (26)             =    (b + cx)/(a ÷ c).


The condition for randomization of policy in equation (11) becomes a

first—order difference equation in expected inflation. The equation is

quadratic in                 and ir. There is one value for expected inflation, call it

       such that expected Inflation would be constant over time.16 That is,

   =   e     implies e = xe                            Taking a linear expansion of the quadratic

terms around the stationary value e It is possible to solve the difference

equation explicitly. The result Is that                                   follows damped oscillations




16The second root of the quadratic equation turns out to be Inadmissible
because It Is Inconsistent with    > 0 and Pt   0. The admissible root is

  =    .(l   +   2[a(l   —   r)   +   c]/[a   +       c(1      ÷ r)])1"2 —
                                                                                         25


 around the rest point 7re.17 Further, the departure of inflationary

 expectations from e for the initial period of randomization r--and hence for

 all subsequent dates t--derives from the discrete length of periods and the

 associated integer restriction on r. Otherwise,           =e     would apply at each
 date.

     The main Conclusion is that the modification of the cost function

 produces no tendency for       to fall during the period of randomization. The

 condition that ir is constant no longer holds precisely, but is a reasonable

 approximation to the solution. My conjecture is that this result would hold

 even with more complicated specifications of costs.        rt seems that expected

inflation would approximate the (single?) value that corresponds to the rest

point,      =
                1,   in equation (11).



Predictions for Inflation and other Variables

    Return now to the simplified model where costs are given by equation

(12). When viewed as a positive theory, the model has predictions for the

behavior of Inflation (and underlying monetary growth), which depend on

whether the policymaker turns out to be of type 1 or type 2. With

probability a0 the policymaker is of type 1 and thereby makes a serious

commitment to zero (or more generally low) inflation. There may be an

interval of length r over which expected inflation is also zero.                (This




17The solution is      -    =   (i   -

Correspondingly, the economy suffers from a string of surprisingly low

inflation, which might show up as a recession or as an increase in distorting

taxes. Thus, the committed policymaker continually "bites the bullet" in the

sense of tolerating the losses from surprisingly low inflation in order to

maintain the low—inflation reputation. Nevertheless, this process does not

succeed in reducing inflationary expectations. Credibility does rise over

time in the form of a growing belief a that the policymaker is of type 1.

But the offsetting reduction over time in the probability Pt that a type—2

person would select low inflation keeps expected Inflation constant.

length r where                =    = 0 obtains. Subsequently, as long as                            = 0 is


chosen, the path mimics that of the type—i person. But, with the rising

probability i-pt, the policymaker opts for high Inflation, , which generates

some short—run benefits from a positive inflation shock (which reflects an

underlying shock to money). From then on the outcomes are the discretionary

ones where actual and expected inflation are both high (c =                                     =

 inflation is zero, but there are substantial runs of negative realizations.

 devaluation of zero (which applies when the exchange rate remains fixed).18

concluding Observations

    The introduction of uncertainty about the policymaker's type allows for

meaningful notions of reputation and learning.
                                                   Thereby the approach avoids
some difficulties with multiple equilibria.     Also, it is no longer necessary

that policymakers plan over an infinite horizon.

    The results are Interesting since
                                         they show how surprisingly low or high

inflation can emerge as part of the equilibrium. The extended Interval where


18ThIs case applies when the exchange rate either remains fixed
                                                                or is
devalued by a discrete amount. Appreciations of the currency are not
considered in this model.
                                                                              28


inflation is below expectations seems to correspond to notions of the

policymakers "bitting the bullet." That is, the costs from surprisingly low

inflation are accepted in order to enhance ones reputation for low

inflation. (But the failure of expected inflation to fall here is a puzzling

finding. )   The uncommitted policyinaker manages to create surprisingly high

inflation for a period. This result corresponds to the idea that a surge in

inflation can provide benefits in the "short run." But, as is also usually

supposed, the long—term cost is that people raise their expectations of

inflation. Thus-—as in the case of the discretionary policymaker in previous

models——the uncommitted poliicymaker ends up with an interval where inflation

is high, but not surprisingly high.

    One shortcoming of the approach is that it relies on differences in types

of policymakers. In the present context these differences relate to

capacities for making commitments. But divergences in preferences for

"inflation versus unemployment" would generate similar results.    It would

seem preferable to generate predictions for inflation that depended less on

individual traits of policymakers and more on basic institutional features.

But if all potential policymakers were the same, there would be nothing to

learn from seeing their actions. Then the model reduces to ones studied

previously, which had the shortcomings mentioned before.
