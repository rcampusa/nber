Many papers have explored the relationship between average tariff rates and economic growth, when
theory suggests that the structure of protection is what should matter. We therefore explore the relationship
between economic growth and agricultural tariffs, industrial tariffs, and revenue tariffs, for a sample
of relatively well-developed countries between 1875 and 1913. Industrial tariffs were positively correlated
with growth. Agricultural tariffs were negatively correlated with growth, although the relationship
was often statistically insignificant at conventional levels. There was no relationship between revenue
tariffs and growth.

1. Introduction
        There is a fundamental disconnect between empirical and theoretical work on the
relationship between trade policy and economic growth. The basic insight of trade theory
is that trade and protection influence the inter-sectoral allocation of resources. In the
context of traditional static trade theory, protection (usually) reduces welfare, irrespective
of what goods an economy is exporting and importing, since it reduces the output of the
good in which the economy has a comparative advantage, and raises the output of the
good in which the economy has a comparative disadvantage. Thus protection reduces the
gains from trade, regardless of what goods are being protected.
        However, theoretical models linking trade and growth typically specify
asymmetries between sectors. In these models, it matters fundamentally what goods are
being protected in an economy. For example, in Matsuyama (1992) the engine of growth
is taken to be learning-by-doing in manufacturing, a phenomenon which is by assumption
absent in agriculture. In this model, anything that increases the size of the agricultural
sector is bad for growth. While tariff policy is not a focus of Matsuyama’s paper, it might
be supposed that in this case, agricultural protection should reduce growth, while
industrial protection should raise it.1
        Alternatively, during the late 19th century, and at many other moments of history
besides, urban wages far exceeded rural ones, suggesting that the marginal product of
labour was lower in agriculture than in industry. Recent empirical work by authors such
as Broadberry (1997, 1998) and Temin (2002), building on earlier contributions by
pioneers such as Edward Denison and Simon Kuznets (e.g. Denison 1968, Kuznets
1957), has emphasised that an important contribution to European growth over the past
two centuries has been the reallocation of labour from agriculture to industry and
services.2 Temin argues that agricultural protection in countries like Germany (as well as
the disruption to trade associated with the turmoil of 1914-45) slowed down this
reallocation, and hence slowed growth. On the other hand, one might think that industrial

1
  In fact, Rodríguez and Rodrik (2000, pp. 269-272) show that matters are slightly more
complicated than this. In the case of a country protecting its manufacturing sector, the static
welfare loss implied by the tariff increases over time as the manufacturing sector gets bigger. The
implication is that growth rates are initially an increasing, and then a decreasing, function of the
manufacturing tariff.
2
   For a similar argument in the context of the United States, see Caselli and Coleman (2001).


                                                 1
protection should have speeded up the reallocation of labour to industry, hence raising
growth. Admittedly, in a sufficiently long run perspective such inter-sectoral shifts
represented a transition between two equilibria, and the growth they gave rise to was thus
a disequilibrium phenomenon, rather than long run growth strictly speaking. In this
respect, the argument is fundamentally different from Matsuyama’s. Nonetheless, the
time frame over which the reallocation took place was a very long one. Hence, if the rate
of inter-sectoral labour reallocation speeded up or slowed down due to changes in tariff
policy, this might show up in changed growth rates over the sort of short to medium run
time periods that authors such as Clemens and Williamson (2004), Harrison (1996),
O’Rourke (2000) and Vamvakidis (2002) have explored.
       Theory thus suggests that the relationship between protection and growth depends
on what is being protected. We are by no means the first people to have pointed this out,
either explicitly or implicitly. Indeed, the models presented in Grossman and Helpman
(1991) suggest that the relationship between trade and growth is fundamentally
ambiguous, and it follows that the relationship between trade policy and growth will be
ambiguous as well. As Rodríguez and Rodrik (2000, pp. 268-9) put it, paraphrasing
Grossman and Helpman,


      the general answer to the question “Does trade promote innovation in a small open
      economy?” is “It depends.” In particular, the answer depends on whether the forces
      of comparative advantage push the economy’s resources in the direction of
      activities that generate long-run growth (via externalities in research and
      development, expanding product variety, upgrading product quality, and so on) or
      divert them from such activities.

       It is therefore striking that the vast majority of papers on the relationship between
protection and growth (including classic papers such as Sachs and Warner 1995, or the
other papers surveyed by Rodríguez and Rodrik) have related growth rates to average
measures of protection, as though all countries imported similar commodities, which they
clearly do not. This is a failing, not just of research on late 20th century growth, but of the
smaller literature on the relationship between protection and growth in the late 19th
century, or more precisely during the period from 1870 to 1913, as well. Papers in this




                                               2
vein include O’Rourke (2000); Irwin (2001); Vamvakidis (2002); Clemens and
Williamson (2004); and Jacks (2006).
        The most notable feature of this historical literature is that it has uncovered a
positive correlation between average tariffs and growth, in stark contrast to the typical
late 20th century finding of a negative correlation. Whether this positive correlation
reflects a causal relationship is not clear, with Douglas Irwin in particular arguing against
such an interpretation of the data (e.g. Irwin 2001, 2002). What all these papers have in
common, however, is a reliance on economy-wide average measures of protection. Surely
we can do better than this. In particular, given the theoretical arguments outlined above,
and given the fact that the late 19th century was a period which saw many countries
successfully make the transition from being predominantly agricultural to being
predominantly industrial, we should surely be asking whether agricultural and industrial
tariffs had the same impact on growth or not. This is especially true, since many rapidly
industrialising countries during this period imposed high manufacturing tariffs, in an
explicit attempt to promote their own industries. Did such tariffs promote or retard
economic growth more generally? And did they have the same effect as agricultural
tariffs, or the opposite effect?
        The reason why scholars have not gone any further to date is simply that it is
extremely difficult to obtain disaggregated indices of tariff protection. Average tariffs are
easily calculated: all one needs to do is to divide total customs revenue, which
governments have long collected, by the total value of imports. These data are readily
available for a wide variety of countries. In order to obtain disaggregated tariffs,
however, even for extremely broad aggregates such as ‘agricultural goods’ and
‘manufactures’, the researcher has to adopt one of two approaches. She can try to collect
tariffs for individual commodities, and construct some sort of weighted average of these.
Here one immediately runs into the practical problem that different countries do not
report tariffs for the same commodities, and indeed that the same commodities are not of
equal relevance for different countries, given differences in the structure of production
and trade.
        In this paper we adopt a second approach, which is easier, but still difficult and
time-consuming. This consists of dividing imports into the desired number of categories,



                                              3
in our case three: agricultural, industrial, and ‘exotic’. The last category consists of goods
such as coffee, tea and spices which were not produced in the countries concerned, and
whose imports were taxed simply to provide governments with revenue. As will be seen,
there are a number of issues which arise in choosing how to allocate goods between these
three categories, and we have therefore tried a number of different specifications, to see if
the judgement calls which we have had to make have materially influenced our results.
Obtaining such a breakdown of imports typically involved going back to countries’
annual trade returns. Next, we calculated a similar breakdown of customs revenues into
the same three categories, which involved consulting government returns giving revenues
by tax source. Dividing customs revenues by tariffs yielded our average tariff data for
these three commodity categories. The hope is that by obtaining such data, we will be
better able to interpret the positive correlation between average tariffs and growth during
this period, seeing whether it is completely spurious (e.g. driven by movements in
‘exotic’ revenue tariffs alone), or corresponds to underlying relationships that are in
accord with the sorts of theoretical arguments mentioned above.3
        There are two strands of recent research which are closely related to this paper.
The first is a very small number of papers exploring the relationship between the
structure of protection and growth econometrically, using late 20th century data. Nunn
and Trefler (2004) calculate tariffs separately for skill-intensive and unskilled-labour-
intensive industries, and find that countries that protect the former grow more rapidly
than countries that protect the latter.4 The second is work by Tena Junguito (2008), who
adopts the Nunn-Trefler distinction between skill-intensive and unskilled-labour-
intensive industries, and provides cross-section regressions relating growth between
1870-5 and 1913 to tariffs in the 1870s. In the context of the late 19th century, it would
surely make more sense to look at the differing impacts of agricultural and industrial
protection, and that is the approach taken here. Furthermore, given that tariffs changed so
much in the late 19th century, a purely cross-section approach misses a lot of the action.


3
  It would clearly be preferable to construct Anderson-Neary (2005) Trade Restrictiveness
Indices, such as have recently been computed by the World Bank (Kee et al. 2006), but this seems
impossible for the late 19th century.
4
  An even more recent paper by Estevadeordal and Taylor (2007) disaggregates tariffs into tariffs
on capital and consumption goods


                                               4
We therefore look at the relationship between tariffs and growth, exploiting variation in
the data both across countries and over time. On the other hand, a particular concern of
Tena’s has been to separate out revenue tariffs from tariffs which might reasonably be
taken to have been protective, and this is exactly mirrored in the approach adopted here.


2. Disaggregated tariff data
        We use the same sample of countries as in O’Rourke (2000). The ten countries
considered are: Australia, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Norway, Sweden,
the United Kingdom and the United States. The time period under consideration is 1875-
1913. In order to calculate tariffs for agricultural goods, manufactures and ‘exotics’ we
first collected annual data on customs revenues and imports for each commodity listed in
the relevant financial or trade statistical report. Different countries broke down their
customs revenues or imports in different ways, and the degree of disaggregation varied
considerably. In Italy, both customs revenues and imports were broken down into 16
identical (later 19) commodity categories. By contrast, our Canadian import statistics
broke down total imports into more than 200 categories, while our US customs revenue
statistics broke down customs revenues into more than 250 categories. We collected all
of these data for each country and each year. We then classified each of these
commodity categories in the import statistics and the customs revenue statistics as
belonging to either agricultural goods, manufacturing, or ‘exotics’, which allowed us to
calculate total imports and total customs revenues for each of these three broad groups for
every country and every year.5 Dividing customs revenues by total imports then gave us
average tariffs for agriculture and industry, as well as average revenue tariffs, for every
country and year. Having calculated an annual average tariff for each category, we then
converted these to five-year averages (1875-79, 1880-84 and so on up to 1910-13), giving
us eight observations for each category.
        The basis for classifying the goods was the Standard International Trade
Classification (SITC) developed by United Nations Statistics. For full details of how we
proceeded, see Appendix 1. However, there were a number of cases where judgement


5
  We would have liked to further break down the data into intermediates and final goods, but this
proved impossible given the sources available to us.


                                                5
was required in order to allocate particular commodities between categories, and this is
particularly the case where ‘exotics’ are concerned. The rationale for including these as a
separate category is that there is no reason to suppose that a tariff on tea or coffee would
influence growth either positively or negatively. We admit than in general equilibrium,
any tax will have an effect on welfare, expenditure, and factor prices (at least in models
where the demand for non-tradables can influence factor markets). Once factor prices
have been affected, it is easy to think of mechanisms whereby growth might be affected
as well. It is also the case that the consumption of goods such as tea and coffee has been
credited with boosting growth during the ‘Industrious Revolution’ of the 18th century, for
example giving consumers an incentive to work harder (see for example de Vries 1994).
However, we are not aware of any author who has made a serious claim to the effect that
tariffs on such commodities might have had an effect on economic growth in the late 19th
century, one way or the other, and it seems to us that any such argument would be
inherently implausible. Clearly, if a strong positive correlation between such tariffs and
growth were uncovered, this would cast doubt on any causal interpretation of the positive
tariff-growth correlation uncovered by the several papers mentioned above.
       The problem that arises, however, is what goods to allocate to this category. Take
for example wine, beer and spirits. There are several issues that arise here, as a glance at
the controversy involving Nye (1991) and Irwin (1993) will reveal. First, wine is
generally classified as an agricultural good, and it surely should be considered to be an
agricultural good in those countries which produced it. However, Nye claims that British
wine tariffs protected the domestic British beer and spirits industries. Should wine tariffs
be regarded as protecting agriculture or industry? Might they be regarded as protecting
agriculture in wine-producing countries, but industry elsewhere? Or should we, as Irwin
urges, regard wine tariffs in a country like Britain as having had no protective effect,
given that they were counter-balanced by domestic excise duties on beer and spirits? In
that case, maybe wine tariffs (and possibly beer and spirit tariffs as well) should be
regarded as revenue tariffs, and thus be allocated to the ‘exotics’ category?
       Resolving these issues satisfactorily seems difficult, if not impossible, particularly
in the context of a panel dataset for ten different countries with different production
structures and cross-price demand elasticities. It is certainly beyond the scope of this



                                              6
paper. We have therefore decided to allocate wine among the three categories in a
number of different ways, and to see whether the choices we make affect the results. Our
baseline assumption is that beer and spirits tariffs protected manufacturing, while wine
tariffs protected agriculture in the five wine-producing countries in our sample (Australia,
France, Germany, Italy and the United States). In the other five countries (Canada,
Denmark, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom), tariffs on wine are either regarded
as being revenue tariffs, or as protecting industry. The first specification is closer in spirit
to Irwin (1993), while the second is closer in spirit to Nye (1991), but we would not want
to make too much of this distinction given that we are looking at a range of countries
other than the United Kingdom, which was the focus of those two papers.6 The primary
purpose of this exercise is to see to what extent the allocation of wine tariffs matters for
our results, and we ask for these two authors’ indulgence in using their names to label
these exercises.
        Another issue that we had to confront was how to allocate tariffs on agricultural
raw fibres, such as cotton, silk and jute. Although jute was grown in India, it seems
sensible to treat jute tariffs as agricultural, on the grounds that they presumably protected
domestic hemp production (just as tariffs on cane sugar protected beet sugar producers).
Similarly, we have treated tariffs on raw cotton and silk as agricultural in our baseline
specification, and indeed both commodities were grown in particular countries in our
sample (for example, cotton was grown in Australia and the United States, while silk-
growing was an important activity in Italy). We did however try allocating raw cotton
and silk to the exotics category. Happily, this made no difference to our results, as results
not reported here show.
        Figures 1 though 3 give the baseline average tariff data. By definition, the two
baseline specifications are identical for agricultural tariffs, as well as for manufacturing
and revenue tariffs in the case of wine-producers. As can be seen, the two specifications
also yield very similar results for manufacturing and revenue tariffs in non-wine-
producing countries. Figure 1 shows that agricultural tariffs were particularly high in the
United States and Canada, while tariffs were also at times quite high in Germany,


6
 And indeed, the Irwin-Nye debate concerned the period prior to the 1880s, whereas our data are
mostly from the 1880s onwards.


                                               7
Sweden, Italy and Norway. Consistent with the qualitative literature, tariffs were low and
falling in Denmark, and were almost zero in the United Kingdom. Agricultural tariffs
were relatively low in France as well. Figure 2 shows very high industrial tariffs in the
three New World countries in our sample, with much lower tariffs in Europe, especially
in the United Kingdom. Finally, Figure 3 shows particularly high revenue tariffs in
Australia, France, Italy and the United Kingdom, while tariffs were considerably lower in
Scandinavia and the United States. All three tariffs fluctuated considerably over time
within individual countries. Agricultural and industrial tariffs were highly positively
correlated in the sample as a whole: the correlation coefficient is 0.70 using either
specification. On the other hand, the correlation between these two tariffs and revenue
tariffs is negative, ranging between -0.23 and -0.34.


3. Econometric results
        Table 1 provides summary statistics for the variables used in the econometric
analysis. Data on GDP and endowments come from Angus Maddison’s website and
O’Rourke (2000), while the tariff data were generated by us. We used a number of
further control variables, including the primary product share of exports and railway
density, which were taken from Clemens and Williamson (2004), and we thank those
authors for providing us with their data. Full details of all the data sources are provided in
Appendix 1 and the notes to Table 1. Since we have eight time periods, we can calculate
growth rates between seven pairs of periods. Since we have data for ten countries, we
thus have a small panel data set, with 70 observations in all. In all cases, we regress
growth between two periods on average tariffs in the initial period.
        Figures 4-6 show that while there is a positive bivariate correlation between GDP
growth and both agricultural tariffs and manufacturing tariffs, the correlation between
growth and revenue tariffs is close to zero. Of course, such simple bivariate correlations
on their own tell us very little, although the fact that revenue tariffs are not positively
correlated with growth is of some interest. Tables 2 and 3 thus regress per capita GDP
growth on the initial agricultural, manufacturing and exotic tariffs, controlling for a
variety of other variables. Tariffs are expressed as log(1+t), where t is the tariff rate.




                                               8
Table 2 includes wine tariffs with exotics in non-wine-producing countries, while Table 3
includes them with industrial tariffs. As can be seen, it makes no difference which
specification you use. In all cases the equations include time dummies (coefficients not
reported), and either country fixed effects (equations 1 through 4) or, as a robustness
check, random effects (equation 5). Including country fixed effects allows us to take
account of country-specific factors influencing growth rates either positively or
negatively, in a consistent fashion across time. Being able to do so is of course one of the
major advantages of panel techniques, as compared with the cross-sectional approach
often used in the literature (Harrison 1996). The time dummies are included so as to
control for growth upswings and downturns that were common across countries. Robust
standard errors are clustered by country.
        Equation (1) in Tables 2 and 3 includes as additional controls the log of initial
income, and growth in the capital-labour and land-labour ratios between the two periods.
The log of initial income is negatively related to subsequent growth. Growth in capital-
labour and land-labour ratios have been found in the past to be important determinants of
growth in the late 19th century, a period of expanding frontiers and international factor
flows (for a theoretical justification of the specification adopted here, see Taylor 1999).
The coefficient on both variables is positive, as expected, although the coefficient on the
land-labour ratio is occasionally statistically insignificant at conventional levels. These
findings are robust across all specifications.
        More to the point, in the context of the present paper, agricultural tariffs are
negatively related to growth in equation (1), while manufacturing tariffs are positively
related to growth. The coefficients are big. For example, taking the coefficients in Table
2, equation (1), a one standard deviation increase in agricultural tariffs is associated with
a decline in growth rates of 0.37% per annum, or 26% of the mean annual growth rate in
this sample of countries (1.45% per annum). A one standard deviation increase in
industrial tariffs is associated with an increase in growth rates of 0.94% per annum, or
65% of the mean annual growth rate. On the other hand, while the coefficient on
manufacturing tariffs is statistically significant, the coefficient on agricultural tariffs is
statistically insignificant at conventional levels. These findings are also robust, in that
they survive the addition of several other control variables in specifications (2) through



                                                 9
(4), while the coefficient on the manufacturing tariff becomes even larger in the random
effects specification (equation 5).7 Moreover, the findings are by definition robust to the
inclusion of country and time fixed effects (country random effects in equation 5). This is
important, given Irwin’s (2002) argument that the overall positive tariff-growth
correlation during this period is being driven by the fact that certain countries,
particularly those in the land-abundant New World, had good growth prospects and also
imposed high tariffs, for completely unrelated reasons (in particular, they relied on tariffs
as a source of government revenue). If this were the only factor driving the overall
correlation, then one should find no relationship between average tariffs and growth once
country fixed effects have been introduced into the equation. O’Rourke (2000) found that
the average tariff-growth correlation increased when country fixed effects were
introduced, and here we similarly find that there is a significant positive correlation
between manufacturing tariffs and growth, controlling for country fixed effects. Indeed,
the present finding is stronger than that presented in O’Rourke (2000), since the
relationship between disaggregated tariffs and growth appears be robust to the inclusion
of time dummies as well.8
        The sign pattern of the tariff coefficients is consistent with theories of growth that
argue that manufacturing is a source of growth in a way that agriculture simply is not.
The results are also consistent with the notion that economies could grow during this
period by transferring labour from agriculture to industry, which implies that while
industrial tariffs should speed up growth, agricultural tariffs should retard it.
Interestingly, there is no relationship between revenue or ‘exotic’ tariffs and growth, with
the coefficients being extremely small and statistically insignificant. A spurious positive
relationship between growth and overall average tariffs, driven by some need on the part
of governments to raise revenues, might be expected to imply a positive correlation
between revenue tariffs and growth, but that is not what these data show. The results in
Tables 2 and 3 thus seem consistent with the empirical evidence presented by authors


7
  This is a general finding. In subsequent tables, we adopt the fixed effects specification.
8
  We also tried including raw silk and raw cotton with exotics; the results (not reported here)
were stronger, in that the negative coefficient on agricultural tariffs became statistically
significant at conventional levels in certain specifications, while the coefficient on the
manufacturing tariff was essentially unaffected.


                                                10
such as Williamson (2006) in favour of the “industry-carries-growth view” (p. 147), as
applied to this period. In our view, these results make it more likely that the overall tariff-
growth correlation for this period was not some spurious artefact of the data, but rather
reflected an underlying set of causal relationships linking trade, economic structure and
growth.
          Table 4 provides two more specifications in an attempt to gain extra insight into
these relationships. The first two columns test whether these results might be due to a
mechanism considered in O’Rourke (2000), namely that during late 19th century
recessions, prices tended to fall. This would lead to average tariff rates rising, since many
tariffs were specified in specific rather than ad valorem terms during this period (Crucini
1994, Irwin 1998). Thus, average tariffs would be particularly high during recessions,
when output was below its long run potential level, and subsequent growth rates might
consequently be expected to be high. This could lead to a spurious positive correlation
emerging between tariff rates and growth. We thus constructed very crude proxies for
average ‘specific’ tariffs for each commodity category, by multiplying our tariff variable
by the aggregate price level (i.e. the GDP deflator) of the economy in question.9 As can
be seen, the negative and positive relationships between agricultural and industrial tariffs
on the one hand, and growth on the other, survive this transformation of the data, with the
negative coefficients on agricultural tariffs now becoming statistically significant. We
also (in results not reported here) interacted the tariff variables with the business cycle
variable used in O’Rourke (2000), and found that manufacturing tariffs were more
positively related to growth during booms than during busts. This is also inconsistent
with the hypothesis that the effects uncovered above are due solely to some recession
effect.
          The third and fourth regressions in Table 4 explore whether these correlations
were driven more by developments within Europe, or within the land-abundant societies
of the New World (Australia, Canada and the United States in our sample). The negative
relationship between agricultural tariffs and growth appears to be a New World
phenomenon, with the two variables being essentially unrelated in Europe. On the other

  That is, the ‘specific’ tariffs are specified as log(1+(p*t)) where p is the aggregate price level
and t is the tariff rate.

hand, the partial correlation between manufacturing tariffs and growth is positive in both
Europe and the New World. While the effect is stronger in Europe, we cannot reject the
null hypothesis that the two coefficients are equal. The overall positive correlation
between manufacturing tariffs and growth is not, it would appear, being primarily driven
by developments in the settler economies of the New World, but by events in Europe as
well.
        Finally, Table 5 runs the same regressions as before, but takes as the dependent
variable per capita industrial growth, rather than GDP growth. Since there are no
available Canadian industrial output figures for this period, our sample was limited to
nine countries and 63 observations. As can be seen, manufacturing tariffs were strongly
and positively correlated with industrial growth during this period, and the size of the
relationship is, as might be expected, larger than the size of the relationship between
manufacturing tariffs and aggregate growth. On the other hand, there is no relationship
between agricultural tariffs and industrial growth in this sample of countries.


4. Conclusion
        While correlation is not causation, the evidence presented here is consistent with
the argument that the overall positive tariff-growth correlation in the 19th century was not
spurious, but, rather, reflected underlying causal relationships that are consistent with
particular economic theories. Manufacturing tariffs were positively related to growth,
while agricultural tariffs were negatively related to growth (although the latter result is
notably less robust than the former). This accords with a variety of theoretical arguments
stressing the growth-promoting benefits of industry. Revenue tariffs were not related to
growth at all: there is no evidence of a revenue-driven relationship between overall tariffs
and growth emerging from these results. We stress again that these findings control not
just for unobserved country-specific factors which influenced growth consistently across
time, but for upswings and downswings in economic activity affecting all the countries in
our sample. The positive relationship between manufacturing tariffs and growth was
driven by European tariff experience just as much as, if not more than, by the New
World, an important finding given the argument in Irwin (2002) that the overall tariff-
growth correlation was due to developments on the prairies.



                                             12
        There is a limit to how hard we can lean on these data, given how small a sample
we have, but given that constraint, our results seem remarkably robust. It would clearly
be of great interest to generate disaggregated tariff information for this period for a
greater range of countries, not just so as to expand the degrees of freedom available to us,
but more importantly to see if the relationships which have been uncovered here can be
generalised to other regions of the world. The work of Clemens and Williamson (2004)
suggests that this is not necessarily the case, since they found strong regional
asymmetries in the relationship between average tariffs and growth: it could well be that
what was true in our sample of more or less affluent economies was not true for poorer
regions of the world as well.
        Expanding the sample to more countries is particularly important since, as Jeffrey
Williamson (2006) among other has pointed out, globalization was a two-edged sword
for developing countries during this period. On the one hand, falling transport costs
allowed developing countries to expand their exports of primary products to core
markets, and many countries, including Ghana, Burma and the settler economies of Latin
America, did well out of this strategy. On the other hand, exposure to Northern industrial
exports made it more difficult for such countries to develop indigenous industrial sectors,
with their potentially growth-enhancing properties. Several Latin American countries
such as Mexico and Brazil were adopting explicitly protectionist manufacturing tariffs by
the end of this period, and Japan lost no time in following suit once she regained tariff
autonomy beginning in the early 20th century. Given the fact that the developing world
moved en masse to protectionism during the course of the 20th century, it would be of
great interest to see whether manufacturing tariffs had any influence on growth, in either
direction, in such countries prior to 1914. The evidence in Clemens and Williamson
(2004) suggests that they probably didn’t help, but without the sort of disaggregated data
presented here it is difficult to be sure.
        As economic historians, we are comfortable with the notion that particular
economic policies may have different effects across time and space, depending upon the
technological, economic or institutional environment. We do not expect that the positive
correlation between manufacturing tariffs and growth uncovered here will turn out to be a
relationship that is generally valid. For example, it might be that for this period,



                                             13
protecting industry was equivalent to protecting ‘expanding sectors’, whereas industrial
protection now typically protects ‘declining sectors’, with different effects.10 We also
stress that we are not making any welfare judgements in this paper. Many papers in the
trade and growth literature derive positive relationships between protection and growth,
but stress that this positive dynamic relationship has to be set against the static welfare
losses implied by protectionism, and indeed that the relative sizes of these dynamic gains
and static losses may vary dramatically over time. On a more mundane empirical note, as
many countries found out during the 20th century, import substitution policies may give
rise to an initial spurt of growth, which however eventually peters out when the limits of
the internal market have been reached. Similarly, once all available agricultural labour
has been reallocated to industry or services, this potential source of growth disappears.
By focusing on five-year periods, in common with much of the empirical literature, we
may have been picking up the short to medium run impact of protection, rather than the
longer run effects. There thus remains much work to be done on these issues, but we
have to start somewhere, and establishing that particular relationships can be found in the
data for one particular group of countries in one particular period is, we believe, a useful
exercise.
          Hopefully this paper has at least convinced the reader of one, crucial point.
Looking for correlations between average measures of protection and growth does not
make a lot of sense. What you protect matters.

population growth and initial income were taken from Angus Maddison’s website,

Appendix 1. The disaggregated tariff data

General:
We estimated average tariffs by dividing customs revenues by imports. Goods are
categorized into three groups: agricultural, manufactured and ‘exotic’ goods.
We used the Standard International Trade Classification (SITC) to assign the goods to
different groups. We used the following specifications to calculate the three categories of
tariffs, with the differences depending on how wine, raw cotton and raw silk are
categorized:


Baseline 1:           Agriculture, including raw silk, raw cotton, plus wine in Germany,
                      France, Italy, Australia and USA, because they are wine producers.
                      Exotics, including wine in the non-wine-producers (Canada,
                      Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and United Kingdom)
                      Manufactures, including beer and spirits

Baseline 2:           Agriculture, including raw silk, raw cotton, plus wine in Germany,
                      France, Italy, Australia and USA, because they are wine producers.
                      Exotics
                      Manufactures, including beer and spirits, and wine in the non-
                      wine-producers (Canada, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, United
                      Kingdom)


       In the few cases where the overall figures for imports or customs revenues exceed
the sum of the individual goods reported, we increased the totals for our three categories
proportionally so that they summed to the correct total. Imports or customs revenues
classified as “others” or “other goods” were proportionally divided between our three
categories.
       Below we give country-specific details of how we classified particular
commodities, other than beer, spirits and wine.

Denmark: For 1875, 1876 the data were taken from Henrik Folde (1989), Liberalisme
og Frihandel 1814-1914, Toldhistorisk Selskab and Niel Thomsen, Industri Stat og
Samfund 1870-1939, Dansk industri efter 1870, Bind 2, Odense Universitetsforlag. From
1892 we used Statistisk Ǻrbog Danmark. Tariff rates between 1876 and 1892 were
interpolated. For 1876 and 1877, imports of wine, beer and spirits are aggregated in
‘other food and beverages’. Customs revenues are covered in ‘beverages’. Folde (1989)
also provides tariff rates for beer and spirits for 1872. Under the assumption that tariff
rates did not change and that the import shares of wine, beer and spirits as well as the
total share of beverages in total imports were equal to the ones in 1890 it is possible to
approximate the shares of customs revenues and imports for wine, beer and spirits.

Sweden: Data were taken from Sveriges Officiella Statistik, Statistiska Centralbyrån.
Imports and customs duties were given in 5-year averages from 1876/80 to 1906/10 and
individually from 1911-14. Wine, beer and sprits are aggregated as “alcoholic drinks”.
We use the share of wine and spirits from the Danish imports to approximate imports for
all specifications, presupposing that tariffs for wine and spirits were equal.

Germany: Data were taken from Statistik des Deutschen Reiches.
Until 1895 tariffs were calculated using customs revenues divided by imports. After 1895
we know the tariff rates levied on different commodities. We calculate the (trade-
weighted) average tariff rate for each category and multiply it by the share of dutiable
imports in total imports for that category. For the years in which we calculate tariff rates
using custom revenues divided by imports, imports contain values for wine, beer and
spirits. In the customs revenues only wine appears. Furthermore, in the years from 1895
to 1914 there is a tariff rate for wine, but none for spirits and beer. No duties on beer and
spirits appear, in either the early years or the later, although both sets of statistics are
quite detailed, and there is no category such as ‘drinks’ which might cover beer and
sprits. Thus it seems acceptable to assume zero tariff rates for spirits and beer.

Australia: Australia only became a united federation in 1901. The Official Year Book of
the Commonwealth of Australia starts in 1900. Thus we use the data for Victoria, as
published in the Victorian Year-Book, Commonwealth Bureau of Census and Statistics,
Victoria Office for years prior to 1898. Missing years are interpolated.
Wine, beer and spirits are listed in imports and customs revenues for Victoria. For
Australia there is neither wine nor spirits listed in either group. We therefore calculate the
three categories without special regard to alcoholic drinks and extrapolate Victoria’s
rates.
