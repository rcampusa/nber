             The Inefficiency of Marginal—cost Pricing
               and the Apparent Rigidity of Prices

                            ABSTRACT



     Under conditions of natural monopoly, private contracts or

government regulation may attempt to avoid inefficiency by
setting up a pricing formula. Once the capital stock is chosen,
the right price to charge the buyer is marginal cost. But the
point of this paper is that marginal—cost pricing provides the

wrong incentives + or the choice of the capital stock by the
seller.   If the seller can achieve a high price by deliberately

under—investing and driving up marginal cost, there will be a
systematic tendency toward too small a capital stock. One type
a-f contract or regulatory policy that avoids this problem charges

marginal cost to each buyer, but provides a revenue to the seller
that is equal to long—run unit cost, not short—run marginal cost.
Such a contract or policy will make the price, in the sense of

the revenue of the seller per unit of output, appear to be

unresponsive to market conditions.

  Setting price equal to marginal cost can be inefficient.
Marginal cost prices provide the correct allocation of the output
from a fixed amount of capital, but may provide the wrong
incentives for capital accumulation. When a seller receives
marginal cost, it has an incentive to raise marginal cost by
investing too little.       In cases of natural monopoly, certain
important     economic    institutions   have arisen     to    prevent
inefficient exploitation of monopoly power.      These institutions
involve long—term contracts or government regulation. This paper
shows that a contract or regulatory procedure granting a seller a

price equal to its own marginal cost is inefficient.           On the
other hand, marginal cost is the appropriate price to           charge
purchasers.

  Contracts can circumvent the conflict between the need           for
efficient allocation of output among buyers, which seems to call
for marginal—cost pricing, and the need for efficient investment,
which excludes marginal—cost pricing.         The fully efficient
contract charges marginal cost to each purchaser, but         provides
stable revenue to the seller, so the seller cannot improve profit

by deliberately creating a shortage 01-   capacity.    When demand is
strong and all customers are paying premium prices, the        excess
revenue is returned to the customers as lump—sum rebates, instead
of flowing to the firm.



                                  1
 A wide variety of contracts of this type can bring both kinds
of efficiency——allocation of output and appropriate investment.
They all prevent the seller from profiting from a shortage of
capital, but otherwise do not limit the relation between output

and revenue.      But I argue that one member at the class of fully

efficient contracts has some extra advantages and fits the facts

about output and revenue.           Under this contract, revenue is
strictly proportional to output, or, to put it another way, the
"price," in the sense of revenue per Linit of output, is
predetermined by the contract (possibly it is indexed to observed
input costs). Price rigidity is a feature a-f the contract.

 Earlier writers,       notably Arthur Okun (1975,          1981) have
commented upon the tendency for long—term relations to stabilize
unit revenue, but have invoked alternative principles to explain

the stability.     Some of   the   principles are outside the domain of

economics, and others, especially those relying on search and
in-formation, are yet to be fully developed.              The principle
studied here is a straightforward economic one.

  The sense in which prices are rigid in the model of this paper
has no direct Keynesian implications; that is, price rigidity
does not lead to disequilibrium in product markets.           Efficient

allocations      of output do not admit an interpretation            of

disequilibrium.     In this respect, the arqument developed in this
paper parallels tne conclusion reached in the literature on labor

contracts (for citations,           see Hall •   1980).   Contracts can
stabilize wages without necessarily creating an inefficient
allocation of labor.

  In another respect, however, the argument of this paper does
have important macroeconomic,       and perhaps even     Keynesian,
implications.   Prices are thought to be important signals about
the current state of the economy.    For example, the performance
of labor contracts is much better if they can be indexed to the

prices at which goods are actually bought and sold.         But if
government price indexes report unit revenue, and unit revenue is
stabilized for the reason laid out here, then the value of those

price indexes in contingent contracts is much reduced.
  The inefficiency of marginal—cost pricing is not completely
unknown in the literature on efficient regulation.       In Alfred
Kahns two—volume treatise, The Economics of Regulation (1970),
there are two long chapters on the virtues      of marginal—cost
pricing.    In a single footnote Kahn notes the          investment
disincentive (p. 106, note 52):


        if public utility rates were free to fluctuate
     like   purely competitive rates over the cycle, it
     would in principle be necessary for     regulatory
    commissions to play a much more active role than they
    now need to in the investment decision      process——
    specifically, to compel companies to expand capacity
    when necessary.    Private managements would have a
    strong temptation to delay capacity expansion in
    times of strong demand, hoping instead to enjoy the
    high profits resulting from the high prices required
    to ration customers.
Kahn mentions earlier work of James Bonbright (1961), which
contains a brief statement of the point and cites Bruce Knight

(1930), as the originator.        But Knights paper does not really

distinguish between the obvious problem of letting a monopoly
utility set its own price unilaterally and the more subtle
problem of a rule requiring price to equal marginal cost.        In

Jacques Drezes review of the contributions of French applied
economists (1964), there is a brief discussion of the incentives

facing the firm subject to marginal—cost pricing, but it reaches
the incorrect conclusion that private and social optimality
coincide.      Alan Walters' (1968) monograph on the economics of

public      roads   also notes,    briefly,   tne problem of    the

inappropriate incentives for investment under marginal cost
pricing, but all of his analysis deals with a public agency that
avoids the problem by adopting consumer surplus rather than
revenue as the positive item in its objective function.     As far
as I can determine, the outpouring of work on peak load pricing
in the 1970s takes Walters' view and is completely silent on the
issue of investment incentives.

 1. Evidence an price rigidity


      Empirical studies for the United States are almost unanimous in

 finding that fluctuations in prices and output are not     movements
 along a marginal cost schedule. At the aggregate level, this was
the consensus of the Eckstein volume (1971) and a good deal of
 later work in the same vein.      In most a-f this work, the issue is
posed as one of finding demand effects in an equation with      price
as the left—hand variable and cost indexes as the major right—
hand variables. The interpretation in terms of movements along a
marginal cost schedule is mine and not the original authors'.      As
a rough guide, the elasticity of price with          respect to the
utilization rate (output—capital ratio) should be about one—half
i-f    the
         elasticity of output with respect to variable inputs is
two—thirds.   Though most studies find slightly positive demand
effects, they are never close to an elasticity of a half.

      Figure 1 presents data on prices relative to costs     for the
aggregate U.S. economy and Figure 2 does the same for one key
industry producing a major intermediate       product, steel.     The
aggregate price is the implicit deflator for GNP in the      National
Income and Product Accounts and the corresponding cost index is
the Bureau of Labor Statistics' inde>          of compensation per
employee—hour.       Both are expressed as indexes with trends
removed.

     The expansion of output from 1954 to 1955 was accompanied by
a modest increase in prices relative to costs.
                                                    Then, as output

fell to its troughs in 1958 and 1961, prices fell somewhat. When
output began its spectacular long rise from 1961 to 1966, prices
continued to decline relative to costs. The fall in output from
1969 to 1971 saw a small increase in the price—cost ratio.         In

the later 1970s, the movement of prices is influenced by energy
costs, which are not considered here. Even so, there is no sign
of movement along an upward—sloping marginal cost schedule.        In

1982, when output fell to its lowest point in the entire period,
prices continued to rise relative to costs.

  Data for the steel industry are drawn from Robert Crandall 's
(1981) study of the economics of steel.         Price is measured as
revenue divided by output for a single homogeneous product, cold—
rolled sheet.    Cost is a detailed index of all components of
steel costs. Again, there is no systematic tendency for price to
rise relative to cost in booms or fall in periods of low output.

From 1956 to 1958, steel output fell by 23 percent, while price
rose a little relative to cost.       From a trough in 1970 to a peak
in 1973, steel output rose by 44 percent, yet the price fell
significantly relative to cost.

  These data strongly support the hypothesis that prices are
closely linked to factor costs and hardly linked to short—run
marginal cost at all.     The rest of the paper investigates hy
contracts might have exactly this feature and yet provide the
efficient allocation of output and the efficient level of the
capital stock.


                                  7
2. Contracts and allocational efficiency


  As a general matter, I will be looking at a situation where one

producer sells output to N purchasers.            The terms of the
transactions         are governed by N separate     bilateral    sales

contracts.      Events occur in the following order:     At contract
time, the terms are set. At investment time, the firm determines
the level      o-f   capital to maximize expected profit under the
contract.      At production time, the output is produced and
delivered to the purchasers.        Buyer i 's need for the output is

perturbed by a random variable, Xj ,      whose value is not known at
all at contract time.         At investment time, the producer has

imperfect      information about the likely demand,        but    this

information is not verifiable and the contract cannot be made
contingent on it.          The advance information is described by a
scalar random variable, u. At production time, the buyers learn

their XjS       but again, they cannot be verified by the seller.
The quantity delivered to purchaser i is q. The total delivered
to all purchasers is 0.         Buyer i derives a benefit, V (qi ,x1)

from receiving qa.        The producer incurs short—run variable costs

of C(Q,K,w) plus capital costs of rK.          1< is the capital stock

chosen by the producer at investment time.        The wage, w, and the

price of capital, r, become known after the contracts are signed
but before the capital decision is made.

  For convenience,       I introduce unnecessarily strong assumptions

                                     8
  For convenience, I introduce unnecessarily strong assumptions
about V1 and C:


     Assumptions:        Each    V1 (qa    ,xa   )   is strictly concave and
     differentiable in q1..      As a function of Q and K, C(Q,K,w) is

     homogeneous of degree one, strictly convex, and continuously
     differentiable.       The derivative of V with respect to             q1

     becomes larae without limit as q1 approaches zero and
     approaches zero as qa becomes large.                 The derivative of C
     with respect to K becomes indefinitely negative as K
     approaches zero and approaches zero as K becomes large.



The goal of the parties is to set up a procedure to deliver               the
efficient quantity to each purchaser.                  The first concept of
efficiency used here is



     Definition.      An allocation ot output, q1,... .q. is output—
     efficient if it maximizes

          C V1 (q1 ,x1) — C(Cq1 ,K,w



Note that output efficiency is a property of the allocation ex
post, after the demand shifts and factor prices become known.

  The following obvious result will be used extensively in the
sequel:




                                       9
     Theorem      1.       There   exists a unique    output—efficient

     allocation! characterized by

        cV— C

That is, whatever capital stock has been chosen by the producer,
the marginal benefit of output to each purchaser should equal
short—run marginal cost at that capital stock.

     The second concept of efficiency is



     Definition.       K is capital—efficient i-f it maximizes

        EEZ Va qt Xj        — C(q ,K,w)   —   rK]
     where the expectation is over the distribution of Xi
     conditional       on the in-formation available to the producer at

     investment time, u, and the qa are the output—efficient
     levels given K.



The parallel result for capital efficiency is:

     Theorem 2.        There is a unique efficient capital stock, and
     it satisfies

        E (—)          r

The expected marginal reduction in cost associated with an
increase in the capital stock should equal the cost of capital.

                                     10
  In order to achieve the efficient allocation, the parties agree

on a contract. A suitable class of contracts lets the buyer pick
the value of q1 subject to making a payment to the seller in the

amount Rt (qa ,Q,K,w,r) .      The   general argument in favor of a
contract that has the buyer choose the quantity appears in Hall
and Lilien (1979) in the context of the labor        market and in
Weitzman (1981) in a setting like this one.       8riefly, when one
party observes some private information and the other party is
affected by nothing but public information, the first party
should make the active choice because it           internalizes the
influence o-f   the   private information.

3. Contract provisions to provide the efficient capital stock

    What is distinctive and complex about the setup considered in
this paper is the investment decision made by the producer after

contracts are signed.      The total revenue from all its contracts

provides an investment incentive to the firm, and the contracts
must be designed to provide the right incentive in order to
achieve capital efficiency.
    There is one minor obstacle to contracting for exact capital

efficiency.     As a general matter, the information available to
the firm at investment time, indexed by u, may convey more than

just     the level of demand.          If so,   the prohibition     of

contingencies on u may make it impossible to frame a contract to

achieve exact capital efficiency.        But if u conveys pure scale

effects, then, as      I will demonstrate shortly, contracts are
available in which efficiency does not require contingencies on
u      The following assumptions are sufficient conditions for a
capital efficient contract not contingent on u:



       Assumptions:

       (A) The demand shifts, xi, are scale effects in the sense
       that Vt (qi ,x1) is homogeneous o-f first degree in qa and Xi.

       (B)    The preliminary information, u, conveys the scale of
       the Xj in the sense that the conditional distribution of x.

       given u has density ga Xj/U)/U.


                                  12
       (C)  The revenue -Formula R(Q,K,w,r) is homogeneous of degree
       one in Q and K.




       It will turn out to be reasonable to consider contracts            in
which the quantity choices of the purchasers influence the
producer's revenue only through total quantity and not               through
the vector o-f quantities chosen separately by each purchaser. In
this case, the revenue of the producer is a function R(Q,K,w,r).
The producer chooses K to maximize expected profit,

         ECR (0 (K,w,r ,x ) ,K,w,r) —   C (Q,K,w) —   rK]

Here   I have noted that 0 depends on the producer's choice of            K

because K affects marginal cost, which in turn affects the
efficient level of output. The marginal conditions for a maximum
of profit are

                           •Q K.



Recall that investment efficiency requires E[— — r)         =   0,   so the
contracts must satisfy




                                    13
       Theorem 3.           A contract with revenue formula R(Q.K,w,r)
       provides capital efficiency only if

       Further, if a fOrmula satisfies this condition for u=1 and
       all w and r, it satisfies it for all u, w, and r.




This theorem provides a criterion for a capital—efficient revenue
formula. Its three terms net to zero in order for the formula to

provide the right incentives for capital efficiency.                   The first

two arise because changes in the capital stock change the level

of output.         The first term is the extra revenue the formula
provides for the extra output.                      The second is the extra cost

incurred in producing the output.                    The third term is the extra

revenue the formula may provide for the extra capital.                  If, for
example, the formula provides less compensation for the extra
output than its marginal cost, then it must provide an offsetting

amount of direct compensation for the capital itself.
       The property that a formula achieving capital efficiency at

u=l    also achieves it             for any value of u means that the formula

need   not be contingent on the value of u, which we assume is not
public    knowledge.



                                               14
      The     inefficiency of marginal—cost pricing can now be
demonstrated. With marginal—cost pricing, the contract specifies
a price,

                         .,   C
           p(Ic,w,x) =



which is marginal cost. Then revenue is price times
                                                    quantity,

        R(Q,K,w,r) =          p(K,w,x)O


The derivative of revenue with respect to output is just the
price, which equals marginal cost. Therefore the first two terms
in the criterion for capital efficiency cancel each            other.   All
that is left is the third term, the derivative of revenue with
respect to the capital stock.              This must equal zero for capital
efficiency. However, with marginal—cost pricing, that derivative
is      which is negative, not zero.              The larger is the capital
stock, the lower is the price——more capital lowers marginal cost.

Profit maximization cannot bring the firm to the efficient stock.
This conclusion is summarized in

     Theorem 4. Under marginal—cost pricing,             expected profit is
     a strictly decreasing function of the capital stock, at the
     efficient capital stock.




                                          15
     Besides marginal—cost pricing, two other simple revenue
functions deserve mention because they are inefficient.   One is
to let revenue equal cost


        JR   tQ,I<,w,r) = C (O,K,w)   ÷ rf<


This revenue      function satisfies the marginal conditions for
capital efficiency but not the second order conditions.       The

producer has profit of zero no matter what, and so is indifferent

among all levels of K. the purchasers would have to develop some
method outside the revenue function to steer the producer to the

efficient capital stock.
     Another choice is to make revenue independent of either
output or capital- At first, this seems like the right approach.
The two parties want the producer to pick the efficient capital
stock so as to minimize the expected cost of producing whatever
level of output the purchasers decide to take. Maximizing profit
might then seem to be equivalent to minimizing cost.      But the
firm influences the level of output through its choice of the
capital stock, even though the purchasers have the unilateral
power to choose the amount of output. For constant revenue,

     R(Q,fC.w,r) =     P0.


the criterion is




                                        16

which is unambiguously negative. The firm faces an inappropriate
disincentive to invest because it is not rewarded for the cost of

producing the extra output stimulated by extra capital.
       Though none of the three revenue formulas considered so far

provides the right investment incentives, the marginal condition
for capital efficiency is not actually very restrictive.                         Many
combinations of rewards for the extra oL(tput associated with
extra capital,
                            R Q      and direct rewards for investment,

conditions imposed on the revenue formula by output                      efficiency
are not too restrictive, capital efficiency is relatively easy to
achieve.

      A particularly interesting and simple way to provide the
firm with the right incentives is to make revenue a fixed amount,
D (w,r) ,   per unit of output. Then


            R'Q,K,w,r) =        Qt(w,r)

This formula provides no direct reward for investment but can

achieve efficiency by providing sufficiently strong compensation
for output. The marginal condition is


                 •'R        f'C Q R
            ELc        —                       -
                                               U



                                                   17
or


       EE($ —
                 oQ oK
                         =0

Define the random variable z as


           4Q      e*Q
       z = aK.     oK.



z is a weight in the sense that its expected value is one.   Then

the marginal condition can be written as



        $(w,r) =
                   E(z-a)

The efficient amount of revenue per unit of output is the
weighted expectation of marginal cost.     Roughly speaking, unit
revenue should be long—run average cost.     The roughness comes
from the treatment of uncertainty——the weighted average of
marginal cost takes exact account of the cost of meeting the
producer's commitment to meet variable demand.   If the notion of

long—run average cost is modified to take account o-f the cost of

the variability, then the principle of setting short—run unit
revenue equal to long—run unit cost is an appropriate one.     In

the related context of peak—load pricing. Boiteux (1949) showed
that the average marginal cost should equai long—run unit cost.
The problem faced by the designers of contracts (or by the
regulator) is to find a way to give the producer long—run
marginal cost while at the same time charging the buyers short—

                                  18
run marginal cost.     When there are many buyers, a contract form
with precisely the right characteristics is    available, as the
next section will show.




4. Contracts to provide both output and capital efficiency


     The type of contract considered in this paper is most at
home when one producer sells to many buyers.      When the buyers
have the unilateral power to determine the quantities they take,
the producer need not be concerned with the circumstances of each
of the many purchasers.     Instead, the producer should offer a
standardized contract to each buyer.      This section shows that
such contracts can provide both output and    capital efficiency.
Key to the functioning of the contracts is the notion that each
buyer is small enough so that its purchases do not          affect
marginal cost. Efficiency is approximate in exactly the same way
that the efficiency of competitive equilibrium is   approximate—---
participants are unaware of their small amount of       monopsony
power. The standardized contract studied here has the form

       Rt   (qs,Q,K,w,r' = Aq1,Q,K,w,r) + ssBQ,K.w,r)
       with A C',ü,K,w,r) = C'.

Differences among customers are captured by the quantity they
purchase, q ,    and a scale variable, sj; in all other respects,
                                  19
al 1 customers have the same contract -          The scale var jab 1 es sum   to
unity: Es, =      1..    Linearity in the s means that the producer's

revenue is independent of the 5j             The approximate concept of
output efficiency is expressed in

     Definition.        A contract is output—efficient for a small
     purchaser if
        A(q,Q,K,w,r) =       qt
     That is, the purchaser pays marginal cost for q1, but the
     role of qi in total output, Q, is ignored.




     This definition saves some tedious arguments later, none of
which is a departure from the same development of the efficiency

of competitive equilibrium.
     Output efficiency restricts the form of the standardized
contract:



     Theorem 5.         A standardized contract is output—efficient for

     a small purchaser if and only if it can be written in the
     form

        A(q± ,D,F(,w,r)       s18(Q,K,w,r)   =

                                 — s±o)-,g       s1RUJ,K,w,r)
        R is an unrestricted function.



                                     20
Output efficiency requires that the payment made by a single
purchaser be a linear function of the quantity purchased.                The

coefficient of       qi must be marginal cost.              Again,   output
efficiency calls for marginal—cost pricing..
       In the standardized contract,            each purchaser makes a
payment, ssR(Q,K,w,r), independent of the quantity it purchases.
It makes a further payment to the extent its purchase, qj
exceeds its prescribed share of total output, 5j0.                   Output
efficiency requires that the payment for the extra output be at
marginal cost, and also that the purchaser earn a reward at
marginal cost for taking less than its share.

      So much for output efficiency.          Capital efficiency involves
the   total revenue of the producer,

          :[qj —              +   sRJ = R(Q,K.w,r.   -




Thus, the standardized contract imposes no restrictions at all on
the revenue received by the producer.                    Any function,    R,

satisfying the criterion for capital efficiency,


               'R
                    —cC,
                     0)
                         :0
                         :L
                                  + L'R
                                    —3 = u
                                         -




can   be inserted into the standardizea contract to make it
simultaneously output— and capital—efficient.


                                        21
     How does the standardized contract for multiple purchasers

accomplish its goal?         In effect, charging a purchaser only for
the departure of its purchase from its share of total output
makes the N—i other purchasers function as a third party to the
contract between the purchaser and the seller.        When demand is
strong, customers face high prices in the allocational sense, but
the revenue from those high prices flows to the customers as a
group, not to the producer.         In this way, the producer does not
face the incentive to create chronic shortages by investing in
too little capital.         Lorne Carmichael (1983) has suggested a
parallel contract in the labor market, where the other employees
in a firm function as the third party in the contract between the

firm and one employee.         The potential role of third parties in
efficient     contracts has been explored extensively in           the

literature on incentive compatibility; see Green and Laffont
(1977) for a general discussion.

     As section 3 of the paper concluded, many different revenue
formulas R(Q,K,w,r) can assure capital efficiency.       But constant
unit revenue,


          R(Q,K,w,r) =   G!t(w,r)


is a natural and realistic choice.         The standardized contract
becomes
           (qa —         + saQf(w,r)



In words, the purchaser and the producer agree on a normal share
of total output.        If the purchaser elects to take exactly its
normal share, it pays long—run unit cost.             Departures from the
normal share are priced at current marginal cost.           Total revenue
from all customers is long—run unit cost times output, and is
independent of the capital stock.
     I     am unaware of any practical examples of contracts with
exactly these provisions,         though   I     would be grateful for
suggestions from readers on this point.           Formal contingencies on
realized marginal cost are tricky, because customers may not be
able to verify capacity utilization rates.           It seems to me that
the basic lesson from this investigation is the importance of
stabilizing the revenue of the firm in the appropriate way
against tight conditions.       The customer must be assured that the
firm cant profit by underinvesting.             The allocation of output
when demand is strong is a subsidiary issue, and not necessarily
one that must be handled by explicit marginal—cost pricing.           As
Dennis Carlton (1978) has noted, suppliers in intermediate—
product markets are often deeply involved in deciding UPOfl          the
quantity    of output   to be delivered.       Output is allocated among
customerE when supplies are short, not soid to the highest
bidder.

     Stabilizing    unit revenue is not the only way to provide the
right investment incentives to the firm.   Total revenue could be

made independent of the level of output and positively related to
the amount of capital. But then the "price"——unit revenue of the
firm——would be negatively related to output. Though the evidence
strongly favors stable unit revenue over marginal cost, it does
not go so far as to suggest declining unit revenue in good times.

To put it another way, profits do decline in recessions, though
not by as much as theywould with marginal—cost pricing.




                               24
5. Macroeconomic implications and conclusions



     If contracts achieve output efficiency, then the price
rigidity   they      induce is not a direct source         of   macro

disequilibrium.      In effect, output efficiency says the level of
output is at the intersection of the implicit supply and demand
curves for output.     In this respect, the study of contracts in
product markets reaches the same conclusion as the closely
related study of contracts in labor markets——there are good
reasons -for the parties to stabilize the flow of payments from
one party to the other, but no reason to expect disequilibrium or

inefficiency just because the flow is stabilized.           There is
little doubt that disequilibrium is a major feature of the
economy, but no reason to think that the price and wage rigidity
associated with long—term contracts is a direct contributor to

disequilibrium.
     It is probably reasonable to interpret most government price
indexes as measures of the unit revenue of producers.      If so, the

revenue stabilization property of a contract that yields capital
efficiency has important implications about the information
conveyed by the price indexes.        In general. unit revenue cannot
be an indicator of marginal cost or of the relation between
outpLlt and capital.    In particular, if unit revenue is typically

held perfectly stable, relative to input costs, then price
indexes are deprived of much of their value in signalling the

                                 25
current state of the economy.

     If prices tracked marginal cost,       and so fell during
recessions and rose during booms, they would convey information
in a highly usable way to agents elsewhere in the economy.   For

example, labor contracts are often contingent on prices, but the
unresponsiveness of prices over the business cycle prevents the
contingency from offsetting the parallel shifts in the demand for
labor.   Employment fluctuations might well be smaller (and more
efficient) if prices were closer to marginal cost..      In this
respect, the need to stabilize revenue to provide the correct
incentives for investcent may indirectly contribute to macro
disequilibrium as a byproduct.
     Even in product markets, the stabilization of unit revenue
in a transaction at an early stage of production may introduce
problems at later stages.        If the published price of a raw
material is actually stabilized unit revenue, then the contract
between a producer of a product for which the raw material is an
input and a downstream purchaser cannot be made appropriately
contingent on marginal cost.

Appendix. Proofs of theorems.



Theorems 1 and 2 follow immediately from                           the   assumptions a-f
strict concavity, differentiability, and saturation.


Theorem 3.        A contract with revenue formula R(Q,K,w,r) provides

capital efficiency only if


                  'Q
                        —             +
                                          ,K       =0
         Cx u}              ,Q cIc.




Further, if a formula satisfies this condition for u=1 and all w
and r, it satisfies it for all u, w, and r.



Proof:

The   first—order condition -for maximum profit is

                  R -&C Q+ 'KR C               —        — r] = 0
         (Xi u)

At the efficient capital stock,

             E(—---— ri = 0
         Cx :u   IC.




so,   at the efficient stock with the first—order condition
satisfied as well,

                          'C eQ     eR
             EL (—
                  •'R
                        - —) -- + ---)
                          w Cr'.    Cr = (_)             -
         (Xi u}

                                                   29
Next, let 71 be expected profit:


                 n   (K,u,w,r) = EER(Q.K,w,r)              —   C(q,K,w) — rK]

The     next step is to show that r is homogeneous of degree zero in
K and u, that is,

                 7T(K,u.w,r) =           un(K/u,1,w,r)
Now,

            r =      S   CR (0 (K,w,x ) ,K,w,r) — C (0 (K,w,x ,Ic:,w) —        rK]g (x/u)    /u du


Let    x' = x/u.            Then

             =       CR (0   K,w,ux ) ,K,w,r) — C (0           (K,w,ux   ) ,K,w) — rK]g (x   ) dx



From the first—degree homogeneity of R in C! and K, and the first-
degree homogeneity of C in 0 and K,

        =   uJCR(0'K/u,w,x          ')   ,K:/u,w,r)   —   C(0(K/u,w,x ') ,K/u,w) — rK/u]g(x ')dx
                 =       urr(KIu,1,w,r)
as asserted.
        The maximizing K plainly has the form

                 K(u,w,r) =        uk(w,r)        -


Then     the zero—degree homogeneity of o/c'K implies that if it
equals zero at the efficient K for u1, it equals zero at the
efficient f:: for any value of u




                                                  30
Theorem 4.          Under marginal—cost pricing, expected profit is a
strictly decreasing function of the capital stock, at the
efficient capital stock.

Proof:

        Let p be the marginal—cost price:


             p(Ic.,w,x) = 'C(Q(K,w,x) ,}<,w)


Then expected profit is


              (I<:,u,w,r. = EEp   (Kw,x ) 0 (K,w,x ) — C (0,K,w) — rK)


The derivative of expected profit with respect to K is

                =
                    EEQ:; + (p
                                  -        -    - r]

The middle term vanishes because p =           .t      the efficient K,

            E( — r)       = U



Thus,

                =



It   remains to show that a larger capital stock always brings a
lower price:



                                      31
                     <.           -


Now

From constant returns,                              > 0 and a2C       < 0. The next step is to
look at the sign of                               For each i, output efficiency requires


               èVt(q (K,w,x) ,Xs)                     = p(K,w,x)
               cqs

contradiction.                  Therefore              < 0..      Finally, as a result,            0,

as asserted.

Integrate     over qj to get


              A(q,Q,K,w,r) =      qs-

The constant of integration is zero because the standardized
contract requires A(O,Q,K,w,r) = 0.                  Thus the output—efficient
contract has the form,


                    ÷ ssBQ.K,w,r)


Let
       R(O.,K,w,r) = B(Q,K,w,r) +


Then


                 + sB(Q,K,w,r) =
                 qs- s1LR(O,K,w,r) —        =

                 (qs —      + sR(O,K,w,r)

as asserted.
