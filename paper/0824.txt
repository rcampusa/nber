                   Inflation and the Valuation of Corporate Equities



                                       ABSTRACT



      This paper examines the relationship between inflation and the return
 on individual corporate securities. This question is of substantial im—
 portance in light of the puzzling behavior of the stock market over the
 last decade. Conventional financial theory holds that equity should be a
good inflation hedge since it represents a claim of real rather than nominal
assets. Yet a negative relationship between both expected and unexpected
inflation and stock market returns has been widely documented. This re-
lationship, which appears to antedate the surge in inflation over the last
15 years. might provide an explanation for the market's surprising recent
performance.

     This paper studies differences across firms in the response of stock
market values to changes in expected inflation in an effort to explore the
reasons for the aggregate negative relationship between inflation and stock
market values. Two opposing hypotheses about the impact of inflation on
market valuation are contrasted. The "inflation illusion" hypothesis holds
that investors are not able to see through nominal accounting statements
and respond to reported rather than real profits. The opposing "tax effects"
hypothesis holds that firms which report spuriously high profits due to
inflation are penalized because the extra tax burden incurred reduces real
profits.

     The results from the l970's strongly bear out the predictions of the
tax effects hypothesis. Aggregate calculations suggest that the interaction
of inflation and taxation can account for a large part of the decline in
the stock market which has been observed over the past decade. A significant
part of the remainder appears to be due to increasing investor awareness
of the   need to adjust for historic cost depreciation.

      This paper examines the relationship between inflation and the

 return on individual corporate securities. This question is of substantial

 importance in light of the puzzling behavior of the stock market over the

 last decade. Investors in the stock market have received a negative real

rate of return over the last 15 years. Over the last decade the value

of the q ratio of the market value of the corporate capital stock

to its replacement cost has declined from 1.05 to .561. The evident

low and declining market valuation of corporate capital in the face of

high inflation has important implications for economic performance and

poses a serious challenge to reigning theories of market efficiency.

     Conventional financial theory holds that equity should be a good inflation

hedge since it represents a claim on real rather than nominal assets.

To the extent that firms are net debtors, real equity values should be

increased by unexpected inflation. Yet a negative relationship between

both expected and unexpected inflation and stock market returns has been

widely documented. This relationship, which appears to antedate the

surge in inflation over the last 15 years, might provide an explanation

for the market's surprising recent performance.

     The apparently anomalous relationship between inflation and market

valuation may cast doubt on the widely accepted hypothesis of market

efficiency. Certainly the recent performance of the stock market raises the

possibility that stock prices may not be rationally related to underlying

economic realities. Shoven, Brainard and Weiss (1980) find the decline

in the market valuation of corporate capital inexplicable on the

and stock market returns include Bodie (1976), Fama and Schwert (1977),

basis of changes in expected future profitability, real interest rates,

or risk premia. Modigliani and Cohn (1979) suggest that the market valua-

tions of corporate capital reflect a systematic confusion of real and

nominal interest rates. Shiller (1980), on the basis of volatility

considerations is also led to doubt the rationality of market valuations.

     This paper studies differences across firms in the response of

stock market values to changes in expected inflation in an effort to

explore the reasons for the aggregate negative relationship between

inflation and stock market values. Two opposing hypotheses about the

impact of inflation on market valuation are contrasted. The "inflation

illusiont' hypothesis holds that investors are not able to see through

nominal accounting statements and respond to reported rathet than

real profits. It implies that by choosing accounting methods such as

FIFO inventory valuation which raise reported profits, in the presence

of inflation with no impact on real economic income firms can increase

their market value. The alleged failure of investors to recognize that

only real, not nominal, interest payments should be treated as costs in

computing profits is a lynchpin of the Modigliani—Cohn hypothesis.

     The opposing "tax effects" hypothesis advanced by Feldstein

(1979, 1980) and Summers (1981) holds that firms which report spuri-

ously high profits due to inflation are penalized because the extra

tax burden incurred reduces real profits. As Feldstein and Summers

(1979). discuss, the effective tax rate on real corporate capital income

is very sensitive to the rate of inflation. The "tax effects" hypothesis

xp1ains the recent decline in the market in terms of the extra tax

burden caused by historic cost depreciation and FIFO inventory accounting.
                                  —3—


      These two hypotheses offer opposing predictions as to the charac-

 teristics of firms which benefit from increases in the expected rate of

 inflation. For example, the inflation illusion hypothesis would predict

 that unlevered firms using FIFO inventory accounting, and having substantial

depreciation allowances would benefit relative to other firms since their

relative reported profits would increase. The tttax effects

hypothesis has the opposite implication since these firms would have

the greatest increase in their real tax burdens arising from inflation.

Since firms differ widely in their depreciation practices, methods of

inventory accounting, and leverage, the elements of truth in these two

hypotheses can be examined. These differences in firm characteristics

are the basis for the empirical work reported here. The econometric tests

are based on data on 1200 firms over a 15 year period.

     The results from the 1970? 5 strongly bear out the predictions of

the tax effects hypothesis. Aggregate calculations suggest that the inter-

action of inflation and taxation can account for a large part of the decline

in the stock market which has been observed over the past decade. A sig-

nificant part of the remainder appears to be due to increasing investor

awareness of the need to adjust for historic cost depreciation.

     Section I of this paper outlines the theory of market valuation and firm

behavior which provides the basis of the empirical tests arid develops the impli-

cations of the competing hypotheses. Section II discusses the construction of

the variables and econometric methods used in the empirical work.

The third section presents the empirical results and some further tests.

The fourth section of the paper relates the results to the problem of

explaining aggregate movements in the stock market. A final section

summarizes the results and suggests directions for future research.

I. Inflation and Stock Market Valuation

    This section outlines the theory of market valuation underlying the

empirical tests in this paper. A central issue in modelling the market

valuation of firms is the choice between a model which values firms

only on the basis of their current assets, and one which assumes that

market value of firms at a point in time includes the market's valuation

of future investment opportunities. The former view is appropriate only

if it is assumed that firms expect to earn no inframarginal returns on

future investments. The large marginal adjustment costs found in Summers

(1981) suggest that in fact firms do earn substantial inframarginal

returns. This inference is supported by the substantial fraction of

the variance in market returns which is due to fluctuations in the

qratio. For these reasons, in what follows, it is assumed that firms

are valued as going concerns. That is, it is assumed that firms are

committed to find future investment plans, and that changes in the

expected return on these investments are incorporated in current market
             2
valuations

     The simplest valuation model in which stock market prices depend

on the present value of future expected real dividends is postulated.

That is:




2ldeally, it would be desirable to recognize that future investment
 plans respond to the same developments which influence current market
 valuation. This makes it impossible to obtain analytical expressions
 for the change in market value occurring due to inflation. I discuss
 the simultaneous determination of investment and market valuation in
 more detail in Summers (1981). The envelope theorem insures that for
 small changes in the rate of inflation the assumptions made here will
 not introduce error.

 Where     .    is   the appropriate discount for firm i given its risk charac-

 teristics,3 and V1 is the total value of the firm.

      It       is assumed that firms are expected to grow at rate g, and to

 finance a constant fraction (1 —                b) of new investment out of retained
 earnings with the remainder financed out of debt issues.                     These assumptions
 about financial policy are satisfactory for the issues considered here.

 New share issues are a negligible source of finance for the large unregulated

 corporations which comprise the sample. While inflation may induce some

 increase in debt equity ratios, as argued by Gordon (1980), the envelope

 theorem suggests that omitting this effect should not distort the results.

Recognizing that retentions and dividends exhaust after tax profits, it

follows that:



                                                       —

where t is represents the expectation at time t of the profits of firm i

at the time s, and K represents the current replacement cost of the capital

stock and b the fraction of new investment financed
                                                                        using debt. Equation (2)
is the familiar statement that the market valuation of a firm represents

the present value of expected future profits less adjustments to avoid double

counting retentions.

                                                                    firms
 personal taxes are neglected here. As discussed below, taking account
 of personal taxation would not change the substantive results. The
 assumption of a constant real discount rate p is made for simplicity
 and could easily be relaxed.

        Equation (2) provides a basis for examining the impact of changes

in the expected rate of inflation on security returns. The one period

holding return on a share of stock is the sum of the dividend yield

and capital gain. That is:

                   R.t =   Div. + V1 — Vj                             (3)
                           V.it    V.


since   the assumption that the number of shares outstanding is constant

insures that total market valuation is proportional to the price of

an individual share of stock. Equations (2) and (3) imply that the

ex—post real return on a security is given by:4

                                                   e
                   R.
                    it
                       =p+E ( t+lp.eis    —
                                              t   p.)
                                                  is
                          st       (1 + p)S
                                                                      (4)


Equation    (4) implies that the return on a security has two components,

the required expected rate of return which equals the discount rate p,

and a second term reflecting news which leads to the revision of expec-

tations about future profits.

     It is clear from equation (4) that inflation can affect security

returns only by causing revisions in expectations of future profitabi-

lity.5 Shareowners will earn the required rate of return p unless new

information arrives which leads to revisions of expectations. Firms


4Note that at time t + 1, profits at time t are known with certainty,
 so the superscript is superfluous for s = 0.

5This statement is true for the model used here. Inflation might also
 affect security returns by causing changes in p. Since the focus of
 this study is on cross—sectional differences in the relation of irifla—
 don to security returns, this issue is not discussed here. The possi-
 bility that inflation affects required returns is recognized in the
 empirical work reported below.
                                       —7—.




 whose profits differ in their sensitivity to inflation should differ

 systematically in their response to changes in the expected rate of

 inflation, but when expected inflation is constant their returns should

 be independent of its level. This important distinction is neglected

 in many earlier studies of the relationship between inflation and stock

 prices. Kessel (1956), Aichian and Kessel (1960) and Hong (1977) all

 provide tests of the "debtor—creditor" hypothesis based on comparisons

 of the performance of high and low debt firms in periods of high and

 low inflation. Unless the inflation is unexpected, any advantages or

disadvantages of leverage should be capitalized into stock prices so

differences in leverage should not affect the rate of return on securi-

ties.

        French, Ruback and Schwert (1980) make a similar point and focus on

unexpected inflation in studying the impact of inflation on cross—sectional

variations in security returns. The theory developed here suggests that

security returns should depend on revisions of expectations about the

entire future path of inflation rather than on unexpected inflation in the

current period. It is easy to imagine circumstances where these concepts

would differ substantially. Consider for example, an announcement of a

shift towards a more expansionary monetary policy. This would have little

effect on the contemporaneous rate of inflation, but a potentially large

effect on expected future rates of inflation. Only under very restrictive

conditions will unexpected inflation be a satisfactory proxy for the revision

in long run inflationary expectations.

     Inflation may affect expected future profits in at least three

ways, through its impact on expectations about the level of economic
                                     —8--




activity, its impact on the taxes paid by firms with given real pre—tax profits,

 and its"inflation illusion" impact on investors' expectations

about future profitability. Since this study focuses on differences

between firms, it focuses on the last two of these effects. Both

relate to the differences between real and reported taxable profits

in the presence of inflation. The relationships may be clarified by

the following identities. Letting           represent real pre—tax profits

and Aj the measurement error in profits due to inflation it follows

that real after—tax profits are given by:6

           (1 —
                  T)(P.t   + A.) —   = (1    —
                                                 T)P.t
                                                         —
                                                             TA.t

If we assume that investors misperceive a fraction P of the inflation

error as real profits, perceived real profits are given by:

         = (1 —           — (-r —                                   (6)
                  T)P.t
If investors fully perceive inflation's effects, p = 0 and this

expression reduces to (5). The effect of inflation on perceived profits

thus depends on the sign of the inflation adjustment At and on the

term (T — 11) reflecting the difference between the tax and misperception

effects. Notice that it is possible that the extra taxes firms pay on

phantom inflation profits are exactly offset by the extra illusory

profits the market perceives. In this case, where p = T the size of

the inflation adjustment has no impact on perceived real profits.




  should be thought of as representing the cumulative effect of
historic cost depreciation, FIFO inventory accounting and the effects
of leverage. These separate components are analyzed below.

 Combining equations (4) and (6) yields an expression for the impact

 of changes in the expected rate of inflation on security returns:

                                          dA.
                                      (         is)

 where it has been assumed that inflation has no affect on real pre—tax

 profitability. This assumption is relaxed in the empirical work

 reported below. Assuming, as will be justified below, that A is pro-

portional to invested capital yields the more easily interpreted

expression:

     dRit =                    (dAft)
     dire                       ull

                           (p    —




     The three major interactions between inflation and
                                                        reported profits
considered here arise from historic cost depreciation accounting, FIFO

inventory accounting, and nominal accounting for net financial liabili-

ties. Because firms differ substantially in the sensitivity of their

reported or taxable profits to these accounting conventions, theory

suggests that the response of market prices to movements in the expected

rate of inflation should also vary. Expressions are derived below which

relate the firm's response to changes in inflation to measurable firm

characteristics.   Because the original motivation for this study was an

effort to understand the relationship between inflation and movements

in aggregate market valuation, the aggregate impact of each of these

adjustments is also considered. Throughout it is assumed that inflation

is. balanced so that firms realize no real capital gains on their physical
                                   —10—




assets and that the pre—tax rate of profit is constant. The possibi-

lity that the adjustments to profits may be perceived to differing

extents is recognized by allowing for a different value of i   for
differing inflation adjustments.


FIFO Inventory Accounting

     American firms are permitted wide latitude in choosing methods of

inventory accounting but are required to use the same methods for both

reporting and tax purposes. Two methods, FIFO and LIFO, are in common

use. Firms using the former method will show and be taxed on illusory

inflation profits whenever prices rise, because the appreciation in

the nominal value of their inventories will show up as income, due to

the understatement of costs of goods sold. Despite the apparent tax

advantage to LIFO approximately 60 percent of US non—financial corpora-

tions, with almost half of all inventories, continue to use FIFO inventory

accounting. The Department of Commerce estimates that false inventory

profits totaled over $40 billion in 1979. and in 1980. In 1980 the

voluntary overstatement of inventory profits raised taxes by about 18

billion, compared to total corporate profits taxes of 61 billion.

The persistence of FIFO inventory accounting, given the substantial

increase in effective tax rates which it causes) is of course a major

puzzle. Possible explanations include executive compensation schemes

based on reported profits, or the perception on the part of managers that

shareholders and potential creditors can be "fooled" by higher reported

profits.

     The appropriate adjustment to reported profits for phantom inventory

profits is:
                                               —11—




         A1 =   rr    FIFO   INV                      (9)


 where FIFO represents the fraction of a firm's inventories which are

 treated using FIFO accounting' and INV is the replacement cost of

 inventories. If a firm uses FIFO accounting for all its inventories,

 the replacement cost equals the book value. For simplicity, it is assumed

 that firms which are currently FIFO have a constant annual probability A

 of switching to LIFO, so equation (9) in conjunction with (8) implies

 that:


                     _FIFO
    (dR.) =
                             :ENV .   (T   —

    \de     INV
                             (p- g + A) v.it

where the subscript on the derivative indicates that it refers   to the

partial effect of inflation assuming no effects other than those on inventories.
Historic Cost Depreciation

     For both book and tax purposes, firms calculate deprecation on

a historic cost basis. That is, each year they deduct a fraction of each

asset's original acquisition cost rather than its replacement cost.

This can dramatically understate true depreciation based on replace-

ment cost. Feldstein and Summers (1979) estimate that replacement cost

depreciation exceeded book depreciation by $39.7 billion for the non-

financial corporate sector in 1977. The understatement had risen to $50

billion by 1980. The understatement of depreciation due to historic cost

accounting depends on past as well as contemporaneous inflation, since

it is the difference between the current price level and the price level

at the time of acquisition. The adjustment to profits due to historic cost

7mis calculation has a small approximation error because it implicitly assumes
 that inventories turnover very quickly. A detailed discussion of the adjust-
 ment of reported profits for the effects of inflation may be found in Shoven
 and Bulow (1976).
                                          —12—




depreciation can be approximated if it is assumed that depreciation is

exponential and the rate of inflation has been approximately constant.

That is:

               =   (KR   — KR)     KH( Tr )   = DEP   •.   Tr'        (11)
          EP
                                      g ++P g    ++
where KH is the book value of the capital stock, KR is its replacement

cost,      its rate of depreciation and DEP the value of current deprecia-

tion allowances.8 The change in the present value of future inflation

adjustments from a change in the expected rate of inflation may be

derived as follows.

        The present value of future depreciation allowances may be written

      This discussion has so far assumed that tax and reported deprecia-

 tion are equal and calculated exponentially. In fact many firms report

 depreciation on a straight line basis, but take exponential depreciation

 for tax purposes. While this would necessitate altering (14), if TIDE?     0,

 it does not appear that the difference is quantitatively important.


      Firm leverage. The third adjustment to reported profits is for

the effect of inflation on nominal financial assets and liabilities of

the firm. Firms that are net debtors will underestimate their profits

in the presence of inflation. The appropriate interest deduction in

calculating profits includes only the real component of interest rates.

Feldstein, Poterba and Dicks—Mireaux (1981) estimate that in aggregate non-

financial corporations realized a gain of $74 billion on their net finan-

cial liabilities in 1979. The adjustment for the extra deduction of

nominal interest payments is given by;

                    ADEBT =   • DEBT                      (15)


where DEBT represents the market value of the firm's outstanding net

financial liabilities.

     The impact of a change in the expected rate of inflation on expected

future profitahility depends on the response of interest rates to such

changes in expected inflation. This issue is examined in Summers (l98Lb).

Here it is assumed that a one point increase in the expected rate of

of inflation raises nominal interest rates by r points. It is probably
                                         —14—



reasonable to suppose that r.        1 during the recent period. The impact

of a change in the expected rate of inflation on security returns

operating through this effect is given by:

     There is a second correction which must be made to reflect the

effects of changes in the rate of inflation on the market value of long

term debt. An increase in the long run expected rate of inflation wiii lead

to an upwards movement in long—term interest rates, causing firms to

realize a capital gain on their existing debt. Unlike the other

adjustments to profits which depend on the level of inflation, this one

depends only on its rate of change. Its impact on security returns is

given by:


                       LTDEBT(1 — e_RT)(fl   .

     Since unrealized capital gains are not taxed, T does not appear

in (i7). The term (1 DEBTCG rather than DEBTCG enters because this

adjustment represents an addition to rather than a spurious component of

reported profits.

     The adjustments described here do not exhaust the ways in which

inflation causes real and reported profits to diverge. Firms have a

variety of nominal assets and liabilities which do not show up on the

standard balance sheet. These include long term leases, pension obliga-

tions and nominal labor contracts. These are all neglected because of
                                           —15—



  data limitations. It is hoped that these omissions will not badly

  bias the overall results though
                                        they may be of great importance in

  evaluating the experience of any individual firm.

       Before turning to the econometric
                                                    estimates, it is useful to examine the
  extent to which these factors can explain the observed negative relationship

 between stock market returns and changes in the expected rate of inflation.

 This can be done by estimating:

             e
                    dMi

 These variables can be calculated for the
                                                         non—financial corporate sector

 using data from the Federal Reserve Board's
                                                          National Balance Sheets and
 the National Income and Product Accounts.               The details of the calcula-
 tions are described in an appendix. Table
                                                         1 displays estimates of the
           under the assumptions that       =   0,   which corresponds to full rationa—

 lity on the part of investors, and to 31 =          1, which corresponds to complete
accounting illusion. The calculations are based
                                                               on equations (10), (14),
 (16) and (17). It is assumed
                                  throughout that p, the required real rate
of return1 is 10 percent, and that g, the expected rate of growth, is .03.

These figures are approximate averages of the historical experience. In

performing the calculations it is also assumed that inflation has no

effect on expectations about future tax law changes. Feldstein and

Summers (1980) show that this is reasonable given the timing of past

tax reform.                                     =
                  Finally, it is assumed            0,   so switchovers to LIFO are
not anticipated, and that fl =    1, so interest rates rise point for point
with changes in the expected rate of inflation.

      At the outset the approximate nature of the calculations in Table 1

 should be stressed. The exact figures are sensitive to the choice of p

 and g, and to the other assumptions made. The calculations do however

 suggest that if the assumption of rationality is maintained, inflation

 corporate tax interactions can explain a sizable fraction of the decline

 in the stock market during the last decade.   It is reasonable to suppose

 that the rate of expected long term inflation has risen by 7 points over

 this interval. This implies that about a 25 percent fall in the level of

the market relative to a normal rate of return would result from infla-

tion—tax interactions even if real pre—tax profits and required rates of

return were unaffected. In fact market returns during the 1965—1980 period

fell short of their long run average level by a total of almost 100 percentage points.

     The results in Table 1 also underscore thc poteitial importance of

irrationality if it exists. The market would rise by 4.73 percent for each

percent of expected inflation if investors responded only to reported profits

without regard to inflation adjustments. If as Nodigliani and Cohn suggest

investors do adjust reported profits for depreciation arid inventory accounting

effects but do not take account of the impact of nominal interest deductibi-

lity, then each 1 percent increase in the rate of expected long—term infla-

tion would reduce market value of 10.8 percent. None of these calculations

purport to examine all the channels through which inflation affects security

returns. Inflation will also affect expected future profitability, and the

required rate of return.

     Aggregate data are clearly not rich enough to identify the extent to

which the market recognizes the effects of inflation discussed here. Since

firms differ substantially in their leverage inventory accounting policies

and extents depreciation of cross—section data can shed light on the
                                    —18—



market's recogni-tion of inflation. Before turning to the econometric

 tests, it is useful to examine the extent of inter—firm variation in

 inflation susceptibility. Estimates of the impact of inflation on the

 security returns for the 30 Dow Jones companies under the assumptions of

complete rationality and full illusion are displayed in Table 2, along

with the components of the effects of inflation. The data underlying these

calculations are described in more detail in the succeeding section. They

 indicate that inflation adversely affects the market valuation of most

firms, if all the effects are perceived. The effect ranges up to 8.5

percent for United Technologies and 10.62 percent for Chrysler. These

calculations suggest that a percentage point change in the expected long

term rate of inflation would have reduced the Dow Jones Average by about

20 points in 1978. Some heavily levered companies such as Woolworth

actually are predicted to benefit from inflation. If investors do not

make appropriate adjustments, for inflation the market value of most firms

would be radically different from that derived with full adjustment, except

for those firms   which are highly levered and therefore benefit from inflation.
     Comparison of the first three columns indicates that the relative

magnitudes of the different inflation effects vary widely across firms.

Many of the Dow firms use LIFO, so that the inventory effect is zero, but this

effect is substantially negative for the remaining companies. The depre-

ciation effect is particularly important for large capital intensive

manufacturing concerns, such as the auto and steel companies. Leverage

also varies widely. Thus the data are likely to have significant power

in revealing differences in the extent to which the inflation adjustments

are recognized. The approach taken to this problem is described in the

next section.

11. Data and Methods


      The theory in the preceding section implies that the real return on

equity in the            firm should be a function of the change in the

expected long run rate of inflation. That is:


         it
      R. = a + 1         Ae   +   •it
where a is the required rate of return p and . measures              the sensitivity

of the valuation of security i to "inflation" news, and u. is a stocha-

stic error which reflects other "news" which has an impact on security i. The

discussion above suggests that                should be a function of the

characteristics of the firm. In particular, it is natural to postulate that:

                    +
                        y1D. +     2 DDEP +   (3   DDEBT + 14 DDEBTCG + Ei
                                                                              (19)

where the variables D1, DDEP. DDEBT, and DDEBTCG are specified so that
          =   (dR             and so forth.
11D
   INV        dr
      Combining expressions (19) and (20) leads to an equation which can
be estimated econometrically:

      R. = a +      e(        +
                                  y1D1   + I2DDEP+ V3 DDEBT+ 4DDEBTCG                  u1 (21)


Equation (21) is estimated using cross—section—rime series data on a large

sample of firms. The principal complication comes from the composite error

term in (21). It may not satisfy the necessary conditions for ordinary least

squares regression. If inflation news is correlated with other information

which affects security prices, u. will be correlated with zlre. It is also

likely that the required rate of return p. varies across firms. Inconsistent

estimates would result if these variations are correlated with the firm

    Construction    of the Variables

    Inflation Expectations

           Equation (18) is estimated using a sample of firms drawn from the 1979

    Compustat tapes for the period 1963—1978. There are two major data problems:

    the construction of measures of inflation expectations and the measurement

    of expected firm sensitivity to inflation. The issue of measuring inflationary

    expectations is taken up first. A discussion of the sample selection is

   presented after the construction of the firm—specific variables is described.

            A major problem in testing equation (18) is the development of mea-

   sures of the change in long term inflationary expectations. As noted above

   previous studies f inflation and security returns have used
                                                                    unexpected inflation
   as a proxy for the revision in inflationary expectations. This procedure

   does not avoid the need to specify a model of
                                                     inflationary expectations.
   It is very likely to substantially overstate the revision in long—term in-

   flation forecasts which actually takes place, since rational investors

   would expect the inflation rate to exhibit some tendency to return to its

   mean.

           In an effort to insure the robustness of the results, five alternative

  measures of the change in inflation expectations were used in the exnpiri—

   cJ. tests. All    are   based only on information available at the point when the

   ecpectation was to have been formed. This represents an
                                                               important improvement
  over previous empirical work. Most previous studies have estimated statis-

  tical models of inflation over the entire sample period and then used the

  residuals as estimates of unexpected inflation. This is inappropriate since

   it assumes that investors used subsequent information to estimate the stochastic
10 To see this consider the case where inflation has a univariate ARNA representation
   By construction the residuals will sum to zero. Since the revision in inflation
   expectations is proportional to unexpected inflation in this special case,
   the revisions over the sample period must also sum to zero.
                                             —21—



    characteristics which effect inflation sensitivity. A lesser problem is

    that the error term in (21) is not likely to be spherical because of year

    and firm effects as well as heteroscedasticity induced by the presence of
      e
    Mr

            Issues of efficiency are ignored because of the very large sample

    used in this study. Potential inconsistency is avoided by adopting a fixed

    effects formulation. That is, it is assumed that the composite error term

    in (21) may be approximated as:



                 i       it   1    t    it                                   (22)



          This       error term includes both year and firm effects. With this

    specification of the error term, (21) can be consistently estimated by

    adding period dummies to estimate the V, and taking deviations from firm

    means to eliminate nuisance parameters V.,. This aporoach which will

    generate consistent standard errors save for the effects of heteroscedasticity,

    is preferable to the GLS techniques becoming fashionable in financial eco—

    nonics because it allows for the possibility that the errors are correlated

    with the right hand side variables.9

          As is well known, fixed effects will reduce the efficiency of the

    estimates, if in fact the orthogonality of the residuals is satisfied.

    If any of the variables in (21) exhibits errors in variables, the use

    of fixed effects may exacerbate the bias. Therefore, estimated equations

    are reported below which do not make allowance for year and firm effects.

           In all the estimates reported in this paper, observations on each firm

   were weighted by the firm's mean real market value. This was done to make

    the data set more representative of the entire non—financial corporate

    sector and to reduce the weight placed on small firms with highly irregular

    returns.
9 Several studies including French Ruback and Schwert (1981) use e11ers' (1962)
  seemingly unrelated regression technique.

process followed by inflation. The importance of this issue may be high-

lighted by considering the recent American experience. Any model estimated

over the entire sample period will generate a mean unexpected inflation

of zero. Thus the standard procedure would deny a priori the possibility

that rising inflationary expectations over the sample period could account

for the low average return on the market.

     This point is reinforced by the results in Table 3, which displays esti-

mates of ARMA models for quarterly CPI inflation over various sample periods.

It is clear that investors' perception of the process generating inflation

should have changed markedly over the last 25 years. The mean decadal rates

of inflation which heavily influence the long term forecast have varied from

1.75 to 7.47 percent. The data reject the hypothesis that a common model

fits the 1960—70 period and 1970—80 period at the 5 percent confidence

level.

     The alternative measures of the revision in inflation expectations used

here are displayed in Table 4. The first series,          is based on the

"rolling ABMA"   procedure   described in Feldstein and Summers (1978). To

generate each year's observation, an ARMA (1,1) processwas fitted to the rate

of inflation as measured by the percentage change in the consumer price

index using quarterly data on the preceding 10 years. Data only on the

preceding 10 years rather than on the entire interval were used because of the

instability in the inflation process. The estimated process as of each date

is then used to forecast the rate of inflation for the succeeding 10 years.

The "permanent" inflation expectation is then taken to be the discounted

weighted average of these forecasts with a discount rate of 8 percent.

     The principal weakness of the ARNA   inflation   forecasts is the limited

information set which they employ. Market participants should base their

inflation expectations on more than the past history of prices. The second

measure of inflationary expectations is based on a rolling vector auto

regressive procedure as described in Sims (1980) and Litterman (1980). In-

flation forecasts were generated using a 4 variable system with the rate of money

growth, the treasury bill rate, and the growth rate of real output included

as well as the rate of inflation. Preliminary experimentation suggested that

the results were insensitive to the inclusion of additional variables.

Four lags on each variable were included. In order to insure "reasonable"

results a Bayesian procedure was used in the estimation as described in

Litterman (1980). Again inflation is estimated as a discounted weighted average

of forecasts for the succeeding 10 years.

     Much of the information which is used in forecasting inflation does not

show up in measurable time series. There is also the possibility that

the market does not forecast inflation in a statistically rational

way. An alternative measure of inflationary expectations         is based on the

Livingston survey of inflation expectations. Expected inflation is taken to be

the average of the annual CPI inflation forecasts made by a panel of forty

experts surveyed by Joseph Livingston of the Philadelphia Bulletin. The

series used is provided in Carison (1977) who discusses necessary adjustments

to the raw data.

     There is substantial controversy (Pesando (1975), Mullineaux (1978) and

Carlson (l977))over whether these forecasts satisfy rationality restrictions.

Even if they fail rationality tests, they may nonetheless be good indicators
                                      —27—



  of the changes in inflation expectations which actually guide market valuations.

  A significant limitation of these measures from the point of view of this

  study is that the inflation rate is forecast over only a one year horizon.

  There is an additional timing problem since the survey measures inflation

  expectations as of October rather than the end of the year.

       The last two measures of changes in the expected rate of inflation

  are based on movements in interest rates. Faxna (1975) has argued that

  movements in expected inflation account for a large fraction of the variance

  in short term interest rates. Summers (198lb) suggests that this conclusion

  is highly sensitive to the choice of a sample period. Nonetheless it may be

 reasonable to use changes in interest rates as indicators of changes in

 inflation expectations. Expectational theories of the term struc-

 ture imply that Fama's conclusion, if valid, should hold for long—term

 interest rates as well. The measure ire is based on the change in the

 one year treasury bill rate, while ire is based on the change in the BAA

 bond rate. The latter measure is probably preferable because of its longer

 horizon, though the relation between the short rate and expected inflation

 is much better documented. An additional virtue of the long term bond
 yield is that it should be
                              aligned closely with the rate at which firms
 discount nominal liabilities of the type under consideration here.

      The lower part of the table exhibits the correlation matrix
                                                                  of these
measures of the change in the level
                                      of expected inflation. The correlations
of the changes in the levels
                             are displayed above the principal diagonal
while the correlations between the levels are exhibited below
                                                              the diagonal.
The measures cohere fairly well. The pairwise
                                               correlations of the first
differences range from .913 between e and
                                                  to .271 between Arr and
      As one would expect the
                                correlations between the levels of the variables
are greater.

     In Table 5, these measures of the change in expected inflation are

related to real aggregate security returns. The relation,which is documented

more fully in Summers (1982), is strongly negative for all five measures.

The estimated impact of a one percentage point increase in long term expected

inflation ranges from a 2.1 percent decline in the market using Air to a

28 percent decline using ATr. These results are broadly consistent with

the calculations in the preceding section under the assumption of rationality.


 Firm Specific Variables

      Estimates of D1, DDEp DDEBT, DDEBTCGand R.t are derived from
 information on the 1979 Standard and Poor's Compustat Tape. The tape con-

 tains basic accounting information of some 2000 large industrial concerns

 for the past 20 years. Because of data limitations, the sample here was

 confined to the years 1963—78. All firms for which all the necessary in-

 formation was available were included in the sample, except those with

 suspected data errors. The final sample contained 13,584 observations. Be—

cause reporting of the necessary data coverage was greater in

 later than in earlier years, there are 1154 observations in the years

 1963—68, compared to 6378 in the 1969—73 period and 6053

 the 1974—78 period.9

      The sample appears to be fairly representative of the non—financial

 corporate sector as a whole. The principal difference is that utilities

 are excluded from consideration here. The correlation between the

mean return on firms in the sample and that on the market as a whole is



9There are fewer observations for the latest period because some of the
1978 data were not available when the tape was constructed.

very high. Moreover, as will be seen below, the mean estimates of the

inflation sensitivity variables correspond quite closely to those reported

 in Table 1.

        Compustat contains information on the number of common shares out-

standing and the price per share at the end of each year. The product

of these figures yields our measure of U. The real return R.t is calcu-

lated according to:

where St denotes the security's price at the end of year t, and Dive

and rr refer to totals during year t. The value of                           is taken to be the

December to December change in the CPI.

where      =           INV        .   The value of FIFO inventories is estimated as the
                      —g +
book value of inventories if the firm reports that any non—LIFO method of

accounting is its principal method. Otherwise, the value of FIFO inventories

is taken to be zero. This procedure is flawed because many firms account

for part of their inventories using each method. There is, however, little

alternative given the difficulty of valuing LIFO inventories.

 reported for accountingpurposes. While it would be preferable to use tax

  depreciation, this information is not available on the tape. The value of

    is estimated as the ratio of reported depreciation to gross plant and

  equipment. Gross plant and equipment is used because most firms report

 depreciation on a straight line basis. The value of                   is taken to be the

 average rate of inflation during the preceding 10 years. Expected inflation

 is measured using each of the five inflation expectations series reported above.

 Finally, p is taken to be .10 in forming DDEP. This estimate may be too high

 if investors recognize that future depreciation allowances have different

 risk characteristics than the remainder of a firm's cash flow. A zero

 or even a negative real rate might be appropriate in some situations as

 discussed in Bulow and Summers (1982). Because of this difficulty and

 the absence of data on tax depreciation any results regarding depreciation

 should be viewed with caution.

     There is little basis for gauging the maturity structure of outstanding

long term debt. The effective maturity, T, is reduced by the fact that

some apparently long term obligations have variable interest rates and almost

all corporate bonds are call protected. For the firms which report the in-

formation it appears that a substantial fraction of long term debt is payable

within five years. Therefore, in valuing the long term debt and calculating.

DEBTCG, a five year maturity is assumed. The value of r in (26) 9s also taken

to bc the end of year 3M bond yield.

     The firm's net indebtedness, DEBT in (25), is then calculated as the

sum of the market value of long term debt, current liabilities, and accounts

payable less financial assets and accounts receivable. This definition of

debt ignores at least three potentially important nominal obligations, long

term leases, pension liabilities, and long term labor contracts. The assets

in firm pension funds are also neglected. Bulow (1979) argues that these

far exceed liabilities when the latter are properly valued. The omissions

are necessary given data limitations. It is to be hoped that the omitted

variables are largely independent of the included ones. A very weak reed

of evidence in support of this view is the apparent difficulty investigators

(e.g. Friedman (1981)) have had in relating pension funding decisions to

fipi characteristics.

     Some characteristics of the sample are presented in Table 6. Several

features of the data warrant comment. Potentially the largest effect of

increases in the expected rate of inflation is due to the capital gains which firms

realize as the market value of their debt declines. The mean interest rate

over the sample period was about 8 percent. The mean of 953 of DDEBTCG

  implies an average ratio of long term debt to market value of equity of .23.

  This contrasts with the ratio of total net debt to equity of .094 implied by

  the mean of DDEBT. The sample mean is less than usual estimates of debt—

  equity ratios due to the exclusion of utilities from the saliple and the

  inclusion of trade credit as a financial asset. The mean       of .1339

 represents the mean ratio of FIFO inventories to equity. For the 82 percent

 of firms using FIFO, the mean ratio of inventories to equity was .169

 Finally, it is interesting to note that in this sample the potential effect

 of inflation on depreciation allowances exceeds its impact on inventories

 by a wide margin.

      The correlation matrix in the lower half of the table reveals that

 net debt, long term debt, and the value of the bonds represented by future

 depreciation allowances are quite highly correlated. This indicates that

 hedging against the losses incurred if inflation reduces real depreciation

 allowances may be an important consideration in leverage decisions. it

 implies that omitting depreciation allowances from consideration as has

 been done in some earlier studies may badly bias estimates of the effects

 of leverage. The presence of FIFO inventories appears to be only weakly

 associated with the other characteristics affecting the sensitivity of

 stock market returns to inflation.

     This discussion of the data has focused on the limitations of the

variables used here. While these dLfficulties suggest caution in inter-

preting the quantitative magnitude of the coefficients, the opposing

qualitative implications of the tax and illusion hypotheses implies that

   and    are negative, reflecting the impact of inflation on FIFO and

depreciation intensive firms, while      and   are positive, reflecting the

impact of inflation on firms' debt. The illusion view has exactly
                                                                    opposing
implications for the signs. These clear differences imply that data problems

should not preclude distinguishing the two hypotheses even if the extent of

inflation cannot be nreciselv estir'ted.

 III. Results

        The results of estimating (20) with various specific2tions of the

 error term and the five alternative measures of inflation expectations

 are presented in Table 7. The estimates of the parameters of central concern

 are very insensitive to the error specification, so only the equations

 estimated allowing for both year and fixed effects are discussed below.

 The results     are surprisingly insensitive to   the choise of the

proxy for inflationary expectations. In general, the results using

     and       are very similar, with somewhat deviant results obtained when

the interest rate variables        and 'Tr are used as proxies for expected

inflation.

        Because the coefficients are difficult to interpret, the values of the

i.   implied   by the first five equations in Table 7 are presented in Table 8.

The calculations assume that p=.l and y=.03. The arbitrariness of these

assumptions mean that the estimates of limust be treated with a great deal

of caution.

      The estimates of the effects of FIFO inventory accounting strongly

bear out the tax effects hypothesis. In all of the equations, the estimated

value           is negative, implying that FIFO firms suffer when the expected

inflation rate increases. In most cases the coefficient is highly statis-

tically significant. This finding contradicts the widespread view that it

is rational for firms to use FIFO accounting because it raises the market

value of their stock due to investor irrationality. Not only do investors

see through the phantom profits caused by FIFO accounting, but also they

recognize the extra tax liabilities which are generated.

    The values of INV in Table 8 suggest that the full effect of FIFO

accounting on subsequent tax liabilities is recognized by the market. The

average estimate of INV using the different inflation concepts is .017. This

calculation assumes that investers expect FIFO firms to continue to use

FIFO forever. If a switchover is expected to occur, so X>O, the results

imply that the market overdiscounts future tax liabilities. It should be

acknowledged that the estimated values of p vary quite widely depending

on the choice of inflation measure. The negative estimates of p may reflect

the choice of too high a discount rate, or the negative signal about manage—

ment quality provided by firms which stay with FIFO when the expected infla-

tion rate increases.

     These estimates are inconsistent with the same earlier work on accounting

changes and excess security returns which found that firms which switched

inventory accounting methods did not have abnormal returns. While these

results have been interpreted as implying market efficiency, in fact they

suggest the opposite given the presence of tax effects. The results here

indicate that firms which switch form FIFO to LIFO should realize large

 excess returns. Assuming an 8 percent expected inflation rate, and

assuming that investors are fully rational, FIFO firms with an in-

ventory to market value ratio of .25 would realize an excess return

of about 15 percent by switching to LIFO. The failure to find such excess

 returns in earlier studies may reflect anticipations of switchovers, or a

 tendency on the part of firms to change accounting methods in years when

 there is already adverse news about profits. When a variable reflecting

 switchovers was added to the equations reported here it had a consistent

 positive sign.
                                    —39—



      The estimates of     the coefficient of DDEP are anomalous, implying

 that investors fail to perceive the effect of inflation on future depre-

 ciation allowances. Firms which should be hurt flost by increases in expected

 inflation appear to benefit from them. The estimates of i   in   Table 8 suggest

 that investors perceive a little less than half of the correct adjustment

 to profits for the effects of historic cost depreciation. However, the

estimates vary greatly depending on the choice of inflation measure.

The equations estimated using the interest rates as inflationary expecta-

tion variables actually yield the predicted negative coefficients. This

may be because the market regards future tax shields as a nominal riskle.ss

bond and so discounts them at the nominal interest rate rather than at the

required return on equity. The equation estimated using the vector auto-

regressive inflation expectations implies that the market is wholly oblivious

to the effects of historic cost depreciation.

     It is difficult to explain the results obtained using the first three

inflation measures, in terms of rational behavior. No simple errors in

variables argument can account for the fact that the regression coefficients

have the unexpected sign. One tenuous possibility is that increases in

expected inflation are associated with expected tax relief in the form of

accelerated depreciation. This relief may actually be expected to exceed

the cost of inflation. Alternatively, it is conceivable that firms' other

unmeasurable net nominal assets are negatively correlated with the value of

their depreciation bond. The negative correlation of DDEP and DDEBT lends

some credance to this argument. It may be, however) that investors simply

fail to perceive the long run effects of historic cost depreciation. It is

plausible that perception of this inflation adjustment to profits would lag
                                   —40—


behind the others because, unlike the others, it depends on a long distribu-

ted lag of rates of inflation, and not just on the contemporaneous rate. This
view is strongly supported below.
     The estimates of     decisively contradict the Modigliani—Cohn hypothesis

that in Pstimating profitability the market confuses nominal and real interest

rates. The results are unaffected by the choice of expected inflation proxy.

In all cases, the estimate is positive and statitically significant, implying

that more highly levered firms bnef it from increases in expected infl.ition.

Presumably, this is because of the extra tax shields generated by the de-

ductibility of nominal interest payments. The coefficients are substantively

as well as statistically significant. Equation 7.1, for example, implies

that a firm with debt—equity ratio of .4 would gain 1.7 percent relative to

an unlevered firm from a one point increase in the expected rate of inflation.

      The estimates of DEBT in Table 8 all lie between .2 and .33, suggesting

that a small fraction of the effects of nominal interest deuctability

may not be perceived by the market. However, this suggestion is highly

speculative given the possible failure of the assumption that the Fisher effect

hrlds exactly for nominal interest rates, and the arbitrariness in the choice

of dis-'ount and growth rates. These results contradict those of French,

Ruhack and Schwert (1980) who could not find support for the debtor—creditor

hypothesis. This is probably due to the use here of changes in expected

inflation, rather than unexpected inflation, and differences in the sample

period studied. An additional possibility is the more satisfactory fixed effects

econometric technique used here.

     The estimates of Y, the effect nf long term   deht, ae ir'precise and very
mixed. Surprisingly, the resi,1ts are much more plausible when the variables

Tr, Tr, and Tr   are used than they are when interest rate are used to proxy

inflation expectations.

The estimates range from — .500 when       is used as an inflation proxy,

to 1.09 when 7T, the BAA bond yie1d is the proxy. The latter is the variable

which a priori should have been expected to be most closely associated with

capital gains on outstanding long term debt. The average value of
                                                                      MDEBTCG
is .394, suggesting some irrationality on the part of investors. Unlike.

the others, this estimate does not depend on the choice of a discount rate.

Apart from data problems, it may represent rational valuation, if firms

do not realize fair's by repurchasing outstanding debt and interest rates

display excess volatility.

     The robustness of these results was examined by esrimating alternative

specifications of (20). Taking account of personal tax effects by using

tax returns as the dependent variable had only a negligible impact on the

estimates. Efforts to use alternative specifications of the required rate

of return, allowing it to depend on the risk free rate as suggested by many

models of market equilibrium) also did not alter the results. Nor did

assuming that a firm's expected rate of return depended on characteristics,

such as its debt equity ratio and 3.       These

modifications to the specification have 1ittle effect because only a

negligibl fraction of the variance in ex—post returns is due to variations

in expected returns. The fact that allowing each firm to have its own

expected return had little effect on the results suggests that these results

are not sensitive to the modelling of expected returns.

    A potentially major qualification to these results is that inflation

"news" may be correlated with other news which effects market returns. For

example, Fama (1981) explains the negative correlation between market returns

and inflation in t-erms of a negative correlation between inflation and real

activity that affects profitability. This objection is probably not
                                        43—


  substantively important. The inclusion of year duuirnies in the equcions

  captures any sch aggregate news, so that the estimates do not suffer from

  this bias, except to the exter!t that inflation and tifir specific" news

  are correlated. This may be seen in a different way by recognizing that

 including year dummies, is equivalent to using the difference between firm

 and market returns as the dependent variable, and the difference between

 firm and average market characteristics as independent variables. The fart

 that this procedure has' so little effect on the results provides strong

 evidence that the estimates here really do capture the effects of changes

 in expected inflation.

      The stability of these estimates over time was also examined, As

 inflation has increased it is reasonable to conjecture that investors have

 become more aware of its distortionary effect
                                                 on reported profits. The
mean absolute revision in inflationary expectations was far greater in the

 latter half of the sample period than in the former, so that the payoff to

studying firm sensitivities to inflation increased substantially. There is

an econometric as well as an economic point at issue here. The greater

coherence of the inflation
                             measures, along with their greater size, during

the l970's suggests that the effects of inflation may be better estimated

during this period than during the entire sample period.

 the whole sample. In the case of                        the hypothesis of equality
                                     y, 13 and
 between the estimates for the 1963—71 period (not shown) and the 1972—78

 period cannot be rejected at the 5 percent level in any of the equations.

 This may be somewhat surprising for          since the likelihood of switchovers

 tc LIFO accounting would seem to have increased. There may he a mover—stayer

 problem here as the probability of switchover assigned to a given firm that

 stayed with FIFO though the inflation of the 1970's actually declined.

      The striking difference between the results for 1972—78 period is in

     the estimated depreciation effect. In four of the five equations,

 the coefficient has the expected
                                    negative sign. The hypothesis of equality
 of the coefficients during the early and later period is rejected at

 astronomical levels of significance in all five equations. When the

 sample period is cut further to the 1974—78 period, the estimated inflation

effect on depreciation is negative and significant in all five equations.

The mean estimate of      for the 1972—78 period is .277 for the 1972—78
period and .043 for the 1974—78 interval. Given the
                                                          many uncertainties in
the calculation these values seem consistent with the hypothesis that in the

market during the 1970's market valuations accurately reflected the joint

impact of inflation and taxes.

     It is natural to conjecture that the change in the estimated depre—

ciation effects reflects increasing market awareness of the need to adjust

for the effects of historic cost depreciation.
                                                     Recognition of this effect

may have lagged because of its importance before high rates of inflation

continued for several years. It is also the adjustment which is most

difficult to perform given only basic accounting data. Certainly, the

effects of historic depreciation received far more attention in the
                                 —46—



business press and among accountants during the 1970's than in the previout

period. An additional possibility is that the difference in results during

the 1970's is just a reflection of better inflation expectation measures.

     Taken together these results suggest that in the latter half of the

sample period tax effects far outweighed any effects of inflation illusion.

The data strongly support the three major implications of the tax effects

hypothesis, tha. inflation hurts FIFO firms which have little leverage and

large depreciation allowances relative to other firms. These findings

suggest that tax effects may account for a significant part of the nega-

tive relation between inflation and stock market returns and the consequent

poor performance of the market during the 1970's. Increasing perception

of the historic depreciation adjustment may also help to explain the

market's poor performance. These issues are examined in the next section.

 IV. Implications
      This section examines the extent to which tax and inflation illusion

 effects can account for the observed negative relationship between increases

 in expected inflation and security returns. It goes on to examine the

 possible relation between increasing awareness of the effects of inflation

 and poor market performance during the 1970's.

      Table 10 presents estimates of the effect of inflation on aggregate

 stock market returns based on the assumptions of full rationality,

and the estLuated values of the p variables in the preceding section.

 The aggregate estimates of D1, DDEP, DDEBT, and DDEGTCG are

described in the appendix. In all the calculations the tax rate t     is   taken

to equal .5. The results are mixed. While the "full rationality" prediction

is that each point of expected inflation should reduce stock marker reurns

by 3.46 percent, the prediction using the actual estimates of the perception

of inflation iz that market returns 'hould fall by .692 percent based on

the estimates for the ho!e sample and 2.04 per-ent based on the estimate

f or the 1972—78 period. Note that these estimates do not depend on the

assumptions about p and g underlying the calculations of p. The estimate

could be caluculated equiva1eotl from the raw regression coefficients and

the aggregate information.

     It seems fair to conclude that inflation—corporate tax effects can

account for some but not all of the negative relation between inflation and

stock market returns. Some of the remainder may be due to the taxation of

nominal rather than real capital gains at the personal level, These effects

are largely due to FIFO inventory accounting. The findings here imply that

Note: The estimates in the last two columns are based on the average
estimates of   presented in Tables 8 and 9. The estimates of aggregate
market inflation sensitivity are for the entire nonfinancial corporate
sector at the end of 1979. The calculations are described in the Appendix.

 the market valuation of the non—financial corporate sector would be about

 25 percent greater if this non—neutrality in the tax system were elimini—

 nated through tax reform or through firm    switchovers   to LIFO. This estimate may

 seem implausibly large. In 1979, however, extra taxes on FIFO inventories

 represented over one third of real after tax profits as measured in the

NIPA.

        The results suggest that leverage is of some significance in explaining

aggregate returns. The two effects of leverage, ceteris paribus, cause

each extra point of exneci-ed inflation to raise marker valuation by three

percent. This effect is likely to be much larger at present than previously

because of increasing debt—equity ratios. It calls into question one part

of the Modigliani—cohn valuation hypothesis,     However, their principal

argument that investors compare real returi-is on equity witi nominal bond

yields is not tested here.

     The difference between the estimates of inflation effects between the

two sample periods is almost entirely due to the change in the estimated

depreciation effect. This raises the possibility that part of the poor

performance of the market may have been due to increasing investor awareness

of the effects of historic cost depreciation. The data suggest that          fell

by at least .5 over the sample period. The average estimated value of

DP was .97 for the 1963—71 priod, .28 for the 1972—78 period, and .05

for the 1974—78 period. The effect of a change "            may be calculated
                                                     DEP
from equation (13). It is given by:

    dR.                   p
        it    =   p+S-I-ir )   DEP
                                                                      (27)
   di.iDEp        (p-g) (+p-hi°)
                                 —50—

 Under the assumptions made here, this exprescion equals 27.5. If the value of

 UDEP is conservatively estimated to have fallen by .5, about 14 percent of the declin€

 in market valuation may be traceable to this source. If the estimate here

 that DEP literally fell from 1 to 0 i.s accepted, learning about the effects

 of historic cost depvec4ati.on can account for a large fraction of the adverse

 market performance during the 1970's.

      The suggestion rhat inrresing awareness of th effects of historic

 cost depreciation cn explain a significant part of the stock market's

 decline contradicts traditional theories of market efficiency that preclude

 irrational valuations. 1t is,bowevex plausible that this sort of inefficiency

 could remain f or an extended period of tit'e. There is no way that a single

investor who recognizes an inflation accounting error inherent in market

valuations can arbitrage it away. Unless the sigt of future changes

in expected inflation is known in advance, there is no strategy with even

a positive expected value, If, as in the depreciation case, the market's

irrationality leads to overvaluat-lons, there is the additional difficulty of

constraints on short sales. A final barrier to the rapid removal of an

inefficiency of this type is the difficulty of knowing whether it exists.

In order to make money, an investor must know not only right valuation

rules, but also the one the market is using. For these reasons, along

with those addressed above, the learning hypothesis seems plausible.

     These results suggest that the joint effects of inflation and taxes,

along with increasing investor awareesc of the effects of inflation) can

account for some of the decline in real stock market prices during the

1970's. The mean real return on the sto'-lc market over the 1926—78 period

was 8.7 percent. The real return averaged —.001 percent over the 1970—78

period. The factors considered here can account for perhaps 40 percentage
                                 —51—


points of the 80 percentage point shortfall during the l97Os. The remainder

may be due to declining real pre—tax rates cf   profit,   increasing macro—

economic risk and other collateral effects of the supply shocks that

have buffetted the economy. These issues are explored in more detail

                                Appendix


     This appendix describes the basis for the aggregate estimates

reported in Table 1. The market value of equity at the end of 1979

was 952 billion dollars. The estimates in Feldstein,Poterba and Dicks—

Mireaux (1981) imply that T = .529.   The increment above the Federal

rate of .46 represents state and local taxes. The value of FIFO

inventories was estimated by dividing the IVA of $43 billion by the

8.1 percent inflation, as measured by the GNP deflator which prevailed

during the year. Total depreciation allowances for non—financial cor-

porations were $147.5 billion, which implies a 5 of .095 since non-

financial corporate equipment and structures totalled $1555 billion.

The value of ji was taken to be .064,the average inflation rate during

the preceding decade, while 11e was set at .08. Bulow and Shoven (1981)

estimate the market value of long term debt at $471 billion. The

average maturity of this debt is taken to be 5 years. These estimates

imply net indebtedness of corporations at $367 billion. These are all

the data necessary to use the formulae cited in the text.
