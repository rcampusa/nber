                                          ABSTRACT

It is unclear whether public sector teachers are under or overpaid relative to other occupations due
to lack of knowledge about teachers’ outside labor market options and other unobserved attributes
related to compensation. We estimate causal labor market returns to novice public teachers in
Colombia. Our approach takes advantage of a national, standardized, teacher-screening exam,
scores on which determine eligibility for public teaching jobs. We use four nationwide
administrative data sources in a regression discontinuity approach to show that applicants who
marginally pass the teacher screening test have greater annual earnings during the first three years
of tenure than applicants below the passing cutoff. The total earnings effect is a combination of
higher daily wages and greater labor supply, part of which is in outside, predominantly non-
teaching jobs for a substantial fraction of public teachers. For infra-marginal high-scoring
applicants, we show that being a public teacher in Colombia is as attractive, if not more, as for
those at the margin. On the whole, rather than a penalty, public teachers in Colombia across all
ability levels earn a substantial labor market premium early in their careers.

1    Introduction

In an effort to raise educational quality, countries around the world grapple

with the question of how to attract top talent into the teaching profession.

Initiatives often target teacher compensation, arguing that public teachers

are underpaid relative to similarly qualified professionals in other occupations

(e.g. Auguste, Kim and Miller, 2010; Mizala and Ñopo, 2016). It is unclear,

however, whether public sector teachers are under or overpaid, because we

generally lack knowledge on teachers’ outside labor market options, cognitive

ability, and other unobserved attributes related to compensation.

    In this paper we estimate causal labor market returns to novice public

sector teachers in Colombia. For mainly two reasons, Colombia provides

an exceptional setting to address this question. First, for recent applicants,

the Colombian government allocates public teaching jobs using scores on a

national, standardized, teacher-screening exam, which provides exogenous

variation in the probability of becoming a public sector teacher among ap-

plicants with marginal scores. Second, rich Colombian administrative data

sources enable us to create a new individual-level longitudinal dataset con-

taining information for all prospective teachers on their secondary graduation

exam and collegiate records, performance on the teacher screening test, and

labor market history two years prior and three years after they take the

screening test. These data, in particular, enable us to observe labor market

outcomes for public teachers in their public sector teaching job as well as in

any additional jobs they hold.

    Theoretically, if the test has screening value and is costly, it creates


                                       3
an entry-barrier effect that unambiguously results in higher average teacher

wages (Angrist and Guryan, 2007). It is theoretically ambiguous, however,

the extent to which the labor market returns to marginal applicants are

positive or negative and the extent to which we can extrapolate such causal

returns to infra-marginal applicants who score high on the screening test.

   Empirically we find that public sector teachers in Colombia earn a sub-

stantial earnings premium early in their careers. Applicants who marginally

pass the teacher screening test have annual earnings that are about 65 per-

cent greater during the first three years of tenure than earnings of applicants

just below the cutoff. Part of the premium is due to the fact that a significant

fraction of public sector teachers hold outside, predominantly non-teaching

jobs in the formal sector. As a result, relative to applicants who fail, ap-

plicants who pass the teacher screening test work more days per year and

have higher daily earnings. However, the earnings advantage from the second

job wanes after two years and by the third year of potential teacher tenure,

most of the earnings premium for marginal applicants is due entirely to their

primary public teaching job.

   To address the question of whether public teaching jobs are as attractive

for infra-marginal high scoring applicants as they are for marginal applicants

near the cutoff, we take advantage of the fact that conditioning on the large

set of baseline predictors in our data effectively eliminates the relationship

between teacher screening test scores as the running variable and applicants’

potential labor market earnings, thereby eliminating the only source of omit-

ted variables bias in discontinuity-based estimates (Angrist and Rokkanen,

2015). A propensity score stratification strategy based on this ignorability

                                       4
result suggests that, in both the main occupation and for all occupations,

the labor market premium for infra-marginal high-scoring public teachers is

greater than for teachers with marginal scores.

   While it is difficult to conclude with our available data whether the sub-

stantial premium earned by Colombian public teachers early in their careers

results in a better pool of teachers, some evidence suggests that it may not.

First, to the extent that the test is costly, some applicants will be discour-

aged from taking it. Therefore, applicants on the margin between public

teaching and an alternative occupation should be the highest-quality teach-

ers (Angrist and Guryan, 2007). Consistent with this theoretical prediction,

we find that relative to recent college graduates who take the teacher screen-

ing test, those who choose not to take it have higher college admission exam

scores and come from more socio-economically advantageous backgrounds,

both of which are strong predictors of student achievement and of teacher

value-added in the US (Clotfelter, Ladd and Vigdor, 2010).

   Second, economic theory highlights how effort depends on marginal in-

centives (e.g. Holmstrom and Milgrom 1991; Holmstrom 1999). After a short

probationary period, usually 6 months, most novice teachers in Colombia

receive tenure and are rarely dismissed. Teacher salaries are set using a se-

niority and education-based salary schedule, and are untied to performance.

The work conditions of public teachers make it plausible that, on the margin,

they will devote more effort to their outside, less secure, non-teaching job,

possibly at the expense of teaching.

   Third, evidence from other developing countries indicates considerable

misallocation of pay and productivity among public workers in general and

                                       5
teachers in particular. In Mexico, for instance, recent evidence shows that

raising public sector salaries improved applicant pool quality and motivation

but not necessarily job performance (Dal Bo et al, 2013). In Pakistan, reduc-

ing teacher pay by 35 percent had no adverse effect on teacher productivity,

as measured by test-score value added (Bau and Das, 2016). In Indonesia,

doubling teacher pay reduced the fraction of teachers holding outside jobs,

but did not affect teacher effort or student performance (de Ree et al., 2015).1

        The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 describes the struc-

ture of public teacher hiring in Colombia and the teacher screening test

reform introduced in 2004. Sections 3 and 4 describe the data and research

design. Section 5 presents our main findings. Section 6 discusses findings

from an analysis that extrapolates our results to candidates away from the

cutoff. Section 7 concludes.



2        Public teacher hiring in Colombia

Evidence suggests that it is difficult to identify effective teachers at the point

of hire: observable characteristics such as educational background are poor

predictors of performance on the job (Rockoff, Jacob, Kane, and Staiger,

2011).

        To improve the quality of the teaching force, countries around the world

have introduced licensure requirements for prospective teachers. In England,

for example, prospective teachers must pass the Teacher Training Agency
    1
    In England, on the other hand, recent evidence suggests that regions in which teachers
earn poorly relative to other occupations have lower student achievement than regions in
which teachers earn on par with other occupations (Britton and Propper, 2016).



                                            6
skills test to become public sector teachers (Wang et al., 2003). In the US,

more than 40 states require teachers to pass some sort of standardized cer-

tification test (Angrist and Guryan, 2007). Mexico and Peru use a national

test to screen all potential new teachers, similar to the one we use in this

study (Estrada, 2013).

      In 2002, the Colombian government modified the conditions that deter-

mine entry into the public teaching profession. This reform was undertaken

with the goal of raising entry standards for public sector teaching and making

the selection process more transparent and meritocratic. The new selection

rules went into effect in 2004 and only apply to applicants who wish to

become public teachers.

      Colombia’s Civil Service Commission manages the new recruitment pro-

cess.2 The new recruitment process consists of three stages. In the first

stage, aspiring teachers take a screening test; eligibility depends on the re-

sult of the test. To take the test applicants must pay a fee; in 2009, it was

25,000 Colombian pesos, or about US $13. Only applicants with scores on

the screening test at or above 60 points are eligible for public sector teaching

jobs. The 60-point cutoff is fixed ex-ante by the Ministry of Education.

      The teacher screening test assesses applicants’ cognitive ability (mathe-

matics, language and pedagogy), content knowledge (specific to the subject

matter the person wants to teach), and personality traits. The test has sub-

stantial power as a quality screen. In 2009—the test cohort we study—only

42 percent of applicants passed the test. Moreover, the probability of pass-
  2
    The Commission also manages recruitment and promotions for most other civil ser-
vants with the exception of military and police forces.




                                         7
ing the test is correlated with applicants’ outside options. Among recent

education college graduates who take the 2009 screening test, scores on the

test are positively correlated with earnings in the prior year.

    In the second stage of the teacher selection process, officials from the Na-

tional Public Service Commission interview applicants with scores above the

eligibility cutoff to verify applicant qualifications and degrees. At this sec-

ond stage the government disqualifies applicants who lack any pre-requisites,

such as having a Bachelor’s degree. Once the commission has determined

the pool of all eligible applicants, it generates a list ranking candidates by

test results. These rankings are generated one for each "Departamento" or

state in Colombia and for all large cities.3

    In the third stage, applicants choose their preferred vacancy. Selection

follows rank order: applicants with higher scores can choose vacancies first,

until all public sector teacher vacancies are assigned. Since the reform was

enacted there have been five teacher screening test administrations: 2004,

2005, 2006, 2009, 2013, 2015, and 2017. Owing data restrictions that are

explained in detail below, we focus on graduates who took the 2009 test.

The teacher screening test, as we show later in the paper, creates plausibly

exogenous variation in the probability of obtaining a permanent public sector

teaching position around the eligibility threshold.
    3
      Teachers apply to take the test in their preferred state or geographic location. Colom-
bia is divided into 32 "Departamentos" or states plus the capital city of Bogotá. The
Ministry of Education constructs local ranking lists by state and one for the capital dis-
trict, so that teachers can be assigned locally within these regions.

3     Data and Methods

3.1    Data

Our dataset combines information from four administrative sources. These

sources are merged using national identification information on names, dates

of birth and adult identification (ID) numbers:

    1. Teacher screening test data for the 2009 application cohort. These

      data contain individual-results for all applicants who took the test in

      2009. We obtained these data from Colombia’s National Educational

      Assessment Agency (ICFES). Because available earnings data begin

      in 2008 (see below), we limit our sample to applicants who took the

      teacher screening test in 2009 so that we can observe at least one year

      of pre-test labor market outcomes.

    2. Colombian Tertiary Education Database (SPADIES) for college grad-

      uating cohorts 2007-2009. This dataset contains individual-level infor-

      mation on key baseline covariates such as secondary graduation exam

      scores, demographics, freshman and graduation year, whether the in-

      dividual received financial aid during college, and the university and

      program from which each individual graduated, which allows to con-

      struct measures of college quality based on mean entry scores of grad-

      uates. Our main sample consist of all graduates from all knowledge

      areas from 2007 to 2009 (313,066 graduates). In our main analytic

      sample, we restric to those who took the screening test in 2009 (31,699

      applicants).


                                     9
  3. Public sector teacher payroll data, 2008-2012. Using these data we

     can identify which graduates hold permanent positions as public sector

     teachers, the region in which they work and their public teacher pay

     schedule.

  4. National Social Security earnings records for all college’s graduates

     from 2008 to 2012. Includes data on all formal sector employees in the

     country, including monthly wages, employment intensity (days worked

     in the formal sector per year) and occupational codes. Importantly,

     the social security earnings records do not cover public sector teachers

     (or military officers) since these sectors have separate pension regimes.

     Therefore, to the extent that public sector teachers appear in the na-

     tional social security records it implies that they hold another formal

     sector job outside public teaching. This is something we investigate in

     detail in our empirical analyses. Because our teacher payroll and social

     security data span until 2012, we can observe labor market outcomes

     for up to three years after an individual took the 2009 teacher-screening

     test.

Table 1 shows mean comparisons of college graduates from graduating co-

horts 2007-2009 who took the 2009 test and of those who did not. Note that

in Colombia, any college graduate can take the teacher entry exam, not just

education majors. Moreover, not all education graduates choose to take the

public teacher screening test and among education graduates in graduating

cohorts 2007-2009 about 60 percent take the screening test. In our empiri-

cal analyses we take advantage of this fact to investigate differences in the


                                     10
labor market returns for for education and non-education majors who wish

to become public teachers.

                                [Table 1 about here.]

       Consistent with the “discouragement” hypothesis of a costly screening

test (e.g. Angrist and Guryan 2007) non-test takers are potentially more

effective teachers to the extent that they are more likely to come from socio-

economically advantaged households (as measured by income and the prob-

ability of having a mother with a college degree), have higher secondary

graduation exam scores—in Colombia these scores are the main college ad-

mission criterion,—and graduate from better colleges (as measured by the

proportion who graduate from an accredited higher education institution).

Relative to non-test takers, test takers are also more likely to be female.

Among those who took the test, we have complete covariate and outcome

information for 88 percent (31,699 graduates).4 Teachers can take the test

several times, and exam repetition may raise concerns for test-score manip-

ulation. While we show balance just above and just below the cutoff in

covariates and density, we repeat all estimations without exam repeaters;

our main findings remain unchanged.

       Formal labor force attachment is high in the study’s population (Table

2). In the two years of pre-exam labor market data we have (2008 and 2009)

over 45 percent of 2009 test takers–many of whom are still enrolled in tertiary

education– worked in the formal sector, as measured by being matched to

social security records. Over time, the fraction of test-takers with formal
   4
    Of these, about 31 percent (9,874 graduates) also took the exam in at least one of the
prior administrations (2004, 2005 or 2006).


                                           11
sector attachment diminishes as a higher fraction of eligible test-takers enter

public sector teaching (column 2, Table 2). Combining public teacher payroll

data and social security data allows us to have a broader perspective on

the labor market outcomes of applicants, among whom close to 73 percent

appear in either teacher payroll or social security records (column 4, Table

2). A non-trivial percent of the sample—ranging from 4 to 8 percent in the

years after the test (2010-2012)—appears in both teacher payroll and social

security data–implying that in addition to being public sector teachers, these

applicants also hold another formal sector job (column 5, Table 2). As a

fraction of public sector teachers with permanent positions (column 2, Table

2), those who also hold outside formal jobs range between 21 in 2012, to 69

percent in 2010.


                            [Table 2 about here.]


3.2   Empirical Strategy

For the 2009 teacher screening test administration, only applicants with

scores at or above 60 points were eligible for a public sector teaching posi-

tion, as determined ex-ante by Ministry of Education officials. Figure 1 shows

that the rule generates a highly non-linear relationship between score points

and the probability of obtaining a public sector teacher position around the

60-point cutoff, which has been normalized to be zero throughout.

   Three aspects of Figure 1 are worth highlighting. First, very few ap-

plicants below the test-score obtains public sector teaching positions. This

confirms that the cutoff rule was generally binding. Second, there is a dis-


                                      12
     Figure 1: First stage: probability of working as a public sector teacher as a function of 2009 teacher screening test
     scores




13
     Notes: Figure shows the probability of working as a public sector teacher in 2010, 2011, and 2012 as a function of applicant’s score in
     the 2009 teacher screening test. Sample of applicants includes 31,699 tertiary education graduates from graduating cohorts 2007-2009
     who took the 2009 screening test. Scores are normalized to be zero at the 60-point cutoff. Each dot is the conditional probability of
     public sector employment for applicants in a given integer score. Whiskers are 95 percent confidence intervals. Separate fits at each
     side of the cutoff are non-parametric (lowess) regressions. Coefficient and standard error in each panel are from a linear regression of
     the probability of being a public sector teacher on normalized score, normalized score squared, an interaction of normalized score and
     normalized scored squared with above cutoff dummy and control variables in Table 1 with robust standard errors.
continuity around zero (normalized score) in the probability of obtaining a

public sector position. Third, the discontinuity at the cutoff grows in mag-

nitude over time.

   The discontinuity grows over time because public sector teaching posi-

tions are filled in a descending priority order beginning with the highest

scores. Many applicants who meet the admission cutoff do not obtain a

public sector position immediately, because in any given year there are more

eligible applicants than vacancies. As more vacancies open up over time,

these applicants are offered positions. This assignment rule also explains

why the slope to the right of zero flattens over time: applicants with lower

scores gain access to new vacancies. The first stage ranges from 23 percent

in 2010 to close to 50 percent in 2012.

   The reduced-form regression equation we estimate is:

                                                          0
             Yi = α0 + α1 Eligibily i + F (Scorei ) + Xi δ + εi             (1)


   where Eligibilyi is a dummy variable that takes value of one if individual

i had a score of 60 or more points in the screening test, Scorei represents the

score in the screening test normalized to be zero at the 60-point cutoff and Xi

a vector of covariates that we include in some specifications as a robustness

check. We impose F() to be a quadratic function of the normalized score.

   As Figure 1 shows, not all individuals with a qualifying score necessarily

end up working as public sector teachers. To estimate the effect of obtaining

a public sector position on labor market outcomes, we instrument obtaining

a position with the Eligibility variable, which as Figure 1 shows, produces


                                      14
a very strong first stage. The regression equations that we estimate in this

Fuzzy Regression Discontinuity research design are:

    First Stage:

                                                               0
           P (Ti ) = π0 + τ1 Eligibility i + F (Scorei ) + Xi δ + εi          (2)


    Second stage:



                                                          0
                   Yi = π0 + τ1 P (Ti ) + F (Scorei ) + Xi δ + εi             (3)


    Without the vector X of controls, τ 1 is identical to the IV-Wald estimator,

equivalent to the ratio of the reduced form in the outcome of interest at the

cutoff to the first stage of the probability of obtaining a public sector position

at the cutoff.



4    Validation of the Regression Discontinuity Re-

     search Design

The plausibility of the regression discontinuity approach rests on the as-

sumption of continuity of potential outcomes at the eligibility cutoff. We

show three pieces of evidence in support for this assumption: the density

of screening test scores at the cutoff, covariate continuity at the cutoff and

continuity of pre-test labor market outcomes.

    The density of scores around the admission cutoff does not evidence any

discontinuous jump that would indicate manipulation (Figure 2). Therefore,

                                        15
we feel confident that manipulation of applicants’ position relative to the

cutoff is not a concern in our setting, even despite the possibility of test

retake.

    Figures 3 and 4 show evidence of covariate continuity around the eligi-

bility cutoff. On Figure 3, we examine the smoothness of gender (female),

proportion of graduates from a public university, proportion of graduates

that received financial aid, and proportion of graduates that graduate on

time. Figure 4 shows graduation year, proportion of graduates from a certi-

fied higher education institution and college reputation measured by average

college entry test scores of graduates. As these figures show, there is no

evidence of discontinuities at the eligibility cutoff in the characteristics of

education graduates taking the 2009 teacher-screening test.

    The most compelling evidence in support for the validity of the RD de-

sign strategy in this settings come from an examination of continuity in pre-

test labor market outcomes. Figure 5 shows annual earnings, labor supply

(payroll days/year), and daily wage in 2008, the year prior to the test admin-

istration. Results show continuity of these different labor market outcomes

applicants took the 2009 screening test (subsections 5.1, 5.2, and 5.3, respec-

tively).5 We then present evidence on the distribution of outside occupations

(subsection 5.4) and the relevance of the LATE treatment parameter in this

context (subsection 5.5). We conclude the section with a theoretical expla-

nation of findings (subsection 5.6).


5.1      Annual Earnings

We use two annual earnings measures: annual earnings from the main oc-

cupation and total annual earnings (from all occupations). In a given year,

annual earnings from the main occupation are annual earnings (including

zeros) from the teacher payroll from test-takers who work as teachers; and

annual earnings from the occupation with the highest number of payroll

days/year for test-takers who do not work as teachers--these earnings would

show up in social security records. Total earnings for all occupations are the

sum of public teacher payroll earnings and social security earnings, including

zeros. Recall that these two data sources measure earnings from mutually

exclusive jobs.

      Figure 6 shows total annual earnings around the screening test eligibility

cutoff. The blue, lighter labels refer to earnings from the main occupation

and the black, darker labels refer to earnings from all occupations. Dots are

conditional means with corresponding 95 percent confidence intervals. The

fit is a non-parametric (lowess) fitted separately to each side of the cutoff.

Earnings are an increasing function of scores on the teacher screening test.

Analogous fuzzy RD results are shown in Table 3.

     Notes: Figure shows total annual earnings (in 2013 US dollars) as a function of applicant’s score in the 2009 teacher-screening test.
     Black labels are total annual earnings from all occupations, including teacher payroll and other formal occupations. Blue labels are
     annual earnings from the main occupation, which is public sector teaching for those in the public teacher payroll and the occupation
     with the greatest number of payroll days per year for those who are not in the teacher payroll, including zeros. Sample of applicants
     includes 31,699 graduates from graduating cohorts 2007-2009 who took the 2009 screening test. Scores are normalized to be zero at
     the 60-point cut-off. Each dot is the conditional mean of total earnings for a given integer score. Whiskers are 95 percent confidence
     intervals. Separate fits at each side of the cut-off are non-parametric (lowess) regressions.
   The first result we highlight from Figure 6 is the jump at the cutoff in

annual earnings for all test takers. Recall that because in Colombia any

college graduate can take the teacher screening exam, the full sample in-

cludes education graduates and graduates of other majors. Scaling up these

differences at the cutoff by the corresponding probability of being a public

sector teacher implies an annual earnings premium of $2,400 relative to those

below the cutoff in 2010 and $3,900 more in 2012 (see Table 3). Relative to

the control group mean, test-takers above the cutoff earn 48 percent more

in 2010 and 65 percent more in 2012, after three years of potential teacher

tenure.

   The second key result from Figure 6 is that the annual earnings jump at

the cutoff is larger when we look at earnings from all occupations (see darker

black line vs. lighter blue line). Adjusting for the probability of becoming

a public school teacher, the annual earnings premium in all three years is

about 65 percent over control group earnings. This total earnings advantage

is initially driven by the outside option or second job. In the first year as

public sector teachers, 38 percent of the total annual earnings premium (from

all occupations) is the result of earnings from outside jobs. In the second

year this decreases to about 10 percent, and by the third year almost the

whole premium is driven only by the main teaching job (see Table 3).


                            [Table 3 about here.]


   The third key result is shown in Table 3, where the analyses are disaggre-

gated by education and non-education college graduates. Table 3 shows that

education and non-education majors have slightly different premia, although

                                     23
these differences are not statistically significant (Column 7, Table 3). The

impact of being a public sector teacher is positive for education graduates,

whose initial premium is 38 percent over the control group and rises to 78

percent after three years. Non-education graduates who become teachers

earn 65 percent more than the non-education majors control group in the

first year from teaching, and 67 percent by the third year (2012).

   The earnings premium from all occupations in the first year for education

graduates is 53 percent, and for non-education majors it is 88 percent. By

the third year, however, the all-occupations premium is almost equivalent

for these two groups at around 62 percent. In other words, after a couple

of years as teachers, both education and non-education majors derive little

earnings advantage from their second job. Most of their earnings advantage

relative to the control group stems from their teaching position.


5.2   Labor supply

Labor supply is the number of payroll days per year in formal employment.

Labor supply is an increasing function of scores on the teacher screening test

(Figure 7). The corresponding regression results are on Table 4. Relative

to graduates just below the eligibility cutoff, individuals who are just above

the screening test cutoff work more payroll days per year, both in the main

occupation (lighter line, blue) and in all occupations combined (darker line,

black). The difference at the cutoff is larger when we account for all occu-

pations, suggesting that increased labor supply of marginal test-takers is the

result of more workdays per year in the main occupation as well as additional



                                     24
work effort in other occupations.6

      When instrumenting being a public sector teacher with Eligible, we find

that in the first year after taking the teacher screening test, public sector

teachers work 78.5 additional days the first year in their main occupation

over the control group, and 135 days in all occupations over the control group

in 2012 (Table 4, Column 2). In the first year after taking the test (2010),

additional days in other jobs accounts for 42 percent of the premium from

all occupations in the full sample.


                              [Table 4 about here.]


      The number of additional payroll days worked by public sector teachers

over the control group decreases over time to 127 days over the control group

in 2012 in their main occupation, and 132 for all occupations. After three

years of potential teacher tenure almost all of the difference in additional la-

bor supply relative to the control group is coming from the main occupation.

The pattern is similar for education and non-education graduates, with the

exception of the first year after taking the test. In this initial year, education

graduates split their additional labor supply in the first year almost evenly

between their main job and other jobs. Non-education graduates exert most

of their additional labor supply in their other jobs (presumably, non-teaching

jobs).

     Black labels are total annual earnings from all occupations, including teacher payroll and other formal occupations. Blue labels are
     annual earnings from the main occupation, which is public sector teaching for those in the public teacher payroll and the occupation

     includes 31,699 graduates from graduating cohorts 2007-2009 who took the 2009 screening test. Scores are normalized to be zero at
     the 60-point cut-off. Each dot is the conditional mean of total earnings for a given integer score. Whiskers are 95 percent confidence
     intervals. Separate fits at each side of the cut-off are non-parametric (lowess) regressions.
5.3   Daily Earnings

Daily earnings per year are total annual earnings divided by total payroll

days per year. We compute daily earnings for the main occupation and for

all occupations. Just as it was the case with total annual earnings and labor

supply, daily earnings are also an increasing function of scores on the teacher

screening test (see Figure 8).

   Relative to all college graduates that take the teacher screening test and

place just below the cutoff, those about the cutoff have greater daily earnings

in the main occupation (blue), as evidenced by the discontinuous jump at

the cutoff (see Figure 8).

   When we instrument being a public sector teacher with Eligible, we find

that in the first year after taking the test, public-school-teachers earn a daily

earnings premium of $1.8 per day in their main occupation (teaching). This

daily premium is not statistically significant (see Table 5, Column 2). The

daily earnings in the main occupation increases with potential experience to

$6.1 per day in 2011, and $7.0 per day in 2012. Results are similar—even

though point estimates are slightly smaller—when we estimate the daily

earnings premium from all occupations (Table 5, Column 2, bottom panel).

   There are small differences in the daily earnings premium for education

and non-education majors, although these differences are not statistically

significant (Table 5, Column 7). In addition, several estimates of the daily

earnings premium are not statistically significant for non-education gradu-

ates (Table 5, Column 6).


                             [Table 5 about here.]

28
     Notes: Figure shows average daily earnings in the year as a function of applicant’s score in the 2009 teacher-screening test. Daily earn-
     ings for all occupations (black) are total annual earnings divided by total days worked from any source, including zeros. Daily earnings
     for main occupation (blue) are total earnings from main occupation divided by total payroll days in the main occupation. Sample of
     applicants includes 31,699 graduates from graduating cohorts 2007-2009 who took the 2009 screening test. Scores are normalized to
     be zero at the 60-point cut-off. Each dot is the conditional mean of number of days worked for a given integer score. Whiskers are 95
     percent confidence intervals. Separate fits at each side of the cut-off are non-parametric (lowess) regressions.
       The daily earnings results suggest that the total annual earnings pre-

mium for public sector teachers in the main occupation (teaching) is—at the

margin—a combination of a labor supply and a wage effect. The daily earn-

ings premium from all occupations for public sector teachers at the margin

is, however, mainly a labor supply effect.


5.4      Outside Occupations

The social security database contains 4-digit ISIC occupation codes.            7   These

codes are available for 2008, 2010, 2012, and 2013. In these years, however,

there are changes to the ISIC revision (Rev 3 or Rev 4) codes reported in

the data. For education-related occupations, the codes are mostly consis-

tent across revisions, but not entirely.8 Due to this inconsistency, we code

occupations as being education related in two ways. First, we only code as

education-related occupations for which the occupation classification is un-

ambiguously related to education in both revisions. This method captures

the majority of education related occupations. This first approach provides

a lower bound estimate of the probability of working in a private, education-
   7
    ISIC stands for International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic.
   8
    Education codes in CIIU Rev. 3 are numbers: 8011 (preschool), 8012 (primary),
8021 (middle school), 8022 (high school), 8030 (higher education) and 8090 (other types
of education). Of this only 8030 is used in Rev. 4 for a different activity (detectives
and private investigators). Education codes in CIIU Rev. 4 are 8511 (early childhood),
8512 (preschool), 8513 (primary), 8521 (middle school), 8522 (academic high school), 8523
(technical high school and job training), 8530 (institutions that combine different levels
of education), 8541 to 8544 (technical and professional), 8551 to 8553, 8559 (other types
of education), 8560 (other activities related to education). Among these three codes are
used in CIIU Rev. 4 for different activities: 8511 (health services institutions), 8512
(medical practice activities), 8513 (dentistry activities). When assuming that all codes
that refer to education in Rev. 3 or 4 correctly identify a worker of the education sector
we will assume that codes 8030, 8511, 8512 and 8513 effectively identify workers from the
education sector. In the second case we will assume that these four codes identify workers
in other sectors.


                                           29
related job.9

       The second approach assumes that occupations in codes that in one revi-

sion are education-related and in the other revision are not, are all education-

related. This approach produces an upper bound of the proportion of workers

in education related occupations. The bounds are quite tight. In Figure 9 we

show outside occupation distributions based on the lower bound codification.

       The occupational distributions for test screening test takers below the

cutoff and for those above the cutoff who do not work as public sector teach-

ers are similar, in 2010 (one year after the test, Figure 9). As can be seen

in Figure 9, about 8 and 5 percent, respectively, of test takers below the

cutoff or above the cutoff but not working as a public sector teacher work

in an education related occupation outside of their main job. The two im-

portant occupational categories in terms of holding a second job after the

test application for these two groups of applicants are real estate, business,

and finance, and other services. Among public sector teachers, only about 3

percent work in a formal education related outside occupation.10 The ma-

jority of public sector teachers with a second occupation work in real estate,

business, and finance, and other services.11

       To the extent that the skills required in those outside occupations differ

from those skills mostly needed and honed through teaching, it seems plau-

sible that there may be little skill complementarity between public sector

teaching and outside jobs. There is however, a scheduling complementarity

in public sector teaching. Schools in Colombia, as in much of the developing

world, operate in two-shifts: a morning and an afternoon shift.

   Each shift is about 4 hours long, and constitutes a half-day school day

relative to the length of the school day in the United States. These double

shifts facilitate lumpy time allocations of public school teachers to outside

occupations.


5.5   LATE and the Distribution of Earnings for All College
      Graduates

Most of the discussion about raising the quality of public sector teachers

centers on how to attract top college graduates into the teaching profession

(e.g. Garcia et al 2014; Bruns and Luque 2014). It could be argued that the

earnings premia and labor supply effects documented in this paper are only

local to the teacher screening test cutoff, in other words, for the potentially

least desirable eligible candidate. Two pieces of evidence suggest that—at

least in the Colombian context—this LATE causal parameter is relevant for

the larger population of teacher candidates. First, it is worth considering

that over one third of public sector teachers in Colombia are not college

graduates. Thus, even the most marginal eligible applicant on the teacher

test will have a college degree, something which has been found to predict

higher student test scores in developing countries, particularly in secondary

schools and in rural areas (Glewwe et al., 2011; Santibañez, 2006).

   Second, even compared to college graduates from all majors, those at

the cutoff do not look disproportionally negatively selected in the overall

earnings distribution (Figure 10). Two years after the screening test, for

                                      32

     Notes: Figure shows the (log) distribution of total annual earnings in 2012 of all college graduates 2007-2009, and different relevant
     centiles, including those at the 60 point cut-off for eligibility for a public position, the 95th percentile of the 2009 teacher screening
     test score distribution, median for education graduates who do not take the screening test, medians for health science, social science
     and engineer graduates and the 95th percentile of college entry exam scores.
example, education college graduates who take the teacher screening test

and score at the eligibility cutoff rank at about the 45th percentile in the

earnings distribution of all graduates. Education college graduates who score

at the 95th percentile in the screening test ("top test taker") have annual

earnings above those at the cutoff in 2012. Median graduates from health

sciences, social sciences, engineering, those education graduates who do not

take the screening test, as well as the top college applicant are well above

the cut test taker. In sum, these figures suggest that, even though public

teaching in Colombia is not attracting the top college graduates, education

graduates who score at the margin of the screening cut off earn near the

middle of the earnings distributions for all college graduates.


5.6   Theoretical Explanation of Findings

Our analyses thus far suggest that public sector teachers earn a significant

labor market earnings premium over applicants at the margin who did not

obtain a public teaching position. Initially, a significant portion of this pre-

mium is the result of additional labor supplied in an outside job, many of

which are non-teaching jobs. Teachers who have more outside options (i.e.

graduates from non-education majors) tend to hold these outside jobs in

higher proportion than teachers from education majors.

   Conceptually, we can explain these findings in a simple labor supply and

demand model in which there are two types of jobs that differ along three

dimensions. In the teaching job, workers have stability but face restrictions

on the number of hours worked and have a pay schedule that is determined by

a central planner with no regional variation. In the non-teaching job, there is

                                      34
no stability but workers can work as many hours as they wish to and workers

are paid marginal product of labor, determined by local market clearing

conditions. Workers differ in their intrinsic motivation to hold an additional

job, which may stem from differences in reservation wages (e.g. Shishko and

Rostker, 1976) or tastes (e.g. Conway and Kimmel, 1998; Dickey, Watson

and Zangelidis, 2011). The existence of local labor markets and moving costs

create regional variation in the equilibrium wage gap between teaching and

non-teaching jobs (e.g. rural vs. urban). Differences in reservation wages

(e.g. education graduates vs. graduates from other majors) or tastes help

explain why within regions we see some public teachers holding outside jobs

and others not.



6    Earnings Premium for Infra-marginal High-Scoring

     Applicants

Most of the discussion about teacher pay concerns ways to attract top talent

into the teaching profession. One potential shortcoming of our RD frame-

work is that we identify impacts that are local to the teacher screening test

cutoff. Even though prospective novice teachers who take the screening test

have earnings that are typical of all college graduates nationwide (Figure

10), it is unclear whether we can extrapolate labor market premia for novice

public teachers at the margin to inframarginal top teachers.

    In this section, we apply the methods of Angrist and Rokannen (2015)

to estimate labor market premia for inframarginal teachers. The approach

exploits our availability of a large set of baseline predictors other than the


                                     35
teacher screening test score running variable. Identification away from the

cutoff requires an additional conditional independence assumption (CIA),

namely, that the teacher screening test score is ignorable conditional on these

additional predictors. Regressions of outcomes on the screening test score

and the additional predictors on either side of the cutoff provide a simple

test for the CIA. Table 6 shows results of these conditional independence

tests.


                            [Table 6 about here.]


    As the top panel of Table 6 shows, conditioning on the test score effec-

tively eliminates the relationship between the running variable and potential

labor market earnings, from the main and all occupations. The coefficients

are small in magnitude and statistically insignificant. Panel B of Table 6

shows that, among eligible applicants (i.e. those above the scoring thresh-

old), conditioning also eliminates the relationship between the running vari-

able and the probability of being a public sector teacher for 2011 and 2012,

that is two and three years after taking the teacher screening test.

    We use the conditional independence results from Table 6 to estimate

labor market premia for inframarginal public sector teachers who obtained

a high score in the screening test. We use a propensity score stratification

approach based on a propensity score (logit) model that includes as predic-

tors all variables in the conditional independence test regression models (see

notes to Table 6 for details).

    The distributions of estimated propensity scores for eligible and ineli-

gible public teacher applicants exhibit substantial overlap across the entire

                                      36
support (Figure 11). This guarantees that we can construct valid earnings

counterfactuals for eligible applicants over the entire support of the predicted

probability of being an eligible public sector teacher.

   We estimate and interpret the causal impacts on earnings of being a

public sector teachers in an instrumental variable framework, similar to the

one employed earlier in the paper. In particular, the first stage is a linear

regression of the probability of being a public sector teacher as a function of

being eligible, controlling for propensity score strata fixed effects (10 strata,

9 fixed effects plus an omitted category). In the second stage we regress

labor market earnings on the predicted probability of being a public sector

teacher, also controlling for propensity score strata fixed effects.

   Table 7 shows results of this instrumental variables estimation approach.

For comparison, columns (1), (3) and (5) of Table 7 reproduce local effects

on earnings on earnings of being a public sector teacher in the first three

years after the screening test. These estimates correspond to estimates we

presented earlier in Table 3. Columns (2), (4) and (6) show impacts on earn-

ings for inframarginal public sector teachers based on the CIA instrumental

variables approach. In both the main occupation and for all occupations,

labor market premia for inframarginal public sector teachers are statistically

significant and larger than the premia for marginal applicants at the cutoff.

When looking at all occupations, teachers away from the cutoff earn 5.04

more in thousands of 2013 US$, than teachers in the control group in 2010.

Teachers at the cutoff earn 3.80 more than those in the control group. The

difference this initial year after taking the test is 1.24, or about 32 percent

more for teachers away from the cutoff, than teachers at the cutoff. This

difference decreases to 5 percent in the third year.

                            [Table 7 about here.]

    These results suggest that—relative to their labor market outside op-

tions—being a public sector teacher in Colombia is as attractive, if not more,

for inframarginal high-scoring applicants as it is for applicants who obtain

marginal scores on the teacher screening test. On the whole, results suggest

that, at least in the Colombian context, rather than a penalty, novice pub-

lic sector teachers across all ability levels earn a substantial labor market

premium early in their careers.



7    Conclusions

In an effort to improve teaching screening, in 2002 Colombia underwent a

major education reform changing the way teachers were selected for public

school teaching positions. The central piece of the reform was a national,

centralized teacher-screening exam. At the heart of these policy efforts is

a determination to make the teaching profession more attractive to highly

qualified and motivated individuals.

    We take advantage of the fact that the screening exam creates exogenous

variation on the probability of obtaining a permanent public sector teaching

position to examine earnings and labor supply differentials or those gradu-

ates that work as public sector teachers against those that work in alternative

occupations. In addition, we use a unique dataset that merges four admin-

istrative national data sources to observe teacher candidates’ labor market

outcomes in their teaching job as well as other occupations.

                                       39
   Applicants who marginally pass the teacher screening test have earn-

ings during the first three years of tenure that substantially greater than

earnings of applicants below the test passing cutoff. Part of the initial year

earnings premium stems from the fact that a significant portion of public

sector teachers hold a second non-teaching job in the formal sector. For

less that one-third of teachers this outside job is education-related. By the

third year of teaching, the earnings advantage coming from the second job

wanes, and almost the entirety of the premium is driven only by the main

(teaching) occupation. There are slight differences in the point estimates of

these premia for education and non-education majors, although none reach

statistical significance at conventional levels.

   Relative to applicants below the cutoff, public teachers work harder, both

in their teaching job as well as in their second job, as measured by payroll

days/year in the first three years of potential teacher tenure.

   The total annual earnings premium in the main occupation in the first

three years of potential tenure for public sector teachers in the main occupa-

tion is—at the margin—a combination of a labor supply and a wage effect.

The total earnings premium from all occupations for public sector teachers

at the margin is, however, a labor supply effect.

   Estimates of the earnings premium for high-scoring infra-marginal appli-

cants suggest that being a public sector teacher in Colombia is as attractive,

if not more, for inframarginal high-scoring applicants as it is for applicants

who obtain marginal scores on the teacher screening test. On the whole,

our evidence suggests that, at least in the Colombian context, rather than

a penalty, novice public sector teachers across all ability levels earn a sub-

                                       40
stantial labor market premium early in their careers. Our results, therefore,

may call into question initiatives that seek to increase teacher compensation

under the presumption that novice public teachers are underpaid relative to

similarly qualified professionals in other occupations.

       Notes: Table shows fuzzy RD estimates for being a public sector teacher on total annual earnings (in USD 2013 thousands). Main
       occupation is being a public sector teacher for those who are permanent public sector teacher or is the occupation with the greatest
       number of payroll days for all others. All occupations includes all income sources reported. Sample contains 31,699 graduates from
       Higher Education from 2007 to 2009 (inclusive) divided in two groups, Graduates from Education and Graduates from Other Ma-
       jors. Scores are normalized to be zero at the 60-point cut-off. Being a public sector teacher is instrumented with a dummy for being
       above the cutoff point. Covariates in the regressions not shown in the table are normalized score, normalized score squared, an
       interaction of normalized score and normalized scored squared with above cut-off dummy, female, whether graduated from a pub-
       lic institution, whether received financial aid in college, whether graduated on time, whether graduated from certified institution,
       college reputation and year of graduation and a constant. Control mean is the mean of the outcome in (-5,5) normalized screening
       test score. Robust standard errors in parentheses. *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1

       Notes: Table shows fuzzy RD estimates for being a public sector teacher on total annual labor supply (payroll days). Main occu-
       pation is being a public sector teacher for those who are permanent public sector teacher or is the occupation with the greatest
       number of payroll days for all others. All occupations includes all income sources reported. Sample contains 31,699 graduates from
       Higher Education from 2007 to 2009 (inclusive) divided in two groups, Graduates from Education and Graduates from Other Ma-
       jors. Scores are normalized to be zero at the 60-point cutoff. Being a public sector teacher is instrumented with a dummy for being
       above the cutoff point. Covariates in the regressions not shown in the table are normalized score, normalized score squared, an
       interaction of normalized score and normalized scored squared with above cutoff dummy, female, whether graduated from a pub-
       lic institution, whether received financial aid in college, whether graduated on time, whether graduated from certified institution,
