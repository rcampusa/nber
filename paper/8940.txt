                                            ABSTRACT

       This paper discusses the NAIRU -- the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment. It first
considers the role of the NAIRU concept in business cycle theory, arguing that this concept is implicit
in any model in which monetary policy influences both inflation and unemployment. The exact value
of the NAIRU is hard to measure, however, in part because it changes over time. The paper then
discusses why the NAIRU changes and, in particular, why it fell in the United States during the 1990s.
The most promising hypothesis is that the decline in the NAIRU is attributable to the acceleration in
productivity growth.

     NAIRU   stands    for   the   nonaccelerating   inflation   rate   of

unemployment.    It is beyond dispute that this acronym is an ugly

addition to the English language.        There are, however, two issues

that fail to command consensus among economists, which we address

in this essay.

     The first issue is whether the concept of NAIRU is a useful

piece of business cycle theory.          We believe it is, and we begin

this paper by attempting to explain why.       In our view, the NAIRU is

approximately a synonym for the natural rate of unemployment. This

concept follows naturally from any theory that says that changes in

monetary   policy,    and    aggregate   demand   more   generally,   push

inflation and unemployment in opposite directions in the short run.

Once this short-run tradeoff is admitted, there must be some level

of unemployment consistent with stable inflation.

     The second issue is why the NAIRU changes over time and, in

particular, why it fell in the second half of the 1990s.              This

question is more difficult, and the answer is open to debate.         Most

likely, various factors are at work, including demographics and

government policies. Yet one hypothesis stands out as particularly

promising: fluctuations in the NAIRU appear related to fluctuations

in productivity.      In the 1970s, the NAIRU rose when productivity

growth slowed.     In the 1990s, the NAIRU fell when productivity

growth sped up.      Developing and testing models that explain the

links among inflation, unemployment, and productivity remains a

challenge for students of business cycle theory.

1. The Role of NAIRU

      The word "NAIRU" entered the language of macroeconomics in the

1970s, a period of rapid and rising inflation.             Yet, in a deeper

sense, the concept has been there all along.


A Building Block of Macroeconomic Theory

      A long tradition in economics emphasizes that the supply of

money influences both inflation and unemployment.            In his classic

1752 essay "Of Money," David Hume wrote about the effects of

monetary injections, such as gold discoveries:              "It is easy to

trace the money in its progress through the whole commonwealth;

where we shall find that it must first quicken the diligence of

every individual, before it increases the price of labour."               This

insight has motivated much of modern macroeconomic theory.                 Two

prominent    examples   are   Milton       Friedman's   (1968)    presidential

address to the American Economic Association and Robert Lucas's

(1996) Nobel prize lecture.      Lucas quotes exactly these words from

Hume.

      At times, some economists have questioned Hume's insight. The

real business cycle theorists of the 1980s, for example, suggested

that business cycles were technologically driven and that money had

no   role   in   explaining   production      and   employment    fluctuations

(Prescott 1986; Long and Plosser 1983).                 But this view is a

minority position, both historically and today.                  There is wide

agreement about the fundamental insight that monetary fluctuations

push inflation and unemployment in opposite directions.               That is,


                                       2
society faces a tradeoff, at least in the short run, between

inflation and unemployment.

     According to conventional macroeconomic theory, the inflation-

unemployment tradeoff is central to understanding not only the

effects of monetary policy but also other policies and events that

influence the aggregate demand for goods and services. But most of

these other events and policies can potentially have effects

through other channels as well. For example, tax policy influences

both aggregate demand through disposable income and aggregate

supply through work incentives.    By contrast, belief that monetary

policy has employment effects is inextricably tied to belief in the

inflation-unemployment tradeoff.

      Two centuries have passed since Hume penned the wise words

quoted above, but the economics profession has yet to reach a

consensus about why this tradeoff arises. In classical theory,

money is neutral.   It is only the numeraire in which prices are

quoted.   Changes in its quantity should affect the overall price

level, but not relative prices, production, or employment. The key

question facing business cycle theorists is why this classical

theorem of monetary neutrality fails to hold in the world.

     Many answers have been proposed.   Short-run nonneutrality has

been blamed on imperfections of information (Friedman 1968; Lucas

1973; Mankiw and Reis 2001); long-term labor contracts (Fischer

1977; Gray 1976; Taylor 1980); the costs of price adjustment

(Rotemberg 1982; Mankiw 1985; Blanchard and Kiyotaki 1987; Ball and

Romer, 1990); or departures from full rationality (Akerlof and


                                   3
Yellen 1985).        Each of these approaches raises its own set of

difficult theoretical and empirical questions, which are beyond the

scope of this essay.       There is, however, a common theme: because of

some market imperfection absent from the classical model, changes

in the value of the unit of account matter.               Monetary neutrality

breaks down, and at least in the short run, monetary changes have

opposite effects on inflation and unemployment.

       Without much loss of generality, we can write the short-run

tradeoff between inflation B and unemployment U as follows:



       B = k - a U


where k and a>0 are parameters.          This equation does not really say

much, other than that B and U are negatively related.                  One fact

about this relationship is clear: it cannot be constant over time.

If it were, the data on inflation and unemployment would trace a

nice, stable, downward-sloping Phillips curve.              There once was a

time when some economists took this possibility seriously, but data
since the early 1970s have made this simple view untenable.

       The instability of this relationship is hardly a surprise.

Even    Samuelson    and   Solow's   (1960)    classic    discussion    of   the

Phillips curve suggested that the short-run menu of inflation-

unemployment combinations would likely shift over time.                Skeptics

are    sometimes    tempted   to   use   the   shifting   Phillips   curve   as

evidence to deny the existence of a short-run tradeoff.                 This is

pure sophistry.      It would be like observing that the United States

                                         4
has more consumption and investment than India to deny that society

faces a tradeoff between consumption and investment. The situation

is not hard to understand and, in fact, arises frequently in

economics.   At any point in time, society faces a tradeoff, but the

tradeoff changes over time.          The next question is what factors

cause the tradeoff to shift.


Expectations, the Natural Rate, and Supply Shocks

     Since     Friedman    (1968)    and    Phelps's   (1967,1968)   seminal

contributions, one variable has played center stage in explaining

shifts in the inflation-unemployment tradeoff: expected inflation.

Other things equal, an increase in expected inflation is associated

with an equal increase in actual inflation.                The reason why

expected inflation plays such a role depends on the theory of

short-run nonneutrality,         Moreover, the choice of theory will

influence the timing of when expectations are formed.            But from a

birds' eye view, the similarity of the theories is more significant

than their differences.        In most standard theories, we can write

the inflation-unemployment tradeoff as



     B = Be - a(U-U*)


where Be is expected inflation and U* is a parameter called the

"natural rate of unemployment."            The natural rate is the rate of

unemployment     that     prevails   when     inflation   expectations   are

confirmed.     Seen in another light, the parameter U* imbeds all


                                       5
shifts   in     the   inflation-unemployment      tradeoff    previously

represented by the parameter k, other than shifts arising from

expected inflation.

      The natural rate can be viewed as the unemployment rate that

the economy reaches in the long.        This interpretation arises from

imposing a modicum of rationality to expectations.        Over any long

interval of time, the average of expected inflation should equal

the   average   of    actual   inflation;   otherwise,   forecasts   are

systematically biased.     Thus, over the same long interval, average

unemployment should equal the average natural rate.          In the long

run, U cannot deviate from U*.

      None of this means that the natural rate of unemployment is

immutable, or even that it moves only slowly over time.               In

principle, U* can exhibit substantial high-frequency variation, so

any other shift in the inflation-unemployment tradeoff can be

described as a shift in U*.       As a practical matter, however, the

literature on inflation-unemployment dynamics has traditionally

used an amended version of the above equation:



      B = Be - a(U-U*) + v


where v is dubbed the "supply shock."

      To some extent, the distinction between U* and v is arbitrary:

both the natural rate U* and the supply shock v represent shifts in

the inflation-unemployment tradeoff.         But many economists view

these two variables as measuring different kinds of shifts.          The


                                    6
natural rate U* is thought to reflect how well the labor market

matches workers and job.        It is altered by, for instance, by

changes in demographics or labor-market institutions and is thought

to move slowly over time.   By contrast, the supply shock v reflects

disruptions in the normal inflation process, such as that caused by

an oil embargo or a change in the exchange rate.     The supply shock

is thought to exhibit more high-frequency variation than the

natural rate.1

   To implement this equation, something has to be said about how

expectations are formed.        One approach is to assume adaptive

expectations, according to which expected inflation is a weighted

average of past inflation.      The simplest version is to posit that

expected inflation equals last period's inflation: Be=B-1.        The

inflation-unemployment tradeoff then becomes:



     B = B-1   - a(U-U*) + v.



The rational expectations revolution was founded precisely on
criticizing this approach. (Lucas 1972; Sargent 1971) And surely,

it would be indefensible to accept adaptive expectations as a

precise and immutable description of the world, regardless of the

monetary regime. But over the past four decades, the assumption of

adaptive expectations may not be so bad.     Inflation has been close

to a random walk during this period (Barsky 1987; Ball 2000).


     1
       For our attempt to derive a theory of the supply shock v,
see Ball and Mankiw (1995).

                                    7
Forecasting future inflation with past inflation, as is assumed by

adaptive      expectations,      is   not       far    from    rational.         In   this

environment, U* can be viewed as the NAIRU, the unemployment rate

at which inflation will be stable, absent the high-frequency shocks

represented by v.

     One implication of this analysis is that the value of the

NAIRU concept depends on the monetary regime.                      If we lived in a

world where inflation was close to white noise, rather than highly

persistent, then adaptive expectations would be a bad approximation

to optimal behavior. The early part of the twentieth century, when

the United States operated under a gold standard, may have been

such a regime. (Barsky, 1987)           In that world, expected inflation

would be closer to a constant of zero, and the natural rate U*

would    be    associated     with    stable          prices    rather    than    stable

inflation.

     In the U.S. monetary regime of recent decades, however, the

NAIRU concept is useful, and it is synonymous with the natural rate

of unemployment. In his classic paper introducing the natural-rate

hypothesis, Friedman described the situation as follows:



"There   is    always   a   temporary       tradeoff          between    inflation    and

unemployment;     there     is   no   permanent          tradeoff.       The   temporary

tradeoff comes not from inflation per se, but from unanticipated

inflation, which generally means, from a rising rate of inflation."



Friedman didn't use the term "NAIRU," but the concept is implicit


                                            8
in his analysis.


Hysteresis

     Some economists have suggested that the labor market exhibits

a form of "hysteresis" (Blanchard and Summers, 1986).   In physics,

hysteresis refers to the failure of an object to return to its

original value after being changed by an external force, even after

the force is removed.    In the labor market, a similar phenomenon

would arise if the natural rate U* depended on past unemployment U.

In this case, a change in aggregate demand would first influence

unemployment by causing U to deviate from U*, but then would have

a persistent effect on unemployment as U* changed.

     Several theories have been proposed to explain why this might

be the case.       The most popular emphasize long-lasting damage

suffered by workers who experience unemployment.     These workers

lose human capital, become less attractive to employers, and reduce

their job search as they become accustomed to being unemployed

(Layard et al., 1991).   All these effects make workers less likely

to be employed in the future. A recession that raises unemployment

leaves a permanent scar on the economy, as U* is higher even after

the initial shock that caused the recession has disappeared. These

theories of hysterisis were first developed to explain the large

rise in the NAIRU in Europe during the 1980s: The increase in U*

came immediately after the disinflationary recession that started




                                 9
the decade.2

     The validity of hysteresis theories is a subject of some

controversy, and we will not take up that debate here.         Regardless

of how this debate is resolved, the concept of NAIRU remains valid.

At any point in time, there will be an unemployment rate consistent

with stable inflation, which can be called the NAIRU.          Hysteresis

theories merely give one reason to expect the NAIRU to change over

time.    As we discuss below, there are many other reasons to expect

that the NAIRU will not be a constant.


Two Econometric Difficulties

     Let us now turn from theory to econometric implementation.          A

large literature has attempted to estimate inflation equations of

this form:
     B = B-1 - a(U-U*) + v.
Often,   the   studies   includes   additional   lags   of   inflation   or

unemployment.    Sometimes, rather than leaving the supply shock v

entirely in a residual, control variables are included, such as
food and oil prices, exchange rates, and dummies for wage-price

controls.3
     One difficult issue that this literature has tried to skirt is

the identification problem. If the macroeconometrican assumes that


2 For a recent study using hysteresis theories to explain the
increase in the European NAIRU, see Ball (1999). For an attempt
to explain the European NAIRU based on labor-market institutions
and supply-side shocks, see Blanchard and Wolfers (2000).

3 For two examples from this large literature, see Gordon (1998)
and Staiger, Stock, and Watson (1997).

                                    10
U* is constant over the interval being studied and that v is

contemporaneously uncorrelated with U, then this equation can be

consistently estimated with ordinary least squares.       The value of

the NAIRU, U*, can then be inferred from the estimated parameters.

     These identification assumptions are not at all innocuous. It

is easy to imagine that the supply shocks represented by v are

correlated with unemployment. For example, a burst in productivity

growth, such as that experienced during the late 1990s, might well

lower inflation and unemployment.       The textbook solution to this

problem is to find instrumental variables that are correlated with

unemployment but uncorrelated with the supply shock.      In practice,

finding valid instruments is hard to do and rarely done.

     Note that other strands of the literature make somewhat

different identification assumptions. Lucas's (1973) classic paper

on inflation-output tradeoffs used nominal GDP growth as the-right-

hand side variable in a regression estimated with ordinary least

squares. The implicit assumption was that the supply shocks in the

residual do not influence nominal GDP, but can influence both real

GDP and the price level in opposite directions. Similarly, Barro's

(1977) classic work on unanticipated money implicitly assumed that

supply shocks do not influence money growth.      These identification

schemes can also be questioned.        Below we follow the traditional

identification assumption, according to which the supply shock v is

contemporaneously uncorrelated with unemployment U.       Dealing with

the identification problem in a more satisfactory way seems an

important avenue for future research.


                                  11
      A second, more tractable econometric issue is the computation

of standard errors.             Until recently, the empirical literature on

the Phillips curve rarely provided standard errors for estimates of

the NAIRU.      This odd oversight was corrected in an important paper

by   Staiger,       Stock,      and   Watson   (1997).       Using     a   conventional

specification, they estimated the NAIRU in 1990 to be 6.2 percent,

with a 95 percent confidence interval from 5.1 to 7.7 percent.

This is a large range.                In principle, better measures of supply

shocks can reduce the residual variance and improve the precision

of NAIRU estimates.             But Staiger, Stock, and Watson showed that

given standard specifications used in the literature, the NAIRU is

not estimated precisely.


Its Use in Policy

      How    should      monetary       policymakers      use    the   NAIRU?        Most

obviously, it is a forecasting tool.                   When unemployment is below

the NAIRU, inflation can be expected to rise, and when it is above

the NAIRU, inflation can be expected to fall.                      Thus, even if the

policy      regime       were     one    of    inflation        targeting,    monetary

policymakers should keep an eye on unemployment and the NAIRU.

      It may be tempting to point to the experience of the 1990s to

suggest that this view is obsolete.                    And, indeed, as we discuss

below, there is evidence that the late 1990s were different: the

NAIRU declined substantially. But it would be rash to suggest that

the NAIRU is obsolete as a forecasting tool.                       Stock and Watson

(1999)      offer    a    comprehensive        study    of   various       methods   for


                                              12
forecasting inflation.        Despite the finding of Staiger, Stock, and

Watson (1997) that the NAIRU is imprecisely estimated, Stock and

Watson (1999) report, "Inflation forecasts produced by the Phillips

curve generally have been more accurate than forecasts based on

other macroeconomic variables, including interest rates, money, and

commodity prices."

     Nonetheless, it also makes sense for monetary policymakers to

give some weight to other forecasting tools. When looking ahead to

future inflation, they should also look at, for example, the

consensus of private forecasters and the spread between real and

nominal bond yields. Of course, these tools themselves reflect the

NAIRU concept, because private forecasts of inflation are often

based on it.         Using such private forecasts of inflation for

policymaking       can   be   viewed   as   a   way   to   decentralize   the

decisionmaking over how the NAIRU is changing over time.


2. The U.S. NAIRU, 1960-2000

     So much for theory. Let's now turn to the practical question:

what is the level of the NAIRU for the U.S. economy?


An Approach

    To see how one might estimate the NAIRU, rewrite the Phillips-

curve equation as



        )B     =    aU* - aU + v .




                                       13
If one assumes that U* is constant and that U is uncorrelated with

v, then the value of U* can be estimated by regressing the change

in inflation )B on a constant and unemployment U.                The ratio of the

constant term (aU*) to the absolute value of the unemployment

coefficient (a) is an estimate of U*.                     When we perform this

exercise    for   annual    U.S.    data      from   1960   to   2000,   measuring

inflation with the consumer price index, we obtain a constant term

of 3.8 and an unemployment coefficient of -0.63.                    This yields a

NAIRU estimate of 6.1 percent.

       However, many economists have questioned the assumption of a

constant NAIRU underlying this calculation, especially since the

apparent fall in the NAIRU in the late 1990s.                There is a growing

literature that seeks to estimate the path of a time-varying NAIRU.

This   literature   is     based    on   the    idea,    discussed    above,   that

movements in U* are long-term shifts in the unemployment-inflation

relation,   while   the     shock    v   captures       short-run    fluctuations.

Authors such as Staiger et al. and Gordon (1998) estimate U* by

positing a stochastic process for U* (such as a random walk) and a

stochastic process for v (such as white noise) and then using a

statistical procedure that separates Phillips-curve shifts into

these two kinds of shocks.          To build intuition, we use an approach

that is simpler but yields similar results.

       Suppose for the moment that we know the value of the parameter

a, which gives the slope of the unemployment-inflation tradeoff. We

can then rearrange to obtain the equation



                                         14
    U* + v/a = U + )B/a.



The right-hand side can be computed from the data, yielding an

estimate of U* + v/a, which measures the shifts in the Phillips

curve.    Within this sum, U* represents the longer-term trends, and

v/a is proportional to the shorter-term supply shocks.              It is

therefore natural to try to extract U* from U* + v/a using a

standard approach to estimating the trend in a series.

     We use the Hodrick-Prescott filter (Hodrick and Prescott,

1997).    The HP filter is a generalization of a linear time trend

that allows the slope of the trend to change gradually over time.

Formally, the HP filter minimizes the sum of squared deviations

between the trend and the actual series, with a penalty for

curvature that keeps the trend smooth.        If there were no penalty,

the filter would yield the original series; if the penalty were

very high, it would yield a linear time trend.

     To implement this procedure, we must choose two parameters.

The first is the Phillips curve slope, a.        In our results below, we

use an a of 0.63, the slope coefficient obtained from regressing )B
on unemployment and a constant.           This value is consistent with

conventional wisdom about the costs of disinflation (it implies

that reducing inflation by one percentage point produces 1/0.63 =

1.6 point-years of unemployment).          Reasonable variation in the

assumed coefficient has little effect on our conclusions.

         The other parameter is the smoothing parameter in the HP

filter--the    weight   that   the   procedure   gives   to   keeping   the


                                     15
estimated U* smooth rather than fitting every movement in U*+(v/a).

The choice of this parameter is largely arbitrary.   In some ways,

this is not surprising: as we noted earlier, the distinction

between U* and v is not well-defined.     Most economists have the

intuition that movements in U* are "smooth" and that v represents

a different kind of high-frequency shift in the Phillips curve, but

this intuition is too vague to have much practical import.   In the

analysis below, we experiment with alternative values of the HP

smoothing parameter.


Results

    Figure 1 presents estimates of the U.S. NAIRU over the last

forty years.   The solid line gives the values of U*+(v/a) computed

as described above; this represents the sum of long-term and

transitory shifts in the inflation-unemployment tradeoff.    The two

dashed lines give smoothed versions of the series that serve as our

estimates of U*.   The two versions correspond to different values

of the HP smoothing parameter: one value is 100, the most commonly-

used value with annual data, and the other is 1000, which imposes

greater smoothing as advocated by some researchers (e.g., Roberts,

1998).

     The two smoothed series tell broadly similar stories.      The

NAIRU has followed a hump-shaped path: it trended up from the 1960s

until about 1980, then peaked and has declined since then.     With

the smaller smoothing parameter, there is a small dip in the early

1960s before U* starts to rise, but this wiggle does not survive


                                 16
with greater smoothing.          More generally, the movements in U* are

smaller with the higher HP parameter.              With a parameter of 1000,

the estimated NAIRU is 5.4 percent in 1960, peaks at 6.8 percent in

1979, and falls to 4.9 percent in 2000.            These results are broadly

similar to those of Gordon and Staiger et al.                    The apparent

increase in the NAIRU before 1980 and decline thereafter has been

widely recognized.        These movements have motivated papers with

titles such as "Why Is Unemployment So Very High..." in the 1980s

(Summers, 1986), and as "Why Has Unemployment Fallen" more recently

(Shimer, 1998).

       While there is a consensus that the NAIRU fell during the

1980s and 1990s, this consensus took some time to develop.                   The

falling NAIRU was initially obscured by the run-up of actual

unemployment in the recession of the early 1990s.              Starting in the

mid-1990s, many authors pointed out a run of favorable shifts in

the   Phillips   curve,    but    these     were   sometimes   interpreted    as

transitory supply shocks--that is, decreases in U*+(v/a) were

interpreted as movements in v rather than U*.            This interpretation

was supported by direct evidence of favorable shocks during the

period 1995-98, such as a fall in energy prices and a strengthening

of the exchange rate, which reduced import prices (see, e.g.,

Gordon, 1998).    Yet the period after 1998 did not see additional

favorable shocks, and indeed energy prices moved back up.             Because

unemployment was low through 2000 without accelerating inflation,

a consensus emerged that the NAIRU had fallen.

      On the other hand, the magnitude of the NAIRU decrease is hard


                                       17
to estimate.        As illustrated above, it depends on an arbitrary

decision about how much to smooth the NAIRU series.                   The precise

timing of movements in the NAIRU is also unclear.                 Our estimated

movements are smooth, with the decrease occurring slowly over

almost two decades.          Yet this is an artifact of our smoothing

procedure.    A number of authors have suggested that the NAIRU was

fairly constant from the 1980s to the mid-90s, and then fell

sharply in the late-90s "New Economy."             Perhaps this is true, and

our procedure artificially smooths out the fall in U*.                  There are

limits   to   how    much   how    one    can   learn   about   the   NAIRU    from

unemployment and inflation data alone.


3. The Falling NAIRU: A More Employable Labor Force?

    Many authors have sought to explain the movements in the U.S.

NAIRU.    This section and the next review some of the leading

hypotheses, with a focus on those that might explain the declining

NAIRU of the 1990s.         Some of these theories also help explain the

earlier NAIRU increase.

     We begin in this section by reviewing stories that focus on

the changing composition of the labor force.              Economists have long

recognized that unemployment rates are different for different

kinds of workers, depending for example on their skills and their

intensity of job search.          Thus, changes in the sizes of groups with

relatively    high    or    low   rates   of    unemployment    can   change    the

aggregate unemployment rate, even without changes in the rate for

any individual group.         In recent years, a number of authors have


                                          18
suggested   changes    in   the    labor    force    that   reduce    aggregate

unemployment by reducing the sizes of high-unemployment groups.


Older Workers

         The    most   obvious    reason    the     labor   force    changes   is

demographics.    In seeking to explain the evolution of the NAIRU, a

number of authors point to a particular type of shift: the changing

age structure as the baby boom generation has moved through the

labor force.    The proportion of the labor force aged 16-24 rose

from 17 percent in 1960 to 24 percent in 1978 as the baby boomers

entered the labor force as young workers, and this percentage fell

to 16 percent in 2000 as the boomers have aged.              These trends are

potentially     important    because       young     workers    have     higher

unemployment rates than older workers: over 1960-2000, the average

unemployment rate was 12.2 percent for workers 16-24 and 4.4

percent for workers 25+.         Gordon has argued that the increase in

young workers accounts for much of the increase in the NAIRU before

1980, and Shimer (1998) argues that the recent decrease explains

much of the NAIRU fall.

     The classic method for measuring the effects of demographic

changes is to compute a "Perry-weighted" unemployment rate (Perry,

1970; Katz and Krueger, 1998).             This is a weighted average of

unemployment rates for different demographic groups with fixed

weights; by contrast, the usual aggregate unemployment rate has

weights equal to labor-force shares, which change over time.                   A

time series for Perry-weighted unemployment shows what would have


                                      19
happened to the unemployment rate given the evolution of each

group's unemployment if the sizes of groups did not change.

         Following Staiger et el. (2001), we compute Perry-weighted

unemployment based on 14 age-sex groups, with weights based on

average labor-force shares over 1960-2000.      We then compute our

estimates of the time-varying NAIRU from unemployment and inflation

data using the same method as in Figure 1 -- but using the Perry-

weighted unemployment series.    Figure 2 shows the resulting series

(based on an HP smoothing parameter of 1000), along with the

corresponding series based on the standard unemployment rate; the

differences between the two series show the impact of demographics.

The Figure shows that this impact has been modest. The hump-shaped

pattern of the NAIRU remains after Perry-weighting, although it is

dampened: the increase from 1960 to the peak and the decrease to

2000 are 0.9 points and 1.3 points respectively, compared to 1.4

and 1.9 with the standard unemployment rate. Thus the broad trends

in the NAIRU remain to be explained even after one adjusts for

demographics.4




     4
       The Perry-weighting procedure assumes that demographics
affect labor force shares but not the unemployment rates of
individual groups. This assumption has been questioned by Shimer
(1998, 2001), who discusses a number of channels through which
changing supplies of old and young workers can affect their
unemployment rates. Shimer's 1998 paper argues that a younger
labor force raises unemployment among the young, but his 2001
paper argues that it reduces unemployment for both age groups.
If the later paper is correct, then differences between Perry-
weighted and standard unemployment rates give an upper bound on
the effects of demographics.

                                  20
Disability and Incarceration

       The labor force can also change if government policies cause

people to leave it.    The aggregate unemployment rate falls if the

labor-force leavers are workers who otherwise would have high

unemployment rates.    Recent work has noted two policy shifts that

work in this direction: the rising rate of incarceration (Katz and

Krueger, 1999) and the greater generosity of disability insurance

(Autor and Duggan, 2001).     People who are removed from the labor

force by being locked up or through certification of disability are

likely to have experienced high unemployment rates while in the

labor force.

       Of these two factors, disability appears more important.        The

percentage of non-elderly adults receiving government disability

insurance has risen steadily from 3.1 percent in 1984 to 5.3

percent in 2000.    Autor and Duggan attribute this rise to reduced

stringency in the screening of applicants and to a higher income-

replacement ratio.     They estimate the impact on unemployment by

examining the effects of variation in the disability program across

states.    They find that the total effect of changes in the program

has been to reduce aggregate unemployment by 0.65 percentage points

from 1984 to 2000.

        Katz and Krueger have observed that lower unemployment can

reflect greater incarceration.       However, while incarceration rates

rose    dramatically   in   the     1990s,   the   effect   on   aggregate

unemployment was modest.          Katz and Krueger estimate that this

factor produced a total decrease in unemployment of 0.17 percentage


                                     21
points.

     Adding the effects of disability and incarceration yields a

total reduction in unemployment of roughly 0.8 percentage points.

This is a bit more than half of the decrease in the NAIRU in Figure

2 when unemployment is Perry-weighted.     However, recall that the

estimated fall in the NAIRU is larger if the HP smoothing parameter

is set lower than 1000, in which case disability and incarceration

can explain a smaller fraction of the decline.

     The likely role of a changing labor force in explaining the

NAIRU decrease depends on the timing of the decrease.         As we

discussed above, some economists suggest that the NAIRU fell

sharply since 1995, although the aggregate data are also consistent

with a gradual decrease since the early 1980s.      If there was in

fact a sharp shift from 1995 to 2000, the factors discussed so far

cannot be the main explanation. The changes in disability benefits

and incarceration are long-term trends, and only a small part of

the changes have occurred after 1995.    And the aging of the labor

force was almost complete by 1995: the percentage aged 16-24

reached a trough of 15.8% in 1997 and has since risen slightly.

The difference between Perry-weighted and standard unemployment

rates fell only 0.2 points from 1992 to 2000.     If the NAIRU fell

significantly in the late 90s, we must look beyond the nature of

the labor force to find the explanation.   This brings us to another

set of theories.




                                22
4. The Falling NAIRU: A New Economy?

       The NAIRU can change not only because of changes in the labor

force, but also because of broader changes in the economy.               In the

second half of the 1990s, many observers alleged the advent of a

"New       Economy"--one   with   new   technologies,   higher   productivity

growth, increased "competitiveness," and so on.               If one believes

that the NAIRU fell significantly in the period after 1995, it is

natural to suspect a link between this fact and the broader changes

in the economy. We now discuss several leading stories along these

lines.5


Greater Openness to Trade

       One story about the favorable Phillips curve shift is that it

resulted from the "globalization" of the U.S. economy -- the

greater       openness   to   foreign   trade   (see,   for   example,   Thurow

[1998]). This argument starts with the fact that foreign trade has

become more important in the United States in recent decades: the

ratios of imports and exports to GDP have trended up.                      Some
observers argue that this integration into the world economy has

subjected U.S. firms to greater competition. This in turn is anti-

       5
       In addition to the stories we mention, some people have
noted declines in unionization and the real minimum wage, and
welfare reform. There appears to be a consensus, however, that
these are not major factors. Changes in unionization and minimum
wages were modest in the 1990s. Welfare reform affected a
sizable number of workers -- roughly one million women have left
the welfare rolls since 1994. However, most of these women were
out of the labor force while on welfare. By joining the labor
force, they are likely to have raised the unemployment rate
slightly, because the incidence of unemployment is higher for
them than for the average worker.

                                        23
inflationary: even if unemployment is low, firms cannot raise

prices    aggressively   because   consumers   will   switch    to   foreign

suppliers.    In mainstream terminology, this means that the NAIRU

has fallen.

         Many journalists have picked up on this idea, but it has

largely been ignored by academic economists. And they have ignored

it, we believe, for good reason.         The theoretical logic of the

story is questionable, but the main problem is empirical. The U.S.

has become more open in the last decade, with the import-GDP ratio

rising from 11 percent in 1990 to 15 percent in 2000.           But this is

not a feature of the New Economy but rather a continuation of a

trend through most of the period since World War II.            The import-

GDP ratio was 5 percent in 1950.         If greater openness produces

lower unemployment, we should have seen a steady downward trend in

the NAIRU for the last 50 years, and this hasn't occurred.           Indeed,

the decade with the largest increase in the import-GDP ratio was

the 1970s, and as shown in Figure 1, this decade saw a substantial

increase in the NAIRU.


Better Job Matching

        One reason for unemployment is job turnover.           When workers

move from jobs that disappear to those that open up, the process

creates unemployment because it takes workers time to find new

jobs.    Several authors suggest that this process improved in the

1990s, leading to lower unemployment.

    The most common version of this story focuses on the growth in

                                    24
the temporary-help industry (e.g. Katz and Krueger; Cohen et al.,

2001). The percentage of workers employed by temporary-help firms,

such as Manpower Inc., rose from 1.1% in 1989 to 2.2% in 1998.

This suggests that an increasing number of workers who are between

permanent jobs are employed as temps rather than unemployed.     In

addition, temp jobs sometimes turn into permanent jobs, so temp

agencies help speed up the process of permanent job matching.

    However, when researchers try to quantify the effects of temp

agencies on unemployment, the results are disappointing. Both Katz

and Krueger and Staiger et al.(2001) examine the relation across

states between unemployment and the size of the temp industry.

Katz and Krueger estimate that the growth of the temp industry in

the 1990s reduced aggregate unemployment by anywhere from zero to

0.4 percentage points.    Staiger et al. fail to find a robust

relation between the temp industry and unemployment rates.   Thus,

stories about the falling NAIRU based on the temp industry remain

speculative at best.

     It is possible that the process of job matching improved in

ways beyond the growth of the temp industry.   Cohen et al. (2001)

suggest that the New Economy features production processes that put

a greater emphasis on general rather than specific skills.     As a

result, workers have become more interchangeable, making it easier

to match workers and jobs and thereby reducing unemployment.     As

evidence for this idea, Cohen et al. cite the management literature

and interviews with human resource managers.       It is an open

question, however, whether this phenomenon has had a sizable effect


                                25
on the aggregate unemployment rate.


The Productivity Acceleration

       A central feature of the New Economy of the late 1990s was a

rise in the growth rate of labor productivity.                 Average growth in

output per hour of work was 1.5 percent over 1974-1995 and rose to

2.6 percent over 1996-2000. Most explanations of this change focus

on the increased use of computers and the internet (for example,

see the Symposium on productivity growth in JEP, Fall 2000).                    For

our purposes, a key fact about the productivity acceleration is

that    it   started   in   the   mid-90s,     around    the    same   time    that

researchers     started     detecting   a    decline    in   the   NAIRU.      This

coincidence suggests a link between the two phenomena.

       Such a link is also suggested by the experience of the 1970s.

This was the beginning of the infamous "productivity slowdown":

average productivity growth fell to its 1974-95 average of 1.5

percent after an average of 3.3 percent over 1948-73. As discussed

above, the 1970s were also a period of a rising NAIRU.                 If there is

a link between shifts in productivity growth and in the NAIRU, it

may help explain both the rising NAIRU of the 1970s and the falling

NAIRU of the 1990s.

       Such a link was suggested by students of the rising NAIRU in

the 1970s, notably Grubb et. al (1982) and Braun (1984).                      These

authors present a particular explanation for the link, one resting

on the idea that "wage aspirations" adjust slowly to shifts in

productivity     growth.       The   concept    of   wage    aspirations      is   a


                                        26
departure from the neoclassical theory of the labor market, but it

builds     on   research     by   psychologists    and    industrial-relations

specialists.      The story goes as follows.6

      In a steady state with constant growth of labor productivity,

the   growth     of   real    wages    is    determined    by   the   growth   of

productivity, as suggested by neoclassical theory (and empirical

evidence).      In such a situation, workers come to view the rate of

real-wage increase that they receive as normal and fair, and to

expect it to continue.            If productivity growth falls, as in the

1970s, fundamentals dictate that real-wage growth must fall as

well.     Workers resist this decrease, however; they try to maintain

the wage increases to which they are accustomed.                 To the extent

that workers have some influence over wages, this means that wage

setters will try to achieve real-wage increases above the level

that can be sustained by productivity growth.                    This mismatch

between real-wage aspirations and productivity growth worsens the

inflation-unemployment tradeoff.             In other words, the NAIRU rises.

          This story received attention in the early 1980s and then

faded from prominence.            It has been resurrected in the last few

years, as many economists have noticed the parallel between the

1970s and the 1990s.          Today's version of the story reverses the

signs.       Productivity has accelerated but workers have become

accustomed to the slow wage growth since the 1970s.               A mismatch of

productivity and wage aspirations in this direction shifted the

      6
       Of course, a more classical story linking productivity and
employment is the real business cycle theory of Long and Plosser
(1983) and Prescott (1986). For a critique, see Mankiw (1989).

                                        27
Phillips curve favorably.     This story is told, for example, by

Blinder (2000), DeLong (2000), and the 2000 Economic Report of the

President.7

     Following Staiger et al. (2001) and Ball and Moffitt (2001),

we examine data on unemployment and productivity growth to see

whether they fit the story.       Figure 3 shows the NAIRU series from

Figure 1; again there are two versions corresponding to different

smoothing     parameters.   The    Figure   also   shows   the   trend   in

productivity growth, obtained with the HP filter and with the same

smoothing parameters used to create the NAIRU series. Productivity

growth is shown on an inverted scale to make it easier to see the

negative comovement between the two trends.         One can see broadly

similar patterns in the two trends, although the match between them

is far from perfect.

    One important subtlety is that the rate of productivity growth

is not exactly the relevant variable in the story discussed above.

In a steady state, wage aspirations adjust to any growth rate.

What causes a Phillips-curve shift is a change in productivity
growth, because aspirations are tied to wage growth and hence

     7
       The shifts in the Phillips curve that occur in this story
are eventually reversed when wage aspirations adjust to the new
rate of productivity growth. This creates some ambiguity about
the right way to describe the shifts. As we discussed earlier,
the Phillips curve can move because of either a transitory
"supply shock" or a change in the NAIRU, and the distinction
between the two is based on a fuzzy notion of persistence. Since
a Phillips-curve shift caused by a productivity speedup
eventually goes away, one might call it a supply shock. We
prefer to call it a change in the NAIRU, however, because the
shift can last for many years. In particular, it lasts long
enough to influence the NAIRU series in Figure 1, which filters
out the year-to-year effects of supply shocks.

                                    28
productivity growth in the past.       Therefore, following Ball and

Moffitt (2001), we examine the gap between current productivity

growth and a long moving average of past growth (one that depends

on productivity growth into the distant past, but with greater

weight on recent observations).   This gap, like other variables in

the Figures, is smoothed with the HP filter to extract a trend.

Figure 4 graphs this trend along with our NAIRU series.    Here, the

comovement is closer than when we examine the pure productivity

growth rate.8

         Two details of these graphs deserve notice.      First, our

inverted gap variable peaks in the early 80s and starts declining,

as does the NAIRU.     This occurs even though, as shown in the

previous figure, actual productivity growth does not accelerate

until the 1990s.    This suggests an effect discussed by Stiglitz

(1997): a catchup of wage aspirations to the productivity slowdown.

In Stiglitz's story, the ongoing experience of the productivity

slowdown caused wage aspirations to fall slowly, so the gap between

aspirations and productivity narrowed over the slow-growth era.
This narrowing caused the NAIRU to start falling; the fall was then

magnified when productivity growth accelerated.

   A related point is that the trend in our gap variable falls to

its lowest level at the end of our sample -- as does the NAIRU,

enhancing the fit of the two series.       In contrast, productivity

     8
       If we denote productivity growth by g, the productivity
variable in Figure 4 is g - (1-b)[g(-1) + bg(-2) + b2g(-3) +
...]. That is, the weighted average of past productivity growth
in the expression has exponentially declining weights. The
parameter b, which gives the rate of decline, is set at 0.95.

                                  29
growth rises at the end of the sample, but is still below its level

in the 1960s.        That is, what is special about the New Economy of

the late 1990s is not the rate of productivity growth, which was

higher thirty years before, but the increase relative to the recent

past.     The       high   productivity   growth    of   the   sixties   was    a

continuation of high growth since World War II; wage aspirations

had largely adjusted, so there was little effect on the Phillips

curve.    In contrast, the Phillips curve shifted favorably in the

late 1990s because of the combination of high contemporaneous

growth and low growth in the preceding two decades.

    The productivity-based explanation for the declining NAIRU is

related   to    a    common   explanation   in     the   popular   press.      In

explaining why inflation failed to accelerate in the late 1990s

despite low unemployment, many journalists cite the productivity

acceleration.         Their story goes as follows.          According to the

Phillips curve, low unemployment puts upward pressure on wage

growth, which feeds into inflation.           Low unemployment has led to

more rapid wage growth. However, the productivity acceleration has
reduced firms' costs, offsetting the increases from rapid wage

growth.   Because overall costs have not accelerated, inflation has

not had to rise.9
     This story has common-sense appeal.             It does not contain any


     9
       For example, Louis Uchitelle (2000) discusses "the concern
that low unemployment drives up wages and, in turn, prices." In
explaining why inflation has not risen, he points to
"improvements in productivity, effectively giving employers more
revenue to pay for raises without raising prices." Uchitelle
attributes this idea to Alan Greenspan.

                                      30
explicit role for slow adjustment of wage aspirations, but such a

role is in fact implicit.        In a neoclassical world, a rise in

productivity growth has no obvious effect on inflation, because

higher productivity is reflected fully in higher real wages.              The

idea that a productivity acceleration reduces firm' costs depends

on the implicit assumption that wages do not adjust fully to

productivity movements.       Thus the idea of slowly-adjusting wage

aspirations provides an underpinning for a common journalistic

explanation for the recent experience.10


5. The Beveridge Curve

   In analyzing the labor market, a complement to the Phillips

curve is the Beveridge curve, which has recently been emphasized by

Blanchard and Diamond (1989).            The Beveridge curve shows the

relationships     between   unemployment   (workers   without     jobs)   and

vacancies (jobs without workers).           The Beveridge curve slopes

downward     in   unemployment-vacancy     space   because   an    economic

expansion that reduces unemployment also raises vacancies, as firms
have trouble finding workers in a tighter labor market.

    Like the Phillips curve, the Beveridge curve appears to shift

over time.    Figure 5 plots unemployment and job-vacancy rates for

     10
       The productivity hypothesis is also somewhat related to
another popular story: Alan Greenspan (1997) has suggested that
workers, cowed by job insecurity, lacked aggressiveness in wage
negotiations. As discussed by Katz and Krueger (1999), there is
no evidence to support an exogenous shift in workers' perceptions
of job security. But what matters is aggressiveness of wage
seekers relative to productivity growth. Failure to increase
aggressiveness when productivity accelerates has the same effect
on the NAIRU as an exogenous decrease in aggressiveness.

                                    31
annual U.S. data from 1960 through 1998.           The vacancy series is

taken from Cohen et al. (2001), who, following Abraham (1987),

estimate the level of vacancies based on help-wanted advertising in

newspapers.       In the figure, there appear to be stable Beveridge

curves    with    different   intercepts   in   different   periods.    The

Beveridge curve shifted outward from the period 1960-69 to the

period 1975-85, and shifted sharply inward after 1990.                 This

pattern of an unfavorable shift in the 1970s and a favorable shift

in the 1990s corresponds to the broad pattern of Phillips-curve

shifts, as measured by time-varying NAIRU estimates.11

     These facts suggest that movements in the Phillips curve and

the Beveridge curve are linked.           A number of authors, including

Katz and Krueger and Cohen et al., argue that such a link helps

isolate the right explanation for the recent fall in the NAIRU --

in particular, that it points towards stories about improved job

matching.        In theoretical work, the Beveridge curve is often

derived from search models of the labor market, where frictions in

matching jobs and workers produce unemployment and vacancies (e.g.
Pissarides, 2000).      In these models, improvements in the matching

technology cause the Beveridge curve to shift in.           Thus the recent

behavior of the Beveridge curve is consistent with the existence of

such improvements, arising for example from the growth of the

temporary help industry.

    Yet we doubt that the Beveridge curve is informative about the

     11
       Cohen et al. stop in 1998 because the rise of internet
advertising makes the newspaper help-wanted index an unreliable
measure of vacancies in recent years.

                                     32
sources of NAIRU movements.          Although the shift in the curve is

consistent with improved matching technology, it is also consistent

with other explanations for the falling NAIRU.               For example,

suppose the NAIRU falls because workers who do not search hard for

jobs   become    incarcerated   or   receive   disability   benefits   and,

therefore, drop out of the labor force.        This reduces unemployment

but has little effect on vacancies, because these workers were

unlikely to fill jobs anyway.         Or suppose the NAIRU falls because

wage aspirations fall relative to productivity growth.         This makes

workers more willing to take jobs when wages are a given level

relative to productivity.       When workers take jobs more readily,

both unemployment and vacancies fall, and again the Beveridge curve

shifts in.      As these examples illustrate, most plausible stories

about a shifting Phillips curve can explain a shifting Beveridge

curve as well.      Thus, the fact that the Beveridge curve shifted

inward after 1985 says little about why NAIRU fell.

       This argument is strengthened by the fact that the Beveridge

curve shifted outward in the 1970s, when the NAIRU rose.               While

some authors suggest that the matching technology has improved

recently, to our knowledge no one has argued that it deteriorated

in   the   1970s.     The   relationship    between   Phillips-curve    and

Beveridge-curve shifts appears to hold consistently over time, but

it does not tell us much about why these shifts occur.



6. Conclusion

       The NAIRU--or its approximate synonym, the natural rate of

                                      33
unemployment--is an important building block of business cycle

theory. Few economists would deny that shifts in aggregate demand,

such   as   those      driven   by    monetary    policy,    push   inflation   and

unemployment in opposite directions, at least in the short run.

That is all one needs to believe to accept the NAIRU concept.

       The practical application is this concept, however, is less

straightforward.           The value of NAIRU is hard to measure, largely

because it changes over time.            The economy experiences many kinds

of shocks that influence inflation and unemployment.                  In light of

this fact, it would be remarkable if the level of unemployment

consistent with stable inflation were easy to measure.

       There is no shortage of hypotheses to explain what causes the

NAIRU to change over time and, in particular, why it fell during

the    1990s.    The    available      evidence   is   too   weak    to   establish

decisively which hypothesis is right, but the literature on the

NAIRU has made progress.              Demography and government policy both

play some role. In addition, changes in productivity growth appear

to shift the inflation-unemployment tradeoff.                 In the past, most

macroeconomists studying the Phillips curve have concentrated their

attention       on   the    dynamic    relationship    between      inflation   and

unemployment.        In the future, they should expand their scope to

build and test models of inflation, unemployment, and productivity.
