¸

This paper investigates the effects of expanding public health insurance eligibility for older children.
Using data from the National Health Interview Surveys from 1986 to 2005, we first show that although
income continues to be an important predictor of children’s health status, the importance of income
for predicting health has fallen for children 9 to 17 in recent years. We then investigate the extent
to which the dramatic expansions in public health insurance coverage for these children in the past
decade are responsible for the decline in the importance of income. We find that while eligibility for
public health insurance unambiguously improves current utilization of preventive care, it has little
effect on current health status. However, we find some evidence that Medicaid eligibility in early
childhood has positive effects on future health. This may indicate that adequate medical care early
on puts children on a better health trajectory, resulting in better health as they grow.

1. Introduction

     Children of wealthier parents are healthier than other children. This relationship

is apparent in key indicators of child health, such as activity limitations, asthma, and

mental health problems (Currie and Lin, 2007; Newacheck, 1994) . Poor health in

childhood is likely to affect adult well-being both directly, through its effects on

health, and indirectly, through inhibiting the child’s accumulation of human capital.

Since 17 percent of all U.S. children under age 18 live in families with income below

the Federal poverty level, it is essential to have a better understanding of the

mechanisms underlying the relationship between income and health (U.S. Bureau of

the Census, 2004).

     Expanding health insurance for low income children continues to be a main goal

of U.S. health policy for children. The primary policy tool aimed at meeting this goal

has been liberalization of the eligibility criteria for public health insurance.

Previous research has shown that expansions in eligibility of infants and young

children for public health insurance have been effective in improving their health and

access to care (Currie and Gruber, 1996b; Dafny and Gruber, 2005; Mathematica

Policy Research Inc., et al., 2005).

     This paper investigates the effects of expanding public health insurance

eligibility on the health of older U.S. children.   Older children are an especially

interesting group because income becomes an increasingly important determinant of

health as children grow older .    We show, using data from the National Health

Interview Surveys for 1986 to 2005, that the importance of income for predicting

health has fallen for children 9 to 17 in recent years.

     What explains this decline in the importance of income?        It is natural to think of

the dramatic expansions in public health insurance coverage for these children which

                                            3
have occurred over the past decade.      If access to health insurance mitigates the

health effects of low income, then one might expect to find that the relationship

between income and health has weakened among the targeted older children. This

improvement in health could stem either from the contemporaneous effects of gaining

health insurance coverage, or from the lagged effects of having been covered at

younger ages. Thus, in our analysis, we look at both present and lagged effects of

public health insurance expansions.

     The paper proceeds as follows. First, we present some background about the

Medicaid expansions, describe the data, and document the reduction in the importance

of income for the health of older children after 1996. Then, we explore the extent to

which expansions of public health insurance eligibility to these children have been

responsible for improvements in their health and access to care.

     We find that while eligibility for public health insurance unambiguously

improves current utilization of preventive care, it has little effect on current health

status.   However, we find some evidence that Medicaid eligibility in early childhood

has positive future effects on health.   This may indicate that adequate medical care

early on puts children on a better health trajectory, resulting in better health at older

ages.



2. Background

     As of the early 1980s, public health insurance under the Medicaid program was

available primarily to children of welfare mothers, which meant that the income

cutoffs for program eligibility were below the poverty line in many states.

Beginning in 1984, Congress expanded Medicaid coverage to pregnant women,

infants and younger children not on welfare.     By April 1990, states were required to

offer coverage to children below age six in families with income up to 133 percent of

                                            4
the federal poverty line.   This meant that young children had access to public health

insurance while older children in similarly situated families did not.

     However, since the passage of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA)

of 1990, the focus of the Medicaid expansions has shifted to older children. OBRA

1990 required states to increase the eligibility of older children by covering one

additional year of age per year. Starting in July 1991, states were required to provide

coverage to all children under age 19, who were born after September 1983 and lived

in households with incomes less than 100% of the Federal Poverty Line. Hence, all

poor children under age 18 were covered by 2001.
     The State Child Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) initiated in 1996 provided an

additional source of public health insurance coverage for low income children.

Under SCHIP, states have had the option of extending Medicaid, creating a new

SCHIP insurance program, or offering a combination. Medicaid and SCHIP work

somewhat differently. Medicaid is an entitlement, which means that all eligible

children are covered, while SCHIP is a block grant. Under SCHIP, if the states run

out of money, then they put people on a waiting list.

     Still, the evidence suggests that Medicaid and SCHIP have had similar impacts

on the lack of insurance among children (LoSasso and Buchmueller, 2004). In

analyses which are not shown below, we tried to distinguish between the effects of

Medicaid and SCHIP programs, but did not see differential impacts on the outcomes

we examine.    Consequently, in this paper we do not distinguish between these two

programs.

     Table 1 shows the weighted average of the income eligibility cutoffs for public

health insurance across states as a percentage of the federal poverty line for each year




                                           5
and child age group1. We initially examined four age groups: 0-3, 4-8, 9-12, and

14-17 in order to divide children into roughly equally sized groups. The Medicaid

income eligibility cutoff differs by state, year, child age, and in some cases it also

depends on a child’s birth month and year. For simplicity, the table only shows the

average cutoffs aggregated by child age group over years, weighted by the population

in each cell.    As is apparent from Table 1, Medicaid expansions for younger children

started before expansions for older children.          The first year in which the average

cutoff for 0 to 3 year old children reached 100% of the federal poverty line was 1989.

In 1990, the average cutoff for 4 to 8 year old children reached 100%, while the

average cutoffs for children 9 to 12 and 13 to 17 reached 100% in 1994 and 1997,

respectively. If contemporaneous health insurance is a major determinant of

children’s health status, then one might expect to see health improve in the same

staggered way across these age groups.

     Even though the Medicaid expansions started later for older children, the

expansion for older children in the past 10 years has been dramatic. In 1996, the

average child aged 0 to 3 was covered if his or her household income was under 155%

of the Federal Poverty Line (FPL), but the average 12 to 17 year old child was only

covered if he or she lived in a household with income under 94% of the FPL.

However, due to the rapid expansions for older children in the past 10 years, by 2005

the eligibility cutoffs had converged to 220% of the FPL for all children.

     As a source of identification, we rely on the fact that the expansions in

Medicaid/SCHIP eligibility for older children relative to younger children have

happened at different times and with different magnitudes in different states.

Although there is significant variation across child age groups over time, Table 1


1
  Data on eligibility are collected from several sources including National Governors Association
(2003), Cohen-Ross and Cox (2005), and Rosenbach et al. (2001).

                                                  6
masks the fact that there is also a great deal variation from state to state. To illustrate

this point, it is instructive to compare eligibility cutoffs in for several states, as shown

in Figure 1.     Figure 1 shows the eligibility cutoffs by child age group over time for

California, Illinois, New York, and Texas. These states were chosen for illustrative

purposes since they are all large and important states and they show quite different

time patterns.

       California is a relatively generous state and covered all poor children over the

entire period we examine.      Gaps between older and younger children in terms of

income eligibility cutoffs were relatively small, and the cutoff converged to 250% of

poverty by 2000 for all children. Illinois was less generous, and had larger age gaps

in eligibility cutoffs over much of the period. The oldest children were covered only

if their incomes were below about 60% of the FPL until 1997, when cutoffs for all

groups rapidly began to converge to just below 200% of the FPL. New York shows

a bumpier pattern, with cutoffs first rising and then declining for the youngest age

groups, and with cutoffs for all ages converging to 250% of the FPL by 2001.

Finally, Texas shows the largest gaps between the cutoffs for older children (less than

50% of the FPL) and the cutoffs for younger children (150% of the FPL) over much

of the period. But as in other states, in 2001, cutoffs converge to about 200% of the

FPL.

       Figure 2 shows the huge overall increase in public health insurance for children

that has taken place since the mid-1980s. The figure shows that the expansion of

Medicaid alone and of Medicaid plus SCHIP moved roughly in parallel after 1996,

and that over the entire period, the fraction of children eligible for public health

insurance expanded from less than 10% to over 25%.

3. Data

       In our analysis, we use data from the 1986 to 2005 National Health Interview

Survey (NHIS)2. The NHIS is an annual cross-sectional survey that provides

information on health status and demographic attributes of a large sample of

American adults and children. The NHIS follows a multistage probability design using

geographically defined sampling units to select a nationally representative sample of

households for interview. Our analysis spanned two sample design periods of the

NHIS: 1986-1994, and 1995-2005. Our analyses used the NHIS public use file

variance estimation variables that are available for pooled NHIS data for 1986-1994,

1995-1996, and 1997-2005.

       We are interested in the potential impact of expansions of eligibility for public

health insurance on the relationship between family income and health status and on

the use of health services among children.            Our dependent variable for health status

follows the previous literature on child income-health gradients, and considers the

parent’s report of whether the overall health status of the child is excellent, very good,

good, fair, or poor. We also use this variable to examine whether a child is in less

than excellent health (a little less than half of children fall into this category).

       To investigate the effect of public health insurance expansions on the utilization

of healthcare for children, we ask whether or not a child had any doctor visits in the

previous year. A potential problem with interpreting utilization measures is that they

confound access and morbidity. One way to surmount this problem is to focus on

utilization that is explicitly preventive, and therefore unaffected by morbidity.

Pediatric best-practice recommends at least one doctor’s visit per year for children;

therefore, we interpret the absence of a doctor’s visit in the previous year as a true

access problem whatever the underlying morbidity.

     Since we are interested in the potential impact of Medicaid/SCHIP eligibility on

the relationship between family income and child health and the use of health

services, family income is a key independent variable in our analysis. A potential

concern that emerges from using the NHIS data is that income information is missing

for an average of 14.7% of our sample. We impute income for those who are

missing data. For 1990 to 2005, we use the income imputation files created by

NCHS. For data prior to 1990, we impute income using methods similar to those used

by NCHS.      A second issue is that the NHIS reports household income in ranges.

We assign incomes to households within reported or imputed income ranges by using

the 1986 to 2005 March Current Population Survey (CPS) data.

     An online appendix describes how we impute income for 1986-1989 and how we

assign an exact income to income ranges for 1986-2005. It also shows estimates

obtained using a consistent income imputation method over the full sample, and that

they do not differ from those reported below. Finally, the appendix discusses some

issues having to do with the redesign of the NHIS survey in 1997.

     In addition to examining children’s health and use of health services as a

function of the (log of) income (in 1986 dollars), we control for other known

determinants of children’s health and health care utilization including (the log of)

family size, child gender, and indicators for race and ethnicity (whether the child was

non-Hispanic white, black or other race, or Hispanic); dummies for each year of child

age; dummies for each survey year; whether the mother (father) was present in the

household; whether the mother (father) had less than 12, 12, or more than 12 years of

education interacted with whether the mother (father) was present in the household;

mother (father) age interacted with whether the mother (father) was present in the

household; and whether the mother (father) was unemployed interacted with whether

the mother (father) was present in the household.

                                           9
     Because we use a restricted version of the NHIS data that includes state

identifiers, we are able to both match information about state Medicaid rules to the

children in the sample, and to control for state fixed effects in the analysis. The

inclusion of the state fixed effects to capture time-invariant characteristics of the state

is potentially important when we attempt to estimate the casual effects of Medicaid

expansions.

     In drawing our final sample for analysis, we first consider all children under the

age of 18 resulting in 548,789 children in the NHIS 1986-2005. We drop

approximately 1 percent of the sample (6,613 records) for which income imputations

were not provided or income could not be computed due to missing information on

variables used to impute income. For the sake of comparability with previous work,

we then follow Case, Lubotsky, and Paxson (2002) in finalizing our sample for

analysis. We drop children who were not living with at least one of their parents, who

were not children of a reference person or spouse, or were living in a household

containing more than one family. These sample restrictions result in dropping about

9 percent (48,621) of the original sample of 542,176 children with nonmissing

information on family income. We do this both for comparability with previous

work and because there may be some doubt about whether reported family income

accurately reflects the income over which the child may have a claim in the less

standard households.    Dropping these children also allows us to consider parental

age, education and employment status as independent variables in predicting child

health.   Identification of parents is not possible for all children of non-reference

person parents in the NHIS prior to 1998. Among the remaining 493,555 children,

we again follow Case, Lubtsky, and Paxson (2002) and drop about 1.7 percent of

children in households where children in the household are reported to be of different

race since we believe that race may sometimes be mismeasured in these cases or that

                                            10
the children are being fostered.   Of the remaining children, we drop about 2.7

percent due to missing information on variables such as race, parental attributes,

family size, and self-reported health, or because of a birth month and year that did not

match the reported age of the child in years.   Our final sample size for health status

is 474,164 children under the age of 18 from the NHIS 1986-2005. (Our final

sample size for doctor visits is 376,889. The sample size for doctor visits is smaller

because, beginning in 1997, the question on doctor visits is asked only of a subset of

children in the NHIS – sample children.)

     Because the children in our sample may not be a random sample of the NHIS

children, we have performed all of the analyses in this paper including the 48,621

children dropped due to reasons related to family structure.   As shown in the

appendix, none of the analyses in this paper were materially affected.

     Summary statistics for key variables by child age group (using the age categories

of 0-3, 4-8, 9-13 and 14-17) and by period are provided in Table 2. The top panel

refers to the period 1986 to 1995 (Period 1), and the bottom panel covers the period

1996 to 2005 (Period 2). The first six rows in each panel of Table 2 show the means of

the dependent variables. For example, the first row of each panel reports the mean for

self reported health (with values 1= Excellent, 2= Very good, 3= Good, 4= Fair and

5=Poor). The second row reports the mean for self reported health, but only for

children who live under 100% of the Federal Poverty Line.

       As we can see from both panels, children’s health deteriorates with child age,

especially for children in poor families. In both periods, more than half of parents

reported their children to be in excellent health, with more parents reporting children

to be in excellent health in Period 2. Moreover, the improvement in health in Period 2

is more substantial for poor older children than for wealthier older children.

     Table 2 also shows that the percentage of children who went without any doctor

                                           11
visits in the past 12 months fell over time, indicating that children have better access

to medical care in Period 2. One thing to notice is that older children are more likely

to have lacked a doctor visit in the past 12 months than younger children, especially

poor older children.

        Subsequent rows of Table 2 show the means of the independent variables used in

our regression analysis. For instance, the mean family income is $29,726 (1986 $) in

Period 1, and it increases to $38,215 in Period 2. It is not surprising to see that older

children live in families that are richer than those of younger children. Around 20

percent of the children live without their fathers and around 2 percent are living apart

from their mothers. The sample (in Period 1) is 70 percent non-Hispanic white, 14

percent non-Hispanic black, 12 percent Hispanic, and 4 percent non-Hispanic other

race.



4. Empirical Strategy

         We began our analysis with a graphical exploration of the relationship between

income and health in four sub-periods, 1986 to 1990, 1991 to 1995, 1996 to 2000, and

2000 to 2005. We estimated the conditional expectation of health status in the NHIS

as a function of the log of family income by time period using a locally weighted

regression smoother, which allows the data to determine the shape of the function,

rather than imposing, for example, a linear or quadratic form.

        Figure 3 shows the resulting estimates for the earliest and latest sub-periods. It

is clear that at the low end of the income distribution, the lines for all four age groups

shift down considerably over time.      For the youngest and poorest children, the mean

shifts from approximately 2 to about 1.8.      For the oldest poor children it shifts from

2.2 to 2.1, where lower numbers indicate better health. At the 25th percentile of

income, the improvements are smaller for all age groups, while at the median income,

                                             12
it appears that overall health status improved slightly among the youngest children,

but worsened slightly among older children leading the lines to “fan out” slightly.

This suggests that there may be unobserved factors causing a slight deterioration of

the health of older children over the period. To the extent that these factors affect all

older children, any positive effects due to the Medicaid/SCHIP expansions to older

children will tend to be under-estimated in this type of simple comparison.

      These graphs give a good sense of underlying trends in the data, but do not

control for other covariates, or for factors that could affect the health of all children of

a given age.     Hence we turn to estimating models of the effects of income on health

status and utilization, of the form:

      (1) y = b0 + b1INC + b2INC*TIME + b3X + b4STATE + b5YEAR + e,

where y is a measure of health status or the utilization of health services of each child,

INC is household income, TIME is a vector of three time dummy variables

representing the periods 1991 to 1995, 1996 to 2000, and 2000 to 2005, X is the set of

control variables shown in Table 2 and discussed above, STATE is a vector of state

dummy variables, and YEAR is a vector of year dummies.

      We estimate these models separately for each of the four age groups, using either

ordered probits or linear probability models. All analyses in the paper use sample

weights (with person weights replaced by sample child weights for “no doctor visit in

the past year” beginning in 1997).          In addition, all analyses account for the possibility

of non-independence of observations within NHIS sampling units in the same design

period to the extent possible, by using a Taylor series linearization method for variance

estimation (Williams, 2000).3 The coefficients b2 allow us to test the hypothesis that



3
  Since the NHIS public use file variance estimation variables are different for 1995-1996 than for
1997-2005, the analysis strategy treats these two periods as distinct design periods for the purposes of
variance estimation.

                                                   13
the relationship between income and outcomes changes over time within age

categories.

     In order to test whether increases in Medicaid/SCHIP eligibility have affected the

relationship between income and children’s health, we pool age groups to take

advantage not only of variation in Medicaid/SCHIP eligibility within states over time,

but also variation within state-age groups over time. Hence we pool all child age

groups together and estimate models of the form:

     (2) y = b0 + b1PUBINS + b2INC + b3INC*AGE9-17 + b4INC*T_1996-2005 +

b5AGE9-17*T_1996-2005 + b6INC*AGE9-17*T_1996-2005+ b7X + b8STATE +

b9YEAR + b10 STATE*AGE9-17 + e,

where PUBINS indicates that the child is eligible for public health insurance,

AGE9-17 indicates that they are aged 9 to 17 and T_1996-2005 indicates that it is the

second half of our time period.    We focus on the age group 9 to 17 in these

regressions because, as we will show below, the reduced effect of income on child

health over time is apparent for the 9 to 12 and 13 to 17 year olds.

     In this model, the two-way interactions control for any differential effect of

income on the health of older children throughout the period and for differential

effects of income in the later period for all children.   We control for both state effects

and state effects interacted with child age group in order to separate any effect of

Medicaid eligibility on child health from other influences on child health that may

vary by state or state and age.

     We focus on the coefficient b6 which measures the extent to which income had a

differential effect for older children in the later period. Our hypothesis is that

Medicaid/SCHIP eligibility may explain this differential effect. Therefore, we

estimate (2) with and without PUBINS and ask whether the estimate of b6 becomes

smaller in absolute value or loses statistical significance when PUBINS is included in

                                            14
the model.    Whether or not the child is eligible for public insurance is computed by

comparing the child’s family income to the appropriate Medicaid/SCHIP income

eligibility cutoffs by state, year and child age.

     Two problems, however, may prevent us from seeing the causal effect of the

expansions. First, even though we control for observable variables that directly affect

eligibility for Medicaid, such as income, the absence of a male head, and the number

of children in a family, persons who are eligible for public health insurance may have

other unobserved characteristics that affect their health. Second, a sick child may

cause lower parental income, leading to a spurious correlation between public health

insurance eligibility and poor health.

     For these reasons, following Currie and Gruber (1996a; 1996b), we instrument

for individual Medicaid/SCHIP eligibility using an index of the generosity of the

state’s public health insurance programs.     This index is the fraction of a fixed group

of children drawn from the same age group and year who would be eligible for public

health insurance in each state.    This instrument was constructed by sampling 500

children by single year of age and calendar year from the CPS data, and then

calculating the fraction of this fixed group of children who would be eligible for

Medicaid/SCHIP in each state and year. This approach allows us to construct a

measure of public health insurance generosity for each state, year and age group that

abstracts from individual or family-level determinants of eligibility and outcomes.

     As Currie and Gruber discuss, use of this instrument assumes that the

state-to-state variations in the timing of expansions of public health insurance

generosity were independent of other factors that would influence child health and

utilization of care. Since much of the expansion was in response to federal

government mandates, as well as the creation of the federal SCHIP program, we think

this is a reasonable assumption.

                                             15
     Figure 4 summarizes the results of our calculation of the simulated instrument. It

shows the fraction of children eligible for public health insurance in each age group

and year. As in Figure 2, we see the divergence between older and younger children

which opens up in the early 1990s, and starts to close again in the late 1990s. Unlike

the eligibility cutoffs, the fractions eligible do not completely converge.            This is

partially due to the fact that older children tend to live in wealthier households.

     Finally, we are interested in seeing whether past eligibility for Medicaid affects

current health status. Since the NHIS is not a panel and does not record state of

birth, it is not possible to control for whether the child was actually eligible for

Medicaid/SCHIP at birth, or to know what state they were born in. Hence, the best

that we can do is to assume that most children remain in the state in which they were

born and examine the effect of Medicaid/SCHIP generosity. Therefore, we estimate

reduced form models where health status and whether the child had a no doctor visit

in the past year are regressed on the fraction of children who were eligible in the

child’s birth cohort and current state of residence at various ages.4            Because we are

interested in the effect of lagged health insurance eligibility on the health status of

older children, we estimate these models using only the children aged 9-17. These

models are of the form:

     (3) y = b0 + b1PUBINS + b2INC + b3INC*T_1996-2005 + b4X + b5STATE +

b6YEAR + e,

where PUBINS is now a measure of the fraction eligible for public health insurance

when the child was age 0, age 1, age 2, etc. Eligibility at each age is included in a

4
  Medicaid eligibility cutoffs prior to 1986 are calculated using AFDC rules and expressed relative to
the poverty level as in Aizer and Grogger (2003). AFDC payment standards for a family of four
were obtained back to 1969 (the year of birth for 17 years olds in NHIS 1986) from Committee on
Ways and Means (various years) and, for the early years, from the Office of Family Assistance (various
years). AFDC payment standards were obtained for all years beginning with 1969 except for 1977.
The 1977 payment standards were assumed to be equal to the mean of the 1976 and 1978 standards by
state. The fraction of children eligible for Medicaid by state, year and year was then calculated back
to 1969 using data from the CPS.

                                                 16
separate regression since there is a good deal of multicollinearity between eligibility

at various ages.



5. Results

     Table 3 presents estimates of equation (1) from an ordered probit model.       The

dependent variable consists of the parent’s overall assessment of the child’s health

status, which takes the values 1 to 5.   The negative coefficients on log family income

indicate that the higher the family income, the better the child’s health.    The

interactions between income and the later time periods are statistically significant for

the older children. For children aged 9 to 12 the importance of income is reduced in

the 2000 to 2005 period, while for children aged 13 to 17 it falls both in the 1996 to

2000 period and (by somewhat more) in the 2000 to 2005 period.         For children 13 to

17, the coefficient falls from -.22 to -.17, a decline in absolute value of almost 25%.

     Still, the pattern of coefficients in Table 3 casts some doubt on the hypothesis

that this decline in the importance of income is due primarily to public health

insurance expansions.    Given that these expansions affected the youngest children

first, one might have expected to see effects on children 4 to 8 in the 1991 to 1995

period, effects on 9 to 12 year olds in the 1996 to 2000 period, and so on.

     Table 4 shows the equivalent estimates from a linear probability model in which

the dependent variable is whether the child is in less than excellent health. The

findings are qualitatively similar, though somewhat less precisely estimated. Now,

the only statistically significant interactions are in the equation for children aged 13 to

17 and in the equation for children 4 to 8 (for 1996 to 2000). Still, the estimated

effects are sizable, reducing the effect of income from -.075 in the base period to

-.058 in 2000 to 2005 among the oldest children.

     Table 5 shows estimates of equation (1) using whether the child went without a

                                            17
doctor visit in the past year as the dependent variable. Once again, the effect of

income is negative—children with higher income are less likely to have lacked any

doctor visits during the preceding year. The interaction terms are all significantly

positive for the younger age groups, suggesting that income became a less important

determinant of having any doctor visits over time.     Among children 4 to 8, the

estimated effect changes from -.037 in 1986 to 1990 to -.014 in 2000 to 2005, more

than a 50% reduction!     By 2000-2005, 9 to 12 year old children have also

experienced a decrease in the probability of having of going without a doctor visit in

the past year.

     This pattern of effects is roughly what we would expect if the improvements in

doctor visits were due to expansions in eligibility for public health insurance. We

see improvements first in younger children, followed by improvements among

progressively older children. We do not see any significant effects in the oldest

group however, suggesting that it may take some years for the effects of the

expansions on access to be felt.

        Table 6 shows estimates of equation (2). The first three columns show

estimates from models using the probability that the child is in less than excellent

health as the dependent variable. We obtain estimates that are qualitatively similar

to those in the previous tables. The effect of income is negative, indicating that

higher income children are in better health. The effect of income is greater for older

children, but this differential declines in the later time period – in other words, the

interaction among family income, older child age, and later time period is significant

and positive.    The estimates in column (1) suggest that for older children the effect

of log income declines from -.070 to -.061 between the two periods.

     Column (2) shows estimates that add a measure of whether the child is

Medicaid/SCHIP eligible to equation (2). Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) estimates

                                            18
suggest that eligibility for public health insurance worsens health. This finding is

likely a result of a correlation between public insurance eligibility and omitted factors

indicating poor health, an explanation that is supported by the instrumental variables

estimate shown in column (3).       When we use the fraction eligible for public health

insurance in the child’s state, age, and year as an instrument, eligibility for Medicaid

or SCHIP is estimated to have a small and statistically insignificant effect of the

anticipated sign. Moreover, adding eligibility causes virtually no change in b6, the

coefficient on the triple interaction term. Hence, the results suggest that income has

become a less important determinant of the health of older children over time, but that

this does not appear to be due to increases in their contemporaneous public health

insurance eligibility.

     Columns (4) to (6) of Table 6 show estimates from model (2) where the

dependent variable is the probability that the child had no doctor visit in the previous

year. Here, b6 is not statistically significant, but individual eligibility for

Medicaid/SCHIP has a strong and significant effect, even in the OLS models. This

is consistent with Currie and Gruber (1996b). Column (6) shows that instrumenting

individual eligibility with the group fraction eligible results in an even larger

estimate—children with Medicaid/SCHIP eligibility are 6.8 percentage points less

likely to have gone without a doctor’s visit in the previous year.

     Since health is a stock, it is affected by past investments as well as current ones.

Hence, it may not be surprising if contemporaneous Medicaid/SCHIP eligibility has

little effect on overall health status. Hence, as discussed above, we estimate models

in the form of Equation (3) for the subsample of children aged 9 to 17.       The results

are shown in Table 7.

     The first panel shows estimates from models with “less than excellent health” as

the dependent variable.    The estimates suggest that more generous health insurance

                                             19
coverage at ages 2, 3, and 4 is associated with better health status when the child is 9

to 17.   The point estimates for effect of health become monotonically larger from

birth to age 3, and then grow smaller again. The relatively small estimate for age 0

might reflect measurement error if families are most likely to change states when their

children are infants. The point estimate for age 3 implies that a one hundred

percentage point increase in the fraction eligible (from no children to eligible to all

children eligible), would reduce the probability that an average older child is in poor

health by about 5 percentage points.     This is a nearly 11 percent improvement

relative to the average--about 46 percent of children aged 9 to 17 are in less than

excellent health. Given the crudeness of our health measure, this is likely to be a

lower bound on the true effect of past health insurance on child health.

     The second panel shows models with “no doctor visit in the past year” as the

dependent variable. This panel suggests that the largest effects on going without

doctor visits are associated with increases in the generosity of public insurance

eligibility when the child was aged 1 or 2, and again, the coefficients decline

thereafter.   At age 8, the coefficient is -.059.

     It is important to emphasize that we are not looking at the number of doctor

visits, but at whether children had any doctor visits at all in the past year. Policy

statements by the American Academy of Pediatrics consistently recommend at least

one physician visit per year for all children aged 21 and under (American Academy of

Pediatrics, 1995; American Academy of Pediatrics, 2000; American Academy of

Pediatrics, 2007).

     Hence, reductions in the number of children going without doctor visits suggest

that contemporaneous health insurance coverage increases access to care. Our

results also suggest that lagged coverage has important effects (perhaps by making it

more likely that the family has gotten in the habit of taking the child for regular

                                             20
checkups, and has a usual source of care.)        It is quite possible that lagged coverage

encourages use of medical care for minor illnesses, though we expect that such an

effect would be reflected in the number of doctor visits, rather than by our measure of

whether the child had any doctor visits at all.

     The estimated effect of past Medicaid/SCHIP eligibility on future access to care

is sizeable.   The point estimate for age 1 or 2 implies that making all children

eligible would reduce the probability that an average older child had no doctor visit by

nearly 9 percentage points. This is a nearly 41 percent improvement relative to the

average fraction of 9-17 year old children who have had no doctor visit in the past

year of about 22 percent.



6. Conclusions

     Income continues to be an important predictor of child health status in the United

States.   However, the importance of income to the health of older children has

diminished in recent years. Large expansions of public health insurance coverage to

cover older children are a possible explanation.      However, we find that while

increases in contemporaneous Medicaid/SCHIP eligibility have strong effects on

access to care, they do not increase the probability that an older child is in good

health.

     We suggest that this may be because health is a stock which reflects the results of

cumulative investments, and offer suggestive evidence that children in states that had

more generous policies in place when they were very young are healthier as 9 to 17

year olds. This may indicate that adequate medical care in early childhood puts

children on a better health trajectory, resulting in better health at older ages. If this

hypothesis is found to be correct, then it is consistent with a growing literature

suggesting that conditions in early childhood, and even prenatally, matter for

                                             21
children’s longer-term outcomes (Barker, 1998; Heckman, 2007), and with the

emerging literature in neuroscience and pediatrics that posits that “sensitive periods”

for functions such as brain development occur prior to adolescence (Andersen, 2003;

Ito, 2004).
