                                                ABSTRACT



        We investigate the ability of several international asset pricing models to price the returns on 36 FTSE

global industry portfolios. The models are the international capital asset pricing model (ICAPM), the ICAPM

with exchange risks, and global two-factor and three-factor Fama-French (1996, 1998) models. We apply the

methodology of Hansen and Jagannathan (1997). While all of the models can correctly price the basic assets,

exchange risks are unimportant and only the global three-factor Fama-French model passes a robustness check

which requires the models to also price portfolios sorted by book-to-market ratio.

1. Introduction

       World financial markets are becoming more integrated.             Under the market

integration hypothesis, only global risks are priced, and assets with the same risk

characteristics, which arise from their correlations with global risks, receive the same

prices irrespective of their nationalities. Consistent with this view, Cavaglia, Brightman,

and Aked (2000) demonstrate that the returns on the national industry portfolios are

decided by industry-specific factors rather than by country-specific factors. This article

explores whether simple international asset pricing models can price the global industry

returns. Byproducts of this investigation include an exploration of investment strategies

that can be implemented to beat the asset pricing benchmarks and an analysis of the gains

to diversifying internationally across the global industry portfolios.

2. Industry Portfolio Returns and International Asset Pricing Models

       We examine weekly excess returns on the 36 global industry indices complied by

the FTSE, which cover the top 85%-95% market capitalization of 22 developed countries.

Table 1 provides the names of the individual industries. The excess returns are currency

hedged because they are local-currency returns in excess of the local-eurocurrency

deposit rate (from Standard & Poor’s DRI database). We examine the pricing of returns

on portfolios that are either equal-weighted (EW) returns or value-weighted (VW). We

also include the gross return on the U.S. Treasury-bill as a risk free asset that pins down

the scale of excess returns. The sample period is from 1986:01 to 2001:05 for a total of

800 observations.

       Figure 1 provides summary statistics for the global industry portfolios. The line

with diamonds displays the mean excess weekly returns; the line without diamonds

displays the two standard error band. Mean returns that exceed the standard error band


                                                                                         2
are significantly different from zero. Although big spreads exist between the average

returns of different industry portfolios, especially for EW returns, the noisiness of returns

inflates the standard errors and makes statistical inference difficult, which lowers the

power of our tests. Industry 20, business services/computer software, has the highest and

the most significant mean return, and industry 34, precious metal/minerals, has the lowest

mean return.

       If world equity markets are integrated, differences in the average returns should

be attributable to differences in the assets’ exposures to global risk factors specified in

international asset pricing models. One benchmark model is the International Capital

Asset Pricing Model (ICAPM) as in Grauer, Litzenberger and Stehle (1976), who assume

Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) holds and demonstrate that the covariance of a return with

the global market return is the only priced risk. We use the global value-weighted market

excess return (WRVW) as the global market risk factor.

       When PPP does not hold, covariances with exchange rates become potential

sources of risk in international asset pricing models as first noted in Adler and Dumas

(1983). Our second model (ICAPMEX) includes exchange risks, as in Dumas and Solnik

(1995). We use exchange-rate data from the DRI database, and we consider exposures to

the Dollar/Pound (EXUK), Dollar/Mark (EXGE), and Dollar/Yen (EXJP) exchange rates.

We calculate the exchange risks as the excess dollar returns on foreign currency deposits.

       Finally, Fama and French (1998) document that exposures only to market risk (as

in the ICAPM) do not explain average returns across countries, especially on country

portfolios sorted by the ratio of a firm’s book value to its market value. Fama and French

(1998) add a second factor, the global excess return of high book-to-market firms over

low book-to-market firms (WHML), and they demonstrate that this multifactor


                                                                                           3
international model explains the data. Our first multifactor model (denoted IFF2) follows

the lead of Fama and French and includes WRVW and WHML. In pricing the US

domestic equity market, Fama and French (1996) include the excess return of small firms

over big firms as an additional factor. Consistent with this approach, we also construct a

third factor, the global excess return of small firms over big firms (WSMB). This

multifactor model is denoted IFF3.         Because WHML and WSMB are empirically

motivated, we construct them in two ways using either data sorted by industry or simply

individual firm data.    The models are referred to as IFF2(a), IFF3(a), IFF2(b) and

IFF3(b), respectively. We only use EW factors to price the EW returns, and we only use

VW factors to price VW returns.

3. Methodology: Hansen-Jagannathan Distance

       We use the methodology of Hansen and Jagannathan (1997) to evaluate the ability

of the various international models to price the global industry portfolios. Denote the

base asset returns by R and let their prices be given by p. If an element of R is an excess

return, the respective element of p is zero; whereas if the element of R is a gross return,

the respective element of p is one. In the absence of arbitrage it is well known that there

exists a set of true discount factors, m, which correctly price the returns. That is,

                                       E (mR) = p .                                     (1)

Because the true discount factors are not observable, we must use an asset pricing model

that provides a proxy discount factor, y. Hansen and Jagannathan (1997) develop a

methodology to measure the minimum distance from the proxy y to the true discount

factor m. We refer to this measurement as HJ-distance, and it is given by usual second

moment distance metric between two random variables:

                                       d = min y − m .                                  (2)


                                                                                              4
The solution for d is

                        d = {E ( yR − p)[ E ( RR' )]−1 E ( yR − p)} .
                                                                 1/ 2
                                                                                   (3)

This expression is the square root of a quadratic form. The vector contains the pricing

errors, which are the differences between the prices given by y and the actual prices, p,

given by m. The weighting matrix for the pricing errors is the inverse of the second

moment of R. If the model is correctly specified, y is a true discount factor, and the

pricing errors should all be zero, in which case d is also zero. But, if the model is wrong

and the pricing errors are non-zero, d will be positive. The magnitude of d tells us the

degree of mispricing, and it can be directly compared across models. Moreover, the

distribution of d under the null hypothesis of correct asset pricing is known, which allows

us to examine whether d is significantly different from zero.

       The international pricing models are linear factor models, in which case the proxy

discount factor, y, can be written as

                                         y = b' F ,                                (4)

where F denotes the risk factors and b denotes the prices of the risk factors. We estimate

b to minimize the HJ-distance, which is a standard generalized method of moments

(Hansen’s (1982) GMM) problem. But, the weighting matrix differs from that in optimal

GMM, which provides the smallest standard errors for the parameters and the most

stringent specification test of the model. For optimal GMM, the weighting matrix is

model dependent. In summary, the uniform weighting matrix of the HJ-distance provides

a fair comparison across models, but we also use optimal GMM to check the robustness

of the HJ-distance methodology.




                                                                                         5
       Hansen and Jagannathan (1997) demonstrate that d also represents the maximum

normalized pricing error of the given model for a portfolio formed from the base assets.

The portfolio weights for this maximum-error portfolio are

                                    1
                               w=     [E ( RR' )]−1 E ( yR − p) ,                   (5)
                                    d

in which case E(yR-p)’w = d is the portfolio’s pricing error and ||w’R|| =1 is the

portfolio’s second moment. We refer to this maximum-error portfolio as the arbitrage

portfolio, because w tells us how to take the biggest advantage of the model’s mispricing.

If a portfolio manager is being evaluated solely relative to the international asset pricing

model, the arbitrage portfolio is the portfolio he should hold to best outperform the

benchmark model.       We report standardized weights by scaling w to make the

standardized weights sum to one.

       In general, the HJ-distance methodology has some potential weaknesses, such as

small sample biases and possible parameter instability.             In our case with 800

observations, small sample bias is not a severe problem. We also conduct stability tests

and find that the parameters of the models appear to be stable.

4. Empirical Results

       Table 2 presents empirical results for both EW returns and VW returns. We first

report the magnitudes of the HJ-distances. Since d is a new distance measure, which is

unintuitive to some, we also provide the maximum annual pricing error, Max. Err., for a

portfolio with an annual standard error of 20%. On average, the annual pricing errors for

all models are between 3% and 4% per year. The p-values of the tests that HJ-distance is

zero, p(d=0), are all quite large, which is consistent with the moderate pricing errors.

Thus, the HJ-distance tests are unable to reject any of the international asset pricing

models. This implies that the international asset pricing models are able to price the

                                                                                          6
return spreads of the global industry portfolios. The p-values from the J-tests of optimal

GMM, p(J), provide similar implications. Notice also that the p-values for the EW

returns are somewhat smaller than those of the VW returns, indicating that the EW

returns are somewhat harder to price than the VW returns. This is due to the fact that the

EW industry returns are more significant, as we reported in Figure 1.

       By directly comparing the HJ-distance measure across the models, we find that

including exchange risks does not improve significantly on ICAPM, but including the

Fama-French factors does offer more improvement. In fact, the IFF3 models obtain the

smallest HJ-distance for both EW and VW industry returns.            The performances of

IFF3(a) and IFF3(b) are very similar. Next, we clarify how the individual factors are

priced in each model.

5. Factor Analysis and Factor Risk Prices

       As a preliminary step in our analysis, we first conduct factor analysis to explore

the covariance structure of the global industry portfolios because an individual portfolio

is priced due to its correlation with common global risk factors. Table 3 displays the

results from principle component factorization.      For the EW returns, the first four

principle components explain about 80% of the total variance. For the VW returns, the

first four principle components explain 70% of the total variance.

       Table 3 also reports the correlation of the pricing factors to help identify what the

principle components are.     For both EW and VW returns, the dominant principle

components have the highest correlations with the world market risk factor.

       None of the exchange risk factors have high correlations with the four principle

components. This implies that the exchange risk factors cannot explain much of the

covariance structure of the global industry portfolios. These results are consistent with


                                                                                          7
Griffin and Stulz (2001) who investigate whether shocks to exchange rates explain

industry returns in six major countries. They find that generally less than one percent of

the weekly variance of industry returns in a country is explained by the change in the

exchange rate of that country’s currency versus the dollar.

       Both WSMB(a & b) and WHML(a & b) have higher correlations with the

variance factors than do exchange risk factors. Thus, from the perspective of explaining

the covariance between global industry portfolios, IFF3 should outperform the

ICAPMEX.

       Until this point, when we talk about risk prices, we mean the factor risk prices b

as in equation (4). Equation (1) has an equivalent but more popular representation,

                               E ( R) = ∑ ik=1β i Λ i ,                               (6)

where k is the number of factors, the βi represent the vectors of sensitivities of the returns

to the i-th risk, and the prices of the beta risks are Λi, i = 1, …, k. Both βi and Λi are

functions of b. The significance of the Λi indicates whether the i-th risk is important for

expected returns on the underlying assets. Table 4 reports the estimates of the beta risk

prices with their standard errors in parenthesis derived from the HJ-distance

methodology. Notice that the world market risk is always significantly priced, especially

for EW returns. None of the exchange risks are significantly priced, while either the

WHML or the WSMB factor is significantly priced for EW and VW returns. Consistent

with the declining importance of the small firm effect, the world price of WSMB is

consistently negative.

6. Pricing Errors and Arbitrage Portfolio

       Pricing errors are the differences between the asset prices given by the proxy

discount factor, y, and the real price, p. A more popular pricing error, Jensen’s α, is

                                                                                            8
simply the product of our pricing error measure and the riskfree rate. We can examine

the individual pricing errors to see the model’s ability to price the cross-sectional returns.

To save space, Figure 2 only presents the pricing errors for the successful model,

IFF3(b). The lines with diamonds are the pricing errors, and the other two lines are the

two standard error bands. Most pricing errors are smaller than 0.05% per week, and none

of them are significant, for both EW and VW returns. Given that the riskfree rate is very

close to one, Jensen’s α should also be smaller than 0.05% per week and insignificantly

different from zero. Overall, IFF3(b) captures the cross-sectional average return spreads

for the global industry portfolios.

       Since HJ-distance is the maximum error for the normalized portfolio, we can take

the biggest advantage of the pricing errors by investing the arbitrage portfolio specified in

equation (5). Figure 3 reports the standardized weights for the arbitrage portfolio for

both EW and VW returns. It is interesting to find that the portfolios put big weights on

the industries with large pricing errors. For instance, there is a big weight on the VW

industry 20 (business service/computer software), which is the most under-priced of the

VW portfolios. Since there are big spreads among the pricing errors for VW returns, the

weights on VW returns are more drastic than for EW returns. However, even for the EW

returns, the arbitrage portfolio weights require the investor to have very long and very

short positions on individual industries with magnitudes between –300% to 300% of

invested wealth, which is not realistic.      Thus, it is quite hard to beat the IFF3(b)

benchmark.

7. Robustness

       To check whether the estimated models are robust, we use the parameters

estimated from the returns on the global industry portfolios to price returns on the global


                                                                                            9
industry portfolios sorted by size (market capitalization) and book-to-market ratio. We

refer to firms with high B/M ratios as value firms, and firms with low B/M ratios as

growth firms. Thus, we have four new sets of assets that we label the small, big, value,

and growth portfolios. Examination of the mean returns and standard errors for these

portfolios indicates that the excess returns on small firms, big firms and growth firms are

insignificantly different from zero, except for the big or growth firms in industry 20

(business service/computer software). However, for value firms, several returns are very

significant, as in Figure 4. Fama and French (1998) and Arshanapalli, Coggin, and

Doukas (1998) also find that value firms have high average returns across countries.

       If the models with the original parameters are robust and the new assets share the

same risk characteristics as the original assets, the original models should be able to price

the new assets. Table 5 provides the p-values for the HJ-distance tests using the original

parameters but pricing the new assets. As expected, since the small, big and growth

industry portfolios do not have particularly significant returns, the original models are

able to price them. But, all the models encounter more difficulty when they are required

to price the value industry portfolios. For the VW portfolios, the p-values for the first

four models (ranging from .14 to .18) indicate that the models only marginally pass the

HJ-distance tests. For the EW portfolios, the ICAPM, ICAPMEX and IFF2(a) models

have p-values no bigger than .05 indicating that they are not the true model. The two

IFF3 models do somewhat better although their p-values are only .12 and .15. This

implies that the benchmark models estimated from global industry portfolios have some

difficulty pricing the value industry portfolios.

       To take the advantage of this mispricing, we also report the weights on the

arbitrage portfolio for the value industry portfolios for IFF3(b) in Figure 5. The weights


                                                                                          10
from both EW and VW returns convey the same information, because they put big

weights on the same portfolios, which are the hardest to price correctly. We need to have

big short positions on industry 4 (insurance) and industry 10 (transportation) because they

are over-priced by the benchmark model IFF3(b). We also need to have big long

positions on industry 9 (utility) and industry 16 (health/personal care) because they are

most under-priced.

8. Short-selling Constraints

       Above, we found that to take the advantage of model’s mispricing of the industry

portfolios requires investors to have large long and short positions on particular

individual portfolios. Since many fund managers face short-selling constraints for cross-

border investments, the above investment strategy may be difficult to implement. In this

section, we investigate how much the short-selling constraints affect the investor’s

investment strategy on industry portfolios to beat the benchmark model and how they

should optimally allocate their wealth accordingly. Since it is difficult to impose the

short-selling constraints within the pricing kernel framework analytically, here we apply

the classic mean-variance frontier analysis by Monte Carlo simulations, as in Li, Sarkar,

and Wang (2002).

       Every asset pricing model implies an efficient benchmark investment frontier that

characterizes the returns’ mean-variance tradeoff. For instance, the benchmark frontier

implied by ICAPM is the linear combination of the world market portfolio and the

riskfree rate, and the benchmark frontier implied by IFF3 is the linear combination of the

riskfree rate and the optimal factor portfolio, which is a convex combination of the Fama-

French factor portfolios that achieves the highest Sharpe ratio. When we include more

assets (e.g. industry portfolios) in addition to the benchmark frontier, we potentially


                                                                                        11
improve the investment opportunities.         If the benchmark model cannot completely

capture the risks in the new assets, we may significantly improve the mean-variance

tradeoff and obtain an improved frontier. However, the magnitude and significance of

the improvement will be affected by the short-selling constraints, because the new

optimal portfolio weights might be unavailable.

       We focus on the improvement in Sharpe ratios to measure the impact of the short-

selling constraints. Since HJ-distance can be interpreted as the maximum difference in

the Sharpe ratios obtained by the benchmark model and the underlying assets (industry

portfolios), this allows us to make a comparison between the two approaches.

       Since the mean-variance frontier is completely determined by the first two

                                       R
moments of the base assets, we assume   ~ N (µ , Ω ) , where R is a vector of industry
                                        RB 

portfolio returns and RB is the return on the tangency portfolio (with the highest Sharpe

ratio) for the benchmark frontier. Denote the maximum improvement on the benchmark

Sharpe ratio as

                                 w' µ − r f       wB ' µ − r f
                      π = max(                −                  ),                 (7)
                             w    w' Ωw           wB ' ΩwB

where w and wB are the portfolio weights, w 'ι = w B 'ι = 1, and ι is a vector of ones. The

weights wB allocate weight 1 to RB and 0 to the other assets. If there is improvement in

the mean-variance tradeoff when we include the industry portfolios, π should be positive

and significant. We can easily impose the short-selling constraints by requiring that

every element of w to be non-negative.              Denote the counterpart of π under these

constraints as πS.    Following Li, Sarkar, and Wang (2002), we conduct 10,000




                                                                                          12
simulations to specify the empirical distributions of the diversification benefit measures:

π and πS.

       Table 6 provides summary statistics for π and πS when we use the value-weighted

industry portfolios to improve the efficient frontier implied by IFF3(b). Using IFF3(a) or

the equal-weighted portfolios gives similar results. When there are no short-selling

constraints, the Sharpe ratio improvement (π) is about 0.185, and it is significantly

different form zero. The magnitude of π is comparable with the HJ-distance measure for

value-weighted industry portfolios presented in Table 2. But, in Table 2, the models are

able to pass the specification test, which implies the difference in Sharpe ratios is not

significant. This is consistent with our claim that due to the high volatility inherent in

weekly returns, HJ-distance test has low power. The second part of Table 6 presents the

portfolio weights to achieve this big improvement over Sharpe ratio. The investors put

90% of their portfolio investment in the benchmark tangency portfolio, which implies

that IFF3(b) can capture most of the risks in the industry portfolios. We have big short

positions on industry 4(insurance), industry 18 (entertainment), and industry 24

(computer). The magnitude of the short positions is 30-50% of the investment. Hence, if

there are short-selling constraints, this improvement in the Sharpe ratio might be

unachievable.     We have big long positions on industry 7(oil/gas), industry

16(health/personal care), and industry 20 (business service). All the big positions are

consistent with the weights of the arbitrage portfolios using HJ-distance in Figure 3.

       As expected, when the short-selling constraints are imposed, the Sharpe ratio

improvement (πS) is only about 0.0324. This implies that it is hard to beat the benchmark

portfolio under the short-selling constraints. We still have big long positions on industry

7(oil/gas), industry 16(health/personal care), and industry 20 (business service).

                                                                                         13
9. Conclusions

       This article explores the ability of several international asset-pricing models to

explain the average returns on a set of global industry portfolios. The general noisiness

of the data makes it difficult to accurately estimate average returns. Thus, all of the

international models are able to capture the cross-sectional industry return spreads. The

world market risk is always priced, but the exchange risks are generally not. Our

international Fama-French three-factor model has the smallest pricing errors, and it is the

only one that can marginally pass a robustness test in which the international asset-

pricing models are required to price the high B/M ratio industry portfolios.

       We therefore conclude that global industry returns are consistent with a globally

integrated equity market. This conclusion contrasts with the finding of Griffin (2001)

who examines whether a global version or country-specific versions of the Fama-French

model better explain country returns. Griffin finds that to explain country returns, the

local Fama-French factors do a better job than the global Fama-French factors. More

analysis of this issue would be useful.

       Zhang (2001) also tests alternative international asset pricing models using size

and book-to-market portfolios from several developed countries. She finds that time-

variation in risk prices are important determinants of cross-sectional return spreads. Our

unconditional asset pricing tests do not allow explicitly for the prices of risks to vary over

time. A potential reconciliation of the results in the two papers may be that the global

Fama-French factors proxy for time-variation in prices of other fundamental risks. This

is also a promising area for additional research.

       Finally, our methodology results in an investment strategy that maximally

exploits the potential mispricings of the benchmark models. When there are no short-


                                                                                           14
selling constraints, investing in the industry portfolios provides a big diversification

benefit relative to investing in the benchmark assets, but the benefit becomes marginal

when there are short-selling constraints.

The test assets are the returns on global industry portfolios sorted by size (market equity)
and book-to-market ratio. The panels present the p-values for the test of HJ-distance = 0
using previously estimated parameters derived from minimizing HJ-distance for global
industry portfolios without sorting on characteristics. The models are an international
CAPM (ICAPM), an international CAPM with exchange risks (ICAPMEX), and two-
factor or three factor Fama-French models. IFF2(a) and IFF3(a) use WHML and
WSMB constructed from national industry indices; IFF2(b) and IFF3(b) use WHML and
WSMB constructed from individual firms.

The first panel present the maximum improvement on Sharpe ratio (π) of the value-weighted
global industry portfolio over the benchmark tangency portfolio implied by IFF3(b). The statistics
are calculated from 10,000 simulations, where mean is the empirical mean, std. err is the standard
deviation, p1 is the value of the measure at 1 percentile, p5 is the value of the measure at 5
percentile, and median is the value of the measure at 50 percentile. Superscript S implies short-
selling constraints are imposed. The second panel presents the mean and standard deviation of
weights on the portfolios achieving the maximum improvement.
