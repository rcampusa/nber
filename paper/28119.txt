The Collateral Link between Volatility and Risk Sharing

JEL No. E44,G12,G18

                                            ABSTRACT

We show that aggregate volatility affects the extent to which agents can share idiosyncratic risks
through the valuation of collateral. Both private and public assets are used in insurance markets
as collateral, but their exposure to volatility differs. While aggregate volatility decreases the value
of private assets--they are exposed to more variation--it increases the value of public assets--
they become more valuable to smooth consumption intertemporally. Hence, a more volatile
economy tends to damage risk sharing when the composition of collateral is biased toward
private assets. As we show that a stable economy is more propitious to the creation of private
collateral, stability makes risk sharing increasingly fragile to volatility shocks. We find empirical
evidence that the higher use of private assets in the U.S. has affected the sensitivity of risk
sharing to aggregate volatility as predicted by our model.

1    Introduction
Public assets (government bonds, T-bills, etc.) and private assets (houses, asset backed
securities, etc.) have two relevant uses. On the one hand, they back promises to move
resources over time, this is to smooth aggregate shocks intertemporally. On the other hand,
they back promises to move resources across agents, this is to smooth idiosyncratic shocks
intratemporally. The first use has been widely analyzed by the asset pricing literature (for
example, Holmstrom and Tirole 2001 and Bansal et al. 2014). The second has been instead
mostly discussed by macroeconomics (for example, Heaton and Lucas 1996, Lustig and
Van Nieuwerburgh 2005, Blundell et al. 2008, Schulhofer-Wohl 2011 and Blundell et al.
2016).
    These uses, however, are intimately related. The use of assets as collateral affects the
prevalence of idiosyncratic risk in the economy and, as such, affects the intertemporal value
of assets. In parallel, the intertemporal value of assets determines their value as collateral
and thus the prevalence of idiosyncratic risk. In this paper, we explore how the intertem-
poral properties of an economy (its time series volatility of aggregate consumption) affects
its intratemporal properties (its cross-sectional idiosyncratic variance). In other words, we
explore the effect of aggregate volatility on the extent of risk sharing across agents in the
economy through the valuation of collateral.
    Understanding the relationship between aggregate volatility and risk sharing has become
particularly relevant during turbulent times, such as the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The pandemic constitutes a sudden, unexpected shock to the economy, affecting all countries
and vastly increasing the aggregate uncertainty individuals face in the short- and medium-
run. How does this shock affect the capacity of individuals, companies, and financial institu-
tions to cross-insure against future idiosyncratic shocks? How does an increase in economic
uncertainty affect inequality across agents, the functioning of financial markets, and the
allocation of resources?
    We show that this relationship is non-monotonic, as an increase in uncertainty--captured
by an increase in the volatility of time-series aggregates that agents face--can either reduce
or increase the possibilities for those agents to share risk. To be more precise, the way in
which volatility affects risk sharing depends on the ratio of private to public assets used as
collateral in the economy, as their valuations react to volatility in opposite directions. On


                                              1
the one hand, an increase in aggregate volatility increases the intertemporal price of public
assets. The reason is that public assets, through the taxation power of governments, have
the property of providing noncontingent future payment promises, and a promise of a dollar
in the future depends on how uncertain the future is. If agents face high volatility (that
is, when the variance of future realizations is high), such a dollar can pay off in very bad
periods, with high marginal utility, making the promise more valuable. On the other hand,
an increase in aggregate volatility reduces the intertemporal price of private assets. The
reason is that their payoffs are tied to the evolution of the aggregate economy, and riskier
assets become less valuable when the variance of future realizations is high.
    When the ratio of private to public assets used as collateral to back insurance promises is
relatively low, the value of public assets is more relevant to determine the value of available
collateral. In this case, higher volatility implies more valuable collateral, on average, and
better idiosyncratic insurance--a sort of "positive externality" of economic volatility on
economic risk sharing. The opposite is true when the ratio of private to public assets is
relatively high. In this case, the total value collateral declines, and there is less idiosyncratic
insurance--a "negative externality" of economic volatility on economic risk sharing.
    The effect of volatility on risk sharing feeds back on the price of government bonds, which
also has implications for the cost of public finances. When government bonds are heavily
used as collateral to back idiosyncratic insurance, an increase in aggregate volatility increases
insurance by reducing idiosyncratic variance, thus moderating the increase in the price of
public assets as their risk-sharing premium decreases. In contrast, when private assets are
used as collateral to back idiosyncratic insurance, an increase in volatility reduces insurance,
consequently adding idiosyncratic risk to consumption and thus providing an extra kick in
increasing the price of public assets.
    These results naturally apply to insurance markets among financial intermediaries and
uncover a novel source of financial fragility. In an economy in which banks insure against
idiosyncratic shocks (such as liquidity needs, shocks to specific asset positions, etc.) by
using contracts that rely heavily on the use of private collateral, their risk sharing could
be negatively affected by an increase in economic volatility. In this case, a large use of
private assets as collateral in inter-bank transactions will positively correlate volatile times
with financial fragility, as banks will find it harder to hedge their idiosyncratic shocks in
interbank markets, putting their activities under stress.


                                                2
    Our results also have long-term implications if there is a trend in financial innovation that
induces private assets to be used more intensively as collateral. Indeed, a recent literature
has argued that the importance of private assets as collateral has increased dramatically in
the U.S. over the past few decades, mostly through financial engineering and deregulation
(see Gorton et al. 2012) and that this trend was curbed somewhat by the regulatory reforms
that followed the financial crisis at the onset of the Great Recession of 2008 (such as the
Dodd-Frank Act and new Basel III restrictions). Combining these results, we predict that
risk sharing improved with private asset creation until the Great Recession but at the cost
of making risk sharing within financial markets more fragile to sudden increases in aggregate
volatility.
    As risk sharing is one of the fundamental roles of interbank markets, the fact that an
extensive use of private assets makes the system more fragile leads us to study what deter-
mines the creation of private assets for collateral. We introduce the possibility of creating
private collateral (for example, securitization) and show that creating private collateral is
more likely in a stable economic environment, as public debt is less valuable for intertemporal
consumption smoothing and thus less valuable as collateral for risk sharing. In this sense, a
stable economy is propitious to the creation and use of private assets as collateral, turning
the financial system increasingly fragile to a sudden increase in future economic volatility.
In short, economic stability plants the seeds of its own instability.
    Our setting highlights the intricate relationship between the creation and valuation of
private and public assets. On the one hand, it is not always the case that more government
bond issuance induces less creation of private assets (the celebrated crowding out effect of
government debt). On the other hand, financial innovation that increases the use of private
collateral reduces the economy's exposure to idiosyncratic shock and the price of government
bonds, increasing the government's cost of raising funds.
    Our results have clear testable implications of the relation between the composition of
private and public assets and risk sharing, and clear regulatory implications for policymakers
that pay attention to financial stability. Unfortunately, directly measuring the composition
of assets used as collateral in the financial sector is challenging, both for academics and poli-
cymakers, as it requires taking stands on what is considered a private asset given government
guarantees, how assets are subject to double counting when they are used in several financial
transactions, etc. Similar difficulties exist when directly measuring the extent of risk sharing


                                               3
in financial markets.
     We bypass some of these challenges by using prices to infer the extent of risk sharing
by measuring the convenience yield of safe assets--that is, the additional value assigned to
assets (net of their payoff risks), which in our setting is because of their use as collateral in
risk sharing contracts. The convenience yield indirectly captures the extent of risk sharing,
as more risk sharing makes safe assets less valuable as collateral, and thus a reduction in the
convenience yield is a signal that risk sharing is less relevant or is better hedged. We then
empirically test whether the sensitivity of the convenience yield to aggregate volatility varies
over time and, if so, whether it varies in the expected direction. Specifically, we test whether
this sensitivity increases in periods when the literature suggests there was an extensive use
of private assets as collateral in financial markets.
     We perform two tests. First, using low frequency data, we show that this sensitivity
has increased over time. While the convenience yield (and thus risk sharing) was barely
reactive to aggregate volatility before the nineties, such sensitivity increased over the past
few decades, suggesting a heightened role of private collateral in the economy. Second, we
use high frequency data to zoom in on the active period surrounding the Great Recession,
characterized by a large increase in private asset creation followed by a large drop after
the 2008 financial crisis. We show that the sensitivity of the convenience yield (and thus
risk sharing) to aggregate volatility increased dramatically leading up to the crisis and then
declined while the crises unraveled. Furthermore, as the sensitivity of risk sharing to volatility
has not increased in the years after the crisis, our model suggests that private assets never
recovered their role as collateral at the extent seen before the financial crisis.

    Related Literature: In this paper, we are particularly interested in the relationship
between collateral and risk in the economy (both intertemporal and intratemporal risk). In
contrast to most of the literature about the role of collateral, we abstract from traditional
models with natural borrowers with investment projects (such as Kiyotaki and Moore 1997)
or liquidity needs (such as Holmstrom and Tirole 1998). In our setting, agents are identical
in an endowment economy, and so are the risks they face.
    Our result is complementary to Gorton and Ordonez (2020), who also study the dual
use of public and private assets as collateral but, in that case, to back productive loans.
Their focus is on the role of informational fragility that mounts in the economy as private
assets (heterogeneous and plagued by asymmetric information issues) become larger vis-a-vis

                                                4
public assets (more homogeneous and less subject to informational frictions). While that
work highlights the informational fragility of collateral composition for productive reasons,
here we study the valuation fragility of collateral composition for insurance reasons.
    Krishnamurthy (2003), in the spirit of Kiyotaki and Moore (1997), also incorporates in-
surance markets in which assets serve as collateral to back insurance promises. In his work,
the focus is on valuation effects stemming from collateral constrained insurance against ag-
gregate shocks. Our focus is, instead, on insurance against idiosyncratic shocks and how
aggregate volatility affects such insurance by affecting collateral valuation. We also intro-
duce private safe asset creation and the relation between exogenous aggregate volatility and
endogenous financial fragility.
    Our framework is consistent with the work of Greenwood et al. (2015), Krishnamurthy
and Vissing-Jorgensen (2015), and Sunderam (2014), who document the crowding out effect
of public assets on private asset creation, and with Infante (2020), who points out that this
sensitivity depends on whether the underlying collateral is publicly or privately produced.
Our framework is also consistent with Mankiw (1986) and Constantinides and Duffie (1996)
who show that risk premia increases if idiosyncratic shocks become more volatile during eco-
nomic contractions. Our framework, however, explores the feedback between volatility and
risk sharing through the endogenous value of collateral in the economy and its composition.
Indeed, the relevance of housing valuations on the extent of risk sharing has been empirically
documented in Hurst and Stafford (2004), Lustig and Van Nieuwerburgh (2010) and Hryshko
et al. (2010) but not formally related to its private/public composition.
    There is a rich macroeconomics literature that explores how risk sharing affects the
relevance of volatility in the economy and, as such, asset prices. Storesletten et al. (2007)
add life cycle and capital accumulation to these settings and show that these effects mitigate
the role of idiosyncratic shocks to explain asset prices. Our main insight goes in the opposite
direction: the effect of volatility on risk sharing.
    The valuation effect described in this paper is related to the so called "negative beta"
property of U.S. Treasury securities--that is, Treasuries appreciate in times of market stress.
Connolly et al. (2005) and Baele et al. (2010) empirically document over recent U.S. history
that, when volatility and illiquidity increase, Treasuries tend to appreciate while stocks tend
to depreciate. In an international context, Caballero et al. (2017) and He et al. (2019)
describe how government bonds issued from economies with reserve currency or safe asset


                                              5
status appreciate as global demand for safety increases. These papers allude to the "flight to
safety" feature of government bonds. Our paper introduces a related but distinct channel--
namely, government bonds' increased ability to hedge idiosyncratic risks can attenuate or
exacerbate the negative beta effect, depending on whether the ratio of private to public
assets used as collateral is low or high.
    Finally, Brumm et al. (2018) quantitatively study how re-using private collateral increases
leverage and volatility in the economy. Rampini and Viswanathan (2010) argue that higher
collateralizability increases borrowing capacity, leverage, and risk, which incentivizes more
productive borrowers to exhaust their debt capacity. In our setting, we explore the opposite
direction, in which volatility affects the value of both private and public collateral to provide
insurance against idiosyncratic shocks. Our finding that the sensitivity of risk sharing to
volatility depends on the composition of collateral highlights why the relationship between
leverage and volatility is not obvious nor monotonic.

    The paper proceeds as follows. The next section presents a model with aggregate volatility
in which public and private assets can be used as collateral to share idiosyncratic risks.
Section 3 presents a tractable CARA-Normal case that allows for very clean comparative
statics on the valuation of public and private assets and their use for risk sharing. Section 4
gives agents the ability to create private assets at a cost. In Section 5, we provide empirical
evidence on the sensitivity of risk sharing to aggregate volatility and how it has changed
over time with private asset creation and financial engineering. Section 6 concludes.


2     Model
In this section, we present the model in which we relate aggregate macro volatility with the
extent of idiosyncratic risk sharing in the economy, assuming exogenous supply of private
and public assets.


2.1    Set Up
Consider a three period (t  {0, 1, 2}) endowment economy with two agents, called Raymond
(R) and Shirley (S ). Both agents have additive separable utility, with each period's consump-
tion utility u(·) and discount factor  . Agents split equally an aggregate endowment, and

                                               6
additionally each agent receives an idiosyncratic endowment shock which is completely offset
by the other agent's shock.1 Specifically, Raymond (Shirley) receives a positive (negative)
shock if it "rains" and a negative (positive) shock if it "shines." To maintain the aggregate
endowment separated from idiosyncratic realizations, we assume that the probability of rain
                     1
and shine are both 2   . Formally, agent i has the following endowment process:

                              Y0                       ~1
                                                       Y                              ~2
                                                                                      Y
                      e0i =      ;             e
                                               ~1i =      +y
                                                           ~i ;               e
                                                                              ~2i =      ,
                              2                        2                              2

where Yt represents aggregate endowments (the tilde signifies that endowment shocks are
t-measurable random variables). For Raymond, y ~i is either y if it rains or -y if it shines.
Shirley has the opposing idiosyncratic endowment shock.

    Supply and Demand of Assets: There are three assets in the economy: short-term
government bonds, long-term government bonds, and a private asset. While in this section
the total supply of public and private assets is fixed, the demand is determined by agents'
maximization of expected payoff.
    The government pays short- and long-term government bonds (the public assets) raising
lump sum taxes on agents in the period the bonds mature. Because of the government's
ability to tax agents, these assets will be considered safe--that is, they will always pay at
par when they mature. We denote the face value of the total amount of short-term bonds
by Sh 0 and of long-term bonds by 0 . We assume the private asset's payoff is proportional
to the aggregate endowment process, paying a dividend a     ~t = Y ~t , with   (0, 1) in each
period. Initially, each agent is endowed with half of a total private asset supply ^ 0 .2
    As the supply of public and private assets is exogenous, assets can be "scarce"--that
is, there are not enough of them to back all private promises that fully hedge idiosyncratic
                                                      Sh
risks. In period t  {0, 1}, each agent will demand ti    of short-term government bonds, ti
   1
     We model an endowment process and not a Lucas tree to avoid the possibility of using the tree as
collateral.
   2
     There is no loss in generality in assuming that the private asset's payoff is correlated with the aggregate
endowment process. In equilibrium, this assumption merely implies that agents exposure to aggregate risk is
scaled by (1 +   ^ 0 ): a part attributed to the endowment process 1 and a part attributed to agents' optimal
holdings of the private asset     ^ 0 . If the private asset payoff were independent of the endowment process,
because of market clearing, agents' optimal portfolio holdings would still create a correlation between their
consumption path and asset payoffs. Therefore, absent wealth effects, the introduction of additional risks
orthogonal to the risk already embedded in the model does not have different qualitative effects.

of long-term government bonds, and      ^ti of private assets at the market clearing price pSh ,
                                                                                             t
          a                                                                          Sh
pt , and pt , respectively. We assume there are no short-sale constraints, thus ti , ti , and  ^ti
must be non-negative.

    Risk Sharing and Collateral: At t = 0, agents are able to write state-contingent
contracts among themselves depending on whether it rains or shines. We model these as
"Arrow-Debreu" securities that pay one unit of the consumption good depending on whether
it rains or shines. Importantly, we will assume that, if an agent sells an Arrow-Debreu
security (effectively selling insurance for that state of the world), they must fully collateralize
their promise with public or private assets.3 If we denote by wi       r
                                                                         and wis
                                                                                 --the amount of
promises agent i makes in case it rains and shines, respectively (super scripts r and s denote
the state "rain" and "shine", respectively)--the need of fully collateralizing the promise
implies that

                   r  Sh             a^                          s  Sh             a^
                  wi  0 i + p1 0i + p1 0i ;                     wi  0 i + p1 0i + p1 0i .                       (1)

A single contract against rain or shine can be thought of as a collateralized insurance con-
tract.4 As standard in the literature, the ability of an asset to collateralize a claim depends
on the worst value it can take (the safe portion of the payoff that can be pledged in all
states of the world). In terms of constraints (1), p1 and pa
                                                           1
                                                             are the lowest price the long-term
government bond and the private asset can have in t = 1, respectively.5 The parameter 
captures the pledgeability of the private asset, which if inferior than public assets to serve
as collateral (more limited pledgeability, informational frictions, etc.), implies  < 1.
    In what follows, we will denote the market trading price of contingent contracts for when
it rains and shines by q r and q s , respectively.

       Consumption: With all these elements, we can write agent Raymond's consumption
   3
     Formally, because of collateralizability, these contracts are not real Arrow-Debreu securities. This market
incompleteness implies that the first welfare theorem does not hold.
   4
     In principle, agents can sell both idiosyncratic contracts, hedging against all states of nature to have a
given consumption. This portfolio of contracts can be interpreted as, for example, a repo contract.
   5
     Note that, i) collateral constraints are ex post, and ii) restricting by the lowest price of the asset requires
that prices are bounded below by zero.

The consumption process for Shirley takes the same form.

   Timing: In t = 0, agents choose the amount of government bonds to purchase and
contingent contracts to sign, taking into account the need to collateralize these contracts--
that is, satisfy the inequalities of (1). In t = 1, agents rebalance their portfolio upon
the realization of both the aggregate and idiosyncratic shocks. In t = 2, agents consume
endowments and proceeds from their portfolio.
   Given the symmetry of agents in period 0, each will end up with half the government
supply of short- and long-term bonds, which will determine prices pSh0 and p0 . Each agent,
however, has the possibility to rebalance his/her portfolio, demanding, for instance, more
long-term bonds in period 1 or more private assets upon the idiosyncratic shock, once agents'
endowments become asymmetric. Taxes are then collected at period 2 to redeem those bonds.
Since there are no choices in period t = 2, the next subsections characterize backwards the
optimal choices in periods t = 1 and t = 0.

c
~1i = c1i . Upon this realization, each agent rebalances their portfolio by choosing the optimal
amount of long-term bonds (which are now one-period bonds) and private asset holdings.

Raymond, for instance, holds both long-term bonds and private assets in equilibrium if

                                            E1 (u (~
                                                   c2R ))
                                    p1 =                                                    (5)

which are the standard intertemporal pricing equations. The condition is identical for Shirley.
Note that the price will depend on the aggregate shock in t = 1 and possibly the idiosyncratic
shock. Specifically, if agents cannot fully insure, then their consumption in t = 1 will depend
on whether it rains or shines, and possibly so will p1 and pa 1 . Given the full symmetry of the
problem, the price will be the same for both realizations of the idiosyncratic shock, as one
of the two agents will always have the "good shock" and the other the "bad shock".
                r         s
    Denote by 1   i and 1i agent i's portfolio in t = 1 when it rains or shines, respectively.
Using agents' consumption path expressed in equations (3) and (4), we can write equilib-
rium conditions so that both agents hold the long-term government bond and private asset
whenever it rains by,

If these equilibrium conditions are satisfied, then both agents hold the long-term government
bond and private asset whenever it rains. Note that, in order to have interesting equilibria,
the idiosyncratic shock has to be large enough so that the maximum amount of insurance
is not enough to hedge all idiosyncratic risks. Specifically, whenever (1) binds, we have

                              R + 1S = 0 ;                 1R   1S


Because we are interested in characterizing symmetric equilibria, the analysis is identical for
when it shines.
   We conjecture that conditions exist in which both agents' optimal private asset holdings
are unaffected by the liquidity shock. Specifically, if trading of the long-term government
bond is able to equalize agents' marginal rates of substitution, then the original private asset
holdings of agents will be optimal. Given the possible reoptimization strategy in period 1,
denote the optimal continuation value of Raymond's t = 1 utility by

                 Sh
             UR (0          ^     r    s ~

   These conditions show that insurance for a "bad state of the world" (in terms of idiosyn-
cratic shocks) is priced by the agent who needs it most. That is q j is priced by the agent
who suffers a negative idiosyncratic shock in state j . In the symmetric equilibrium, q r = q s
      r    s
and R   = S  . In addition, Raymond sells insurance to Shirley and Shirley sells insurance to

The equations (9)­(11) directly show that, if agents cannot fully insure, all assets will have
a convenience yield related to agents' limited abilities to hedge their idiosyncratic risk. The

                                                  12
pricing effect of the convenience yield depends on how useful the asset is to collateralize the
sale of insurance. That is, the manner in which the convenience yield affects prices depends
on the worst possible price in t = 1 and the degree of pledgeability . In this model, the
convenience yield takes the simple expression of

                                                   cs
                                                u (~          cr

and has an easy interpretation. The convenience yield is equal to the difference in marginal
utility when agents suffer a bad idiosyncratic shock relative to a good one. That is, the
additional value Raymond places on assets that can help write insurance contracts against
"shiny days" is equal to the marginal decrease in consumption Raymond experiences when
it shines relative to when it rains.
    In equilibrium, the convenience yield will depend on the amount of safe assets in the
economy, their degree of pledgeability, and the size of the idiosyncratic shock. From the
expression in equation (12), it is clear that the convenience yield is non-negative (being
zero only in the case of perfect insurance, thus no difference between the marginal utility of
consuming in shiny or rainy days).
    It is also useful to define the t = 0 price of a theoretical risk-free security that pays par
in t = 1, in absence of idiosyncratic risks. That is, the frictionless value of funds in t = 1.

3      Special Case with Closed-Form Solutions
In this section, we present comparative statics for a special case with simplifying assumptions
that allow us to obtain closed-form solutions:

Assumption A1. Consider a case with the following simplifying assumptions:

    1. Preferences are characterized by CARA, with risk aversion  .

       ~1 = Y1 = 0.
    2. Y

       ~2  N (µ,  2 ).
    3. Y


                                                   13
   In this simpler setting  2 , which is the variance of aggregate endowment realizations in
period 2, captures the uncertainty agents face in periods 0 and 1 about consumption in
period 2 and fully captures aggregate volatility.


3.1    Characterization
This simplified case is useful for the following reasons. First, CARA utility eliminates wealth
effects, so agents' optimal risky asset holdings in t = 1 do not depend on the idiosyncratic
shock, nor does t = 1 prices. Second, having a deterministic endowment shock in t = 1
means that the t = 1 price of the long-term government bond and the private asset are
known in t = 0. Therefore, the worst-case outcome is merely the price in t = 1. Third,
normality in the final aggregate shock allows to recover a simple formulation of prices in
t = 1, facilitating comparative statics.

   Allocations: The benefit of this special set of assumptions is to dramatically simplify
equations (7) and (8), as the marginal rates of substitution between t = 1 and t = 2 must be
the same for both agents. We conjecture then that the optimal portfolio choice is each agent
holding half of the private asset (^r =    ^r =   ^ 0 /2) and that the long-term government
                                    1R      1S
bond is used to smooth the idiosyncratic shock. This implies that

                                            r       
                                  (1 + p1 ) 1 R -       = y - w,
                                                    2

giving the following optimal portfolio holdings for when it rains in t = 1:

                ^                         (y - w) 0                          ( y - w ) 0
      ^r = ^s = 0 ;               r                                r
       1R   1R                    1 R =           +   ;            1 S = -            +   ,
                2                          1 + p1   2                         1 + p1    2

                       + pa  0
                           1 2 . When it rains, Raymond buys some extra long-term gov-
ernment bonds from Shirley. This is intuitive. As Shirley suffers a bad idiosyncratic shock
when it rains, she would optimally sell bonds to Raymond to consume more in t = 1. Thus,

    By mere inspection of the optimal consumption paths, with CARA utility, the difference
in consumption between rain and shine cancels out and, thus, does not affect t = 1 pricing.
As we advanced, without wealth effects, agents' private asset holdings are their original ones,
and only long-term government bonds are used to smooth the idiosyncratic shock.
    Exploiting that collateral prices are deterministic (that is, the lowest values for the long-
term government bond and the private asset are their trading price because Y       ~1 = Y1 = 0)

where we have used the fact that a  ~ t = Y~t and Y
                                                  ~2 is normally distributed. Note that, because
there are no wealth effects, the price in t = 1 only depends on model parameters.
    In what follows, we focus on the case in which the expected return is high enough to have
positive pricing but not so high as to make it more valuable than the risk-free rate. Put
differently, the private asset's certainty equivalent is less than one, making it less attractive
as a store of value. In addition, to put some discipline to the model, we assume that agents'
preferences and the private asset's distribution satisfy the Hansen-Jagannathan bounds:

Assumption A2. Assume the private asset price is positive but lower than the long-term
bond price. That is

Proof. We only have to ensure that Raymond and Shirley hold both long-term government
bonds and private assets in t = 1 and that the idiosyncratic shock is large enough so that
agents cannot fully hedge their idiosyncratic risk. That is, the inequalities in (17) and (18)

   It is useful to express the initial prices of all securities as a function CY (see equation

                                  0  = prf

That is, prices in t = 0 can be decomposed into the traditional convenience yield, the
frictionless value of funds in t = 1, and the price of assets in t = 1.


3.2    Comparative Statics
Having characterized the symmetric equilibrium and ensured its existence, we now study
how prices change with changes in the supply of both short- and long-term public assets
(Sh0 and 0 ), the severity of idiosyncratic shocks (¯  y ), the pledgeability of private assets
                                                   2
(), and most importantly, aggregate volatility ( ). We defer the comparative statics with
respect to the supply of private assets for the next section, in which we endogenize it.
    Given that asset prices in (22) ­ (24) are expressed in terms of the traditional risk-
free rate and the convenience yield, the following lemma is useful to generalize the model's
comparative statics with respect to any of our parameters of interest,

Lemma 1. (Sensitivity of risk-free rates and convenience yields). Given the equilibrium
characterized in Theorem 1, for any model parameter z , we have the following comparative
statics,

                             prf           cs          c0R
                              0

                             CY            c           c 0R
                                    = -prf
                                        0
                                             1R
                                                 + CY       .
                             z             z           z
                        cs         cs
Proof. First, note that z 1R
                             = - z  1R
                                       for all z (see equations (15)). The result comes from
taking the derivative of equations (12) and (13), and noting that for CARA utility u (z ) =
-u (z ).

   The interpretation of these sensitivities with respect to any parameter z is informative of
the comparative statics with respect to the needs of risk sharing--what we call risk sharing

                                              18
effects. Assume, for example, that a change in z increases Raymond's consumption when it
shines, then reduces the need for risk sharing. In this case, the price of the frictionless risk-
free bond is lower as agents' abilities to transfer wealth from t = 0 to t = 1 is less relevant,
because their exposure to idiosyncratic shocks is lower. The decrease is proportional to the
wedge created by agents' limited hedging abilities: the convenience yield, CY . This direct
effect of better risk sharing on the price of the risk-free bond is captured by the first term
in the first equation of the lemma.
    Similarly, if an increase in z reduces the needs of risk sharing, the convenience yield is
lower and proportional to the value of funds needed to smooth consumption across states--
that is, the price of the risk-free bond. Put differently, as agents need less, or are better
at, risk sharing across states, they need less funds across those states, valued at prf 0 . This
direct effect of better risk sharing on the convenience yield is captured by the first term in
the second equation of the Lemma.

3.2.1   Changes in the Supply of Public Assets

Assume the government increases the total amount of both short- and long-term government
bonds. Because the government raises lump sum taxes in periods the bonds mature, and
because, in t = 1, the difference in consumption between rain and shine cancels out, changes
in issuance would not change consumption paths, not affecting prices in t = 1 (see equations
(19)­(20)). The increase in the supply of public assets, however, affects the possibilities of
risk sharing. From equations (14)­(16), we have

                         cs
                          1R       p1                        c0R
                             =            >0        and          = 0.
                          0    2(1 + p1 )                     0

The case for Sh 0 is similar, except that the partial derivatives with respect to consumption
                         1
are proportional to 2(1+   p1 )
                                .
    This partial derivative shows that an increase in short- and long-term government bonds
increases consumption in the bad state (of Raymond when it shines and of Shirley when
it rains) by improving risk sharing. This is a pure collateral effect: the economy has more
collateral to sustain insurance promises, which improves hedging against idiosyncratic shocks.
This effect shows up in the price of public and private assets in period 0. The next proposition
characterizes these changes.

Proof. The result comes from directly applying Lemma 1 to (22)­ (24).

    The Proposition shows that having more public assets that improve risk sharing makes
all assets, both public and private, less valuable as collateral, reducing their price. Also,
because p1 < 1, the effect of short-term government bond supply is larger than the impact of
long-term government bond supply. Thus, changes in short-term government bond supply
are more effective at increasing risk sharing, making the impact on prices larger.7
    The effect on the price of the private asset is also proportional to the convenience yield and
depends on its collateralizability. Interestingly, even if the private asset were not pledgeable
at all (that is,  = 0), the increase in idiosyncratic risk would still lower its price, since
private assets are also useful to transfer wealth to t = 1. Still, a higher  makes the private
asset more sensitive to changes in the supply of public assets, because of the extra change
in their value as collateral.

3.2.2    Changes in Private Asset Pledgeability

Now, assume there is an increase in pledgeability , perhaps by financial innovation or
deregulation. This increase makes risk sharing easier by indirectly increasing the supply of
collateral in the economy. As before, prices in t = 1 do not change, but allocations, from
equations (14)­(16) do. Specifically, we have

                            cs       pa
                                      1     ^0                             c0R

                                =              >0                and           = 0.

   7
    This result is consistent with Krishnamurthy and Vissing-Jorgensen (2012), Greenwood et al. (2015),
and Infante (2020), who show that the convenience yield, and thus the price of safe assets, is more sensitive
to changes in T-bill outstanding than changes in longer term U.S. Treasury bonds outstanding.

Proof. The result comes from directly applying Lemma 1 to (22)-- (24).

    The intuition is parallel to the increase in public assets, but the effect on the private asset
price is now ambiguous. On the one hand, private assets become more useful as collateral,
becoming more valuable, which operates through pa        1 CY . On the other hand, the implied
improvement in risk sharing tends to reduce the value of all assets.

3.2.3   Changes in Idiosyncratic Volatility

Assume now that the variance of idiosyncratic shocks increase, which given the binomial
structure of idiosyncratic shocks is captured by its size, y . This increases the needs for
risk sharing. As with government bonds, because of CARA utility, the realization of the
shock does not affect prices in t = 1 (see equations (19)­(20)). In terms of allocations, from
equations (14)­(16) we have

                         cs
                          1R       1                           c0R

Proof. The result comes from directly applying Lemma 1 to (22)­ (24).

  As idiosyncratic shocks become larger, the extent of idiosyncratic insurance decreases,
making all assets more valuable as collateral for risk sharing purposes.


3.3    Changes in Aggregate Volatility
In this subsection, we present our main result. We assume an increase in aggregate volatility,
which is captured by an increase in the variance of period 2 aggregate realizations,  2 . In
contrast to the previous cases, this generates a direct impact on prices at t = 1. From
equations (19)­(20),

                 p1   2           2
                              ^ 0 p1

                      p1      2

    The t = 1 price of the long-term bond always increases when volatility increases. This
can be interpreted as a standard "negative beta" effect of government bonds: as aggregate
volatility increases, the need to smooth consumption intertemporally from t = 1 to t = 2
increases, making long-term government bonds more valuable.
    The t = 1 price effect on the private asset is, however, more intricate. On the one
hand, similar to the long-term government bond, there is a "negative beta" effect propor-
tional to the private asset's certainty equivalent (the first term). On the other hand, more
volatility implies that the private asset is less desirable per se, as it encompass part of the
aggregate risk, putting downward pressure on its price (the second term). We focus on the
economically interesting case in which the second effect dominates and the private asset's

                                2
of this natural assumption for the effect of aggregate volatility on risk sharing.

    Remark of the plausibility of Assumption A3: Even though this assumption seems
natural, usually it is difficult to test given the lack of a purely exogenous shock on aggregate
volatility. The recent crisis caused by the outbreak of the COVID-19 virus constitutes,
however, a unique shock to aggregate volatility and higher future uncertainty--characterized
by being exogenous, unexpected, significant, without an end in sight, and truly aggregate
as it affects all countries at once. Given this unique event, we are in a position to test these
pricing assumptions. In Figure A.1 of Appendix A, we use VIX as a measure of aggregate
volatility, which was relatively stable during 2018 and 2019 and exhibited a large and sudden
increase starting in February 2020 with the COVID-19 outbreak. As the VIX was stable, the
spread between public and private yields was roughly constant. In February of 2020, as the
news about the COVID-19 virus spread, the behavior of public and private yields started
moving in opposite directions, consistent with Assumption A3.

           = 0. The effect of higher aggregate volatility on Raymond's consumption when it
shines comes through changes in the price of assets in t = 1, since those assets are used as
collateral in t = 0 to back promises that mitigate the effects of idiosyncratic shocks. That
is, risk sharing is affected by aggregate volatility purely by a valuation effect.
     The overall impact is mixed. On the one hand, the price of long-term bonds in t = 1
increases, improving risk sharing (this is the first term in equation 26) and the amount of
funds received when selling the long-term bond in t = 1 (this is the third term in equation
26). On the other hand, the price of private assets (under Assumption A3) in t = 1 decreases,
weakening risk sharing (this is the second term in equation 26). The net impact depends
on the relative amount of public and private assets used as collateral, which itself depends
on the supply of assets and the private assets' certainty equivalent and pledgablility. If the
economy depends heavily on private assets, overall consumption in the bad state decreases,
reducing risk sharing. Finally, because aggregate volatility in t = 2 does not affect the
price of short-term government bonds in t = 1, it does not affect risk sharing through the
use of short term bonds as collateral. These observations are summarized in the following
proposition

Proposition 4. (Risk Sharing Effects of Aggregate Volatility). Given the equilibrium char-
acterized in Theorem 1 and Assumption A3, if more private assets are used as collateral than

    When agents support risk sharing more with private assets than with public long-term
assets, the increase in aggregate volatility decreases insurance through a decrease in aggregate
collateralizability, as the most relevant asset to hedge idiosyncratic risk becomes less valuable.
In addition, the proposition also shows that, when the private asset becomes more useful as
collateral, captured by , then the negative sensitivity of risk sharing to aggregate volatility
becomes even stronger. Intuitively, when private assets become more important as collateral,
a reduction in their price triggered by an increase in aggregate volatility becomes more
pervasive for risk sharing. Finally, notice that relaxing Assumption A3 implies that the price
of both public and private assets would, perhaps counterfactually, increase with aggregate
volatility, unconditionally improving risk sharing in the economy.
    While Proposition 4 studies how aggregate volatility affects allocations, Proposition 5
characterizes how it affects asset prices at t = 0 through its role of facilitating (or not) risk
sharing.

Proof. The result comes from directly applying Lemma 1 to (22)­ (24).

    Proposition 5 shows that the effect of aggregate volatility on t = 0 prices depends on two
forces: a direct effect on the asset itself and an indirect effect on facilitating risk sharing.
    The direct, asset-specific effect of aggregate volatility on long-term government bonds and
private assets comes from their value changing in t = 1. While the value of long-term bonds
increases with volatility, the value of private assets decreases (under Assumption A3). The
indirect effect of aggregate volatility on risk sharing depends on the composition of collateral.
If there are fewer private assets used as collateral, then there is more idiosyncratic insurance
and the t = 0 value of all securities are lower as their convenience yield declines. Conse-


                                               25
quently, the impact on prices operates through risk sharing effects: if aggregate volatility
improves risk sharing, all assets become less valuable as collateral.
    These results underscore that the composition of collateral is important to understand
the overall impact of aggregate volatility on risk sharing and asset prices. The reason is that
public assets also serve to smooth consumption intertemporally, while private assets inherit
part of that volatility. When the economy, for some reason, relies heavily on private assets
for hedging against idiosyncratic shocks, an increase in volatility may generate a sudden dry
up of risk sharing. A relevant question, then, is what determines such composition? In the
next section, we endogeneize the private creation of assets and collateral.


4         Private Asset Creation
In this section, we entertain the idea that Raymond and Shirley have the ability to create
private assets at a cost. We then give conditions under which supplying public assets can
crowd out or crowd in private assets. To build intuition toward tackling this question, we
first study the effect of an exogenous supply of private assets on risk sharing and prices, as
these considerations will enter into agents' decisions to create private assets.


4.1       Model with private asset creation
Assume the cost of producing x units of private assets is C (x) in terms of consumption
goods, with C , C > 0. Agents incur this cost before choosing their portfolio in t = 0 and
sell these assets (perhaps to themselves) at the equilibrium price pa
                                                                    0 . Focusing on Raymond's
consumption path, we have

                                    0                    Sh                    ^0

where xR is the amount of private assets Raymond creates. If we assume that each agent
does not internalize their effects on prices, through the envelope condition we know that
Raymond's optimal production of assets is given by

                                         C (x       a
                                             R ) = p0 .                                      (27)

Thus, given the problem's symmetry (Shirley faces the same problem at t = 0), the total
stock of private assets is given by ^ =^ 0 + 2x , and all the previous pricing equations hold

4.2    Changes in the Exogenous Supply of Private Assets
Before studying what determines private asset creation, we discuss how private asset creation
affects prices and allocations. Expositionally, the reason we did not tackle these comparative
statics in the previous section is because an increase in private assets not only changes the
total amount of collateral in the economy, but also increases the amount of risk that agents
face in t = 2, which directly affects t = 1 prices, as was the case with aggregate volatility.
    Let's go back to the situation in which the supply of private assets is exogenous, at    ^ 0,
so there is no creation (which can be captured by C =  and then x      R = 0). From equations
(19) and (20), we have

                      p1                ^ 0 ) 2 p1
                          = -  µ - (1 + 
                       ^
                       0     2    2
                        a
                      p1                ^ 0 ) 2 pa -  2  2 p1 .
                          = -  µ - (1 +          1
                       ^
                       0     2    2                  2

An exogenous increase in the supply of private assets decreases both the t = 1 price of long-
term government bonds and of private assets. More private assets in the economy increases
agents' asset holdings, making them wealthier in t = 2. This puts downward pressure on all
assets proportional to private assets' certainty equivalence. In addition, the value of private
assets is also depressed because there are more of them in the economy, making them less
attractive for agents to hold.
    Similar to the analysis of Section 3.3, the partial derivative of cs 1R is the hardest to
characterize, because it involves a valuation effect on risk sharing. In this case, there is an
additional quantity effect on risk sharing because of the increased asset supply (absent, for

and c  ^ = 2 . The overall change on risk sharing has two opposing forces. On the one hand,
       0R


as discussed earlier, an increase in private asset supply increases agents' wealth by increasing
their asset holdings, reducing t = 1 prices of all assets. This valuation effect reduces the
extent of risk sharing and hence, cs   1R is smaller. On the other hand, an increase in private
assets improves risk sharing directly as there are more assets that can be used as collateral.
This quantity effect depends on the asset's collateralizability. In this case, the trade-off does
not come from opposing forces between private and public collateral valuations (as in the
case of aggregate volatility) but instead by the opposing forces between the valuation and
quantity of available collateral.
    The net effect on risk sharing then depends on how much the economy depends on long-
term assets for risk sharing and their pledgeability. For example, if there were few pledgeable
long-term assets in the economy (low 0 ,     ^ 0 ), and private assets were very pledgable (high ),
then the valuation effect would be small and the quantity effect would drive an improvement
in risk sharing. In contrast, if there were numerous pledgable long-term assets in the economy
(high 0 ,  ^ 0 ) and private assets were not very pledgeable (low ), then the valuation effect
would trump the quantity effect, resulting in a decrease in risk sharing. These observations
are summarized in the following proposition:

Proposition 6. (Risk Sharing Effects of Private Assets). Given the equilibrium character-
ized in Theorem 2, if there are numerous long-term assets used as collateral relative to the

Proof. The result comes from directly applying Lemma 1 to (22)­ (24).

    The results in Proposition 7 are similar to those in Proposition 5. Aside from the unin-
teresting effect of changes in t = 0 consumption, the overall effect on prices depends on the
indirect impact on risk sharing and the direct impact on the asset price itself.
    As discussed, an increase in private asset supply unequivocally reduces all t = 1 prices
and the value of long-term securities in t = 0. At the same time, it increases the quantity
of available collateral and the extent of risk sharing. The overall change in t = 0 prices then
depends on this trade-off. If  is large, for instance, more private assets allows for more risk
sharing, reducing asset prices in t = 0 further. But the valuation effect can dominate by
reducing risk sharing. If this reduction is large enough, the increase in convenience yields
can be significant, which may lead to the counterintuitive result that an increase in supply
increases prices through a deterioration of risk sharing.


4.3    Crowding Out
Here we explore how the production of private assets changes with the provision of public
assets. This analysis will shed light on the government's ability to crowd out private asset
creation and potentially steer the buildup of financial fragility (in terms of reduction of risk
sharing among financial intermediaries) to a sudden increase in uncertainty (in terms of an
increase in aggregate uncertainty). In fewer words, the government may want to reduce

                                              30
the relevance of private assets as collateral by creating public assets. Here we study the
consequences of such a policy. The following lemma gives the functional form of the model's
comparative statics for any model parameter.

    Lemma 2 gives us a generalized view of the model's sensitivities. Let's start with the
                                               pa
intuitive case, where in partial equilibrium,    ^ < 0 and thus |D | is positive. Following the
                                                 0


insights from Proposition 1, an increase in long-term government bonds would put downward
pressure on all asset prices because of better risk sharing. With private asset creation, this
effect reduces private asset creation, marginally decreasing the quantity of collateral, with
an overall effect of more risk sharing due to the increase of high quality collateral--that is,
government bonds. These effects are the celebrated and well documented crowding-out effect
of government debt.
    Interestingly, these standard results can be reversed once we factor in general equilibrium
forces. Specifically, if the marginal cost to produce private assets does not increase too fast
with private asset creation (that is, C  0), and the increase in public assets reduces risk
                                                                pa
sharing (this is, the conditions in Proposition 6 such that      ^ > 0), then |D | < 0 and all
                                                                  0


of the sensitivities would flip. Intuitively, an increase in government bonds would directly
increase the amount of collateral used for risk sharing, but the change in t = 1 prices could
reduce agents' abilities to share risk through the valuation effect. This pushes all t = 0 prices

                                               31
upward, consistent with agents' increased incentives to create more private assets. That is,
the general equilibrium valuation effect can induce agents to "exaggerate" a response by
increasing supply. These effects point at the lesser acknowledged possibility of crowding-in
effects of government debt.


5    Empirical Analysis
Our main theoretical result is that the effect of increased aggregate volatility on risk sharing
depends on whether agents rely on private or public assets to collateralize their idiosyncratic
insurance. While measuring the relative share of private to public assets, and their usefulness
as collateral, is challenging (see for instance Gorton et al. 2012), our model predicts that
this share determines the sensitivity of risk sharing to aggregate volatility. Unfortunately,
measuring risk sharing is also challenging, but we can use the convenience yield as a proxy
that captures the changes of risk sharing: when risk sharing is either not an important
consideration or can be provided easily, the value of assets as collateral is low, and thus
better risk sharing implies a lower convenience yield.
    Proposition 5 states that if the amount private collateral is larger than the amount of
public collateral (pa    ^
                       1 0 > p1 0 ) then an increase in aggregate volatility decreases risk
          cs
sharing (    2 < 0). Moreover, this sensitivity decreases as the private asset becomes more
            1R

                        2 cs
useful as collateral (     1R
                             2 < 0). We can test these sensitivities by studying the correlation

between the convenience yield and measures of aggregate volatility. More formally, in terms
of the convenience yield, which is inversely related to risk sharing, the testable implication
of our model is the following:

Proposition 8. (Testable Implications Based on the Convenience Yield). Given the equilib-
rium characterized in Theorem 1, if more private assets are used as collateral than long-term
government bonds--that is, pa    ^
                               1 0 > p1 0 --then an increase in aggregate volatility  in-
                                                                                         2

creases the convenience yield--that is,
                                                s

Moreover, if pa ^
              1 0 < 2, then the increase in convenience yield is larger if the private asset

Proof. See Appendix B.

    Proposition 8 states that an increase in aggregate volatility reduces risk sharing when
private assets are heavily used as collateral, increasing the convenience yield of assets. Fur-
thermore, when the private asset can be used more efficiently to hedge idiosyncratic risks,
this effect is magnified and the impact of aggregate volatility on the convenience yield is
even larger. The condition pa     ^
                                1 0 > p1 0 in Proposition 8 is necessary but not sufficient,
implying a positive sensitivity between the convenience yield and aggregate volatility when-
ever more private assets are used as collateral. The model does not have a clear prediction
when the share of public assets is larger.
    The insights from Proposition 8 motivates the empirical analysis. Taken literally, the
proposition shows that an unexpected increase in the aggregate volatility that individuals
expect to face in the future will affect the convenience yield today.9 These observations
motivate us to estimate the following empirical model:

          CYt = 0 +            j CYt-j + V V IXt + F F edF undst + Govt + t ,                              (33)

where CYt is first differences of well-known empirical measures of the safe asset conve-
nience yield and V IXt is first difference of the Chicago Board Options Exchange VIX
index, a measure of implied volatilities of S&P500 index options, to capture changes in ag-
gregate volatility. Lagged changes of the convenience yield are used to control for serial
autocorrelation.
   This empirical specification is inspired by Nagel (2016), who shows that the level of the
convenience yield depends on the level of rates, as it depends on the opportunity cost of
holding money. In particular, Nagel shows that, once you control for the level of rates, gov-
ernment asset supply loses its statistical significance in explaining the safe asset convenience
   9
     Our stylized three-period model is not designed to capture price changes in response to a fully dynamic,
infinite horizon, volatility process. The model is intended to capture how changes in the volatility of future
payoffs affect agents' exposure to idiosyncratic risk in the near term--that is, how future aggregate volatility
affects risk sharing today.


                                                      33
yield. Therefore, we also control for changes in the level of rates and changes in government
bond supply. Importantly, our specification differs as we focus on changes in the convenience
yield, rather than its level.
    We estimate the empirical model in equation (33) over different time periods in which the
literature has highlighted changes in the production and use of private assets as collateral.
One of those changes evolved in the long term, spanning several decades, and was given
by a process of slow financial innovation and deregulation.10 The other happened more
drastically over a short period and goes in the opposite direction, driven by the Global
Financial Crisis (GFC) that put the use of private assets as collateral under distress and
was promptly followed by tight regulations.11 Our model conjecture is that the sensitivity
of the convenience yield to changes in aggregate volatility is higher in the 90s and 2000s
when compared with the 70s and 80s. Moreover, this sensitivity increased rapidly in the
2000s leading toward the financial crisis, after which it declined as new regulations were
implemented.
    In what follows, we first perform a long-term analysis that captures the long-run evolution
of private assets as collateral since World War II, then we conduct a short-term analysis that
captures the more rapid increase in the use of private assets as collateral leading to the Great
Recession and the large collapse of such use afterwards.


5.1     Longer-Term Analysis
For the long-term analysis, we use the same data as Nagel (2016).12 The convenience yield is
measured as the spread between the banker's acceptance and the three-month T-bills spread
(BA/T-bill spread). The VIX index is only available from 1990 onward, but earlier time
periods are estimated using the projection of the VIX on realized S&P Index volatility. We
winsorize the changes in convenience yield and VIX at the 1st and 99th percentile to control
for outliers. The interest rate is the federal funds rate, and the government's supply of bonds
is captured by the total amount of T-bill outstanding and total U.S. debt relative to GDP.
  10
     For example, in the 1980s repos were excluded from automatic stay, contributing to the prevalence of
these types of contracts.
  11
     For example, the Liquidity Coverage Ratio places a larger regulatory burden on private assets that are
used to back financial firms' liabilities.
  12
     This dataset is available on Nagel's website.



                                                    34
This post-war data frequency is monthly, from January 1950 to December 2011.13 Details of
the data can be found in Nagel (2016).
    In this estimation, we study how the slow and persistent process of financial innovation,
financial engineering (such as securitization), and financial deregulation, which generated
an increase in the relative share of private to public assets used as collateral according
to Gorton et al. (2012), has changed the sensitivity of the convenience yield to aggregate
volatility. Inspired by Proposition (8), we would expected V to be larger in the more recent
decades. To capture this long-term change in sensitivity, we estimate model (33), splitting
the sample in 1990, and use two lags of the dependent variable as controls.
    Table 1 shows the estimates for the entire sample, using data before 1990 and using data
after 1990. The results show that the statistical significance of V IXt is much larger in
the latter part of the sample. That is, in the more recent time period, when the economy
faces an increase in aggregate volatility the convenience yield increases. From the eyes of
our model, this happens because of the economy's higher reliance on private assets, which
reduces risk sharing in response to an increase in aggregate volatility.

                                            [Insert Table 1]


5.2     Shorter-term Analysis
For the shorter-term analysis that covers the most recent period, we use the same data as
Infante (2020). The convenience yield is measured by the spread between the one-month
overnight index swap (OIS) rate downloaded from Bloomberg, and the four-week T-bill
rate, downloaded from the Federal Reserve H.15 Statistical Release. We again winsorize
the changes in the convenience yield and VIX at the 1st and 99th percentile to control for
outliers.14 Government supply is captured by the total amount of T-bill outstanding and
total amount of Treasury notes and bonds outstanding, published by TreasuryDirect. The
data frequency is daily and runs from August 2004 and April 2020. Here we estimate the
  13
     Nagel (2016) provides convenience yield data from January 1920, however Gorton et al. (2012) show
that the increase in private safe assets began at the start of the 1950s.
  14
     We also drop observations on quarter-end dates, and two days surrounding quarter-end, to exclude any
changes in short-term rates driven by financial firms' window dressing behavior. See Infante (2020) for more
details.




                                                    35
sensitivity of weekly changes using overlapping data to reduce the impact of high frequency
variations.15
    In this estimation, we study how the more stringent regulatory landscape implemented
after the Great Recession, which in principle reduced private asset creation and made the use
of private assets as collateral more difficult, has affected how the convenience yield reacts
to changes in aggregate volatility. Again, inspired by Proposition 8 we would expect the
coefficient on 5 V IXt to be smaller after the Great Recession.16 To capture the change in
sensitivity, we estimate model (33), splitting the sample in 2009, and use two lags of the
dependent variable as controls.
    Table 2 shows the estimates for the entire sample, using data before 2009 and using data
after 2009. The results show that the statistical significance of 5 V IXt is much larger before
the Great Recession than after, consistent with the idea that regulatory efforts after the crisis
reduced the economy's reliance on private assets. Again, intuitively, the lower reliance on
private assets makes risk sharing less responsive to changes in aggregate volatility.

                                              [Insert Table 2]

    We can further exploit the high frequency data to estimate the model in shorter time in-
tervals and see the evolution of 5 CYt 's sensitivity to 5 V IXt . Specifically, in each quarter,
we estimate the empirical model (33) using plus and minus two years of data.17 With this
strategy, we can keep track of the changes in sensitivities over time.
    Figure 1 shows the results. We can observe that the point estimate on 5 V IXt is positive
and statistically significant at the end of 2006. Arguably, this period is the pinnacle of the
securitization boom that began in the previous decade. We would expect that this period
also coincides with an increase in financial engineering, which allowed agents to use more
private assets as collateral. During the period running up to the GFC, the point estimate
begins to decline. It turns insignificant at the end of 2011, around the time when new
regulatory initiatives took hold and financial firms' ability to use private collateral was less
attractive. From the lens of our model, the results in Figure 1 suggest that before the onset

   17
      To increase the length of the time series, we exclude Treasury issuance controls, which, in our data set,
only begins at a daily frequency in August 2004. The results are qualitatively similar if we consider Treasury
issuance controls over a shorter time span.

and persisted thereafter.

6    Concluding Remarks
We have characterized the relationship between aggregate volatility, which determines the
cyclical properties of the economy, and risk sharing, which determines its distributional
properties. This relation is qualified by the composition of private and public assets that
are used as collateral to sustain insurance promises. As both assets are used for intra- as
well as intertemporal reasons, aggregate volatility can either improve or weaken risk sharing
depending on the importance of (or lack thereof) public collateral. The main linkage is then
given by the valuation of collateral, as aggregate volatility affects valuation of private and
public assets in different directions. An economy that relies relatively more on private assets
to collateralize risk sharing sees insurance decline when aggregate volatility increases.
    Financial intermediaries are among the largest players in trading public and private assets
to back contracts that insure against idiosyncratic shocks. This paper is particularly relevant
in that context, as it shows that changes in aggregate volatility will tend to cause stability
problems in derivative markets that rely largely on private collateral.
    Our model generates testable implications that relate aggregate volatility and risk sharing
depending on the intensity of using private assets as collateral. We overcome the difficulty
to measure risk sharing by using the convenience yield of safe assets as a proxy and testing
its sensitivity to changes in aggregate volatility. We provide empirical evidence that this
sensitivity has increased over the second half of the 21st century, and dramatically so during
early 2000s. This trend, however, has sharply reversed after the Great Recession. From the
prism of our model, this suggests that the U.S. economy's reliance on private collateral, and
thus the added fragility that comes with it, has increased during the second half of the 21st
century (consistent with financial innovation and financial deregulation) but declined after
the Great Recession, a period indeed characterized by stricter regulations.
    We also show that, because of the valuation implications of aggregate volatility, as the
economy becomes more stable, the value of public bonds decline relative to those of private
assets, prompting more production of private assets and endogenously making them more

                                              37
relevant to back insurance contracts. As such, economic stability endogenously induces
a higher dependence on private collateral, making risk sharing more fragile to shocks to
aggregate volatility. In short, stability creates a more fertile ground for fragility, planting the
seeds of its own instability. This insight provides a novel element--the relevance of private
assets relative to public assets to collateralize contracts--that policymakers should follow
when assessing the fragility of the economy and when imposing macroprudential safeguards.

Tables and Figures

 Table 1: Volatility versus Convenience Yield Pre- and Post- 1990
 This table shows the empirical results of equation (33) using monthly average data. The
 convenience yield measure is spread between the monthly average of the 3-month bankers
 acceptance and the monthly average of the 3-month T-bills. V IXt is the first difference
 of the monthly average of the VIX Index, and F edF undst is the first difference of the
 monthly average of the federal funds rate. log (T billOutt /GDPt ) is the log difference
 of total outstanding of T-bills to GDP, and log (Debtt /GDPt ) is the log difference of
 total U.S. debt to GDP. Two lags of the dependent variable are included as controls (not
 shown), with reported p-values of lags equal to zero. The sample runs from January
 1950 to December 2011. The dependent variable and the V IX are winsorized at the
 1% and 99%. Newey-West standard errors with 12 lags are reported. *, **, and ***
 denote significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels, respectively.

Table 2: Volatility versus Convenience Yield Pre- and Post- 2009
This table shows the empirical results of equation (33) using overlapping daily data. The
convenience yield measure is the spread between the 1-month overnight index swap rate
and the 4-week Treasury bills rate. 5 V IXt is the 5-day first difference of the VIX Index,
and 5 F edF undst is the 5-day first difference of the federal funds rate. 5 log (T billOutt )
is the 5-day log difference of total T-bills outstanding, and 5 log (U ST N otesOutt ) is
the 5-day log difference total U.S. Treasury notes and bonds outstanding. Two lags
of the dependent variable are included as controls (not shown), with reported p-values
of lags equal to zero. The sample without U.S. Treasury issuance controls runs from
December 2001 to April 2020, and the sample with U.S. Treasury issuance controls runs
from August 2004 to April 2020. Estimates exclude quarter-end dates (and ± 2 days
surrounding quarter-end). The dependent variable and the 5 V IX are winsorized at
the 1% and 99%. Newey-West standard errors with 21 lags are reported. *, **, and ***

   The expression for         2 comes from taking the derivative of  2 then using Proposition 2. Thus,

C       Alternative Government Tax Schemes
In this appendix, we explore the impact of implementing different government policies to tax agents. The
motivation is to capture the interaction between altering agents' intertemporal smoothing through taxation
and their risk sharing. We show that, if taxes can change the path of consumption, it may have valuation
effects on collateral, which affects risk sharing.
     Specifically, because the government is the only agent in the economy that can store wealth by raising
and holding funds through bond issuance and repayment, it can directly alter agents' consumption paths.
In this sense, the role of the government is to store agents' wealth for future periods, as their bonds are
the only (safe) way agents can carry wealth from one period to the next, and choose how much agents can
transfer. This assumption can be interpreted as a shortcut to the assumption that the government has access
to markets that the agents cannot, such as foreign investors.
     Therefore, in this case, we can write Raymond's consumption processes--which is identical to Shirley's--
in each period as

asset, respectively. In this case, T0 , T1 , and T2 are aggregate lump sum transfers to agents (negative values
are taxes). Note that these consumption equations are identical to the original model (equations (2)­(4)),
except that the government returns what it raises (plus interest) when short- and long-term government
bonds mature and manages its transfers to agents to balance its budget.
    We assume that the government must have enough funds to make payments intertemporally. That is, in
each period, the government must have enough funds to make final bond payments and transfers. Specifically,

                              t=0:                       T0       pSh  Sh

                                       Sh                           Sh Sh

                                                                   0 0 + p0 0

where the last equality ensures that the government has to balance its aggregate budget in t = 2. These
inequalities imply that the government uses its storage technology to transfer aggregate consumption from
one period to the next, but it must be able to fulfill its promises in each period. To simplify the analysis, we
will restrict the governments choice set by assuming that the government fully balances its budget in t = 1.
This implies that T2 = -0 , T0 = p      Sh  Sh
                                        0 0 + p   0 0 - T1 - Sh    0 , and thus the initial financing constraint
                     Sh Sh           19
implies that T0  p  0 0 + p    0 0 .
     Thus, in absence of idiosyncratic shocks (i.e., y = 0), the direct impact of the government's issuance and
tax policy is on how it affects the cost to transfer wealth from one period to the next.
     It is easy to show that in this context, under assumptions A1 and A2, Raymond and Shirley's optimal
portfolios are just as in the original model. Specifically, Raymond (Shirley) sells rain (shine) insurance to
Shirley (Raymond); and agents hold half of the private asset supply in all periods, half of the government's
issuance in t = 0, and rebalance their long-term government bond holdings in t = 1 to smooth their
idiosyncratic risk exposure. Incorporating the government's tax plan, as a function of T1 , agents optimal
consumption is

    That is, prices in this model are proportional to the prices in the original ones but scaled by the relative
distortion from the government's tax policy. A larger lump sum transfer in t = 1 increases consumption in
t = 1, and thus increase the need for intertemportal smoothing between t = 1 to t = 2, putting upward
pressure on t = 1 prices.

    The effect of different tax policies in t = 0 is the opposite to what happens in t = 1. As lump sum
transfers in t = 1 increases, there is more consumption in t = 1 and less in t = 0. In this case, the government
is effectively forcing agents to save more, making it less attractive to do so, putting downward pressure on
prices.
    Thus, the equilibrium in the case of alternative tax plans are the same as in the original model, scaled by
the direct effect of said tax plan. This implies that the comparative statics of all non-governmental variables
are as before, scaled by the tax distortion. The only important difference are the comparative statics with
respect to the government's t = 1 lump sum tax decision. These decisions not only have an effect on agents'

      T1 = - 2 . The direct effect due to changes in agents' consumption smoothing is capture by the
last term: 1/2. The effect on agents' risk sharing comes through a pure valuation effect: an increase in
T1 increases the price of the long-term bond and the private asset, augmenting agents' ability to hedge
idiosyncratic risks. This leads to the following result,

Proposition 9. Given the equilibrium characterized in Theorem 1 with an alternative tax plan, the initial
prices of the short-term government bond, long-term government bond, and private asset have the following

Lemma 1.



     The increase in lump sum transfers in T1 unequivocally makes all assets less valuable in t = 0. The
direct effect is an increase (decrease) in aggregate consumption in t = 1 (t = 0), which reduces the need to
transfer wealth from t = 0 to t = 1 and thus reduces t = 0 prices. This effect is somewhat muted by the
increase in t = 1 prices, which affects both long-term bonds and private assets. These effects are somewhat
mechanical and well understood. The novel change is the valuation effect on risk sharing. By making prices
higher in t = 1, assets are more pledgeable, allowing for more risk sharing, making the assets less valuable
in t = 0.
     This indicates that the government can improve the amount of risk sharing by either altering the amount
of government bonds or how they pay for them. An important element in these results is that the agents
cannot transfer resources intertemporally to undo the effects of government taxes. The only way agents can
react is through their demand for government bonds, thus affecting their price and the valuation effect. While


                                                     51
the power of the government to change the path of consumption may seem extreme, this assumption should
be taken as capturing incomplete markets, or other frictions in which taxation affects paths of consumption
in equilibrium.



D         Additional Empirical Analysis -- Daily Frequency
In this appendix, we show the results for the same empirical strategy described in section 5.2, but use one-day
differences rather than five-day differences. For this specification, we consider four lags of changes in the
convenience yield as controls.
     The results in Table D.1 are qualitatively similar to those in Table 2. There is a positive and statistically
significant relationship between changes in the convenience yield and changes in the VIX in the early part
of the sample, before the GFC. After the GFC, the relationship loses its statistical power.
     The results in Figure D.2 are qualitatively similar to those in Figure 1.20 We can observe that the
sensitivity of V IXt on CYt is positive and statistically significant toward the end of 2006 and subsequently
loses significance toward the end of 2010.
