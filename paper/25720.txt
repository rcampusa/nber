Policy News and Stock Market Volatility

                                          ABSTRACT

We create a newspaper-based Equity Market Volatility (EMV) tracker that moves with the VIX
and with the realized volatility of returns on the S&P 500. Parsing the underlying text, we find
that 72 percent of EMV articles discuss the Macroeconomic Outlook, and 44 percent discuss
Commodity Markets. Policy news is another major source of volatility: 35 percent of EMV
articles refer to Fiscal Policy (mostly Tax Policy), 30 percent discuss Monetary Policy, 25 percent
refer to one or more forms of Regulation, and 13 percent mention National Security matters. The
contribution of particular policy areas fluctuates greatly over time. Trade Policy news, for
example, went from a virtual nonfactor in equity market volatility to a leading source after
Donald Trump’s election and especially after the intensification of U.S-China trade tensions. The
share of EMV articles with attention to government policy rises over time, reaching its peak in
2017-18. We validate our measurement approach in various ways. For example, tailoring our
EMV tracker to news about petroleum markets yields a measure that rises and falls with the
implied and realized volatility of oil prices.

                          The history of thought in financial markets has shown a surprising
                          lack of consensus about a very fundamental question: what
                          ultimately causes all those fluctuations in the price of speculative
                          assets like corporate stocks…? One might think that so basic a
                          question would have long ago been confidently answered.
                                                                         Robert Shiller, 2014

    1. Introduction
    Volatility in aggregate equity returns is resistant to convincing interpretation. Shiller’s classic
1981 contribution shows that stock market ups and downs cannot be rationalized by realized future
dividends discounted at a constant rate.1 Partly motivated by Shiller’s demonstration, one major
line of research stresses time-varying expected returns in asset-pricing models with rational agents.
Another prominent line, also partly motivated by Shiller, stresses non-rational beliefs, limits to
arbitrage, and fads that move equity prices in ways not fully tethered to real investment
opportunities.2 See Cochrane (2017) and Barberis (2018) for recent reviews.
    We develop new data and evidence that inform rational and behavioral interpretations of the
volatility in equity returns. In a first step, we identify articles about stock market volatility in
leading U.S. newspapers and use them to construct an Equity Market Volatility (EMV) tracker.
Figure 1 displays the resulting measure, which runs from January 1985 to October 2018 and is
scaled to match the mean value of the VIX from 1985 to 2015. Our EMV tracker moves closely
with the VIX and the realized volatility of daily returns on the S&P 500, with correlations of about
0.8 (0.85) in monthly (quarterly) data. As we show below, a narrower EMV tracker tailored to
news about petroleum markets correlates well with the implied and realized volatility of oil prices.
Another EMV tracker, which we tailor to macroeconomic news, surges in the wake of episodes
that involve unusually high uncertainty about the near-term macroeconomic outlook – e.g., the
October 1987 stock market crash, the 9-11 terrorist attacks, the March 2003 invasion of Iraq, the
Global Financial Crisis, and the U.S. debt-ceiling crisis in summer 2011. These results suggest that
our EMV trackers capture important drivers of fluctuations in equity market volatility.

(1989), Cochrane (1992) and Barberis, Huang and Santos (2001), among many others. Cochrane
(1991) stresses the equivalence of excess volatility to return predictability.

  On the difficulty of drawing confident inferences about the presence of such fads, see Summers
(1986), Fama and French (1988) and Poterba and Summers (1988).
                                                 1
   In a second step, we parse the text in the EMV articles to quantify journalist perceptions about
the news items, developments, concerns, and anticipations that drive volatility in equity returns.
We classify these proximate drivers into about thirty categories, many of which pertain to
particular types of policy. This approach lets us assess the importance of each category to the
average level of stock market volatility and its movements over time. An immediate result is the
importance of news about the Macroeconomic Outlook, broadly defined, which receives attention
in 72% of all articles that enter into our EMV tracker. Most EMV articles discuss multiple topics.
Thus, we also find that 44 percent mention Commodity Market developments, 31 percent mention
Interest Rates, and 8 percent mention Financial Crises.
   The policy share of EMV articles rises over time, reaching peaks in the 2001-03 period (9/11
and Iraq Invasion), the 2011-12 period (U.S. debt-ceiling crisis and the “fiscal cliff”), and the
period since Donald Trump’s election in November 2016. Parsing the role of policy more finely,
we find that 35 percent of EMV articles refer to Fiscal Policy (mostly Tax Policy), 30 percent
mention Monetary Policy, 25 percent mention Regulation, and 13 percent mention National
Security matters. We also construct EMV trackers tailored to these policy categories and find that
each one fluctuates markedly over time. For example, our National Security EMV tracker is low
in most periods but highly elevated after the 9/11 terrorist attacks and around Gulf Wars I and II.
Trade Policy matters went from a virtual nonfactor for equity market volatility in the twenty years
before Donald Trump’s election to a leading source afterwards, especially since the intensification
of U.S-China trade tensions from March 2018.
   How should we interpret these findings? According to the efficient markets view, equity price
movements reflect genuine news that alters rationally grounded forecasts of future earnings and
discount factors. Under this view, it’s natural to interpret news reports as a catalog of the rational
forces that drive the volatility of equity returns. Shiller (2014, 1496-97) articulates a rather
different view: “The market fluctuates as the sweep of history produces different mindsets at
different points of time, different zeitgeists…. [A]ggregate stock market price changes reflect
inconstant perceptions, changes that Keynes referred to with the term ‘animal spirits.’” Under this
view, we expect newspaper articles to (imperfectly) mirror these mindsets and their shifts over




                                                  2
time.3 Under either view, we see our methods and measures as helpful in efforts to address the
“basic question” posed in the epigraph.
    Our EMV trackers have several noteworthy attributes: First, their construction is
straightforward, transparent, easy to refine, and simple to replicate. Second, the frequency and
volume of newspaper text affords much scope for granular characterizations of the forces that
underlie equity market volatility and its movements over time. We develop several tailored EMV
trackers that exploit this granular richness. Third, our text-based approach is useful for assessing
the role of wars, policy risks, and other hard-to-quantify sources of stock market volatility. Fourth,
our measurement methods are highly scalable across countries and over time. Although we focus
on the volatility of aggregate U.S. equity markets from 1985 onwards, our methods extend readily
to any country or time period with digital newspaper archives and data on aggregate equity returns.
Finally, we update our EMV trackers monthly in real time.4 These real-time updates facilitate
efforts to assess the out-of-sample performance of our measures.
    There is a vast literature on equity returns and stock market volatility. Fama (1981), Chen, Roll
and Ross (1986), and Fama and French (1989) are influential early studies that relate equity returns
to macroeconomic forces. More recent contributions include Boyd et al. (2005) on stock market
reactions to unemployment news, Killian and Park (2009) on the role of oil price shocks, and
Bekaert et al. (2013) on the relationship between monetary policy and stock market volatility.
    In one of the first studies to use newspaper text, Niederhoffer (1971) considers “world events”
from 1950 to 1966 – as indicated by large headlines in the New York Times – and relates them to
U.S. stock market movements. Cutler, Poterba and Summers (1989) relate returns on U.S. equities
to macroeconomic data and news accounts of “political and world events.” They conclude that it’s
hard to explain more than half the variation in aggregate stock prices by information in these
sources about discount rates and future cash flows. Baker, Bloom, Davis, and Sammon (2019)
consider thousands of daily stock market moves greater than |2.5%| in fourteen national markets.
Based on systematic human readings of next-day newspaper accounts, they find that journalists
attribute 37% of large daily moves in the United States to news about government policy. Evidence
that policy developments move stock markets resonates with the theoretical work of Pastor and


3
  Shiller (2014, page 1497) also writes “News media tend to slant their stories toward ideas of
current interest, rather than useful facts that readers no longer find interesting.” Our results help in
forming a judgement regarding that claim as well.

Veronesi (2012, 2013), who model the role of government policy as a source of economic
uncertainty and the resulting implications for risk premia and equity prices.
      Another line of research explores the usefulness of stock market volatility, as measured by the
VIX, for predicting and assessing other important financial and economic variables. Nagel (2012)
shows the VIX to be highly predictive of the return on liquidity provision. Dreschler and Yaron
(2011) show that the equity variance premium – the squared VIX minus the expected realized
variance – has predictive power for stock returns. Forbes and Warnock (2012) and Rey (2018)
document global patterns in capital flows, asset prices and credit growth that are closely tied to the
VIX. Our EMV trackers offer a new means to identify which developments underlie the
relationships of stock market volatility to other outcomes of interest uncovered in earlier works.
      Finally, we contribute to the rapidly growing body of research in economics and finance that
applies text-based methods. Gentzkow, Kelly, and Taddy (2018) offer an excellent survey of
research in this area. Here, we mention a few papers that are closest to ours. Baker, Bloom and
Davis (2016) construct newspaper-based indices of economic policy uncertainty. They find that
stock price volatility reacts more strongly to their policy uncertainty indices in firms with greater
exposure to policy risks. Hassan et al. (2019) apply tools from computational linguistics to
conference calls about earnings announcements to construct time-varying, firm-level measures of
political risks. Their text-based measures also have explanatory power for firm-level variation in
stock price volatility. Davis and Seminario (2019) quantify firm-level policy risk exposures using
the text in 10-K filings. Their measures account for much of the huge dispersion in firm-level stock
returns in the wake of Donald Trump’s surprise victory in the 2016 presidential election. Kelly,
Manela, and Moreira (2018) develop an econometric model of text usage, estimate the model on
multiple text sources, and use the estimates to backcast, nowcast and forecast financial variables.
Manela and Moreira (2017) apply machine-learning methods to front-page articles in the Wall
Street Journal to develop an “NVIX” measure of stock market uncertainty and the perceived risk
of rare disasters. They conclude that policy risks and especially war-related concerns are a major
source of variation in equity risk premia, broadly in line with the literature on rare disasters and
asset prices.5

    2. Methodology
    2.1 Constructing an Equity Market Volatility Tracker
    In constructing our Equity Market Volatility (EMV) tracker, we follow Baker, Bloom and
Davis (BBD) in using scaled frequency counts of newspaper articles that contain selected terms.
We differ in our approach to term selection. They rely on human readings of 12,000 randomly
sampled articles to populate a list of candidate terms. They then select the permutation of candidate
terms that minimizes the sum of false positives and false negatives in computer-automated
classifications compared to human classifications.6 Their approach makes sense in developing a
measure of economic policy uncertainty, for which there is no obvious observable counterpart. We
exploit the observability of stock market volatility to take a much less labor-intensive approach.
    We first specify terms in three sets, as follows:
    E: {economic, economy, financial}
    M¢: {“stock market”, stock OR stocks, “equity market”, equity OR equities, S&P OR “S &
             P”, “Standard and Poors” OR “Standard and Poor’s” OR “Standard and Poor” OR
             “Standard & Poors” OR “Standard & Poor’s}
    V¢: {volatility OR volatile, “realized volatility”, uncertain OR uncertainty, risk OR risky,
             variance, VIX}
Second, we randomly select a 30% sample of articles that contain at least one element in each of
E, M¢ and V¢ from 1990 to 2015.7 Third, using the sampled articles, we construct a candidate
EMV tracker for each permutation of elements in M¢ and V¢.8 Specifically, we count articles that
contain the candidate permutation, scale that count by the number of all articles in the same
paper and month, standardize the scaled frequency counts to unit standard deviation for each
paper, and then average the resulting standardized, scaled counts over papers by month.9 Finally,
we select the permutation that achieves the highest R-squared value in an OLS regression of the
30-day VIX on the candidate EMV tracker using monthly data from 1990 to 2015.



6
  BBD use this procedure to select the “Policy” terms for their newspaper-based Economic Policy Uncertainty
Index. Their approach to selecting terms in “Economy” and “Uncertainty” is similar in spirit but much less formal.
7
  Here, we use four newspapers for which we could download many articles that meet our criteria: the Miami
Herald, Dallas Morning News, San Francisco Chronicle, and Houston Chronicle.
8
  We consider all permutations in P(M¢) × P(V¢), where P(•) denotes the power set and × is the Cartesian product.
“Equity market” never appears in our sample of articles, so we drop it. That leaves five elements in M¢ and six in V¢,
which yields 2$ × 2% = 2048 permutations.
9
  These mechanics follow Baker, Bloom and Davis (2016) exactly.
                                                          5
     Log, level, and level specifications with quadratic and cubic terms yield the same best-fit
permutation, given by
     E: {economic, economy, financial}
     M: {“stock market”, equity, equities, “Standard and Poors” (and variants)}
     V: {volatility, volatile, uncertain, uncertainty, risk, risky}
In the analyses below, our EMV tracker is based on this best-fit term set.
     In assessing our term sets and our selection procedure, a few additional remarks will be helpful.
We start with parsimonious E, M¢ and V¢ sets to reduce the danger of overfitting. While each
regression in our selection procedure has few explanatory variables (just one, except when we add
quadratic and cubic terms), we consider many such regressions. We eschew terms like “Lehman
Brothers,” “Bernanke” and “Iraq war” that might improve in-sample performance but perform
poorly out of sample. And we prefer terms that extend easily to other countries and settings. Terms
like “economy,” “stock market,” “volatility” and “uncertainty” translate readily, while terms like
“Standard and Poors” have obvious counterparts for other national stock markets. In this respect,
we regard it as fortuitous that “VIX” did not make the cut for our best-fit permutation, because
there is no VIX counterpart for many national stock markets.
     Armed with our best-fit term set, we obtain monthly counts of articles that contain at least one
term in each of E, M and V for eleven major U.S. newspapers: the Boston Globe, Chicago Tribune,
Dallas Morning News, Houston Chronicle, Los Angeles Times, Miami Herald, New York Times,
San Francisco Chronicle, USA Today, Wall Street Journal, and Washington Post. At this stage,
we use counts from the full set of articles published in each newspaper, not a sample, and we again
scale by the count of all articles in the same paper and month.10 We then standardize the scaled
counts and average over newspapers by month. In a final step, we multiplicatively rescale our best-
fit EMV tracker to match the mean value of the VIX from 1985 to 2015.
     Figure 1 displays our EMV tracker from January 1985 to October 2018.11 The series exhibits
pronounced upward spikes in reaction to the 1987 stock market crash, the 1998 Russian financial



10
   The reader might wonder why we don’t use all eleven papers in the term set selection procedure. The answer is
purely one of feasibility. We cannot obtain a large sample of machine-readable articles for most newspapers. Nor
can we put millions of queries to digital newspaper archives to cover all the permutations of M¢ and V¢. Given the E,
M and V sets, however, we need only two article counts per paper per month – the EMV count and the “all” count.
11
   Data for the CBOE 30-day VIX starts in 1990. After selecting our best-firm term set using data from 1990 to 2015,
we obtained the VIX data developed in Berger et al. (2019) back to 1983. Thus, our EMV tracker data before 1990
and after 2015 are “out of sample” in the sense that they are outside the period used in our term selection procedure.

crisis, the Enron and WorldCom accounting scandals and bankruptcies in 2001-2002, the full-force
eruption of the financial crisis in September 2008, and the U.S. debt-ceiling crisis in the summer
of 2011. Several other episodes triggered smaller spikes. We validate our EMV tracker, assess its
performance in various ways, and consider robustness checks in Section 3 below. Before doing so,
we explain how to construct our category-specific trackers.
    2.2 Parsing the Text and Constructing Category-Specific Trackers
    We parse the text in our best-fit EMV articles to quantify journalist perceptions about the
particular forces that drive volatility in equity returns. As a first step, we classify these forces into
10 general economic categories and about 20 policy-related categories. These classifications
provide a basis for assessing the importance of each category for the average level of stock market
volatility and its movements over time.
    Our classification approach is conceptually simple: If certain category-relevant terms appear
in an EMV article, we infer that the article discusses one or more topics covered by the category
in question. For example, consider our term sets for Interest Rates (one of our general categories)
and Monetary Policy (one of our policy categories):
    Interest Rates: {interest rates, yield curve, fed funds rate, overnight rate, repo rate, T-bill
            rate, bond rate, bond yield}
    Monetary Policy: {monetary policy, money supply, open market operations, fed funds rate,
            discount window, quantitative easing, forward guidance, interest on reserves, taper
            tantrum, Fed chair, Greenspan, Bernanke, Volker, Yellen, Draghi, Kuroda, Jerome
            Powell, lender of last resort, central bank, federal reserve, the fed, European Central
            Bank, ecb, Bank of England, bank of japan, people’s bank of china, pboc, pbc, central
            bank of china, Bank of Italy, Bundesbank}
If an EMV article contains one or more terms in Interest Rates, we infer that the article includes
a discussion of interest rates; likewise, if it contains one or more terms in Monetary Policy, we
infer that it discusses monetary policy. As these examples suggest, many EMV articles contain
terms in more than one category. That is by design. We do not draw overly sharp boundaries
between overlapping categories, nor do we aim to draw distinctions that are too fine for our text
sources and methods. Appendix B sets forth a complete listing of our category-specific term sets.




                                                   7
       Next, we calculate the share of EMV articles in each category and multiply by the EMV
tracker value to obtain category-specific trackers. For example, to measure the importance of
monetary policy considerations in equity market volatility during month t, we calculate
                              # {𝑬 ∩ 𝑴 ∩ 𝑽 ∩ 𝐌𝐨𝐧𝐞𝐭𝐚𝐫𝐲 𝐏𝐨𝐥𝐢𝐜𝐲}?
                          *                                    @ 𝐸𝑀𝑉? ,
                                       # {𝑬 ∩ 𝑴 ∩ 𝑽}?
where # denotes the count of newspaper articles in the indicated set, and 𝐸𝑀𝑉? is the value of our
overall EMV tracker in month t. We use this same approach for all categories.
   As before, a few additional remarks will be helpful in assessing our method. First, the
overfitting concern that led us to start with parsimonious E, M¢ and V¢ sets in developing our
overall EMV tracker is no longer germane, because we have already identified our best-fit EMV
articles. At this point, our goal is to capture and classify the full set of topics and concerns that
animate discussions of stock market volatility in the EMV articles. Thus, several of our category-
specific sets contain many terms. 𝐌𝐨𝐧𝐞𝐭𝐚𝐫𝐲 𝐏𝐨𝐥𝐢𝐜𝐲, for example, has more than 25 terms. Other
categories with lengthy term sets include Macroeconomic News & Outlook, Commodity
Markets, Taxes, and Financial Regulation.
   Second, while we deliberately avoid particularistic terms like “Bernanke” and “Iraq war” in
constructing our overall EMV tracker, we embrace them in devising our category-specific term
sets. The difference in approach reflects a difference in objectives. In developing our overall EMV
tracker, we seek a measure with good prospects for fitting well out of sample and ready portability
to other national stock markets and eras. In contrast, we design the category-specific term sets to
characterize and quantify the specific forces that underlie stock market volatility and its variability
over time and space. We recognize that our category-specific sets require considerable
modification when applied to other countries and time periods. That is inherent in an effort to
characterize forces that are specific to time and place. Still, our roughly 30 categories are portable
over time and space, even when many of the category-specific terms are not.
   Third, our term sets for the policy-related categories extend Baker, Bloom and Davis (2016)
and Davis (2017). They populate their category-specific term sets by consulting textbooks,
newspapers, “risk factor” discussions in 10-K filings, and other sources – including their own
knowledge of economic matters and input from other economists in seminars and personal
communications. We extend the policy-related term sets of BBD and Davis and build term sets for
the general economic categories using the same basic approach. Thus, our classification approach


                                                  8
is expert-driven and judgmental, in contrast to the algorithmic use of external libraries to classify
n-grams as in Hassan et al. (2019), who borrow methods from computational linguistics.
     Table 1 considers all EMV articles from 1985 to 2017 and reports the percent that contain
terms in each category.12 The top row says that news and other remarks about the Macroeconomic
Outlook feature very prominently, appearing in 72% of all EMV articles. News about Commodity
Markets appear in 44% of EMV articles, while news about Interest Rates figures in 31%. Panel B
in Table 1 considers our policy-related categories, including aggregated categories for Fiscal
Policy and Regulation. Tax Policy and Monetary Policy each receive attention in 30% of EMV
articles, the aggregated Regulation category features in 25%, and National Security matters figure
in 13%. Most other categories play a small role over the 1985-2017 period as a whole, although
they can become prominent in certain episodes, as we show below.


     3. Validation and Robustness Checks
     3.1 EMV Tracking Performance
     Table 2 provides information about how well our EMV measure tracks monthly movements in
stock market volatility from 1985 to 2018. As reported in column (1), regressing the VIX on
contemporaneous EMV values yields a highly statistically significant slope coefficient of 0.76 and
an R-squared value of 0.61. The first two lags of EMV are also statistically significant, and their
inclusion raises the R-squared to 0.70. Adding lagged VIX pushes the R-squared value well above
0.8 and knocks out the statistical power of the lagged EMV terms, but the contemporaneous EMV
term remains highly significant. Log-log specifications and regressions of realized stock market
volatility on EMV yield similar results.
     Figure 2 plots the VIX and the fitted values for the column (1) specification. For the most part,
fitted values – and the underlying EMV values – move closely with the VIX. There are some
exceptions: (i) fitted VIX jumps less than actual VIX in reaction to the October 1987 stock market
crash, (ii) fitted VIX largely misses the VIX reaction to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August
1990, (iii) fitted VIX persistently exceeds the VIX from 1993 to 1996 and 2005 to early 2007, and
(iv) fitted VIX reverts to the mean more quickly than actual VIX after major upward spikes, a
pattern that is most evident for the cataclysmic events of September-November 2008.

12
   The column entries sum to more than 100 percent for two reasons: First, because certain terms such as “Fed funds
rate” appear in the term set for more than one category. Second, because many EMV articles refer to multiple
sources of equity market volatility.
                                                         9
    We could address (i) and (ii) by incorporating episode-specific terms like “Black Monday” and
“Kuwait invasion” into our EMV term sets. We refrain from that approach for reasons discussed
in Section 2.1. Fit errors of type (iv) reflect how press coverage evolves after surprise events that
jolt financial markets. In the immediate wake of events like 9-11 and the 2011 U.S. debt-ceiling
crisis, an outpouring of newspaper articles discusses the event and its bearing on stock market
volatility. Elevated volatility levels persist, but press coverage abates as the event loses its
newness. As a result, our EMV tracker drops relative to the VIX in the near-term aftermath of such
events. A closer examination of regression residuals in Appendix Figure C.1 reinforces this
interpretation. Figure C.2 shows that adding lagged VIX to the regression specification greatly
dampens fit errors of type (iv), except for the stock market crash of 1987. While this temporal
pattern in the residuals is an interesting commentary on press coverage, it does not undercut the
usefulness of EMV for our purposes. In any event, adding lagged VIX to the regression
specification largely resolves this type of tracking error as well as errors of type (iii).
    3.2 Comparison to NVIX
    Manela and Moreira (2017) construct a monthly news-based implied volatility (NVIX)
measure using abstracts and headlines of front-page articles in the Wall Street Journal. From this
text source, they create large “feature sets” of n-grams that serve as explanatory variables in
support vector regressions fit to the VIX. While their method and text source differ from ours, the
spirit of their statistical undertaking is similar. As another check on EMV, we now assess how it
fares – with respect to similarity to the VIX – in comparison to NVIX. We use monthly data from
January 1985 to March 2016 for this purpose, the longest overlap period for the three measures.
    Table 3 reports summary statistics. EMV correlates with the VIX at 0.78, which compares to
0.70 for NVIX. The mean absolute monthly difference between EMV and VIX is 3.7 points, as
compared to 4 points for NVIX. The EMV standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis are much
closer to the corresponding VIX statistics. Turning to Figure 3, we see that NVIX underperforms
EMV in tracking the VIX during the second half of the 1980s and from 2012 to 2015. NVIX
performs better than EMV in 1990 around the time of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
    In summary, each measure has weaknesses and strengths, but EMV outperforms NVIX in
tracking the VIX and matching its moments. A big reason for EMV’s superior performance is its
reliance on a much larger text corpus – the full text of eleven major newspapers, as compared to
abstracts and headlines of front-page articles in a single paper. In fact, when we rerun specification

                                                  10
(1) in Table 2 using an EMV measure based on a single paper, the R-squared value drops
drastically – by 17 to 38 percentage points. See Appendix Table C.2.13
     3.3 Robustness to Alternative Newspaper Weightings
     We also assess the assumption, implicit in our method, that each newspaper is equally useful
(on the margin) in tracking equity market volatility. To do so, we double the weight on each
newspaper, one at a time, in constructing EMV. Then we rerun specification (1) in Table 2 using
the EMV tracker based on the modified newspaper-level weights. Table C.2 reports the results.
Doubling the weight on the Wall Street Journal or the Miami Herald yields an incremental R-
squared gain of .002 to .004. Doubling the weight on the San Francisco Chronicle leaves the R-
squared unchanged, and doubling the weight on any other paper lowers the R-squared, with a
maximal drop of 0.011. We also drop each newspaper, one at a time, and repeat the exercise. In
two cases, dropping the paper yields a modest fit improvement, in one case it has no effect, and in
the other eight cases fit deteriorates modestly. The largest absolute change in the R-squared value
from dropping newspapers is only 0.013.
     We draw three conclusions from these results. First, tracking performance improves greatly by
drawing on multiple newspapers. Second, the performance of our preferred EMV measure is robust
to alternative newspaper weightings on the margin (i.e., given eleven papers in our baseline).
Third, while using multiple newspapers yields huge performance gains, the gains are subject to
strong diminishing returns. Eleven papers appear sufficient to exhaust the gains. Of course, we
cannot preclude the possibility that an untried newspaper would materially improve EMV tracking
performance. However, even the financially-oriented Wall Street Journal matters little on the
margin, which casts doubt on the notion that an untried paper would add a lot.
     3.4 A Petroleum Markets EMV Tracker
     We now subject our method to a different type of assessment, one that is especially pertinent
for our category-specific measures. Specifically, we construct a Petroleum Markets EMV tracker
and compare it to observed measures of oil price volatility. To that end, define a Petroleum
Markets term set, {oil, petroleum, Alaska pipeline, Keystone pipeline}, and compute




13
  In Appendix Table C.1, we also show that EMV and NVIX each have independent explanatory power in VIX
regressions, regardless of whether we control for lagged VIX. This pattern suggests that applying machine-leaning
methods to the full text of our eleven newspapers would materially improve on our EMV tracker. Of course,
implementing such an approach requires direct access to the full text of each paper.
                                                        11
                            # {𝑬 ∩ 𝑴 ∩ 𝑽 ∩ 𝐏𝐞𝐭𝐫𝐨𝐥𝐞𝐮𝐦 𝐌𝐚𝐫𝐤𝐞𝐭𝐬}?
                        *                                      @ 𝐸𝑀𝑉? .
                                       # {𝑬 ∩ 𝑴 ∩ 𝑽}?
   This Petroleum Markets EMV tracker correlates at 0.59 with the CBOE Crude Oil Volatility
Index (0.68 in quarterly data) from 2007 to 2018 and at 0.52 with the CBOE Crude Oil Realized
Volatility (0.57 in quarterly data) from 1986 to 2018. Inspecting Figure 4 confirms that our
measure mirrors many of the movements in oil price volatility. It also misses badly in certain
episodes, e.g., after the stock market crash of 1987 and during the Global Financial Crisis. These
episodes involve much larger jumps in stock price volatility than oil price volatility. Hence, it’s no
surprise that our measure, with its focus on equity markets, remains highly sensitive to these events
even when we narrow its scope to petroleum markets. Nor is this sensitivity a problem for our
purposes, given that we aim to characterize the sources of equity market volatility.
   In summary, Figure 4 gives assurance that our category-specific EMV trackers capture
variation in the role of the corresponding topics and concerns as drivers of equity market volatility.
We interpret our category-specific EMV trackers accordingly.


   4. What Drives Fluctuations in Stock Market Volatility?
   4.1 News About the Economic Outlook
   Figure 5 displays our EMV tracker for Macroeconomic News and Outlook, which contains
about 80 terms and reflects an expansive conception of the category. Since topics covered by this
category appear in 72 percent of EMV articles (Table 1), Macro EMV moves similarly to overall
EMV and to the VIX. For example, the Macro EMV tracker jumps in reaction to the October 1987
stock market crash, the Russian Financial Crisis, the Global Financial Crisis, and the debt-ceiling
crisis in summer 2011 – episodes that involved major upsurges in uncertainty about the
macroeconomic outlook. In contrast, the Enron and WorldCom scandals – which arguably injected
little uncertainty about the macro outlook – generated a muted response in Macro EMV relative to
overall EMV (Figure 1) and relative to the VIX (Figure 2).
   Our method is easily adapted to more tightly focused EMV trackers. As an illustration, Figure
6 plots a Financial Crisis EMV tracker based on the following term set: {financial crisis, financial
crises, Northern Rock failure, Lehman failure, Lehman Brothers failure, AIG Takeover, euro
crisis, Eurozone crisis, Greek crisis}. Two events stand out in the evolution of this EMV tracker:
the Global Financial Crisis, and the U.S. debt-ceiling crisis of 2011. The Mexican Peso Crisis of
1994, the Asian and Russian Financial Crises of 1997-98, and concerns related to Greece and
                                                 12
China in 2015 also leave clear marks on our Financial Crisis EMV tracker. Interestingly, the
tracker’s baseline level is consistently higher after the Global Financial Crisis, which suggests that
the GFC prompted a persistent shift in perceptions about the relevance of financial crises to U.S.
stock market volatility.
     4.2 The Growing Role of Policy Matters
     Figure 7 reveals an upward drift in the fraction of EMV articles that devote attention to policy
matters, with peaks in the 2001-03 period (9/11 and Iraq Invasion), the 2011-12 period (U.S. debt-
ceiling crisis and the “fiscal cliff”), and the period since Donald Trump’s presidential election in
November 2016. To construct Figure 7, we sum EMV article counts over the policy-related
categories in Table 1 and divide by the EMV article count summed over all categories – both
general economic and policy-related categories.14 We take this approach, because limits on the
number of terms per search query prevent us from directly computing the share of EMV articles
that contain one or more of our policy-related terms. As a robustness check, we performed the
direct calculation using the much smaller set of “Policy” terms in the Economic Policy Uncertainty
Index.15 This alternative calculation, reported in Appendix Figure C.3, also shows an upward drift
in the policy fraction of EMV articles, broadly in with Figure 7.
     This upward drift suggests a growing role for policy concerns in U.S. stock market volatility.
It resonates with other evidence of an expanding government role in the economy and an upward
trend in policy-related economic uncertainty, as discussed in Baker et al. (2014) and Davis (2017):
secular growth in government expenditures as a share of GDP, the increasing scale and complexity
of the regulatory system, the increasing complexity of the federal tax code, the growing share of
business “risk factors” that U.S. firms attribute to government policy in their 10-K filings, a secular
rise in the newspaper-based Economic Policy Uncertainty Index of Baker, Bloom and Davis
(2016), an upward drift in the frequency with which the Federal Reserve System’s Beige Books
refer to policy uncertainty, and a secular rise in U.S. political polarization that has drawn enormous
attention from political scientists. On this last point, see, e.g., McCarty, Poole and Rosenthal
(2016). Since these long-term developments show little sign of reversal, policy concerns are likely
to remain a major source of stock market volatility for many years.



14
 For Fiscal Policy and Regulation, we use article counts for the more disaggregated categories.
15
 Their Policy term set is {regulation, regulations, regulatory, deficit, deficits, legislation, legislative, legislature,
white house, federal reserve, the fed, congressional, congress, war, tariff.}
                                                            13
     As suggested by the annotations in Figure 7, the mix of policy-related factors in stock market
volatility varies over time. We can use our category-specific term sets to develop this point in a
systematic, quantitative manner. As an illustration, Figure 8 displays the percent of EMV articles
by month that contain one or more terms in Trade Policy. The figure shows a dramatic upsurge
in trade policy concerns as a source of stock market volatility after Donald Trump’s election. Days
after his inauguration, President Trump pulled the United States out of the Trans-Pacific
Partnership, which had yet to be ratified. He threatened to jettison the North American Free Trade
Agreement, triggering contentious trade negotiations with Canada and Mexico. The Trump
administration also imposed tariff hikes on steel, aluminum and other goods and has threatened to
impose many more. Since March 2018, the United States has ratcheted up tariffs and tariff threats
with China, and the China has responded in kind. These are among the developments that took
trade policy concerns from a virtual nonfactor in U.S. stock market volatility to a leading source.16
     4.3 Policy-Related EMV Compared to Economic Policy Uncertainty
     We now construct a Policy-Related EMV tracker and compare it to the Economic Policy
Uncertainty Index of Baker, Bloom and Davis (2016). While both measures rely on scaled
frequency counts of newspaper articles, they are conceptually distinct. The EPU Index aims to
quantify policy-related uncertainty for the economy as a whole. The Policy-Related EMV tracker
aims to quantify the full range of policy-related volatility sources for the stock market in particular.
To obtain our Policy-Related EMV tracker, we multiply the overall EMV tracker in Figure 1 by
the policy-related fraction in Figure 7. We then multiplicatively rescale to match the mean EPU
value from 1985 to 2009, so that we can readily compare the two series.
     Figure 8 displays the comparison. The two measures react to many of the same developments
but also show systematic differences. Stock market crashes and financial crises leave larger marks
on Policy-Related EMV. National security developments, national elections, and fiscal policy
conflicts are more visible in the EPU Index.
     Panel B in Table 1 makes a closely related point. Financial Regulation receives attention in
25% of EMV articles as compared to 6% of EPU articles. In contrast, National Security, Healthcare
Policy, and Entitlement and Welfare Programs are among the policy-related categories that loom
larger for Economic Policy Uncertainty than Equity Market Volatility. On the whole, policy-

                                                       14
related discussions appear more frequently in EPU than in EMV articles. That’s sensible and
reassuring, because we use “policy” terms in identifying EPU articles.
    4.4 A Suite of Policy-Related EMV Trackers
    We now implement the method in Section 2.2 to construct a suite of policy-related EMV
trackers. Figures 10, 11 and 12 display EMV trackers for monetary and fiscal policy categories.
Certain events loom large in all three trackers: the stock market crash of October 1987 and the
debt-ceiling crisis of 2011. Certain events are particularly prominent in the Monetary Policy EMV
tracker: the start of QE1 and QE2, the Taper Tantrum, and the July 2015 Greek Referendum that
shook the Eurozone. Other events are more prominent in the Tax Policy EMV tracker: the Bush
Tax Cuts of 2001 and 2003, the Fiscal Cliff episode in late 2012 and early 2013, and the Tax Cut
and Jobs Act enacted in November 2017. Yet other events are prominent in the EMV tracker for
Government Spending, Deficits and Debt: the Government Shutdowns of 1995-96 and 2013 and
the Fiscal Cliff.
    The EMV tracker for Financial Regulation in Figure 13 shows large upward spikes around the
enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, during the Global Financial Crisis, and around the
time of the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010. The EMV tracker for Elections and Political Governance in
Figure 14 fluctuates at low levels except for short time windows around the U.S. presidential
elections of 2000, 2016 and, to a lesser extent, 1992. The National Security EMV tracker in Figure
15 exhibits large upward spikes around Gulf War I, the 9-11 attacks, and the early stages of Gulf
War II. EMV trackers for Healthcare Policy and Trade Policy (Figures C.6 and C.7) also show
distinctive fluctuations. All of the underlying data for these figures, and more, are available at
http://www.policyuncertainty.com/EMV_monthly.html, with regular monthly updates.
    To summarize, these figures show highly distinctive temporal movements in the category-
specific EMV trackers. Certain events, most notably the market crash of 1987, leave a strong mark
in most or all of the category-specific trackers. Many other events, however, leave a strong mark
in only one or a few of the category-specific trackers. The distinctiveness of the temporal patterns
in the category-specific trackers is potentially quite useful in downstream econometric work that
seeks to explain firm-level outcomes.




                                                15
   5. Summary and Directions for Research
   We develop a simple, transparent, scalable method for constructing newspaper-based Equity
Market Volatility (EMV) trackers. Implementing the method using eleven major U.S. newspapers,
our EMV tracker moves closely with the VIX and with realized volatility on the S&P 500.
   We also parse the text in the EMV articles to quantify journalist perceptions about the forces
that underlie stock market volatility and its movements over time. We classify these forces into
about thirty categories – including Macroeconomic News, Monetary Policy, Tax Policy and
Financial Regulation – and construct a tailored EMV tracker for each category. This exercise
reveals an upward drift over time in the role of policy as a source of stock market volatility, as
measured by the share of EMV articles that discuss policy-related matters. It also reveals Monetary
Policy and Tax Policy to be the most important policy-related sources of stock market volatility,
followed by our aggregated Regulation category. The contribution of specific policy categories to
stock market volatility fluctuates markedly over time.
   There are several natural directions for future research. First, we are currently using our
category-specific EMV trackers to explain and interpret the distribution of firm-level stock price
volatilities and its movements over time. Second, our methods extend readily to any country or
time period with digital newspaper archives and data on aggregate equity returns. By developing
EMV trackers for multiple countries, one can explore the specific global and national forces that
underlie stock market volatilities around the world. Third, our basic approach could be usefully
applied to construct and parse newspaper-based trackers for other concepts. It would be
straightforward, for example, to adapt our methods to construct newspaper-based trackers of
consumer confidence, business sentiment and the like, and to delve into the specific forces that
drive their movements.

Notes: Each column reports a regression of the indicated dependent variable on the indicated row
variables, using monthly data from January 1985 to December 2018. The sample for Columns (2)
and (4) starts in March 1985. EMV is Equity Market Volatility tracker developed in Section 2.1.
VIX is the monthly average of daily closing values on the CBOE 30-day implied volatility index
from January 1990 onwards, appended to data from Berger et al. (2019) in earlier years. RVol is
the standard deviation of daily returns on the S&P500 in the month. Robust standard errors in
parentheses.

and is downloadable at http://apps.olin.wustl.edu/faculty/manela/data.html. See the notes to
Table 2 for definitions of VIX and EMV. We multiplicatively scale the NVIX and EMV to
match the mean value of the VIX from 1985 to 2015.

              Notes: The Equity Market volatility (EMV) tracker runs from January 1985 to October 2018. We construct it using scaled
              frequency of articles that contain terms about Economics, the Stock Market, and Volatility in 11 leading U.S. newspapers, as
                                                                                                                                    22
              detailed in Section 2.1. We scale the EMV tracker to match the mean value of the VIX from 1985 to 2015.

Notes: The NVIX measure is from Manela and Moreira (2017) and runs through March 2016. See the notes to Figure 2
for the VIX and NVIX.. We multiplicatively scale NVIX and EMV to match the mean value of the VIX from 1985 to 2015.

                                          compute a moving average with six lags and leads, truncating lags (leads) near the sample start (end).

 Notes: The BBD EPU Index is from Baker Bloom and Davis (2016). To construct the Policy-Related EMV tracker, we multiply our
 overall EMV tracker by the fraction of EMV articles the discuss policy matters. We multiplicatively rescale Policy-Related EMV to
 match mean of the BBD EPU Index from 1985 to 2009.                                                                       30

Notes: We construct the National Security EMV tracker as the product of our overall EMV tracker and
the share of EMV Articles that contain one or more terms in National Security. See Appendix B for the
list of terms.                                                                                      36
                Appendix A. Additional Information About Our Text Sources

       Figure A.1 plots the total number of articles in the newspapers we draw on in constructing
our Equity Market Volatility (EMV) tracker and related measures. The total article counts fluctuate
in the range of 60-90 thousand per month in the first 16 years of our sample period, then drift
down, reaching lows of about 35,000 per month.
       The rightmost column of Table A.1 reports average daily article counts by newspaper from
1985 to 2017. The remaining columns report average daily counts and percentages of all articles
that satisfy various criteria defined by our E, M and V term sets. Not surprisingly, the Wall Street
Journal stands out for percent of articles devoted to topics encompassed by our term sets.
       Five newspapers are not available to us for the entire 1985-2018 time period. Access World
News discontinued coverage of the Dallas Morning News from July 2016. The ProQuest
newspaper archive covers the New York Times through 2015 only, as of this writing. Access World
News coverage of USA Today from Access World News is missing in 1985, 1986 and the first half
of 1987. roquest archive coverage of the Houston Chronicle is missing for most of 1985, and its
coverage of the Washington Post is missing in 1985 and 1986.
       When missing, we impute scaled counts using fitted values from the regressions,
                                              #         #
                         !"#$ = & # + ∑*∈,∗ )* !"*$ + .*$ , for / ∈ 0 1*22
where N* is the set of newspapers with complete coverage (Boston Globe, Chicago Tribune, Los
Angeles Times, Miami Herald, San Francisco Chronicle, and Wall Street Journal), 0 1*22 is the
set of newspapers with missing coverage, and !"*$ is the scaled EMV frequency count for
newspaper i in month t. We run this regression from 1988 to 2015 for each paper ion 0 1*22 and
use it to impute missing !"#$ values in other months.

Notes: See main text, Section 2.1 for definitions of the E, M and V term sets. The last column reports articles per day based
on a count of weekdays per year. The Dallas Morning News coverage stops in May 2016, the New York Times coverage
stops at the end of 2015, the USA Today coverage begins in the middle of 1987, the Houston Chronicle coverage begins
near the end of 1985, and the Washington Post coverage begins in 1987, so the days are adjusted for those newspapers.

                            Appendix B. Category-Specific Term Sets

        Our term sets for the Policy-Related Categories build on Baker, Bloom and Davis (2016)
and Davis (2017). We developed terms sets for the General Economic Categories for this paper.
We group related terms into topics within categories, as indicated by { }. These topical groupings
play no role in counting methods or analysis, but we find them helpful in conceptualizing the
boundaries of each category. In defining our Regulation term set, we hit a ceiling on the number
of terms per search query. Given this constraint, we limit our Regulation term set to the union of
terms in the most common regulation categories plus a few generic terms indicative of government
regulation.

                          Appendix C. Additional Analysis and Results

       Figures C.1 and C.2 display the time series of residuals for the regressions reported in Table
2, Columns (1) and (3), respectively.

        Table C.1 expands on the VIX regressions in Table 2 by using NVIX as an explanatory
variable instead of, or in addition to, our EMV tracker. There are two main results in Table C.1:
First, columns (1) to (4) show that EMV outperforms NVIX in tracking the VIX. Second, columns
(5) and (6) show that EMV and NVIX have independent explanatory power in the sense that neither
knocks out the statistical significance of the other. Moreover, including both explanatory variables
substantially improves the goodness of fit.

Notes: Each column reports a regression of VIX on the indicated row variables, using monthly
data from January 1985 to March 2016. VIX is the monthly average of daily closing values on the
CBOE 30-day implied volatility index from January 1990 onwards, appended to data from Berger
et al. (2019) in earlier years EMV is Equity Market Volatility tracker developed in Section 2.1.
NVIX is the news-based volatility measure developed in Manela and Moreira (2017) using front-
page abstracts and headlines in the Wall Street Journal.

        Table C.2 explores the sensitivity to alternative newspaper weightings in regressions of
VIX on EMV. Column (1) replicates our baseline specification reported in Column (1) of Table
2. The remaining rows adopt the same regression specification but double the weight on each
newspaper, one at a time, in constructing the EMV tracker (Panel A), drop each newspaper one
at a time (Panel B), or use a single newspaper in constructing EMV (Panel C).

       Figures C.3. displays a time series for the fraction of EMV articles that contain one or
more of the “Policy” terms that Baker, Bloom and Davis (2016) use in constructing their
newspaper-based Economic Policy Uncertainty Index for the United States. Figures C.4 to C.7
display additional category-specific EMV trackers.

Notes: All series are at the monthly level. EMV is the Equity Markets Volatility Index. The dependent variable is always the VIX where
VIX refers to the monthly average of daily close of the VIX implied volatility index on the S&P500. Columns (2)-(12) of Panel A
correspond to a different version of our EMV Index as the independent variable where the version is constructed such that the column
title newspaper has twice the weight as the other newspapers. Columns (2)-(12) of Panel B correspond to a different version of our EMV
Index as the independent variable where the version is constructed such that the column title newspaper has been removed from the index.
Robust standard errors in parentheses. The slope coefficient is statistically significant at the 1% level in all regressions.

Notes: This charts shows the total number of articles in the eleven newspapers that enter into our EMV

missing papers in certain periods.                                                                      45

Notes: This chart shows the fraction of EMV articles that contain one or more of the policy terms used to
construct the U.S. EPU Index of Baker, Bloom and Davis (2016). We compute this fraction for each
newspaper and month, average over papers by month, and then compute a moving average with six 48     lags
and leads, truncating lags (leads) near the sample start (end).
