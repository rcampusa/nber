                                             ABSTRACT

This study examines a wide range of health and economic outcomes in a sample of Irish- and African-
American Civil War veterans during the postbellum period. The information in our data is from a variety
of circumstances across an individual’s life span, and we use that to attempt to explain whether the
disparities in mortality are related to disparities in life experiences. We find evidence of disparities
between Irish and blacks and others in such variables as occupation and wealth, morbidity, and mortality.
The data do not reveal disparate outcomes for all blacks and Irish; they only reveal inferior outcomes
for slave-born blacks and foreign-born Irish. For the freeborn blacks and native-born Irish, for whom
the historical tradition suggests discrimination and prejudice, the data only hint at such problems.

                                   To hate all but the right folks
                                    Is an old established rule.
                                                        Tom Lehrer, “National Brotherhood Week”

       With razor-sharp sarcasm, satirist Tom Lehrer reminded his listeners that prejudice and
discrimination were well-established phenomena. In the early 1960s, one could still find signs
reading “Colored Entrance” throughout the American South. It was widely believed that signs
reading “No Irish Need Apply” were equally ubiquitous in Northern cities at the turn of the
twentieth century. While historian Richard Jensen has argued persuasively that this was largely
a myth, the sentiment was real.2 The main concern was their Catholicism, but the Irish also
provoked fear among Americans because of their use of violence. Irish men often worked at job
sites that were controlled through the force of Irish gangs; Irish women were often domestics.
As famine wracked their homeland, the Irish migrated in mass to the U.S. Despite the fears,
there was no attempt to exclude them.
       At different times in U.S. history, these two groups, the Irish and the blacks, supplied the
unskilled labor on which a rapid rate of industrialization depended. For the latter half of the
nineteenth century, it was the Irish immigrants. By the early years of the twentieth century, with
the reduction of immigration from Europe, the “Great Migration” of blacks northward
maintained needed labor supplies. In cities such as Lowell, Massachusetts, the first transition
was dramatic.3 Ninety percent of the labor force was reported to be native born in 1849, many of
them of Irish ancestry. Six years later, only 35 percent were native born; the balance were
immigrants, largely from Ireland. This contributed to the “de-skilling” of the labor force
(whereby unskilled workers gradually replaced skilled craftsmen as capital substituted for labor)
and to the rise of the “Know-Nothing” Party (which was particularly strong in de-skilled areas).
       As industrialization preceded apace, scholars such as Oscar Handlin, who studied the
Irish in Boston, found they were at the bottom of the occupational hierarchy.4 Other scholars
note that the Irish and free blacks lived in the same neighborhoods and intermarried in the
antebellum period.5 Like the blacks, the Irish were often unskilled, innumerate, and subjected to
discrimination. Notes Joel Mokyr:

                                                 1
        The Irish in Handlin’s Boston were excluded from more desirable professions not only by
        the prejudice and suspicion of others, but because of their lack of capital and training.
        Even the blacks, most similar to the Irish in occupational experience, did better than they
        did.... Even in peddling and groceries to their own kinsmen the Irish seem to have done
        poorly in the USA in contrast to Britain ..., which is fully consistent with our finding that
        the percentage of overseas emigrants in commercial occupations was very low and that
        they were, on the whole, not very numerate.6

        After the Civil War, as industrialization firmly took hold, the Irish and the blacks were
still near the bottom of the socio-economic hierarchy, but there were some changes. The
movement of southern blacks northward, albeit not in the magnitudes of the “Great Migration,”
was still large enough to cause a deterioration in the relative position of northern blacks. The
arrival of other Roman Catholic immigrants from southeast Europe, many without the ability to
speak English, led to an increase in the relative position of the Irish. Withal, this is still the
period when prejudice against the Irish is characterized by the idea that “No Irish Need Apply.”
        This study examines a wide range of health and economic outcomes in a sample of Irish-
and African-American Civil War veterans in the second half of the nineteenth century. We find
evidence of disparities between Irish and blacks and others in such variables as occupation and
wealth, morbidity and mortality. The information in our data is from a variety of circumstances
across the span of an individual’s life, and we use that to attempt to explain whether the
disparities in mortality are related to disparities in life experiences.
        Our data were collected under the auspices of Robert Fogel’s Early Indicators of Later
Work Levels, Disease, and Death project at the University of Chicago’s Booth School of
Business.7 The Early Indicators life-cycle health histories of Union Army veterans contained in
the databases of the Center for Population Economics (CPE) provide insight into how well these
two groups did relative to other veterans in the post-bellum period. The Union Army Data Set
(UA) consists of the military, pension, census and lifetime medical records of white men from 25
Northern states who served as infantrymen in 331 companies in the Union Army during the Civil
War. The U.S. Colored Troops (USCT) data set consists of identical records of black men who
served as infantrymen in 52 companies of the Union Army during the war.8
        For present purposes, the sample was limited to veterans who did not desert, who
survived the war, and for whom an age at death is available. White officers were excluded from


                                                   2
the USCT data. Whites in the UA database, both Irish and non-Irish, were divided into those
born in the U.S. (native-born) and elsewhere (foreign-born). Blacks have been subdivided into
those born in free-states and those born in slave states (as those states were considered in 1837).9
Table 1 contains the counts of veterans in each of the three groups (plus two subgroups for each
group) and in the total that led to our final sample of 19,951 veterans used in the analyses that
follow. For expository purposes, the four columns expressing subtractions from the initial total
are expressed as percentages of the initial sample size.
       Table 1 highlights several differences among the groups and subgroups. The foreign-
born whites were much more likely to desert than the native-born; the two subgroups of Irish
were less likely to desert than the respective subgroup of non-Irish. The native-born Irish had a
rate similar to USCT born in a free-state, while USCT born in slave-states had the lowest rate of
desertion. However, the slave-born USCT were 50 percent more likely to die in service than
native-born non-Irish; the native-born Irish having a remarkably low rate. Finally, the database
is much less likely to have an age of death for foreign-born non-Irish and blacks, whether
freeborn or slave-born.

         1
           Recruits' (and their parents's) places of birth were determined using information found in their
        pension, military service, and census records. The non-Irish UA are divided into two subgroups:
        Native Born and Foreign Born. The former includes all recruits born in any of the present-day United
        States. The latter includes recruits with a birthplace outside of the United States. Irish is defined as any
        recruit born in Ireland or with at least one parent born in Ireland. This group is also divided into Native
        Born and Foreign Born groups, but the latter category only includes recruits born in Ireland. Finally,
        the USCT are divided into two groups: those born in slave states and those born in free states (as
        defined in 1837).
        2
           We dropped any recruit that ever became an officer from the black sample and only those recruits
        that started as officers from the Irish and non-Irish UA samples.
        3
          Includes all recruits that died during the war or while still enlisted in the service. For example, black
        troops that enlisted in 1863 (with a three year contract) and died fighting in frontier battles or during
        the march home in 1866 were excluded from our final sample.
        4
          Sub-group totals do not equal sum of parts because birthplace was not available for all recruits.

       Using the individuals in the “Final Sample” in Table 1, we want to look at how mobile
they were—where did they live before and after the war? In addition to their geographic
mobility, we want to look at their occupational mobility; not all of them were at the bottom of
the hierarchy. How many succeeded and where? We then will compare their health status by
looking at the incidence of disease and their cause of death. Finally, we will look at survival
rates of the various groups and calculate hazard ratios. First, however, we must discuss how we
determine who is Irish—and how we can enlarge the sample.


I. Who is Irish?
       The Union Army data includes 1,817 individuals that we know were born in Ireland or
whose parents were born in Ireland. There are many more people with Irish surnames in the
database. Some of these are third-generation (or more) Irish, for we know that neither they nor
their parents were born in Ireland. Unfortunately, complete information is not available on
veteran’s birthplaces, much less their parents’ birthplaces, and there are many individuals for
whom information is lacking to establish what generation American they are or whether they
belong to a particular ethnic group.
       Since some information required for our analyses involves linkage to U.S. censuses, and
since roughly two-thirds of the names in the Union Army database could not be linked
conclusively to the 1860 census, the 1,110 individuals contained in the final sample constitutes
too small a number to address some of our questions. Thus, to augment the sample, we turned to
the IPUMS One Percent Sample of the 1850, 1860, and 1870 censuses. We searched for


                                                     4
surnames where at least 25 people had that surname and 80 percent or more of them were born in
Ireland. The first restriction was to have sufficient numbers to suggest the name was not the
result of a single family; the second, to make sure they were largely Irish. This generated a list
of 201 surnames. In several cases, different spellings of names that would be pronounced the
same were captured by this rule (e.g., Cain-Kane, Conner-Connor-O'Connor, Kelley-Kelly,
O'Neal-O'Neil). As a result, we chose not to augment the list with additional homonyms (e.g.,
Kain or O’Neill) that did not satisfy the two restrictions. This approach added a total of 502
individuals to the 1,110 originally identified to give us a total sample of 1,612 individuals.
       The consequences of this definition were explored by examining several demographic
statistics for the resulting sample against those of alternative rules of defining an Irish surname
using the IPUMS sample. For example, a more restrictive definition might require that there be
at least 50 people with a given surname; a less restrictive definition, 10 people. All three cases
assume that 80 percent or more of them were born in Ireland. Table 2 reports the results.
Changing the rule for determining whether someone is Irish leads to minor changes in the
summary statistics: the less restrictive the rule, the greater the percentage of rural veterans that
are included. They are only slightly taller and are less long-lived, which means lower survival
rates. This table supports the decision to define Irish in this manner, but alternative definitions
need to be explored.10 Changes in the rule for determining whether someone is Irish lead to only
small changes in these summary statistics.11

       In Table 3, we use the variables reported in Table 2 to compare the different groups and
subgroups. Height is correlated with both economic well-being and health. For non-Irish
whites, the average native-born veteran was just under five feet, eight inches tall, with the

                                                  5
     average foreign-born veteran approximately an inch shorter. The average native-born Irish white
     was the same height as the average non-Irish white (combining the native- and foreign-born), but
     the foreign-born Irish were two-thirds of an inch shorter than their native-born counterparts. The
     colored troops born in a free state were a half-inch shorter than the average Irish troops (again
     combining the native- and foreign-born), while the slave-born USCT were a third of an inch
     shorter than their freeborn counterparts. Thus, there is a 1.3-inch difference in the average height
     of the tallest and shortest subgroup. It is no surprise that this measure suggests the health
     trajectory of slave-born blacks was poorer than native-born whites.
              With respect to age at death, the non-Irish lived to an average age of 69.1 years with the
     Irish living about six months less. The native-born Irish lived a bit longer than the native-born
     non-Irish, and they proved to be the longest lived of the subgroups. The foreign-born non-Irish
     lived six month shorter lives than the native-born non-Irish, but 10 months longer than the
     foreign-born Irish did. The foreign-born Irish, in turn, lived about twenty months longer than the
     freeborn USCT. The shortest-lived of any group was the slave-born USCT who lived to an
     average age of only 65.3 years, more than four years less than the native-born Irish.

were born in free states were roughly a half-year younger than the native-born non-Irish, but
their survival rates were several percentage points lower than what might have been predicted
from the white experience. The USCT born in slave states were born, on average, at the same
time as the native-born non-Irish, but the survival rate among those who survived the war was
even lower than those born in free states.
       The final column reports the percent that were recorded as living in a rural area when
they enlisted. Urban areas were defined as places where 2,500 or more individuals lived, so
many of the “urbanites” are from quite small places. The freeborn blacks are the most urbanized
by far; with a majority of them living in such places. The native-born non-Irish are the most
rural, with almost 80 percent of them reported as such; slave-born blacks are next at about 75
percent. The native-born non-Irish and Irish are more rural than their foreign-born counterparts,
with a thin majority of the foreign-born Irish classified as rural.

II. Geographic Mobility
       There are two types of mobility to be investigated: geographic and occupational.
Geographic mobility of the two ethnic groups can be seen in the following figures. First,
consider the Irish. In Figure 1, we consider only those born in the United States. Of these, 52.7
percent were born in the Northeast, with another 38.3 percent born in the Midwest. By way of
contrast, about 47.7 percent of the native-born non-Irish Union Army veterans were born in the
Northeast, with 41.1 percent born in the Midwest. In Figure 2, we see where the Irish enlisted
for the war, and the same distribution is present, with the percentages for the non-Irish whites at
roughly 32.7 percent in the Northeast and 58.6 percent in the Midwest.

The growth of Detroit and Chicago is evident. At enlistment, we can divide the Irish into those
who were born in the United States and those who were born in Ireland. The native-born Irish
have already begun to migrate; only 36.3 percent of them remain in the Northeast, but 57.8
percent of the foreign-born enlist there. 55.2 percent of the native-born are now in the Midwest
as compared to 35.0 percent of the foreign born.
         By 1890, as Figure 3 depicts, the percentages for the two regions have reversed for all
Irishmen (35.6 percent Northeast vs. 54.0 percent Midwest). By this time, the foreign-born also
have begun to migrate west, as the Northeast was home to only 26.2 percent of the native-born
and 44.9 percent of the foreign-born. The Midwest was home to 63.4 percent of the native-born
and 44.6 percent of the foreign-born. The non-Irish exhibited a similar pattern as the native-born
Irish.




                                                  9
       Figures 4–6 provide the same information for blacks. Of the USCT, 88.5 percent were
born in the South, with 5.2 percent born in the Northeast and 6.3 percent born in the Midwest.
Of the native freeborn, 61.5 percent were born in the Northeast with 8.0 percent in the Midwest,
and 30.5 percent in the South (as defined by the census as opposed to the Confederacy). Perhaps
a tenth of those categorized as freeborn were born outside the country. Of the slave-born, 93.9
percent were born in the South, with the balance in border states. The birthplaces of USCT are
shown in Figure 4.
       The places of enlistment are roughly similar to birthplaces, with 80.1 percent in the
South, but the balance is roughly evenly split between the Northeast and Midwest. For the
freeborn, 66.1 percent enlisted in the Northeast, 7.1 percent in the Midwest, and the balance, 26.8
percent, in the South. For the slave-born, 85.0 percent enlisted in the South, with 4.9 percent in
the Northeast (particularly the Middle Atlantic) and 10.0 percent in the Midwest (particularly the
West North Central). The places of enlistment are in Figure 5.
       In 1890, 70.4 percent of the USCT are still in the South. This includes 21.8 percent of
the freeborn and 74.5 percent of the slave-born. The largest share of the former are in the Mid-
Atlantic, while the largest share of the latter are in the East South Central regions. Of the USCT,
7.7 percent are in the Northeast. That area is home to 50.0 percent of the freeborn veterans, the
vast majority of whom live in the Middle Atlantic region, but only 4.1 percent of the slave-born
live in the industrializing Northeast. The Midwest has become home to 20.7 percent of the
USCT, with 24.4 percent of the freeborn and 20.4 percent of the slave-born residing there. Of
those living in the Midwest, the East North Central was home to 21.8 percent of the freeborn,
while the West North Central was home to 12.7 percent of the slave-born. The result is in Figure
6.

       Overall, the USCT were far less mobile than the native-born Irish and the non-Irish UA
veterans. The problems faced by the slave-born are well known; nevertheless some of them are
beginning to move north and west by 1890. The freeborn are slightly more mobile than the
slave-born, but they too are less mobile than whites.



III. Occupational Mobility
       The second type of mobility to be considered is occupational mobility. We have adopted
a six-way occupational distribution: high- and low-skill white-collar, farmer, high (skilled) and
low (semiskilled) blue-collar, unskilled, with the balance being unclassified. We have two
snapshots of these populations. The first is from the enlistment records, while the latter is from
the 1890 census. The former is reported in Table 4; the latter, Table 6.

            The similarities between the native-born and foreign-born Irish and non-Irish are
    immediately apparent. The foreign-born are much less likely to be farmers and much more
    likely to be unskilled, often industrial, workers. There are relatively fewer of them in the high
    white-collar positions, and relatively more in blue-collar positions. The slave-born are
    overwhelmingly either farmers or unskilled. The same is true of those born in free states, but the
    proportions of the two are reversed. They are more likely to be semiskilled than any group other
    than the foreign-born Irish. On the other hand, they are completely missing from white collar
    occupations.12
            It seems natural to inquire if this occupational distribution is consistent with other readily
    available information. These results are consistent with those in a sample assembled by
    Glatthaar for his study of the USCT, the census data assembled by Horton and Horton for their
    study of free blacks in Boston before the Civil War, and a sample assembled by Curry of free
    urban blacks in the antebellum period.13 In particular, Joel Mokyr calculated a 14-way
    distribution for both the 1841 Irish census and for the records of Irish migrants arriving in New
    York City in the years before the famine of 1848. We have compressed his 14 categories into
    our six. Table 5 compares those results with the foreign-born Irish from Table 4.14

       It is likely the data from the 1840s and earlier reflect an older generation than that from
the 1860s. Overall, white-collar workers are roughly the same total percentage in all three
columns. The fact the percentage in high white-collar occupations is smaller in 1863 could be
due to those that might have been in that group being officers or buying their way out of the
service. The percent of Irish-born enlistees who were farmers is somewhat higher than the
percentage in the 1841 census and ship registers.15 There is rough consistency between the
census and ship registers as to the percentage of high blue collar workers, but this increases
dramatically in the enlistment records. And while the percent unskilled is higher in the ship
registers than the 1841 census, it is much lower in the enlistment records. While many of the
enlistee’s fathers may have reported being unskilled, the enlistees themselves learned a skill in
the family’s new country and worked either on farms or in high blue collar occupations. There
does not appear to be much movement toward the higher-earning part of the distribution from the
1840s to the 1860s.
       Three decades later, the percentage breakdown from the 1890 census for the non-Irish
and Irish in Table 6 shows increasing numbers of white-collar workers and a decline in the
number of farmers, as one would expect during this period of industrialization. The percentage of
high white-collar jobs has increased more for the native-born than the foreign-born, and more for
the non-Irish than the Irish. The Irish have seen more or less equal advancement for low white-
collar jobs. Otherwise, the distributions are quite similar. The difference between the native-
born and foreign-born Irish has narrowed, but much larger percentages of the foreign-born are
still being reported in either semiskilled blue-collar jobs or as unskilled.

        The movement off the farm is evident for the USCT as well, both with respect to the
freeborn and the slave-born. As a result, more than half of them were considered unskilled in
1890, more than double the percentage of any other category. Also of note is the relative
exclusion of blacks from high blue-collar occupations. It is somewhat surprising that almost 6
percent of the freeborn are now considered to be white-collar, but this is only eight people. One
possible explanation for this result is that veterans of USCT regiments formed by free northern
blacks were eligible for federal government jobs following the war. Clearly, a larger sample is
required.



IV. Wealth
        The 1870 census reported wealth under two headings, Real Estate and Personal Estate.
If the amount was less than $100, it was not reported. As Table 7 indicates, over 90 percent of
veterans fall into this category. After all, on average, they were in their early 30s when the
census was taken. Nevertheless, making allowance for the small sample size, there are some
curious results.
        Using the non-Irish Union Army as the comparison group, 93.0 percent report less than
$100 of personal wealth and 94.8 percent report less than $100 of real estate wealth. The percent
of the native-born Irish reporting less than $100 of personal wealth is one-half a percentage point
higher, but that for the foreign-born Irish is five percentage points higher. A similar result is
obtained for real estate wealth. There are no Irish that have accumulated personal estate worth

                                                 15
    more than $5,000. In the $100 to $5,000 categories there are over 3.25 times more native-born
    than foreign-born that report personal estate; for real estate, the relevant ratio is just over 2.25.
    We do not know how long any of these foreign-born veterans resided in the U.S., but it appears
    that time in the U.S. is correlated to wealth.

            The more curious results are those of the USCT. Admittedly, the sample is small. The
    percentage of blacks reporting personal estate greater than $100 is larger than any of the white
    groups, and the percentages are higher for slave- than freeborn blacks. More research needs to

                                                      16
be done to determine whether this result remains if the sample size is increased. Successful
whites might have paid others to fight in their place, while successful blacks felt a war against
slavery was their fight, even if they fought it as a private. Successful whites might have become
officers, but blacks were prohibited from holding such ranks.
       A similar, albeit less dramatic pattern appears with respect to real estate wealth. The
freeborn USCT veterans are much more likely to report real estate, although none report real
estate wealth more than $5,000. This may be less curious in that the USCT came from, and
returned to, rural areas. Also, by this time, former slaves were beginning to acquire land. Was
land ownership somehow tied to improved health?16 That is a question for further research.
       One disappointing feature of our data is that a similar snapshot of wealth-holding is
unavailable at a later date for these veterans. What we can observe later in their lives is the
distribution between homeowners and renters. Table 8 reports the division for 1900 when they
were, on average, in their early 60s, and each group was experiencing some mortality.

                         Table 8: Owners vs Renters in 1900

       This table is consistent with what might be expected. The group with the highest
percentage of owners was the non-Irish whites, with the Irish about four percentage points
below, but considerably above the percentages for blacks. The freeborn veterans of the USCT
are almost 20 percentage points below the Irish, and they are evenly divided between owners and
renters. Slave-born veterans are much more likely to rent than own, the opposite pattern of the
whites. The wealth data suggests some black individuals did relatively well. How well and why
they chose to join the USCT remains to be determined.

Overall, the white troops, non-Irish and Irish, are very similar. There are some differences
between the foreign- and native-born Irish, but they too are very similar on the whole. With
respect to the conditions where at least 10 percent of the population has been rated, the Irish are
never more than, say, 20 percent different from the non-Irish, and often much closer. There are
only a few differences between the two subgroups of Irishmen. The native-born were twice as
likely to be rated with chronic diarrhea than the foreign-born, 84 percent more likely to be rated
with a gastro-intestinal condition, and 76 percent more likely to be rated with hemorrhoids. Why
this should be true requires further research.


                                                     18
       With respect to the blacks, the percentages are generally less than either of the two white
groups with a few exceptions. The blacks were about a fifth more likely to be rated with
rheumatism and a third more likely to be rated with an eye condition or a poor general condition
than the whites. The whites were less likely to be rated with a cardiovascular condition than
native-born whites, non-Irish or Irish. This is the opposite of contemporary data which shows
blacks much more likely to have cardiovascular disease than whites.18 Both cardiovascular
conditions and rheumatism received a gradation with the rating (the higher the rating, the higher
the pension). Other things equal, whether blacks received a reduced rating for rheumatism while
whites received an inflated rating for cardiovascular (and the likelihood of a higher pension)
need to be studied. With the exception of general appearance and hernia, for each condition for
which at least 10 percent of freeborn blacks were rated, slave-born blacks were less likely to
receive a rating. With the exception of rheumatism, an eye condition, or a poor general
condition, blacks were about two-thirds as likely as whites to receive a rating. When this is
broken down between freeborn and slave-born, the average percentage for the residual
conditions for each group divided by the average percentage for the non-Irish whites become 80
percent and 66 percent, respectively. The lack of ratings for blacks veterans might suggest
blacks were healthier, but it is more likely explained by discrimination.19
       The information on death-by-cause raises questions similar to those from the ratings data.
A cardiovascular condition is the leading cause of death in each group and subgroup accounting
for over 30 percent of deaths in whites and freeborn blacks. Curiously, slave-born blacks have a
greater than six percentage point lower incidence of a cardiovascular condition being reported as
the cause of death than any white subgroup and over four percentage point lower incidence than
freeborn blacks. Since it was most unlikely that the surgeon completing the report for the
Pension Bureau was the same person as the doctor signing the death certificate, there is unlikely
to be a direct relationship here. However, the fact a veteran received a rating (and a pension) for
a particular condition may have influenced what was listed as the cause of death. This requires
additional research.

        Respiratory conditions and infectious diseases were the second and third most common
death causes for non-Irish whites. This was true for the Irish as well, but genito-urinary
conditions were a close fourth for the combined group. For the native-born Irish, genito-urinary
conditions were more common than infectious diseases. For freeborn blacks, infectious diseases
were the second most common cause with an incidence 50 percent above either of the white
groups. Infectious diseases were also a more common cause for slave-born blacks, but it ranked
behind respiratory disease. Slave-born blacks had the largest incidence of respiratory disease;
freeborn blacks, the lowest. The reasons for that require more research.
        Given the lower incidence of cardiovascular causes among blacks, other causes will
assume greater importance. Relative to the non-Irish, blacks were more likely to die from any of
the next three ranked conditions: respiratory conditions, infectious diseases, and genito-urinary
conditions. The incidence of rheumatism and general appearance as a death cause are also
higher, but the percentages are low. Freeborn blacks were also more likely to die of injuries. On

                                                    20
the other hand, blacks were much less likely than the white groups to be reported dying of
neoplasms. Given that many of these are likely to have been skin cancers, this isn’t surprising.
       Like the blacks, the Irish have greater incidences of respiratory conditions, infectious
diseases, and genito-urinary conditions. The former two are more prominent in the foreign-born
Irish; the latter, in the native-born Irish. To the extent that respiratory conditions and infectious
diseases are a reflection of people living in dense and less affluent conditions, it may help
explain the higher incidence among these groups. It may also explain the lower incidence of
cardiovascular disease, but it cannot explain the entire difference. Much more work is required
to understand the patterns in these two tables, especially the smaller percentage of blacks
reported as dying from cardiovascular conditions.


VI. Survival Rates

Death information exists for many of the veterans in the various groups, and this permits the
construction of survival curves for each subgroup. It is important to keep in mind that these are
not survival curves for the male cohort born ca. 1840; these are the survival curves of groups of
men healthy enough to be inducted into the Union Army and lucky enough to survive the insults
of battle and disease during the war. Since most of the information about death places is found
in the pension records, they are biased by those veterans who survived until 1890. Before that
date, when the law creating a service pension was passed, disability pensions were awarded to
those who were severely injured and impaired during the Civil War. Roughly half the veterans in
the panel were not eligible for a pension initially, and may not have been able to apply under the
service pension law, especially if they died before 1890. Since many veterans did not enter the
pension system until after 1890, the sample found in the death records is more representative of
those veterans who survived until then.
       Because the average year of birth varies widely across the three large groups, the curves
are arranged so that the horizontal axis is age as opposed to year. Given that the average non-
Irishman was born in 1837 (rounding to the nearest whole year), they are 29 in 1866; the USCT
did not become 29 on average until 1867.
       The USCT have the worst experience, with the difference between that group and the
others widening. Although survival curves for the subgroups are not reported here, the reason


                                                  21
for this is associated with the slave-born USCT. The freeborn have survival rates 6–8 percent
higher the slave-born until they reach their early 80s. A similar pattern is true among the Irish
where the native-born have higher rates than the foreign-born until about the same age (early
80s). The freeborn USCT and foreign-born non-Irish have the highest survival rates at young
ages. Their survival begins to fall below the native-born non-Irish in their late 50s. What is
evident in both versions of the figure is that the experience of the US-born non-Irish whites is
typically at or near the best. More detail can be found in calculation of hazard ratios.
               Figure 7A depicts survival curves by year (1865 = 1) for the three major groups. The
Irish seem to have more or less the same experience as the non-Irish until about 1908, then their
survival falls quickly. This is about when you would expect the great difference in average birth
years to have its effect; 1904 is the year the average foreign-born Irish veteran turned 70. The
USCT, who are approximately the same age as the others, have lower survival rates.

                 In Figure 7B, the curves in Figure 7A have been adjusted so that the horizontal axis is age
as opposed to year. We shifted the Irish and black groups to the right or the left so, on average,
they match the average age of the non-Irish, who again serve as our comparison group. Given
that the average non-Irishman was 29 in 1866 and the average member of the USCT did not
become 29 until 1867, those curves have been shifted by one year to the left. The result is Figure
7B.

VII. Hazard Ratios
                 We calculated hazard ratios using a pooled logistic regression model for the discrete time
hazards in the surgeons’ certificates.20 The results are in Table 11 below. We adopted 1890 as
the baseline; the regressions are defined to include only those veterans who were alive in 1890,
whether they received a pension before that year or not. This additional limitation is necessary


                                                                                                                23
given that a significant portion of our “final sample” was not eligible for a pension until the
reforms of 1890, and we do not necessarily know which of them died before 1890. In these
regressions, the dependent variable is a time-dependent indicator for having died in a particular
year during or after 1890. Controls include age in 1840 (the hazard ratio increases at
approximately 10 percent for each additional year a veteran lived) and a cubic time trend.
Coefficients with a P value less than 10 percent are highlighted in red and boldface.
       Regression I includes only an indicator for which population group a veteran belonged.
The omitted group is the native-born non-Irish whites; foreign-born non-Irish whites are included
as a separate group and have a ratio a little less than 10 percent higher. Slave-born blacks had a
higher ratio (1.246) than freeborn blacks (1.197). That for foreign-born Irish, the first generation
in the US, was 1.219, slightly less than that for slave-born blacks. Finally, the other native-born
Irish had a hazard ratio roughly 8 percent higher than native-born non-Irish. As more and more
control variables are added to this basic regression, the ratio that retains P values of 10 percent or
less (those in bold) are the slave-born blacks. It remains high in every specification.
       Regression II adds a set of controls for place. Urban (large) indicates a place larger than
50,000 in the 1860 census; urban (small) indicates a place larger than 10,000 but less than
50,000; and foreign is outside the U.S. The omitted group is a rural place. The places reflect
three distinct time points in a veteran’s life: where they were born, where they enlisted, and
where they died. The urban mortality penalty is immediately evident in that the urban
coefficients are generally greater than one, and urban (large) is typically greater than urban
(small).21 Further, even as additional controls are added, these results persist. Consistent with
the findings of Cain and Hong, a foreign birthplace is as hazardous as a large American city, but
there are too few veterans with foreign death places to be able to say they were in any manner
different than the others.
A series of controls reflecting the person’s life around the time of enlistment is added in
regression III. The first is a set of occupational variables reflective of those reported in Aim 3
above. The omitted group is the unskilled. High-skilled blue collar workers had a lower hazard
than any of the other occupational groups. The hazard ratios for high-skilled white collar
workers ranked second best. An early enlistment year increased one’s hazard as did being
wounded during the war. Being tall, being sick during the war, surviving life in POW camps,
and beginning one’s service as a private did little to one’s hazard. That said, an increase of one


                                                 24
inch in height increased one’s hazard by a little over 1 percent. This is somewhat surprising and
needs further investigation.

       The final set of controls added in regression IV reflect conditions with which a veteran
could be rated as part of the Union Army pension program. Everything else equal, the highest
hazards were for a poor general appearance or varicose veins. Why this should be true is
unclear. Why a gastro-intestinal condition was, on average, protective is also unclear. Ear

(deafness) and wounds were the other two conditions with p-values less than 10 percent. Fogel
et al. suggests there was little difference between those rated for wounds who were wounded
during the war (hence eligible for a pension before 1890) and those rated for wounds who were
not wounded during the war. 22
       With all these controls in place, foreign-born non-Irish whites had a hazard ratio 13
percent higher than US-born non-Irish whites. Freeborn blacks had a hazard ratio roughly 10
percent higher and slave-born blacks had a hazard ratio roughly 20 percent higher than US-born
non-Irish whites. First-generation Irish had a hazard ratio in 20 percent higher; while the native-
born with Irish surnames were but 5 percent higher than their non-Irish counterparts. Most of
these differences are not statistically different from zero. Nonetheless, the suspicion is that early
life conditions in the southern United States and Ireland were substantially different than those in
the northern United States. Understanding such differences is necessary if one wants to
understand the health outcomes of these two ethnic groups.


VIII. Conclusion

       Joel Mokyr opined that blacks in Boston may well have done better than the Irish in the
years before the Civil War. The results of this investigation suggest that well may be true if the
comparison is between blacks born in the North and Irish migrants. While the bottom half of the
occupational distribution of both groups was largely unskilled, the proportion of freeborn blacks
in high (but not low) white-collar occupations in 1890 than foreign-born Irish, but this is based
on an extremely small sample. On the other hand, unskilled Irish initially provided the unskilled
labor for the burgeoning industrial firms of New England, whereas blacks were generally
excluded until the twentieth century. For this cohort of USCT veterans, their unskilled labor was
likely to take quite a different form.
       Our evidence suggests that the native-born Irish were very much like their non-Irish
white counterparts. They moved west at about the same time; they had similar survival rates and
not very different hazard ratios. There is, however, a suggestion that the benefits they received
did not rise as quickly as for the non-Irish. There is clear evidence that their foreign-born
brethren lagged behind. The foreign-born began their western migration a bit later and smaller
proportions migrated when they did leave the familiar confines of the East Coast. Some became

farmers, but, of those obtaining other skills, they were more likely to move into blue-collar
occupations tied to industry. Their survival pattern was slightly different, and their hazard ratios
a bit higher. Whatever disparities and prejudice faced the native-born Irish, it was seemingly
worse for the foreign-born.
       The blacks born in slave states, some of whom may have actually been free blacks, had
the hardest path to trod. They were largely unskilled and overwhelmingly penniless. The
generation who joined the USCT did show some northward movement, but it was cautious at
best. When they became eligible for the pension, they were almost 10 percentage points less
likely to be rated with a cardiovascular condition, than whites, and, while rheumatism is a
relatively rare cause of death, it is at least twice as likely to appear for black veterans. A
cardiovascular condition is the most common cause of death, but slave-born blacks are less likely
to have that listed on the death certificates as whites and freeborn blacks. Why this should be
true is unclear; was it part of a pattern of differential diagnosis that led to slave-born blacks
receiving lower pensions than others? They were scarred by their experiences before the war,
and their prospects after the war were little improved.
       The blacks born in free states, however, are a revelation. While roughly half the group
are little different than their southern brethren, the other half contains people who seemingly did
quite well. Much more research needs to go into discovering how they moved into high white-
collar positions, and why, despite what must have been family origins in slavery, their generation
has survival rates and hazard ratios similar to non-Irish whites. There is no evidence, with so
few of them in the North, they were accepted as “right folks” (in Tom Lehrer’s terminology).
There is evidence they suffered increasing discrimination when the Great Migration brought the
slave-born blacks north. It could be that, since discrimination forbade blacks from being officers
in the USCT, we simply do not have their white counterparts in these databases.
       In short, the statistical evidence does not reveal disparate outcomes for all blacks and
Irish, but there is evidence of inferior outcomes for slave-born blacks and foreign-born Irish. For
the freeborn blacks and native-born Irish, for whom the historical tradition suggests
discrimination and prejudice, the statistical evidence only hints at such problems. More digging
is required to learn how real they were.

   The 1841 Irish census was consulted, but many of the most common names found in that census are not
ethnically Irish (e.g., Smith).
11
   Defining Irish in this manner means that it is possible that some with Irish surnames can be found in the
USCT both because some slaves took the surnames of their former masters and because USCT companies
included some white sergeants and other non-commissioned officers. These numbers are thought to be
quite small, and we have not attempted for the purpose of this paper to attempt to identify and remove
them.

   One would expect only a small number in these cells; the zeros are likely the result of a small sample
size.

   The percentage of farmers in the ship registers for the 1840s (1840-48) is roughly half that in the 1841
census. This was likely to have changed once the famine struck.

   These data are subject to several biases. Veterans who got on the pension rolls early (before 1890) as a
result of an injury are less likely to have chronic condition listed as are veterans who got on the pension
rolls for reaching age 65 under the 1907 law. Most blacks were placed on the rolls as a result of the 1890
law (they had a chronic condition) or the 1907 age law. Whites are more likely to be on because of the
General Law (war-related disability) before 1890. This may lead to a different set of conditions being
given and an underestimation among blacks if more are receiving a pension as a result of their age. A
detailed analysis of black-white differentials based on this data can be found in Dora L. Costa, Lorens A.
Helmchen, and Sven Wilson, “Race, Infection, and Arteriosclerosis in the Past,” Proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences, vol. 104, no. 33, August 14, 2007.

   The percentage distribution for the subcategories of cardiovascular reveal three major differences
between white and black: impaired circulation, palpitations and, especially, cyanosis. Because cyanosis is
identified by a bluish skin color, it is much harder to discover on darker-pigmented skins. However, this
explains less than half the difference between white and black.
20
   There are well-defined problems that emerge when this specification is used with a fixed population.
Each group has a survivor rate of 1 at the start, and they each have a rate of 0 by some year.

   Robert Fogel, Louis Cain, Joseph Burton, and Brian Bettenhausen, “Was What Ail’d Ya’ What Kill’d
Ya’?,” Economics & Human Biology, online December 2012, suggests there was little difference between
those rated for wounds who were wounded during the war, hence eligible for a pension before 1890, and
those rated for wounds who were not wounded during the war.
