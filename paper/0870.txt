        This paper demonstrates that, contrary to a widely—held opinion,

the determination of the goals of unions is fully amenable to empirical

analysis. A characterization of the wage and employment—setting process

in unionized markets is adopted and its qualitative implications

examined. The first—order condition for this model is fitted to time—

series data on the newspaper industry from ten cities.          The Inter-

national Typographical Union's objective           function reveals very

restricted opportunities for substituting wages for employment in

response to a change in the slope of the employer's labor demand func-

tion.     Larger union locals place greater emphasis on wages versus

employment than smaller union locals.

                            I. Introduction

      There is now a considerable volume of evidence to suggest that
unionized labor markets operate differently in a number of respects from

non—unionized labor markets. However, in general, these findings have

been reported with little attempt to relate these empirical regularities

to the objectives of and constraints on the decision—making units

involved.   Consequently, our understanding of "what may trade unions

maximize?" has advanced only a trifle from the time that John Dunlop

[l9] first raised the question almost 1O years ago. The prevailing

opinion appears to be that the problem of modelling trade union behavior

is "virtually intractable" [Johnson, 1975] .     The purpose of this paper

is to belie this notion.      We adopt a characterization similar to

Dunlop's for the determination of wages and employment in unionized

markets and we apply this model to a particular institutional setting.

Our objective is not to endorse the specific model of the trade union

outlined here, but simply to demonstrate that the investigation of union

goals is fully amenable to empirical analysis.

      The data examined here describe the wages and employment of

members of the International Typographical Union for ten cities over the

20 years from l9L6 to 1965. This is a truly extraordinary union whose

features are well suited to the particular model outlined. Before the

dramatic technological changes of the last 15 years, the union occupied

a very powerful bargaining position with newspaper firms and, therefore,

there is good reason for interpreting the movements of wages and employ-

ment of these typographers as reflecting the constrained objectives of
                                   —2—



the union. This represents a maintained hypothesis in this paper and,

while some observers of this institutional setting may question this

judgement, it is not evident that the sort of abstraction involved here

is any more demanding of empirical phenomena than are the economist's

conventional models of the firm or of the family. Moreover, good reason

exists for investigating the role of the ITtJ in view of the unsatisfac-.

tory state of our understanding of the pattern of wages in the printing

industry which is based on research that has avoided explicit modelling

of the behavior of the union.      For instance, in the literature that

seeks an explanation for the movement in money wage rates over time, the

sort of multiple regression equation that is preferred for most indus-

tries always performs lamentably for the printing industry..iJ        In

addition, the variation in the wage rates of typographers across cities

is much greater than the typical geographical differentials for a given

occupation and this has never been satisfactorily accounted for..V

Naturally one is led to wonder whether a better understanding of the

union would provide the key to an explanation of these features of the

printing industry.

        In this paper the union is characterized as maximizing an objec-

tive function that contains wage rates and employment as arguments and

as being constrained by a trade—off between these two variables given by

the employer's labor demand function. This model which offers a deter-

minate solution to union—management bargaining was articulated most

fully   by William Feliner El9IT1 and Allan Cartter [19591.   As a theory

of the determination of wages and employment in unionized markets, it is
                                   —3—



clearly deficient in not explaining how a position of disagreement at

the opening of the collective bargaining process converges over time

into a mutually acceptable contract. Moreover, as Leontief [l961 and

Fellner [l9171 made clear, the solution to the bargaining process pro-

vided by this model lies inside the payoff frontier and thus it is an

inefficient contract from the point of view of the two parties

involved.   However, the standard of efficiency used here is one that

presumes the absence of transactions costs to negotiating an agreement

and the empirical relevance of this standard for a union—management

bargaining situation should not be taken for granted. That is, it is

not evident that collective bargaining procedures provide incentives for

the parties to reveal their respective valuations and, in fact, each

party's objective function tends to be camouflaged by a veil of threats,

bluffs, and deceptions. In such circumstances when each party's percep-

tion of its opponent's payoff function is distorted, there is no guar-

antee that the Pareto frontier (defined as excluding these negotiation

costs) will be reached and so there seems no compelling reason either to

presume that union—management contracts are efficient in this sense or

to presume that they are not.

      This Fellner—Cartter model is outlined in the following section

and, since there has been little attention addressed to the issue, the

qualitative implications of the model are discussed.        Section III

presents a brief description of the ITtJ and the American newspaper

industry and of the data used in this study. Estimates of the objective

functions of the ITtJ locals are presented in Section IV.

                             II.    Conceptual Framework


        Our   starting point is a f iris     that   hires labor and n other inputs

at given prices to produce an output at minimum cost. The cost function

summarizing this behavior is


                      C =                            =   C(w,r,X)
                            C(w,r1,r2,...,r,X)
where w is the wage rate, r the price of input i, and X the level

of output. C is assumed to be smooth and fully differentiable and is a

linearly homogeneous concave function of all input prices.                 The cost—

minimizing level of employment, L, is determined from the cost function

by    simple differentiation:

(i)                         L(w,r,X) = aC(w,r,X)           w


        The workers are organized in a trade union whose leader takes
account of the welfare of all its members as represented by the follow-

ing quasi—concave objective function:


(2)                                   U =   g(w,L,Y)

where     U    is assumed to be strictly increasing in the wage rate (w)

and in employment        CL).      Variables that affect union preferences, but

are exogenous to the union are indexed by Y. These might                  include the
price    level of commodities consumed by union            members, the wage received

by a comparison group of workers, or the level of unemployment benefits.
This objective function, equation (2), includes as special cases the
                                               —5—



wage bill as proposed by Dunlop, rents from unionization as proposed by

de Menu        [19711 and Rosen [19701 , and expected per member utility as

proposed by Farber [1978] , McDonald and Solow [19811 , and Oswald [1982]

        The union selects w and L to maximize its objective function,

equation (2), subject to the choice of w and L being restricted by

the employer's labor demand function, equation (1).                           The situation in

which the union determines the wage rate and then leaves the employer to

determine employment through equation (i) is, of course, consistent with

this model. The first—order condition for a maximum is


                          g             C (w,r,X)
                              =    —
                                                         s(w,r,X


where            3U/w >   0       and          U/aL >         0       or the marginal rate of
          g1                              g2
substitution of wages for employment in the union's objective function

equals the slope (s) of the firm's labor demand function. The second—

order condition for a maximum may be written as


()                        = — 1wg1(swL1              +   i)       -
                                                                      2s
where s =        s/w,   swL is the wage elasticity of the firm's labor

demand function, and a is the elasticity of substitution between wages

and employment in the union's objective function.                            The reduced form

equations may be derived from equations (1) and (3) and they express

wage rates and employment as functions of all the exogenous variables:


(5)                                       =                   ;
                                        —6—




                                L =
(6)
                                      2(Y,r,X)

These reduced form equations and the marginal rate of substitution

equation (3) are invariant under positive monotonic transformations of

the union's objective function.

        The qualitative content of this model of unionism is assessed by

determining the signs of the partial derivatives of equations (5) and

(6). In fact, without specifying particular expressions for the objec-

tive and constraint functions, all that can be said about the signs of

these derivatives is that the sign of L/Y must be opposite that of

 aw/3Y: an increase in Y alters the objective function, but does not

disturb the constraint C so if the union opts for an increase in wage

rates then this must be accompanied by a decrease in employment. Other

than this restriction across equations (5) and (6), the sign of each of

the partial derivatives is ambiguous and in this sense the model is

empty of qualitative implications.i" This is not surprising in view of

the theorem of conjugate pairs [Archibald, 1965], but it is odd that a

model with so little qualitative content should have provoked such an

extensive debate as that which arose over whether or not the trade union

can be portrayed as maximizing anything..!

        The dual of this problem describes the union as selecting w

and L to minimize the parameters of the labor demand function

Cw =    L(w,r,X)    subject to a prescribed value of the objective function

 U0 >   g(w,L,Y).     Naturally, the first—order condition for this problem

is again given by equation (3) which may be solved jointly with the
                                         -.7—




constraint to yield "utility—constant" reduced form equations for wages

and employment:


                                W = 41(Y,r,X,U0)

                               L =
                                     ip9(Y,r,X,U0)


The derivatives of these equations can be related to those of equations

(5) and (6) in lutsky—type fashion, but, unless further restrictions

are placed on the objective function or on the constraint function, the

"utility—constant" derivatives (such as              and ip1/aX) cannot be

signed.

        Instead of dwelling on the dearth of qualitative statements that

can   be made, consider what restrictions on the model wifl yield unambig-
uous implications. For instance, suppose labor is not an inferior input

(so c/x >       0)   and suppose that the union's objective function is

strongly separable in wages and employment (so           g12   0).   Then,

provided an increase in output does not increase the slope of the labor

demand function with respect to wage rates (that is, provided

s < a), an increase in output will induce an increase in the optimal
wage rate. On the corresponding set of assumptions, an increase in the

price of an input that is a substitute for labor will induce an increase

in the optimal wage    rate.    In these two cases, whether or not optimal

employment also increases depends upon the magnitude of the slope of the

labor demand function with respect to wages. Alternatively, suppose the

union maximizes the total rents from unionization. Once again, if labor
                                       —8—




is   not an inferior input and provided an increase in output does not

increase the slope of the labor demand function, then an increase in

output will induce an increase in the optimal wage rate. However, so

little is known about the nature of the union's preferences for wages

and employment that we are in no position to assess the empirical rele-

vance of alternative prior restrictions on the union's objective func-

tion. For example, Cartter's [19591 conjecture that the elasticity of

substitution between wages and employment in the union's objective

function is very lowi has never been confronted with the evidence

although the limiting case of this hypothesis-—that wages and employment

are combined in fixed proportions——would considerably simplify models of

unionized labor markets.



             III •   The   Institutional Background   and the Data


       The data used to estimate the union's objective function consist

of annual observations on wages, employment, and other variables

describing the members of the International Typographical Union and the

newspaper industry in ten American cities from 1946 to 1965. The ITIJ is

the quintessential democratic union where the leaders exercise very

little discretionary authority, where the perquisites of being an offi—

cial are few, where the rank—and—file are intimately involved in the

management of the union, and where there are no important skill differ-

entials within the union..J Consequently, an objective function such as

equation (2) that does not differentiate between the interests of the

leadership and of the rank—and—file or between various groups within the
                                   —9—




 rank—and—file is well suited to the ITU. Moreover, it is evident from

 the ITU's well—known concern for the employment effects of new tech-

 nology that the employment of its members occupied a very important

place in its objectives.    On the other hand, the popular portrayal of

the union as relentlessly opposing new composing methods is something of

a caricature.    There have been occasions on which the union has spon-

sored inventions and it established its own research and development

laboratory and staff in the 1950s.       The more accurate description is

that the ITU adapted to and controlled the new technology up until the

mid—196Os.IJ    In the period before the dramatic technological changes

that have taken place in the new-paper industry in the last fifteen years

or so, the ITU had clearly established a dominant bargaining relation-

ship with the employers: collective bargaining took place at the local

level where the ITU operated a closed shop requiring every worker in the

composing room, including the foreman, to be a. member of the union.

Newspapers were extremely vulnerable to an interruption in production

and, in fact, for the ten union locals in the years analyzed below, no

strikes took place. The ITtJ was a highly sophisticated union and very

mindful of the competitive environment in which newspapers operated.

Wage increases not matched by increases in productivity would translate

into newspaper price and advertising rate increases that, other things

equal, would harm the newspaper's total revenue and ultimately dis-

courage ITU employment.
                                   —10—



        The data most appropriate for a study of this kind describe the

production processes of a particular newspaper and, in fact, such data

have been obtained for the Cincinnati Post.i For Cincinnati, w stands

for the hourly wage for journeymen printers at the Post and L is the

number of full—time typographical workers in the Post composing room.

In 1958, the Post merged with the Cincinnati Times—Star and the ITU

members of the Times—Star chapel were absorbed into the Post composing

room.    The primary   problem presented by extending the study to other
cities is the difficulty of obtaining employment data. The

ical Journal, the union's publication, supplies data on local union

membership, but these figures will include ITU members employed in

commercial (book and job) printing establishments.      Typically, major

book and job establishments are located in very large cities so, if we

avoid these cities, a much closer correspondence between local union

membership and newspaper employment is reached.      Therefore, for nine

other cities, the data on L represent local union membership.

        Average values of w and L over the years l946—65 for the ten

cities are given in Table I together with other characteristics of these

cities. The cities range from Columbus, Ohio, that had a mean journey—

man   membership of just over 600 in these years to Fond du Lac,
Wisconsin, which was about one—fifteenth the size of Columbus. Average

money wages ranged from a high of $2.9L in Columbus to $2.1T in

Dubuque. In fact, the wages of typographers vary markedly across all

cities in the United States and a thorough explanation for these differ-

entials has yet to be provided. For the ten cities listed in Table I

cities in which a newspaper merger took place between newspapers during
these years. The average hourly wage scale for Journeymen is given by w
and w/p is w deflated by the consumer price index. L denotes employ-
ment at the Post for Cincinnati and it represents local union membership
for the other cities. The data on w are from issues of the ITU Bulletin
while union membership data come from the Typographical Journal.       The
Post's advertising image (in thousands) in April is listed in the column
headed X while for the other cities X is total image sold by all the
local daily newspapers.   This information on    X   comes from issues of
Editor and Publisher, a trade magazine. A rough index of potential reader-
ship is provided by the numbers on the population (in thousands) of each
city in 1960. These population figures are taken from Table 30 of the 1960

over these years, there were strong positive trends in both real wages

and employment, but virtually no cyclical movements in these variables,

a finding consistent with the belief that unionism tends to insulate

these labor market variables from cyclical movements in economic

activity.



                           IV. Empirical Results


      One way of implementing the model of unionism outlined above is to

posit particular functional forms for the union's objective function,

equation (2), and for the firm's labor demand function, equation Ci),

and then to estimate the implied reduced form equations for wages and

employment, equations (5) and (6). This procedure has been applied in

previous work2i and it possesses the attractive feature of permitting

simulation exercises on the reduced form equations. On the other hand,

the closed form solution of the reduced form system can be obtained only

if relatively simple expressions are specified for the union's objective

function and for the labor demand function.         Hence, if we limit our-

selves to reduced form   estimation,    then this rules out some interesting

general forms for the objective and constraint equations. Consequently,

a different course is pursued here, one of estimating the marginal rate

of substitution equation (3). This has the computational advantage of

requiring nothing more than standard two—stage least—squares.

      Suppose the union's objective function takes the following form

where p denotes the consumer price index, a measure of the price level

of consumer goods purchased by union workers:

a sufficient (but not necessary) condition for which being that both A

and r are negative. This strongly separable function, equation (7),

is the addilog augmented by the parameter y that provides a reference

point for real wages. This function has the appealing feature of nest-

ing     some      interesting special cases.                                        For instance, consider

 A =     + -1.       Then the objective function may be written as follows:



                         U(,L) = log ( — y)                        +   (1 —             log L



and if, futhermore, j                  = 0.5    and y equals the competitive real wage,

then    this objective function is a transformation of the rents from

unionization, an objective discussed by Dunlop [19441, Rosen [1970), and

de Menu        [19711 .           If    x =     + —1,            =     0.5          and y = 0, the objective

function is a transformation of Dunlop's wage bill maximand.                                                Or if

y = 0     and A =             r   * —1, the objective function is a transformation of
                                         _J)4_




the constant—elasticity—of—substitution function, but otherwise the

elasticity of substitution (a)           between wages and employment in the

union's objective function is not constant and, in particular, a is

given by the following expression:


                            w   -
                                         Xw
                                          (—) + (1   -
                            p       1)     p




Clearly, unless the parameters assume the particular values discussed

above, the union's preferences for wages vis——vis employment cannot be

described fully by a single parameter and the value of the substitution

elasticity depends on the particular combination of wages and employment

being evaluated.

     With this augmented addilog objective function, the natural log-

arithm of the marginal rate of substitution equation (3) is as follows:


                                    '
          X log ( — y) + log              ) — log    p —   r   log L =   log   s




where, as before, s is the slope of the firm's labor demand function.

The empirical implementation of this equation requires an expression for

the slope of the labor demand function and this has been assumed to be

 s = e                            10/ and r denotes the price of
         /r where X indexes output—
newsprint (in hundreds of dollars per short ton) as quoted in national

markets. Newsprint is a very important input into newspaper production

and previous work indicated that the ratio of wages to the price of

newsprint exercised a highly significant influence upon typographer
                                   —15—



 employment. The specification here builds upon this finding by allowing

 the slope of the labor demand function to depend upon output (x)            as

 well. Integration will reveal that very general labor demand functions

and cost functions (including cost functions exhibiting decreasing or

constant or increasing returns to scale) are consistent with this

expression for     5.!i'   In addition, the reference parameter for real

wages     (y)   is specified not as a fixed constant but as a constant

proportion of the real wages of another group of workers, say,

y = $(Wa/P),    a popular special case of this being            1. With these

assumptions concerning s and y, the previous equation may be written



      log () = log                     log             +   log () +   log
                   {8() + exp
(9)                                          (1   U)                        L +
                                   [
and, after a stochastic error term is added to the right—hand side, this

equation may be fitted by nonlinear two—stage least—squares methods

[Ainemiya, 1971 where employment is treated as endogenous.!V

        Table II presents the results from fitting equation (9) to the

pooled 182 observations on all ten union locals together. To serve as a

reference wage series (Wa), both the average hourly earnings of non—

supervisory workers in retail trade (who are almost wholly non—

unionized) and the average hourly earnings of production workers in

manufacturing industry were used. These two wage series move together

over the years from 1946 to 1965 so there is little difference between

the two sets of estimates. The results presented in Table II correspond

to the use of the wage of retail trade workers for w5. According to

the estimates in line (1), X          is very close to —1 and        8 is not

appreciably greater than unity so that the first term in the union's

objective function approximates the expression               Log (W —   W)
However, with i significantly different from 0,5 and r significantly

different from unity judged by conventional criteria, the data do not

seem to be consistent with an objective function that takes the form o

the rents from unionization. Equation (9) is normalized with respect to

the logarithm of real wages, but the instrumental variables estimator of

a nonlinear equation is not invariant to the variable aeleted for

normalization.   Consequently, the estimates in line (ii) of Table II

report the effects of rewriting equation (9) so that log L constitutes

the left—hand side variable and where the sane set of intruments are

used for   log (w/p).   These estimates do not d4ffer appreciably from

those in line (i) except that    ),    and   r are closer to being equal to

one another. However, 8 remains significanty different from unity so

that a simple constant—elasticity—of—substitution (CES) function does

not appropriately describe this union's objectives,

      The estimates reported in line (iii) correspond to fitting equa-

tion (9) after augmenting it with a vector of dumr       variables   for each

of the union locals.    In particular, suppos the slope of the labor

demand function is   s = exp   (x + 1Z)/r where 2 takes the value
of unity for the ith union local and of zero otherwise. Then equation

(9) is respecified to include the terms 6.Z./X witin the square

brackets. The resulting estimates of the objective function parameters

do not differ in any meaningful sense from those in the previous

lines. In particular, the estimates are not consistent with the special

functional forms that are nested in our specification, namely, the wage

bill maximand, the rents from unionization, and the CES function.

      Line (iv) of Table II reports the estimates of equation (9) that

treat output (in addition to employment) as endogenousJ The most

noticeable feature of these estimates is the increase in the standard

errors over those in previous lines and no doubt this reflects, in part,

the inadequacy of our instrumental variables. These estimates, testify

to the fact that confident inferences from these results about the

nature of this union's objectives are simply unwarranted at this stage

of the research.-i!i

      To this point, although differences among the ten cities have been

permitted in the slope of the labor demand constraint, the parameters of

ITU's objective function have been assumed to be the same for all ten

locals. Previous work [Dertouzos and Pencavel, 19811 suggested that the

objective function probably varied with the size of the union so this

sample of ten ITU locals was split into two categories of five
relatively small union locals and five relatively large union locals.

The large union locals consist of Cincinnati, Memphis, Louisville,

Columbus, and Albany and over the l946—65 period their average real

wages ranged from 3.38 to 3.58, their employment averaged 4l8, and they

operated in the larger cities with an average 1960 population of almost

I00,0O0 people (see Table I).    The small union locals are those in
                                         —19—



Augusta, Columbia, Dubuque, Fond du Lac, and Elmira and in these years

they had a lower average real wage (namely, 2.96), their average employ-

ment was 78,    and   they were located in the smaller cities with an average

population in 1960 of 6i,ooo        people.   On all three criteria (real wages,

employment, and population), the smallest of the group of relatively

large union locals was greater than the largest of the group of rela-

tively small union locals. Then equation (9) augmented by a vector of

union dumn variables (i.e., by the terms                         in the notation

introduced earlier) was fitted to each of the two groups of union

locals. The results are presented in lines (v) and (vi) of Table II,

the relatively large union locals in line (v) and the relatively small

union locals in line (vi).

       Although the estimated standard errors caution against confident

inferences, the larger 1W locals tend to place slightly more weight on

"supernumerary" real wages relative to employment (as given by ).

This may be the consequence of the greater alternative employment possi-
bilities (especially in commercial printing) available in the bigger

cities where the larger unions were located. The smaller union locals

reveal less restricted opportunities of substituting real wages for

employment in their objectives (as given by )             than   the larger union

locals and, indeed, for the smaller union locals the hypothesis of a

unitary substitution elasticity cannot be rejected.               For the larger

union locals' estimates in line (v), each of the null hypotheses

8 =   1,   =   0.5,   X = —1, and     = —1    cannot be rejected by conventional

criteria and these are precisely the parameter values implied if the
                                     —20—



 union locals maximize the rents from unionization.!J This does not

 appear to be an appropriate description of the objective function,

however, for the group of relatively small union locals (line (vi)). A

conventional test of the null hypothesis that the two groups of union

locals have the same objective function parameters is decisively

rejected.J.!      Further disaggregation to the level of each individual

union local seems not to be warranted, however.!L'

         What appears to be a common finding in all the results in Table II

is an estimate of the elasticity of substitution () between wages and

employment in the ITU's objective function that lies between zero and

unity.     Only for the relatively imprecise estimates in line (iv) (in

which both employment and output are endogenous) is        cy   not   signifi-

cantly different from zero.      In other words, these results are fully

consistent with Cartter's conjecture that a union's objectives allow

relatively little scope for substituting wages for employment. However,

the limiting case of fixed wage and employment combinations also appears

to be rejected by these estimates.!J



                               V. Conclusions


      Two approaches to the issue of wage and employment determination

in unionized labor markets can be identified. One approach takes the

objectives of the trade union as given and enquires into the character-

istics of the solution to the resulting bargaining problem [de Menil,

1971; McDonald and Solow, 1981; Rosen, 1970] . The second approach takes

as a maintained hypothesis the method through which wages and employment
                                      —21—



 are settled and investigates the objectives of the union [Dertouzos,

 1979; Dertouzos and Pencavel, 1981; Farber, 19781 .         This paper has
 followed this second approach and has shown that, contrary to widespread

 belief, the questions involved in ascertaining the objectives of trade

 unions can be addressed through conventional empirical procedures. The

union examined here is the ITU over the period l916_65 and perhaps our

most consistent finding is that the elasticity of substitution between

wages and employment in the union's objective function tends to lie

between zero and unity.        This suggests quite restricted opportunities

for trading off wages for employment.         The larger ITU locals possess

objectives that approximate the rents from unionization although it

would be imprudent to attach a high degree of confidence to this

inference in view of the standard errors accompanying the point esti-

mates of the objective function parameters.         Moreover, it should be

stressed that the empirical implementation of the model requires speci-

fications for two behavioral relationships, the union's objective func-

tion and the firm's labor demand function (or the first derivatives of

both functions), and, therefore, estimates of the union's objective

function parameters may   be   sensitive to the precise specification of the

labor demand functiOn..12i

      What   do these results suggest for the two empirical anomalies

alluded to earlier, namely, the time series movements of wages in the

printing industry and the variation in typographers' wages across

different cities? Because bargaining takes place at the local     level,   it

is not surprising that aggregative variables such as the unemployment
                                   —22—



rate in the entire economy are not highly correlated with movements over

time of wages in the printing industry. On the other hand, the model of

the wage—setting process outlined in this paper does identify the con-

sumer price index as being relevant to money wage differences as should

be differences in the exogenous variables of the labor demand function

(such as the prices of other inputs and the factors determining news-

paper output).   If the objective functions of these union locals are

characterized by little substitutability between wages and employment,

then differences in the slope of the labor demand function will generate

relatively small differences in (real) wages. In this event, the inter—

city variation in wages is a consequence of differences in the location

of the labor demand function with, for instance, newspapers in big

metropolitan areas with a larger circulation paying higher wages (which

is exactly what is observed).   On the other hand, if more observations

on each union local were available, then the objective function para-

meter estimates in Table II might be more precisely estimated and sig-

nificant differences across union locals might emerge. If this were the

case, the observed intercity variation in wages would reflect, in part,

the different weights attached to wages in the unions' objective func-

tions and, then, an explanation for these variations in objectives would

be called for.

     A very large body of research now exists that applies constrained

optimization models of the household and of the firm to data on consump-

tion expenditure and production.    In contrast, the literature on the

behavior of the union became enmeshed in unproductive methodological
                                  —23—



squabbles and economists turned their interest towards the measurement

of the various effects of unions without imbedding their measurement

procedures in precisely articulated behavioral models.     Consequently,

there is a large body of research documenting the empirical regularities

associated with unionism, but there is little interpretation of these

regularities in terms of economic behavior. The primary purpose of this

paper has been to show by way of example that purposive models of union-

ism (such as the one outlined here) have operational content and can be

analyzed empirically.

*    I am indebted to Paul Chen and Cathy Hartsog for their proficient
     research assistance, to Thomas MaCurdy, Andrew Oswald, and James
     Rosse for useful discussions during the preparation of this paper,
     and to two anonymous referees for their reactions to an early
     draft. I have also benefitted from a Sloan Foundation grant to
     the Department of Economics at Stanford University.


1/   For instance, in Wachter's 119701 time series analysis of wages in
     two—digit manufacturing industries, his preferred equation for the
     printing industry has only a time trend as a relevant regressor
     and no significant role is found for the unemployment rate, for
     price changes, and for movements in the industry's value added.
     Even more striking are the results reported by Eckstein and Wilson
     [19621 where R2's for wage changes in the printing industry are
     recorded of 0.01 while most other industries generate         R2's
     greater than 0.90.


     The Bureau of Labor Statistics' wage surveys reveal that for hand
     compositors at night work in the newspaper industry workers in the
     city reporting the highest wage earned 55% more in July 19)46 and
     28% more in July 1965 than workers in the city reporting the
     lowest wage. This range is all the more remarkable in view of the
     fact that these wage data relate to workers in a narrowly—defined
     occupation,   the  members   of    which possess very     similar
     characteristics from city to city.   (These data are published in
     BLS Bulletins No. 912 and No. 1)489.)


     Indeed, even with further restrictions on the model, ambiguities
     prevail.        For instance, suppose the slope of the labor demand
     function is independent both of wages and of the scale of produc-
     tion (i.e., suppose as/aw = as/ax =      o).   Then the effect on opti—
     mal wage of a proportional increase in output is
                        —1       —1             —1
     a2,nw/a,nX = eL( 1g12 — g 2g22)1(1 + swL ) where e is              the
     elasticity of the demand for labor with respect to output,
     g12 = a2U/awaL, and g22 = a2U/3L2.       If, in addition, the union's
     preferences are homogenous with respect to w and L, then
     a,.nw/a,.nX =
                     eLg1g12.     These expressions are ambiguous in sign.

IL'    The adversaries in this debate were, of course, Dunlop [i9'iJii who
       maintained, "An economic theory of a trade union requires that the
       organization be assumed to maximize (or minimize) something.
       Although not the only possible objective, maximization of the wage
       bill may be regarded as the standard case" (p. L) and Ross [19I81
       who responded, "The wage policy of unions...is not to be found in
       the mechanical application of any maximization principle" (p. 8).


       Cartter [1959, pp. 89—901 wrote: "It would seem most likely, once
       a union    is already enjoying a particular wage—employment
       combination, that it would take a considerable increase in wages
       to compensate for a reduction in employment, and it would take a
       considerable increase in employment to compensate for a wage
       reduction. This is reasoned to be true because of the internal
       political pressures the union would be subject to if it openly
       agreed to either of these reductions."


§1     The justifications for these statements are to be found in the
       classic study by Lipset, Trow, and Coleman [19561


.1-!   See Kelber and Schlesinger [19671. Today the very survival of the
       ITU in its traditional form is threatened by the diffusion of
       typesetting computers and photographic processes which have
       eliminated many of the skills once required of printers.  The
       dramatic consequences of this automation for New York's Local 6
       are documented by Rogers and Friedman [1980]


       These data were obtained by James Dertouzos while consulting for
       the proprietors of the Cincinnati Post.


.2!    Dertouzos [19791 and Dertouzos and Pencavel [19811 fitted the
       reduced form real wage equation jointly with the stochastic form
       of the employer's labor demand function. The estimates so derived
       were very similar to the maximum likelihood estimation of the
       reduced form real wage and employment equations as given in
       Pencavel [1982].


       Output is measured here by the amount of advertising image sold
       annually and average values of this variable are listed in Table
       I. This output index measures only one dimension (albeit the most
       important in terms of newspaper revenues) of newpaper output and
       is not perfectly correlated with other dimensions such as the
       space devoted to news.    Moreover, although many of the primary
       determinants of output are beyond the control of the newpaper firm
                                   —26—



      (in particular, the size and wealth of a city's population and the
      number of television channels to which advertisers have access),
      it would be inappropriate to treat output invariably as
      exogenous. For these reasons, a set of estimates was derived for
      which output was characterized as endogenous. These are reported
      below.


      Thus, the labor demand function implied by this expression for
      s  is L = f(. ) — (w/r) exp (ix) where f(. ) is some unspecified
      function of X,    r, and the prices of other inputs (except for
      w).


      The exogenous variables consist of log (p/r), x, w°7p, the whole-
      sale price index of machinery and equipment and quadratic terms
      and interactions among these variables.


      The exogenous variables used to instrument for employment and
      output in this equation are log (p/r),          log q (a/)2
      (log (p/r))2, (log q)2, T, T. log q ,    T.   log (p/r), and
      T •   ai    where q    is a wholesale price index of machinery and
      equipment and T is a time trend.


      For all these estimates, the quasi—concavity conditi-on (equation
      (8)) was   satisfied
                         for all observations in the sample.


      The elasticity of substitution    (a)  is a highly nonlinear
      function of all the objective function parameters, however, so
      that, although each of the objective function parameters is not
      significantly different from the value assumed under the rent
      maximization hypothesis, a is significantly different from unity
      (which is the value taken by a is the union's objectives were
      exactly rent maximization).


      In this case, the calculated value of the F statistic is 9.9)4
      which exceeds by a large margin the critical value from the F
      distribution.


IL!   For the group of large union locals, the null hypothesis of no
      difference in the objective functions among the five locals yields
      a calculated F of 1.52 while the corresponding value for the group
      of small union locals is 2.01. Each of these falls short of the
                                  —2T—



      critical F value at the 1% percent level of significance. Of
      course, these test statistics are only approximate in this instru-
      mental variable context.


      In equations fitted to each union local separately, a number of
      variations in the estimation procedure were applied to equation
      (9).   First, the constraint that the slope of labor demand
      function be homogenous of degree minus unity in input prices was
      relaxed. Second, the equation was fitted in first difference form
      (year to year changes) with allowance for a linear time trend.
      Third, the objective function parameters were allowed to change
      after a merger between newspapers in those four cities in which a
      merger was recorded in these years. In each of these cases, the
      inferences about the objective function of the ITJ were       not
      materially different from those in the main text.


!21   Some examination of this issue was undertaken by specifying
      different slopes for the labor demand function.    The resulting
      estimates of the unionts objective function parameters were riot
      substantially different from those reported above.
