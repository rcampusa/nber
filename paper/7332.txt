The Changing Distribution of Job Satisfaction
Daniel S. Hamermesh
NBER Working Paper No. 7332
September 1999
JEL No. J30
                                             ABSTRACT

        The distribution of job satisfaction widened across cohorts of young men in the United States
between 1978 and 1988, and between 1978 and 1996, in ways correlated with changing wage inequality.
Satisfaction among workers in upper earnings quantiles rose relative to that of workers in lower quantiles.
An identical phenomenon is observed among men in West Germany in response to a sharp increase in the
relative earnings of high-wage men in the mid-1990s. Several hypotheses about the determinants of
satisfaction are presented and examined using both cross-section data on these cohorts and panel data from
the NLSY and the German SOEP. The evidence is most consistent with workers? regret about the returns
to their investment in skills affecting their satisfaction. Job satisfaction is especially responsive to surprises
in the returns to observable skills, less so to surprises in the returns to unobservables; and the effects of
earnings shocks on job satisfaction dissipate over time.

I. Introduction and Rationale

       A rapidly growing literature has identified rising earnings inequality as the premier labor-

market problem of the 1980s and 1990s in the United States (e.g., Bound and Johnson, 1992; Juhn

et al, 1993), and its importance in other countries has also been examined.1 Recently some attention

has been paid to the changing distribution of nonwage monetary returns to work (Pierce, 1998); and

the changing distribution of a variety of nonmonetary aspects of work has also been analyzed

(Hamermesh, 1999). All of these studies concentrate on some part of what workers derive from their

jobs, and the student of inequality can use them to piece together a jigsaw puzzle describing much

of the total change in inequality of the returns to work. But any study of nonwage monetary or even

nonmonetary returns will necessarily ignore some nonpecuniary aspects of these returns. What is

needed is an understanding of how the overall distribution of the returns to work has changed.

       Only one measure, the satisfaction that workers derive from their jobs, might be viewed as

reflecting how they react to the entire changing panoply of job characteristics. As our theoretical

arguments and empirical analyses will demonstrate, even this measure cannot in the long run reflect

changing inequality in the overall returns to work. In the short run, however, it can provide a

reflection of all the returns to labor-market activity, and as such can allow us to infer whether and

how the relative well-being of different kinds of workers has changed in response to shocks to the

labor market.

economies.

       Economists have traditionally been loathe to deal with subjective outcomes describing work,

feeling that these cannot be linked to any underlying concept of utility and that, even if they could,

their subjective nature renders them too noisy to be of analytical value. We have not, however, been

entirely aloof from an area that has chiefly been the domain of social psychologists. Hamermesh

(1977) constructed and tested a theory of overall job satisfaction; and Freeman (1978) and Borjas

(1979) examined the effects of unionization on overall job satisfaction. More recently Farber (1990)

continued the analysis of unions and job satisfaction, and Clark and Oswald (1996), Gerlach and

Stephan (1996) and others have considered cyclical variations in satisfaction.

       In this study I examine how the distribution of satisfaction from work has changed over time

in the United States and elsewhere. The first part of the empirical analysis takes subsamples of male

workers ages 26-31 in 1978 from the National Longitudinal Survey cohort of young men (NLSYM)

who were asked questions about their satisfaction with their jobs and compares them to men the same

age in 1988 who were asked the same question in the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth

(NLSY). In the second part of the study I control for the heterogeneity in workers’ satisfaction that

is inherent in the first part by following the job satisfaction of members of the NLSY over a long

period (1984-96) as they matured and as the distribution of their pay changed, presumably in part

unexpectedly. In both of these empirical analyses we expect to observe a widening of the distribution

of satisfaction, one that is correlated with the growing inequality of pay and of nonwage benefits and

nonpecuniary amenities. As a check on the validity of this approach, a third set of empirical analyses

examines cross-section and longitudinal data on job satisfaction and pay inequality in Germany from

1984 to 1996.




                                                                                                    2
II. Motivation

        If job satisfaction were a monotonic transformation of full income, and thus a true measure

of utility, it would be extremely interesting for use in welfare comparisons. Regrettably, as I argue,

that is not likely to be the case. Despite that disappointment, however, while it is not likely to

indicate their well-being in any sense that is useful for an outsider evaluating welfare, how workers

perceive their work does affect economic outcomes. A more satisfied worker, even one whose

economic situation appears to an outsider to be no better than that of otherwise identical workers,

is less likely to leave his/her job voluntarily. Depending upon current job satisfaction, a worker will

be more or less likely to invest in firm-specific human capital that will increase his/her commitment

to the employer (with the same argument applying to occupation- or industry-specific investment).

Indeed, one might even reasonably imagine that the fluctuations in the animal spirits that are a

major Keynesian motivation for business cycles arise in part from variations in workers perceptions

of their well being. Presumably more satisfied workers, who are secure in their jobs, have a reduced

motive to undertake precautionary saving. In short, even though it may be a substantial stretch to

link expressed job satisfaction (or satisfaction generally) to utility, studying job satisfaction is still

important for understanding labor-market behavior and perhaps economic activity more generally.

        All of the available sets of data describe job satisfaction (JS) as a categorical response that

presumably maps the worker s underlying feelings about his/her job to a few discrete choices.

Assume that there are J such choices, and let S be a continuous index of the worker s satisfaction.

Then we will observe worker i s responses on JS as:




                                                                                                        3
(1)        JSi = J ,        if Si t > SJ ;
           JSi = J-1 , if Si t > SJ-1 ;
                .
                .
                .
           JSi = 1 ,        if Si t # S2 .

Recognizing that this is a tremendous simplification, to make the notation here easier I assume that

Si t is a linear function of its argument(s).2 In each case I assume that these arguments are measures

of objective characteristics of the job.

           The determination of job satisfaction depends on workers expectations about their current

earnings and working conditions. Consider a series of cases describing workers perceptions.

           I. Complete forgetfulness and complete surprise. Workers care only about their current full

earnings Ei t and make no comparisons based on their characteristics (or compare themselves only

to the average worker) or on their past histories or those of other workers. In this case:

(2a)       Si t = E i t .

The transformation from current earnings to job satisfaction is monotonic, and comparisons of job

satisfaction indicate utility comparisons. In reality even in this case the transformation from wages

to S will be nonlinear: Although we expect wages and amenities to be related to a worker s full

earnings, the demands for each are not unit full income-elastic. Indeed, given evidence that the

demand for job-market amenities is highly income-elastic (Hamermesh, 1999), one might expect the

distribution of job satisfaction to be wider than that of wages. Under this assumption greater (lesser)

wage inequality will generate correlated increases (decreases) in the inequality of job satisfaction.



2
    All that is needed is that S be a monotonic transformation in its arguments.


                                                                                                        4
        II. Knowledge of average current rates of return. This assumption stems from expectancy

theory (stated by Lewin, 1938, and summarized nicely by Vroom, 1964). Hamermesh (1977) showed

that this approach to the determination of job satisfaction dominated empirically the assumption

implicit in (2a) in a cross-section of American workers in 1969.3 If workers compare themselves to

others who had made the same investments at the same time, differences in satisfaction will arise out

of heterogeneity in the returns to those investments. Only supernormal returns and quasi-rents will

generate higher job satisfaction. In a cross section this implies that job satisfaction will be related to

the residual from equations relating earnings to measures of investment in general human capital, and

to measures of quasi-rents (e.g., returns to firm tenure). The satisfaction index is determined as:

(2b)    Si t = Ei t - E*i t*Xi ,

where E*i t*Xi are the full earnings of the average worker with characteristics X identical to those

of worker i. Increasing (decreasing) inequality in the distribution of earnings over time will increase

(decrease) the dispersion in the distribution of job satisfaction only if the change in inequality results

from greater dispersion in the returns to unobservable skills. This requires separating out changes

in this distribution from those in wages generally (see Di Nardo et al, 1996).

        III. Disappointing returns. As is implicit in Lévy-Garboua and Montmarquette (1998), a

rational individual will base his/her job satisfaction on comparisons of outcomes to expectations that

were formed at the time that the investment decisions that generated those returns were undertaken.

Thus in this view job satisfaction is determined by the worker comparing his/her full earnings to what

would have been expected upon entering the labor market at time t0, having made the investments


3
 A journalistic description of the problems of managers and professionals earning only $100,000 to
$200,000 (Wall Street Journal, August 3, 1998, p. 1) illustrates the role of expectancy theory in affecting
satisfaction.

                                                                                                         5
the worker made and with the returns to the worker's other characteristics. No extra satisfaction is

generated by unusually high or low returns received by heterogeneous workers that were expected

at t0; but temporal changes in the means and variances of the distributions of returns will alter the

distribution of job satisfaction, so that:

(2c)     Si t = E i t -   ti 0   E*i t*Xi ,

where ti 0E*i t*Xi is the full earnings that a worker with i's characteristics would have expected to

receive at time t had labor-market conditions remained as they were when i entered the labor market

at time ti 0.

         Admittedly this is backward-looking, in the sense that the worker retains at time t full memory

of the expectation at ti 0; but it is consistent with substantial evidence in the literature in psychological

economics of the role of regret in affecting behavior (for example, Thaler, 1992, Chapter 6).

Rising (declining) earnings inequality will raise (lower) the variance of the distribution of job

satisfaction to the extent that today s workers formed their expectations when the distribution of

earnings was different. This will persist until all the workers who entered the labor market at a time

when earnings inequality differed from its current state have left the labor market.

         IV. Rational expectations with learning and heterogeneity. It is difficult to believe that regret

lasts an entire working life: If the demand for a worker s skills dropped unexpectedly and

permanently in the first year of the stream of returns, one might expect that worker to be more

regretful in that year than thirty years later. After some period of time the worker s expectations of

future returns may have adjusted to the likely reality. This consideration suggests that job satisfaction

will be determined by the deviation of the returns to the worker s skills over a continually adjusting




                                                                                                           6
forecast of those returns. The forecast will be based on what the worker expected at ti 0, but modified

by events. The satisfaction index will be determined as:

                      t
(2d)    Si t = Ei t - Ó âkE*i k*Xi ,
                      k=t 0


with the weights âk presumably greater as k 6 t. In this case increasing (decreasing) inequality of

earnings can increase (decrease) the dispersion of job satisfaction, but only if the changes in inequality

are unexpected. If earnings inequality is greater and has been so for some years, the distribution of

satisfaction will approach what it was before the initial shock occurred.

        We can go beyond the four Cases to examine how job satisfaction responds to unexpected

returns to investment in human capital as compared to unexpected returns to a worker s

unobservable (to the econometrician) characteristics. There is no reason to expect workers to react

the same way to changes in the returns to their investments in education and on-the-job training as

they do to changes in the returns to their native capacities, since their ability to perceive these two

sources of the wage outcomes may differ. (2c) and (2d) could be decomposed into two components,

one showing the deviation of returns to those measurable skills in which the worker had invested, the

other showing the deviation in returns to unobservables. Also in (2d) the paths of adjustment of

expectations (the âk) of the responses to surprises need not be the same for both components of the

unexpected returns.4




4
 The theoretical issue throughout this discussion is essentially one of examining the extent of cognitive
dissonance between where the worker currently is and what he/she perceives the correct place to be (see Festinger,
1957). The empirical issue is the determination of what that perception is and how it evolves.


                                                                                                                7
III. Cohorts of American Men

        A. Data

        The ages of the respondents and the timing of information on job satisfaction in the National

Longitudinal Survey of Young Men and the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth fortuitously

enable us to compare workers within a narrow, fairly young age range just before and immediately

after the most rapid increase in earnings inequality in the past 75 years occurred in the United States.

I take nonhispanic white male workers 26-31 in each survey, with those in the NLSYM observed in

1978 (one of only two years in which questions about job satisfaction were asked in that study) and

those in the NLSY observed in 1988. In both surveys workers were asked the question, How do you

feel about your job? Do you like it: very much (4); like it fairly well (3); dislike it somewhat (2);
                            5
dislike it very much (1)?       Because the last response is very rare (1.73 percent in 1978, 1.51 percent

in 1988), and the third is not common, I combine these two categories in the analyses here and in

Section IV.

        The sample used in most of this section consists of all men in the required range of ages

whose annual hours of work averaged at least 35 per week in the year preceding the survey (so that

I restrict the analysis to full-time workers). This restriction eliminates 10 percent of working men this

age in 1978, and 14 percent in 1988. I use annual earnings (for 1977 in the NLSYM, 1987 in the

NLSY) to measure wages in the comparisons in the remainder of this section and in Section IV to

reduce problems of measurement error (see Bound et al, 2000).




5
 The responses are coded in the data in reverse order. I have transformed them here to make the ordering
consistent with general usage.


                                                                                                        8
        B. The Relationship Between Changing Earnings Inequality and Job Satisfaction

        Table 1 presents the distributions of the crucial variables in this analysis, reported job

satisfaction and actual annual earnings. The data on earnings corroborate for these very narrow age

groups the well-known results on changing earnings inequality: The distribution widened substantially

during the 1980s, as shown by the changing ratios Wp /W50, annual earnings at percentile p relative

to median annual earnings at the time. Moreover, as comparisons of the second part of the table

show, the greatest change that occurred was the result of rapid growth of earnings at and within the

top decile of the distribution.

        The first thing to note from the distribution of job satisfaction is that there is no apparent

evidence that average satisfaction increased during this decade. Indeed, if anything there is some

indication that the responses became more negative during this period. Other than Case I the

explanations of job satisfaction outlined in Section II do not imply any necessary trend in the

responses, and even Case I might be interpreted as requiring only comparisons to other workers'

actual wages at each point in time. Thus the absence of an upward trend in satisfaction during a time

of rising real wages is not surprising. The Table also shows no indication of widening dispersion in

the distribution of job satisfaction. This too is not surprising, as the arguments in Section II imply

that we should observe changes in the distribution of job satisfaction of workers arrayed by their

earnings, not necessarily in the raw distribution of satisfaction. (For example, if average earnings rise

steadily, and some shock lowers the return to skill, the earnings distribution will narrow even though

under Case III and, at least until expectations adjust, also under Case IV we would observe the

distribution of satisfaction to have widened.)




                                                                                                       9
        We cannot test the predictions of Section II even indirectly without examining how job

satisfaction changed at different points of the widening distribution of earnings. In all cases over 40

percent of the sample members like their jobs very much, and over 40 percent like them fairly well,

so that the most useful comparison is of how these two fractions differ over time by earnings quartile.

For that purpose I array the respondents by annual earnings (by quartiles, to circumvent the random

variation induced by the small sample sizes within deciles) and examine how average job satisfaction

changed over time within each quartile.

        Figure 1 presents ( ) the double-differences in the logarithm of average earnings by quartile

compared to the lowest quartile of workers sorted by earnings. As was implied by the data in Table

1, these double-differences are positive, with the largest value being that for the double-difference

between the top and bottom quartiles. Figure 1 also presents:

(3)     Ä2q j = {[fq = j] - [f1 = j]}88 - {[fq = j] - [f1 = j]}78 , j = 4, 3 ,

where f indicates a fraction and q denotes a particular quartile. During this time of rising earnings

inequality the fraction of workers in each of the highest three earnings quartiles who said that they

liked their jobs very much ( ) increased relative to the change in the lowest quartile, while the

fractions stating they only liked their jobs fairly well ( ) decreased relatively. Moreover, these

changes were greatest in the top quartile, which saw the biggest relative increase in earnings. These

results are consistent with Cases I, III and IV in Section II, and with Case II to the extent that the

rising inequality of returns to unobservables accounts for part of the overall increase in earnings

inequality.




                                                                                                    10
       C. Distinguishing the Cases

       To determine which of the alternative explanations of job satisfaction in Section II describes

these data better, we need to move from those abstract models to an estimable model. Ideally I

would like to approximate Eit , E*it*Xi and ti0E*it*Xi by measures that account for a large variety of

returns to work, not just by wages. Regrettably, good measures of the nonwage monetary returns

to work are not available in this data set; and obtaining even incomplete measures of just some of the

nonpecuniary aspects of these workers jobs is very difficult. Accordingly, I proxy E by the worker s

wage, W, throughout the empirical work. While this neglects substantial aspects of the returns to

work, the wage, nonwage pecuniary returns, and nonpecuniary amenities are all increasing functions

of full earnings (none is inferior). Thus one can view W as a monotonic function of E whose elasticity

probably is not unity and need not even be constant.

       Table 2 shows the parameter estimates describing various characterizations of the cases in

Section II using the data on job satisfaction for young men ages 26-31 in 1988. I present the results

of estimating these ordered probits as the impact of a ten log-point increase in the independent

variable on the probabilities of being in each of the three job-satisfaction categories. The first

coefficient in each triad is .1MPr{JSt =4}/MZ}, and the second is .1MPr{JSt =3}/MZ}, where Z is a wage

measure. The sign of the t-statistic in parentheses below the derivative indicates the sign of the

coefficient in the ordered probit.

       The coefficients in the first row are from an ordered probit in which the only independent

variable is the worker s annual earnings (in 1987), as in (2a). Those in the second row are on the

residual u88 from a regression of annual earnings reported in 1988 (for 1987) on education, actual job

experience, job tenure, annual hours, and indicator variables for marital status, location in the South


                                                                                                    11
and in an SMSA, union status, and bad health. This ordered probit is the econometric analog of (2b).

Unlike in Hamermesh (1977) actual earnings describe the distribution of job satisfaction better than

does the residual from a cross-section earnings equation.

         Neither of these models describes job satisfaction in 1988 as well as does a simple version of

Case III, in which I try to capture the idea of regret/disappointed expectations. The estimated effects

from the ordered probits that are presented in the third row of Table 2 are on annual earnings in 1988

and on   78   W^i,88, what the average earnings in 1988 of a worker with individual i s observable

characteristics would have been had the distribution of returns to someone with those characteristics

remained unchanged between 1978 and 1988. This equation is thus essentially identical to (2c),

except actual earnings replace full earnings. By using 78W^i,88 to proxy             E*i t*Xi I implicitly assume
                                                                                  ti 0


that when they entered the labor market in (roughly) 1978 those workers who were 26-31 in 1988

based their expectations about their labor-market success at those ages on the experiences of workers

who were 26-31 in 1978.6

         This model performs better than the simpler models describing Cases I and II: Not only are

the pseudo-R2 higher and each of the coefficients above its standard error; the coefficient on 78W^i,88

has the expected negative sign. The results suggest that, if a worker s current wage is above (below)

what his observable skills would have generated based on his expectations when he entered the labor




6
 In all of these equations I experimented with including other variables, among them each of the measures
included in the equations used to generate u88. Among these none achieved a t-statistic above 1 in absolute value.
 Including a vector of indicator variables for one-digit industry generated only one new result, namely that workers
in professional services were more satisfied (given their wages, or the residuals of their wages) with their jobs
than were other workers. Even here, this effect was only marginally significant statistically. The inclusion of
these other variables never lowered the statistical significance of the wage measures.

                                                                                                                 12
market, he is unusually satisfied (dissatisfied) with his job. The importance of this variable suggests

that workers do exhibit some regret in their feelings about their work. Comparing the results to those

of Case II implies that workers are more concerned with how the labor market treats them relative

to their initial expectations than how it treats them relative to its current treatment of other workers

with the same (observable) skills.

       While the data from these two cross-sections of young men do not allow distinguishing

between Cases III and IV, they can be used to examine the relative importance of regrets about the

returns to observable and unobservable characteristics in the determination of job satisfaction. The

remaining effects presented in Table 2 are from ordered probits that include as independent variables

combinations of measures that decompose earnings shocks into those to the returns to the observable

and unobservable components of skills. The first term is [u88 - u^p,78], the residual from an equation

describing earnings in 1988 minus what that residual would have been at the p th percentile of the

earnings distribution if the distribution of observed earnings had remained unchanged since 1978. The

                ^ -            ^ ], the earnings predicted in 1988 for a person with worker i s
second term is [W 88      78   W88


characteristics minus what would have been predicted for those characteristics in 1978. The first term

thus measures how well the worker was rewarded in 1988 relative to otherwise observationally

identical workers then, compared to the returns that those unmeasurable skills would have generated

in 1978. The second term measures the gain (or shortfall) of the returns to his/her measurable skills

(demographics, education, years of tenure, union status, etc.) relative to what could have been

expected in 1978.

       The fourth and fifth rows of Table 2 present the results of including these two measures

separately, while the sixth set of ordered-probit coefficients includes them both. Clearly, this

                                                                                                     13
decomposition of the measures that are essentially summed in Case III matters, since the pseudo-R2

rises. More important, the estimates suggest that the unanticipated returns to a worker s observable

characteristics -- education, job tenure, etc. -- are the more important determinants of job satisfaction.

Workers are either less aware of unexpected returns to their idiosyncratic characteristics (those parts

of their drive, innate ability, etc., that are not determinants of the education and job tenure that they

accumulate); or the returns to these unobservables simply do not affect how they perceive their jobs.7

        The final equation in Table 2 includes an interaction of [u88 - u^p,78] and [W^88 - 78W^88] to test

whether unusually high (low) unexpected returns to both observables and unobservables interact to

generate unusually high (low) job satisfaction. With the inclusion of this interaction term all three

coefficients are significantly nonzero; and the results suggest that unusual returns along both

observable and unobservable dimensions affected job satisfaction in 1988. Between 1978 and 1988

the returns to both types of skills rose; and workers who were fortunate enough to have accumulated

a lot of education and who were highly able reaped the benefits of those apparently unexpected higher

returns and were especially well satisfied with their jobs.

        D. Cohorts of Men 31-33, 1978 and 1996

        Only longitudinal data can both circumvent the problems of heterogeneity and enable us to

distinguish empirically between Cases III and IV; but using a pair of cross sections still further apart

than the decade that separates the workers in the samples on which the estimation in Part B was based

can at least provide a hint of whether workers’ expectations about their treatment in the labor market

do adjust to the realities that confront them as their careers progress. I take 31-33 year-old


7
 While I present only the results for nonhispanic whites in Table 3, estimates for the entire sample of males 26-31
years old were generally comparable and demonstrated the superiority of Case III over Cases I and II as an


                                                                                                                14
nonhispanic white males observed in 1978 in the NLSYM and compare them to men in the same age

group in the NLSY observed in 1996. The sample for 1978 contains the same men age 31 who were

also included in the data used in Part B. I reuse these observations in order to prevent an already

small sample (400 observations in 1978, 627 observations in 1996) from becoming smaller still.

        Figure 2 shows double differences in the logarithms of annual earnings by quartile. The

results indicate unsurprisingly that over this nearly twenty-year period the distribution of earnings in

this narrow age range became less equal, with the biggest change being the sharply widening gap

between workers in the top earnings quartile and others. The other two lines in Figure 2 present the

double differences in the fractions of workers responding that they are very or somewhat satisfied

with their jobs. These results are directly comparable to those in Figure 1 for slightly younger

nonhispanic white men observed over the decade 1978-88. As in that Figure the double differences

on JS = 4 are positive, suggesting that even over this longer period workers’ expectations about their

labor-market success did not fully adjust to the change in outcomes.

        A comparison of the results in the two Figures reveals one crucial difference, however: The

largest positive double difference in Figure 1 was in the top quartile, mirroring the very sharp rise in

relative earnings in that quartile compared to others. In Figure 2, even though the top-bottom

quartile double difference in log-earnings over the eighteen-year period exceeded that in Figure 1 and

is the largest in this Figure, the double difference in JS in the top quartile is smaller than those in the

third and second quartiles. While the changing distribution of job satisfaction matched the changing

distribution of earnings (by quartile) perfectly between 1978 and 1988, the match was less complete,

although still in the expected direction, between 1978 and 1996. This distinction provides some


explanation of job satisfaction in 1988.

                                                                                                        15
evidence that there was at least some adjustment in workers’ expectations about the returns to their

skills after they entered the labor market, and it thus hints that Case IV may describe the path of job

satisfaction better than Case III.

IV. Longitudinal Changes in Job Satisfaction When Earnings Inequality Widens -- U.S. 1984-
96

        The attempt to distinguish among the theories of job satisfaction is plagued by problems of

heterogeneity. Individuals who are inherently more satisfied may also be those who invest more in

themselves, whose wages are higher (or higher than an econometrician would expect) and whose

wages grow more rapidly once they cease formal education. The ordered probits describing Cases

I-III may thus have been misspecified because they ignored a common component in both the job

satisfaction measure and the wage measure(s). For example, (2a) might more appropriately be

specified as:

(2a')   Si t + vi = Ei t + èi ,

where vi and èi are individual effects, with E(vi)=E(èi)=0, and E(vièi)>0. The vi and èi might be

viewed as positively correlated measurement errors that are unchanging over time. Clearly,

estimation based on (2a') or its analogs will impart a positive bias to the impact of earnings measures

on satisfaction because of heterogeneity rather than any causation from E to S. This difficulty has

no effect on our inferences about the changing distribution of job satisfaction, but it does prevent us

from drawing structural inferences.

        To circumvent this potential difficulty we need to examine longitudinal data that allow us to

difference out the vi and èi. The NLSY is the only American data set that contains repeated

observations on large numbers of individuals' job satisfaction, and I use it again in this section. Since

W is represented by annual earnings, I again restrict the sample to full-time workers (in this case,

                                                                                                      16
those who worked at least 1500 hours in a year). In order to avoid observing sample members during

a time when many were acquiring additional education I start the panel only in 1984.8 To prevent

sample sizes from becoming minuscule because of the restriction to full-time employees, I examine

panel members' job satisfaction over the twelve-year period 1984-96, but only in the three years 1984,

1990 and 1996. (Three years of data suffice to discriminate between Cases III and IV.)                  This

restriction and the requirement that information be available on satisfaction in each year and on the

observables used to predict W reduce the sample to 1280 individuals.

        I estimate standard log-earnings equations for each of t = 1984, 1990 and 1996 to obtain ut

for use in estimating empirical analogs to (2b). In each case the explanatory variables include the

usual human capital measures (education, actual experience and job tenure), indicators of union

status, a variety of demographic measures, and indicators of location, with separate earnings

equations estimated each year for men and women. For each sex the earnings equations for the three

years are estimated as a system of seemingly-unrelated equations. The more difficult choice is the

                 ^ .. An early cross section of the NLSY cannot be used for this purpose, since the
estimation of t 0Wt


age range in any cross section is too narrow to allow within-sample prediction of the growth of

earnings in the NLSY over the twelve-year period that we use.

        The best alternative is to predict earnings growth in the NLSY sample by examining a cross

section of workers from the CPS Outgoing Rotation Groups on whom we have some of the same

information as in the NLSY. This approach has the virtue of providing very large samples covering



8
 By 1984 the number of sample members whose education was still increasing grew much more slowly than
before. Indeed, while the fraction of the sample with 16+ years of schooling rose from 12.2 percent in 1982 to
18.2 percent in 1984, it grew to only 22.9 percent in 1990 and to 22.7.


                                                                                                           17
the entire age range of full-time workers, but the disadvantage that it lacks the richness of information

in smaller samples such as the NLSY. Nonetheless, it captures the majority of the determinants of

earnings differences (especially among full-time workers) that we observe in these smaller samples.

    I use the 1979 CPS-ORG, because that year roughly corresponds to t0. Using the CPS-ORG I

estimate the log-earnings equations for 1979, the results of which are presented in Appendix Table

A1. The estimated coefficients are completely unsurprising and require no comment here. I then use

these coefficients and the data on the NLSY panel members (including their computed potential

                        ^ in each of the three years t -- 1984, 1990 and 1996.
experience) to obtain 79Wt


          The final issue in specifying the longitudinal models is the treatment of the measures of job

satisfaction. In the panel data these can be viewed as allowing us to form a pair of 3x3 transition

matrices, one showing transitions in satisfaction from 1984 to 1990, the other from 1990 to 1996.

While I present these matrices below, by themselves they are not readily usable in models describing

the determinants of changing job satisfaction. I thus estimate ordered probits for JS90 and JS96, in

each case using as additional independent variables a vector of two indicator variables that spans JSt-6.

Obviously there are many other ways to describe the changes implicit in these 3x3 transition

matrices, but this one is simplest.9 Coupled with six-year changes in the various wage measures, it

allows us to remove the vi and èi from the equations. At the same time, for JS96 we can distinguish

between Cases III and IV by examining the relative effects of recent and past changes in the wage

measures on the satisfaction outcomes.




9
 In this case, however, ordered probit does lead to estimates of the parameters that have biases in unknown
directions.

                                                                                                        18
        Table 3 presents the characteristics of both the full subsample of 1280 workers and, for

purposes of closer comparison to the results in Section III, for a still smaller subsample consisting of

nonhispanic white males whose educational attainment was unchanged from 1984 to 1996. Panel A

of the table demonstrates the expected rise in earnings over the twelve years. More interesting for

our purposes is the pattern of wage growth in the smaller subsample shown in the first row of Panel

B. The returns to schooling in this subsample rose from 1984 to 1990, but stayed essentially constant

between 1990 and 1996.10 That earnings differentials by education first widened in this sample and

then stopped widening provides substantial scope for examining the time path of responses of job

satisfaction to wage shocks.

        The remainder of Table 3 presents the distribution of earnings within this subsample broken

down by education (at most 12 years, more than 12 years) as well as the distributions of job

satisfaction by education for each of the three years sampled. Perhaps the most interesting thing to

note is that workers with at least some college education were more satisfied with their jobs than

were high-school graduates. This difference suggests the role of current earnings; but it is also

remarkable that, between 1990 and 1996, when the rate of return to schooling ceased rising in this

sample (and perhaps in the United States more generally), the distribution of job satisfaction among

more educated workers began to approximate that of less educated workers more closely. This

conjunction of a growing similarity in the responses of workers with different educational attainment

and a halt in the growing returns to schooling suggests that changes in job satisfaction are more subtle

than might be implied by a theory based on current outcomes alone.



10
  The rates of return shown in the table are coefficients of years of schooling from the log-earnings equations that
are used to calculate ut..

                                                                                                                 19
        Table 4 lists the transition matrices for the 1280 continuous full-time employees in the NLSY

sample. The ÷2-statistics for both six-year transition matrices and the twelve-year matrix (1984 to

1996) show that current job satisfaction is not independent of previous job satisfaction ( ÷2.01(4) =

13.28). This may be evidence that vi // 0, or it may show that some individuals earn high wages, or

unexpectedly high wages, and are more satisfied with their jobs because of that. Nonetheless, that

the off-diagonal elements in each matrix contain nearly half the sample members suggests that there

is ample room for describing changes in job satisfaction over the six-year intervals.              The

corresponding elements of the two six-year transition matrices are remarkably similar, with the only

difference being the somewhat smaller off-diagonal terms in the later matrix, perhaps indicating

greater stability of workers' responses as they settle into longer-term jobs. The lesser significance of

the ÷2-statistic describing the twelve-year transition matrix may suggest that the impacts of shocks

that affect job satisfaction dissipate over time.

        Table 5 contains the principal results of this section, the ordered probits describing job

satisfaction in 1990 and 1996. In each equation I also include indicator variables for JS = 4 and JS

= 3 at time t-6. The results are presented as in Table 2: The first two numbers are the impacts of ten

log-point increases in the independent variables on the probabilities of responding JSt =4 or JSt = 3,

while the t-statistic on the ordered-probit coefficient is in parentheses below these derivatives. The

first thing to note is that the hypotheses implicit in Cases I and II both make some sense in these

estimates that account for individual heterogeneity. For both 1990 and 1996 the coefficient on dWt

                                                                          ^ ) to the equation
is positive and significant, as is that on dut. Moreover, when we add d(79Wt


containing dWt to embody Case III, the impact of the actual wage remains unchanged and still highly

significant, while the wage predicted at t0 is either negative, or positive and insignificant. Case II

                                                                                                     20
seems to describe the data best in 1990, while in the ordered probits without the lagged wage terms

Case I or III does better in 1996.11

        Because we have many years of longitudinal information on these workers, we can distinguish

at least crudely between Cases III and IV by including lagged changes (changes between 1984 and

1990) in the various wage measures in the ordered probits for job satisfaction in 1996. The second

row in each pair of ordered probits describing JS96 includes lagged terms (measuring percentage

changes in the wage variable between 1984 and 1990). Considering the first equation (containing

only dWt and dWt-6), the insignificant term in the lagged wage change suggests very clearly that more

distant lags in a stimulus to job satisfaction have little effect (implicitly that the shocks are dissipated

over time). A similar result is apparent in the equations embodying Case II (including dut and dut-6).

The results become more interesting in the final specification in Table 5, the only one presented thus

far that enables us to differentiate Cases III and IV. While the lagged wage change term is

insignificant, the lagged term in the change in expected wages is highly significant statistically (and

has the expected negative sign). None of the results showing the unimportance of lagged changes

in the wage measures varies qualitatively if we delete the lagged satisfaction measures from the

ordered probits. Except for the apparent importance of initial changes in expected wage growth,

none of the lagged changes in wages is important. This finding implies that past shocks to earnings

have no effect on current satisfaction.

        As a check on these estimates I present in Appendix Table A2 the results of the same

specifications estimated over the reduced subsample of full-time continuous nonhispanic white male


11
  Both here and in the next Section I examined whether job satisfaction responds asymmetrically to wage growth
(or wage residuals) depending on whether this is positive or negative. Except for some slight indication in one
case in the next Section, there is no evidence of any asymmetry in the responses of changes in job satisfaction

                                                                                                            21
workers. The patterns of the coefficients are somewhat different from those in Table 5: As before,

in the equations describing JS90 Case II seems to fit best; but in the description of JS96 Case I seems

to fit best. There is no evidence that wages predicted at labor-force entry affect current job

satisfaction, and none that past wage shocks persist in the determination of current job satisfaction.

        The appropriate general conclusion from estimates based on longitudinal data from the United

States is the same as from the comparison across cohorts of young adult men. Job satisfaction is not

simply based on either actual wages or on apparent unexpected returns (excesses of wages over those

received by observationally identical individuals). Instead, it may be based on comparisons of actual

wages to what the individual might have expected based on the state of the labor market when he/she

was making decisions about investing in human capital. The evidence on whether early labor-market

experience has a long-term effect on job satisfaction is mixed, although the general impression is that

early expectations and wage shocks become less important as workers age. The results in this section

also indicate (since they implicitly relate changes in job satisfaction to changes in wages) that growing

wage inequality generates at least a temporary increase in the inequality of the distribution of job

satisfaction.




to changes in wages (or in wage residuals).

V. Longitudinal Changes in Job Satisfaction -- Germany 1984-96

       A. Data

       Germany is one of the few countries with a long household panel containing information on

a large number of workers       job satisfaction and other characteristics.    This is the German

Socioeconomic Panel (GSOEP) begun in West Germany in 1984 and expanded to a panel in the

former East Germany in 1991. Using data on Germany has the additional virtue that, unlike the

United States, the country experienced no change in earnings inequality, at least through 1994

(Steiner and Wagner, 1997, 1998). Thus we may be able to examine the hypotheses discussed in

Section II in a labor market characterized by a substantially different experience from the American

one.

       Because the GSOEP covers Germans of all ages, we cannot focus on two entirely different

cohorts as in Section III.B. Instead, for 1984, 1994 and 1996 I construct data describing all men who

were ages 30-59 in the particular year, who worked 12 months in the previous year and at least 30

hours in the survey week, and on whom earnings information is available. The sample includes West

Germans only. The annual earnings measure is a broad one that adds to 12 times gross monthly

earnings 13th-month pay,      14th-month pay, Christmas bonuses, and vacation, professional and

other pay. The data on job satisfaction in the GSOEP are scaled more finely than those in the NLSY,

with the worker rating his/her job on a scale ranging from very satisfied -- 10 -- to very

dissatisfied -- 0. For purposes of analysis and presentation here I combine the responses into four

categories.




                                                                                                  23
           B. The Relationship Between Changing Earnings Inequality and Job Satisfaction

           The upper parts of Table 6 show the information on earnings and its distribution in this

sample of full-time German male workers ages 30-59. Between 1984 and 1994 there was essentially

little change in earnings inequality, with the slight lengthening of the right tail of the distribution being

due partly to increases in nonwage compensation of higher-wage workers, partly to a slight increase

in their relative monthly earnings.12 Between 1994 and 1996 earnings inequality in Germany expanded

rapidly. As the data in Table 6 indicate, there was little change in the distribution of the left tail of

earnings; indeed, even workers at the 75th percentile did not see their earnings increase greatly relative

to the median. Instead, the right tail of the distribution stretched out rapidly during this period.13

Given this growth in earnings inequality, rather than providing a different pattern against which to

reflect the American results, changing German earnings inequality between 1984 and 1996 allows us

to attempt to replicate the American results over a period in which inequality widened suddenly near

its end.

           The distributions of job satisfaction for all workers in the sample in each of the years are

presented in the bottom part of Table 6. By themselves they are not informative, other than to

underscore the perils of comparing trends in average job satisfaction: It is very difficult to believe

that the percentage of men viewing their jobs as yielding satisfaction below 8 on a ten-point scale rose

from 35 percent to 52 percent at a time when real earnings were rising, just as it was difficult to

believe the apparent decline in average satisfaction implicit in Table 1. Comparisons of the effects


12
     For example, the 90-50 ratios of monthly earnings were 1.667 in 1984 and 1.706 in 1994.
13
  This is not an artifact of some error in the data for 1996. Already in 1995 the 90-50 earnings ratio had
increased to 1.762, essentially half of the increase between 1994 and 1996. Nor is it a result solely of using a
broad definition of earnings, although that is part of the explanation. The 90-50 ratio of monthly earning rose

                                                                                                             24
of changing wage inequality on inequality in job satisfaction must abstract from aggregate changes

in satisfaction that may arise from slight changes in survey design, question structure or even general

attitudes about life outside the labor market.

        The appropriate examination of how job satisfaction by earnings quantile changed over this

period uses the double-difference calculation presented in (3). Figure 3 presents calculations for 1994

compared to 1984 exactly analogous to those in Figure 1. As is implicit in Table 6, the main change

in earnings inequality over the decade was the slow rise in average earnings in the right tail (shown

by the positive double difference in Ln(W) at the top quartile). Perhaps because of the slowness of

this and the other changes in relative earnings, the double differences in job satisfaction show little

relationship to the patterns of earnings changes.

        The results for 1984-94 stand in stark contrast to those in Figure 4, which presents double

differences calculated only over the two-year interval 1994 to 1996. During this two-year period

changes in interquartile earnings differences were as large as they had been over the entire previous

decade. Accompanying these rapid changes was a related rise in inequality of job satisfaction, with

the biggest increase apparent among workers in the top quartile of the earnings distribution. Given

the suddenness and recentness of the rise in relative earnings in the top quartile, it is not surprising

that this finding mirrors the strong results for the U.S. between 1978 and 1988 rather than the

attenuation that occurred over the longer period 1978-1996.

        C. Longitudinal Changes in Job Satisfaction

        The GSOEP also lends itself for use in an examination of the determinants of job satisfaction

like that conducted on the NLSY in Section IV. Because it contains the same kind of information


to 1.750 in 1996 after fluctuating between 1.65 and 1.70 between 1984 and 1994.

                                                                                                     25
needed to construct wage residuals, it allows for distinguishing between Cases I and II.

Unfortunately, because of the broad age range of the respondents, there is no information that would

allow constructing empirical analogs to ti 0E*i t*Xi (and no extraneous information that would enable

me to form these expectations), and thus no way to test Cases III and IV. The panel nature of the

data does, however, allow testing the importance of lagged terms in Cases I and II and thus whether

wage shocks have long-term consequences.

       Here I construct a sample of respondents who were full-time (defined above) workers in each

of 1984, 1990 and 1996, the same years used in Section IV for the American NLSY. That dynamic

models of job satisfaction have something to explain is indicated by the transition matrices in Table

7. There is clearly some persistence of the responses: All the ÷2-statistics strongly reject the

hypothesis that job satisfaction in one year is independent of the response six years earlier, although

as in the U.S. the stability becomes less apparent as the interval between observations increases

(notice the lower ÷2-statistics for the matrix linking 1984 and 1996). Nonetheless, the mass of the

distribution in the off-diagonal elements of the matrices is substantial. Indeed, between 1984 and 1990

24 percent of the respondents changed their expressed satisfaction by two or more (of the four)

categories. Between 1990 and 1996 the percentage was 18 percent, still substantial, and as in the

NLSY lower than in the previous six-year period (during which members of the panel were younger

and more mobile).

       Table 8 replicates for the GSOEP the estimates of the dynamic job-satisfaction equations that

were presented for the NLSY in Table 5. (Similar estimates, but for the reduced sample of native-

born workers who acquired no additional education between 1984 to 1996, are presented in

Appendix Table A3.) The earnings residuals are from equations that contain the usual education,


                                                                                                    26
experience and tenure terms. For each ordered probit I present the effect of a 10 log-point increase

in earnings on the average worker s probability of responding that he or she is in the top (9 or 10),

the second (8), or the third (6 or 7) category on the scale of job satisfaction. The results for both JS90

and JS96 suggest that Case I, in which changes in job satisfaction depend on earnings, describes the

data somewhat better than does Case II, in which changes in the unexplained component of earnings

determine changes in satisfaction. This partly contradicts the results from the NLSY panel in Section

IV, but we found this same result for levels of job satisfaction in the 1988 NLSY cross section.

        The most interesting results in this section are those for JS96 that include the lagged terms in

changes in wages (wage residuals). As in Table 5, these terms, changes in the returns to work

between 1984 and 1990, have little effect on the change in job satisfaction between 1990 and 1996.

Nor is their unimportance an artifact of having included the indicators describing JS90 in the

equations: When these are removed, the t-statistics on the two wage change terms become 3.87 and

0.69, while those on the changes in the wage residuals are 3.55 and 0.83. While we cannot test for

the importance of early-career expectations (test Case III), this evidence reinforces the conclusion

from the NLSY estimates that past earnings shocks have little effect on workers current job

satisfaction. They thus imply that Case IV is a better description of behavior than Case III.

VI. Synthesis and Inferences

        With so many different samples and several ways of examining them it is unlikely that we will

find complete unanimity in their implications for the determinants of job satisfaction. Nonetheless,

some conclusions seem quite strongly supported by the analyses: 1) Inequality in job satisfaction

tracks shocks to earnings inequality; but 2) There is little relation between job satisfaction and

persistent inequality of earnings. In terms of underlying models of job satisfaction, all the evidence


                                                                                                       27
suggests that recent shocks to earnings matter more to current and recent changes in job satisfaction

than do distant earnings shocks; and the evidence implies that the influence of early-career

expectations on job satisfaction diminishes with time.

        That the distribution of job satisfaction widens (temporarily) in response to shocks that widen

the distribution of the returns to work has an interesting implication for the dynamics of those returns.

We know that voluntary turnover and job satisfaction are negatively related (e.g., Clark et al, 1999).

That being the case, our results imply that an exogenous shock that widens the distribution of

earnings also raises turnover among low-wage workers. This change in turn leads them and their

employers to invest less in firm-specific human capital, with the opposite occurring among high-wage

workers and their employers. Since these investments generate future returns, the linkage through

changes in the distribution of job satisfaction, even though these are temporary, can generate

permanent hysteresis effects on the distribution of earnings.

        From the studies presented here it is clear that changes in earnings affect job satisfaction.

What is not answered here or in the literature is the exact mechanism through which these effects

operate. While it seems likely that workers pay more attention to comparisons of the returns to

observable than to unobservable skills, the results are mixed about whether workers reference others

with similar observable characteristics, reference all workers, or what. Only with longer panels of

data, preferably from several countries, are we likely to be able to disentangle any further the various

explanations of patterns in job satisfaction.

        Limitations on the data have prevented going beyond examining the impacts of

transformations of wages on job satisfaction. Yet the evidence that the demand for nonpecuniary and

nonwage pecuniary returns to work is income-elastic suggests that it would be very worthwhile to


                                                                                                      28
examine a broader set of economic determinants of satisfaction. That analysis awaits a set of

longitudinal data that contains objective measures of these nonwage aspects of work.
