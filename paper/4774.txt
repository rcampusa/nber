       A commonsense and empirically supported approach to explaining metropolitan real house

price changes is for the theory to describe an equilibrium price level to which the market is

constantly adjusting. The determinants of real house price appreciation, then, can be divided into

two groups, one that explains changes in the equilibrium price and the other that accounts for the

adjustment dynamics or changing deviations from the equilibrium price.

       The former group includes the growth in real income and real construction costs and

changes in the real after-tax interest rate. The latter group consists of lagged real

and the difference between the actual and equilibrium real house price levels. Either group of

variables can explain a little over two-fifths of the variation in real house price movements in 30

cities over the 1977-92 period; together, they explain three-fifths.

      Real house prices have swung sharply in metropolitan areas on the two 13.5.

coasts during the last decade (Abraham and Hendershott, 1993).            In three

Northeast cities for which we have data (Boston, Nassau-Suffolk and Newark), real

prices rose by 92 percent during the 1983-88 period and through 1993 have since

declined by 25 percent. In eleven west coast cities, real prices rose by over

50 percent between 1984 and 1990 and, so far, have declined by 15 percent.' The

rest of the country (excluding the mineral states that were devastated by the

middle l980s oil price collapse) has not experienced such sharp fluctuations.

For a sample of nine Upper Midwest and five Southeast cities, real prices

increased by only 13 percent in the 1983-92 decade, about reversing the earlier

1979-82 decline. Table 1 reports the growth of real house prices across 30

cities and in various regions over the 1977-92 period.

      Real price movements in the stable Upper Midwest and Southeast are amenable

to explanation with the basic Capozza-Helsley urban model (A&R, 1993). Real

construction cost inflation, real income growth, and changes in real

interest rates alone explain about half of the variation in real price inflh\.tion,

and the explanation accounts for both the general real price decline in the early

1980s and the recovery since then. The same variables help to explain real price

movements in the rest of the country.

      While AMPs empirical results are correctly signed, of appropriate

magnitude, statistically significant, and broadly consistent with the findings

of other researchers, their model largely fails to explain the sharp, prolonged

cycles in Northeast and West real house prices. That is, the results suffer not

from large random standard errors, but rather from sustained, serially correlated




       Reports in the popular press of larger real price declines refer to larger
houses than those in our sample. Higher price houses in California appear to
have declined significantly more than our "average" price houses (Case and
Shiller, 1993).
deviations, which are generally described as bubbles (Stiglitz, 1990).

     Some earlier work suggests the existence of housing market bubbles. Case

and Shiller (1989) report estimates where the lagged appreciation rate entered

price regressions with a coefficient of 0.3. The lagged appreciation rate is an

obvious bubble-builder; once appreciation accelerates, the lagged        variable

magnifies the increase. Further, Shiller (1990) interprets survey results from
                                                                                 in

speculative bubbles appear to be local phenomena, occurring in one city and not
                                                                                the

lagged appreciation rate entered the regressions restricted to the more volatile

coastal cities with a coefficient twice as large as in the stabler inland cities,

suggesting that some cities may be more prone to bubbles than others.

      But as bubbles grow larger and larger, they likely create an offsetting

tendency to burst. Case and Shiller (1990) present weak evidence to this effect:

the appreciation rate lagged more than one period enters negatively, although not

with statistical significance.     Incorporating a proxy for the tendency for

bubbles to burst, as well as to build, is a major component of this paper. Our

proxy is the deviation between the actual metropolitan house price    level and a

"fundamental" price level based upon our empirical estimation.2 The bubble

buster proxy does indeed work and is especially useful in explaining the large

cyclical swings in real house prices in the West.        That is, the notion of

adjustment to an equilibrium price seems to be a useful one.

      Forecasts of future real house price appreciation thus depend on two


     2 The use of this variable also addresses what some viewed as a shortcoming
in our earlier paper, the absence of a role for variables reflecting the level
of house prices (Wilcox, 1993).

factors: forecasts of changes n fundamentals (real income and real after-tax

interest rates) and of initial gaps between actual and equilibrium price levels.

Regarding the latter, it is widely perceived in early 1994 that houses in the

coastal markets are "overpriced" and may continue to weaken, while houses in the

oil and resource states are rebounding from "below equilibrium' prices. Our

results provide no hints on future fundamentals, but we do have estimates of just

how much more prices on the coasts may still need to fall in the absence of

changes in fundamentals.

      The body of the paper is partitioned into three parts. Section I presents

the estimation model and the data. Section II reports the empirical estimates

and indicates both how well they explain real regional house price cycles and

what disequilibria existed at the beginning of 1993. Section III contains some

simulations to illustrate the real price dynamics implied by the estimates and

the sensitivity of the dynamics to variation in the estimates. A conclusion

closes.



                I. The Model and Data for the Explanatory Variables

The Model

      Capozza and Helsley (1989 and 1990) present models in which real land value

is the sum of four components: the real value of agricultural land rent, the cost

of developing the land for urban use, the value of "accessibility," and the value

of expected future real rent increases. Concern with the real value of houses

adds the real cost of constructing houses to these components (this variab'le

could also represent the cost-of-developing-land component). The conversion of

a stream of rents into a value introduces the real-after-tax interest rate as a

determinant of real house prices, and the value of accessibility should vary

positively with real income in the metropolitan area.

      Following this framework. Abraham and Hendershott (1993) express the growth

in equilibrium real house prices (in a specific city) during period t, p*, as

a linear function of the growth in real construction costs, ct, in real income
                                                                  and the change in real after-

With an   error term,' 9       reflecting adjustment dynamics (e.g., bubbles) as well

as random error, we have:

                                                                                            (2)


      Regarding the adjustment dynamics. we specify the error term as


                   +       +   A2   (1ogP*_1
                                                â€”
                                                    logP_1)   +                             (3)

where logP*1 - logP..1 is the log difference between the equilibrium and actual
real price levels (in city i) at the beginning of period t                   and   c is a random
error.    (All growth rates are measured as log differences.) For convenience, the

disequilibrium measure is calculated as the simple difference in two log-levels.

rather than the percentage difference between nominal indices.                      Other things

equal, the greater the real price change the previous period or the equilibrium-

actual price difference at the beginning of the period, the larger will be the

actual price change during the period. For A1 positive, the first variable acts

 to perpetrate growth, generating a price bubble; the second variable, for A2

positive, captures the tendency of the bubble to eventually burst, Substituting

 equs (1) and (3) into equ (2), we have




                                                     4
Pt a (a0+A0) +   aict   +   a2et â€¢ a3y +.a.zc + X1p.1   +   A2(logPt1â€”logP_,) +   â€¢ (2')
     The econometric difficulty is that equ (2') cannot                   be   estimated without

knowing *, which itself depends on the estimates from (2'). In effect, we need

to use values of P* in the estimation of (2') that are consistent with the

p*'s that we compute after the estimation.

     We finesse this difficulty by first estimating equ (2') without the A2

term. We then calculate p* and cumulate it over time to obtain a first-pass time

series on P* for each city. To illustrate, if we assumed that house prices

were in equilibrium in the initial year (tâ€”O), we would compute logP*.. as



                        JogP*_1     logp0 +     p                                           (4)

An index for P would be constructed similarly by replacing p*j with p.3

      In the empirical estimation, we set P0 â€”               P*   â€” 1 in 1983 and use the first-

pass estimates of p*1 to compute P*,.' We then add (logP*1-logP.1) to equ

(2') for reestimation. If logP*. -             logP1,       Pt-i and the determinants of p* are

uncorrelated, the estimates of the a's and thus of p*1 will be unchanged. If the

estimated regression coefficients change, we then recompute logP* from equ (4)

and reestimate equ (2'). After a few iterations, the coefficient estimates

stabilize so that the p* and P* estimates are consistent (generally, three

iterations are required).




      If equilibrium were assumed to exist in year n, we would compute values
after n as in equ (4) but with P, replacing P. For values before n, logP is
reduced by Ep*_, where the sumM goes backward from n.

       We choose 1983 because the early 1980s were a period of generally falling
real prices in the West and especially the Midwest, while after 1983 real prices
exploded in the West and especially the Northeast.

EaDirical Droxies

      Our source for metropolitan price data is a combined Fannie-Mae/Freddie-Mac

repeat-sale data base (Stephens, et.al., 1993). For a general construction cost

measure, we use the National Income and Product Accounts residential deflator.

which is really the Census Bureau deflator for new houses excluding the value of

the lot, not an index for both multifamily and single family construction. To

obtain city-specific cost estimates, we multiply the general index by the

appropriate R.S. Means Company city index adjustment factor. The R.S. Means cost

survey is applicable for industrial and commercial construction projects.

      The local CPIs net of shelter are from Data Resources/McGraw-Hill.

Employment data and population aged 25-64 are from Regional Financial Associates

(RFA). Income data are from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, Department of

Commerce.   Because the 1992 NSA income and population estimates are not yet

available, we have used RFA forecasts to estimate these numbers. The general

deflator is the CPIU-Xl, which is the official national consumer price index

beginning in 1982 and the official index purged of the mismeasurement caused by

rapid increases in mortgage rates in the late l970s and early l980s (see the

Economic Report of the President).

      We specify the real after-tax interest rate as the nominal

after-tax rate less a weighted average of the expected national general inflation

rate and the expected local house price inflation rate:

                    R â€”   (l-r)i   -
                                       (wpn +   (l-w)pl),                      (5)


where i is a nominal interest rate, r is the relevant tax rate, pn is the

expected national inflation rate, p1 the expected local house price inflation

rate, and w is the weight given to the national rate. This expression can be

rewritten as


                                                 6
               R â€”   [(l-r)i   -
                                   Pu] +   (l-w)(pn   -
                                                          p1).                      (5')

We include both the bracketed first ten (the RAT interest rate using the

expected national inflation rate) and (pn-pl) as regressors. The weight applied

to the national appreciation rate, l-w, can then be computed as the coefficient

on the inflation differential divided by that on RAT.

      We use the one-year Treasury rate for the financing rate and the previous

year's national CPI appreciation rate for expected general inflation and the

previous year's local house price appreciation for the local expected

appreciation. Poterba's time series on the marginal tax rate for households with

real adjusted gross income of $30,000 in 1990 is employed (the 1990 tax rate is

assumed to hold in 1991 and 1992).



                          II. Empirical Estimates

      Table 2 contains the basic model estimates.                Column I reproduces the

estimates from our earlier study, and column 2 lists comparable estimates for the

new data set. The new set differs from the old in two major respects. First,

the dependent variable is now computed from a joint Fannie-Freddie data set of

repeat transactions. Second, we were able to fix up the real employment growth

variable. As a result, we have added an intermediate year (1982) and a city

(Seattle) to the data base. With the further addition of 1992, the data base is

expanded from 319 observations to 420 (30 cities for 14 years).

      As can be seen by comparing columns 1 and 2, the data revision and

extension do not alter the results significantly. Only the coefficient on the

change-in-local-price deviation changes by over 12 percent or more than half a

standard deviation. All t-ratios rise, with that on the change-in-local-price

deviation increasing the most, -1.5 to -3.5.


                                               7
      Both employment growth and real income growth per adult work as expected.

In the earlier paper, we noted that which variable is theoretically appropriate

depends on the model assumptions. Hera we have experimented some with different

real Income growth measures.    Column 3 gives the result with the variables

replaced by a total real income growth. As can be seen, it performs slightly

better than the two components used in the earlier paper.

      The specification in column 3 is reproduced for comparison in column 1 of

Table 3. Column 2 includes the new variable reflecting the percentage deviation

of actual from estimated-equilibrium price levels. While the coefficient is

statistically significant with the expected sign, the coefficient is a small 0.05

and raises the equation explanatory power by a trivial amount.

      Next, we divide the sample roughly into halves: the 14 cities in the

Northeast and West and the other 16 cities (Upper Midwest, Southeast and Texas).

We have lumped "Texas" with the Midwest and Southeast, but this is a far from

perfect aggregation. Dallas and Houston price behaviors differ from each other

and from any other region (see Table 1).      Prior to the most recent 1987-92

period, Dallas is much like the Upper Midwest, but in the most recent period its

price decline is even more severe than in the West.         Houston is like the

Southeast, except in the middle l980s, when Houston experienced sharp real price

declines.

      The empirical estimates in columns 3 and 4 suggest common responses of the

"coastal" and "inland" cities to real income growth and the user cost variables

(changes in real after-tax interest rates and local price deviation), but

substantially different responses to the disequilibrium variables (lagged

appreciation rate and deviation of the actual from equilibrium price level) and

to construction cost inflation. The common coefficients are similar to those in


                                       8
column 2: 0.7 on real income growth,        -0.5 on the change in real after-tax

interest rates and -0.15 on the change in relative inflation. The coefficient

on construction cost inflation is only 0.16 for the Northeast-West versus 0.57

for the rest of the country.      Moreover, evidence of price bubbles is much

stronger for the Northeast-West (coefficients of 0.5 on lagged appreciation and

0.10 on the price disequilibrium variable) than for the rest of the country (0.2

for lagged appreciation and effectively zero for the disequilibrium variable).

      Column 5 combines the two subsamples, but allows for different constants

and differential impacts of construction cost inflation, lagged appreciation, and

disequilibrium (constrained to zero for the 16 city group). The coefficient

estimates are as expected, with a slightly improved R-squared. Table 4 uses

these estimates to determine the ability of the model to explain the

substantially different movements in real regional house prices since 1983. The

decade is divided into the boom years of 1983-88 (1983-90 for the West) and the

subsequent bust. We report, for four regions, the actual cumulative log change.

the fitted, and the dynamically simulated.        In the latter, we substitute,

beginning in 1984, the predicted real price change for the actual lagged price

change and in calculation of the lagged price level in the disequilibrium

variable.

      Comparing the actual and simulated changes, we explain roughly three-

quarters of real price swings in the Southeast, Upper Midwest and the West, about

half the changes in the Northeast, and only about a quarter in Texas.         The

explanations for the West, Northeast and even Texas are substantial improvemefits

on our earlier paper (contrast, MB. 1993, table 9).        Of course, the Texas

results are still far from satisfactory.

      Next, we decompose the cumulative actual price appreciation since 1983 (the


                                        9
equilthritim year) into an increase in the equilibrium price and a residual, which

is simultaneously determined with the equilibrium process.        The qualitative

results regarding current disequilibria. shown in Table 5, are consistent with

expectations; the coasts were overpriced in 1992, Texas was underpriced, and the

great in-between was fairly priced. But it's worth looking more closely at each

area's numerical results.

       Real prices in the Northeast rose 92 percent from 1983 through 1988, before

dropping 25 percent through 1992. Over the same 1983-88 period,    the equilibrium

rate grew at a historically rapid 3 plus percent a year. but that still left a

yawning 50 percent gap in 1988 between actual and equilibrium prices.       Actual

levels have fallen more than equilibrium price since then, but the equation

suggeEts that a 30 percent gap remained at the end of 1992 (probably 25 percent

at the end of 1993). Unfortunately, because we were able to explain only 60

percent of the inidl980s surge. we may well have under-forecasted the equilibrium

price rise, and thus the actual-equilibrium price gap could be less than 25

percent.

       In both the Southeast and the Midwest, real prices rose by much smaller

amounts between 1983 and 1992, and actual prices remained within a few percent

of the equilibrium level in the 1980s. Texas is the inverse of the Northeast:

property values collapsed and for reasons not well captured in the model. Thus,

we have a huge 35 percent measure of underpricing and very little confidence in

 it.

       The Western regions had smaller cumulative increases than the Northeast.

and the fundamentals were stronger overall. Thus the disequilibrium gaps are a

 smaller 15 and 20 percent. While real prices fell significantly in 1993, how

much was a closing of the 1992 gap and how much was a further deterioration in


                                         10
California's fundamentals is unclear.



                            III. House Price Dynamics

      Of perhaps greater interest than the numerical results for specific regions

are the implications of the estimates for regional house price dynamics. The

error ten 6, as specified in equation (3), presents a dynamic tension for the

effect of lagged price change on current price inflation: lagged change enters

with a positive coefficient as a growth rate and with a negative coefficient

through the lagged price level.

      Simulations of price booms and busts using the estimated values of A1 and

   are presented in Figure 1. Four different 'boom' scenarios are overlaid on

top of an equilibrium growth rate of 1 percent.5 After being at equilibrium,

actual annual real appreciation is assumed to run for four years annually at: 14

percent (the Northeast), 8 percent (California), 4 percent (Midwest), and L

percent (trend). A dynamic solution starts in the fifth year (year 1 in the

chart), with the inflation rate equal to the sum of the equilibrium rate (1

percent) and the error term. The formula for the error term is:


               +
                   o.i[   pt1 â€”   p11
                                                                              (4)



which is equation (2') with values for A1 and A2 taken from column 5 of Table 3

for the coastal cities. There are no stochastic errors in these simulations.6

      In the "Northeast" simulation, the disequilibrium tern quickly drives


        Averaging the components of the equilibrium growth rate formula:
construction costs, real income, real after tax inflation rate, relative
inflation, and the constant, across time and the 14 coastal cities yields an
annual growth rate of 1.2 percent, rounded to 1 percent.

         These house price simulations are similar to the wage disinflation
simulation developed in Abraham (1987).

                                                           â€”   - 52 percent). Real

changes stay negative through the twelfth year; if nominal general inflation is

3 percent, nominal house price inflation will turn positive in year 8.         This

assumes that the equilibrium level continues growing at one percent annually.

Should the economic fundamentals temporarily worsen, as they did in Boston, a

sharper decline and stronger bounce back could be observed.

      As illustrated by the "California" and "Midwest" simulations, more modest

disequilibria impose less wrenching adjustments. In fact, real house price

appreciation in the Midwest is negative for only two years and then by trivial

amounts. Within 20 years, all four simulations have stabilized at an identical

'equilibrium' price level that is growing steadily at 1 percent per year.        (In

practice, changes in the equilibrium growth rate and stochastic shocks will alter

the timing along the disequilibrium path.)           These empirically estimated

coefficients imply it can take a long time --        up to a decade -    for   price

inflation in areas with long-term strength to recover from the bursting of a

bubble!

      The adjustment coefficients are, of course, estimated with error. Figure

2 illustrates the sensitivity of the Northeast adjustment path to combinations

of increases and decreases of two standard errors in the coefficients, 0.1 for

   and 0.05 for A2.    With a higher coefficient on the disequilibrium price

variable, the decline is steeper and more abrupt because the overpricing premium

is eliminated more rapidly.         With high coefficients on both the lagged

appreciation rate and the disequilibrium price, the price actually overshoots and

coefficient on the lagged appreciation rate but a low coefficient on the

disequilibrium variable, the decline is relatively slow (appreciation is not

negative until the third year). but longer lasting.

      The adjustment path is also sensitive to the underlying fundamentals. The

Figure 3 simulation examines the sensitivity of the California scenario to

equilibrium growth rates of 0, 1, and 2 percent. Clearly zero growth is the most

draconian, requiring that all of the 20 percent overpricing be unwound. Real

prices fall for a decade. In contrast, with two percent equilibrium growth,

roughly what the west coast experienced in the l980s, real prices decline for

only two years. This implies that it is not enough to know (believe) that houses

are overvalued by, say. 20 percent to forecast where values will be a year from

now. Even in such a case, the extent to which the equilibrium path is rising or

falling makes a fundamental contribution to real appreciation (depreciation).



                                 IV. Conclusion

      The last few years have seen the widely expanded availability of high

quality, constant-quality house price indices for metropolitan areas. As price

trends are a very localized phenomenon, a myriad of exciting research

opportunities are opening up. In this paper, we build upon an earlier attempt

(AWl, 1993) to understand cross sectional annual variation in real house price

movements in 30 cities over the 1977-92 period.

      A commonsense and empirically supported approach is for the theory to

describe an equilibrium price level to which the market is constantly adjusting.

The determinants of real house price appreciation, then, can be divided into two

groups, one that explains changes in the equilibrium price and the other that


                                       13
accounts for the adjustment dynamics or changing deviations from the equilibrium

price. The former group includes the growth in real income and real construction

costs and changes in the real after-tax interest rate. The latter group consists

of lagged real appreciation and the difference between the actual and equilibrium

real house price levels. Either group of variables can explain a little over

two-fifths of the variation in our sample; together, they explain three-fifths.

      Substantial real house price booms occurred on the two coasts during the

middle and late 1980s and real prices have since been declining. Our model can

explain roughly three-quarters of real price swings in the West (as well as the

smaller changes in the Southeast and Midwest), and about half the changes in the

Northeast. However, little of the general decline in real prices in Dallas and

Houston is explained.

      When this approach is applied across the country, we find as of end 1992

a huge 30 percent 'above market' premium in prices in the Northeast, a 15-20

percent premium in west coast prices, and probably significant underpricing in

Texas. Given our inability to explain part of the earlier rise in the Northeast,

that premium is probably too large. While some of the coastal premia undoubtedly

eroded in 1993, a further deterioration of fundamentals in California may also

have occurred. Thus a best guess is about a 15 percent premium on both coasts

in early 1994. The majority of the country, as represented by our Midwestern and

Southeastern cities, is near equilibrium.

      flow rapidly the presumed 15 percent premia will be eliminated is uncertain.

The basic coefficient estimates suggest the years of most intense declines occur

3-6 years after the boom ends, with a possibly very long period of adjustment - -

up to a dozen years of falling real prices.        Favorable economic trends can

significantly blunt the magnitude of the house price disinflation required

following a boom.

      Many mysteries remain.         The lagged appreciation term that represents

speculative pressures in the market performs admirably in soaking-up volatility,

but we still lack a compelling explanation for why it is needed, i.e., we don't

really know what starts the speculative bubbles. Even the detective work in Case

and Shiller (1993) does more to track the observed boom in real prices during the

l9ROs than to explain why it occurred in the first place.              In terms of the

Capozza-Helsley model, we have identified a role for real income growth, but we

have been unable to identify changes in the expected growth path.               Another

possibility is differing supply restrictions -     - or   lack of restrictions in places

such as in Texas - -   that   cause real income growth spurts to have greater impacts

in some areas than in others.6 it is these areas that we recommend future

researchers explore.




       We spent considerable time trying to fit cross-sectional measures of land
restrictions from Godschalk and Hartzell (1992) into our equations and were
unsuccessful in finding more than a token effect.
