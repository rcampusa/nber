Over the last 30 years, the Chinese government has invested in new industrial parks with the
intent of stimulating urban economic growth. The central government delegates the site selection
decision to provincial leaders. A principal-agent issue arises because the central government
prioritizes efficiency and equity criteria while the provincial leader may allocate such place based
investments to reward socially connected mayors. We present a revealed preference test of
industrial park site selection and document the willingness of China’s provincial leaders to
sacrifice economic development in order to reward social connections. We examine the causes
and consequences of this misallocation of capital.

Introduction



         Since 1982, the Chinese Central Government has built thousands of industrial parks. 1

Although these parks only occupy 0.1% of China’s total land area, they contain 40% of the nation’s

manufacturing jobs, and contribute 10% of China’s GDP and 33% of foreign direct investment

(Zheng et. al., 2017). Each park is a multi-billion dollar investment that requires acquiring a large

parcel of land, upgrading this land to improve sewer, utility and transport infrastructure, building

the capital stock for housing new firms, and offering economic incentives such as tax reductions

and subsidies for land rent and energy in order to attract productive firms and stimulate local

agglomeration economies (Wang, 2013). Alder et. al. (2016) use data from a panel of Chinese

cities to find that the establishment of a state-level industrial park is associated with an increase in

the level of GDP of about 20% ten years after the opening of the park.. Lu et. al. (2016) find that

two years after the opening of a park that the physical area features 47.1 percent greater

employment, 55.3 percent higher output than the non-park control areas.

         Prominent examples of these parks include Beijing’s Zhongguancun Science Park and the

Shenzhen High Tech Industrial Park. While these parks are associated with modern economic

agglomerations, there are other parks that have fizzled or even become “ghost towns”. In past

research we have documented that 30% of parks failed to generate local agglomeration benefits

(Zheng et. al., 2017).




1
 As of 2006, there were 1,568 national-level and provincial-level industrial parks distributed in more than 270 Chinese
cities, with 9,949 square kilometers in total.

                                                          2
        The fact that we observe ex-post very different returns on place based capital investments

raises a question about the initial site selection problem. Why did some Chinese leaders choose

the “wrong” city to site this expensive place based investment? 2 This paper presents a revealed

preference analysis of Chinese leaders’ priorities. We reconstruct the choice set of possible

locations to build a new park and we observe where the park is actually built. We follow

McFadden’s (1978) discrete choice approach to investigate the revealed preference of the Chinese

Communist Party. 3

        A leader with political career concerns who seeks to rise in the Chinese Communist Party

has an incentive to invest in projects that contribute to economic growth (Li and Zhou, 2005).

Provincial economic performance, measured as real GDP growth, is considered to be the main

performance measure for judging a provincial leader (Maskin et al., 2000). On the other hand,

rising income inequality in China in recent years has been viewed as a threat to social stability.

Since Hu Jintao became China’s President in 2002, the Chinese Communist Party (the CCP) has

sought to     promote the “balanced development” strategy, and thus has also rewarded political

leaders who have successfully reduced their area’s income inequality. This suggests that provincial

leaders tradeoff efficiency gains versus equity considerations when choosing where to locate

place-based policies such as a new industrial park.

        We posit that social connections between city leaders and the provincial leader also

influences a provincial leader’s park placement decision. This hypothesis builds on the emerging



2
 For instance, in 2011, the total fixed asset investment in 131 state-level industrial parks was 2092 billion RMB
yuan ($332 billion US dollars), which was about 35% of the total fixed asset investment in the whole nation (China
Statistic Yearbook, 2012).
3
  Each of the 31 provinces of China (including four municipalities with provincial status and five autonomous
regions) has two political leaders: provincial CCP secretary and provincial governor. The former is the head of
the provincial branch of the Communist Party, and the latter is the head of the provincial government. Provincial
secretaries are ranked higher than provincial governors (Jia et al., 2015). By “provincial leaders”, we mean either
of these two political leaders in each province.

literature studying the political economy of public capital resource allocation. Studies such as

Fisman (2001) and Jia et al. (2015) have documented the importance of social connections in

determining economic outcomes in both China and Indonesia. The literature on Chinese politics

(e.g. Dittmer (1995)) argues that Chinese political leaders build a network of loyal followers to

reduce the likelihood of their being ousted from power. 4 One of the common strategies for leaders

to maintain loyalty is to allocate scarce resources such as industrial parks in favor of the places

where their connected subordinates are serving.

         We estimate park site selection conditional logit models to test for the marginal effects of

a city’s growth potential, expected inequality reduction and social connections on the probability

that a park is sited in a given city. This discrete choice framework allows us to measure how much

economic growth a provincial leader is willing to sacrifice in order to help a subordinate friend.

Our empirical approach documents that the misallocation of capital in China represents a tradeoff

and thus has an “economic price” (the lost economic growth). A data innovation that we discuss

below is our creation of a detailed social networks database that allows us to track the long term

connections between provincial leaders and city leaders at different points in time.

         To preview our findings, we find that a provincial leader is willing to sacrifice 1.6% of the

province’s annual GDP for helping a connected subordinate. These results contribute to the capital

misallocation literature (Restuccia and Rogerson 2017). This literature has explored the

consequences of capital misallocation but there is less work exploring the political economy of its

causes or measuring its costs. While the Chinese Communist Party may be willing to bear some




4
  The city leaders promoted by provincial leaders will join the provincial government or become higher-ranking
leaders in higher-ranking cities (e.g., from city mayor to city CCP secretary, or from a small city leader to a large city
leader). Promoting political enemies may threaten the power of the provincial leaders.

efficiency cost to achieve social stability through lower inequality, the misallocation cost triggered

by rewarding political connections is a pure loss of social welfare.



The Provincial Leader’s Industrial Park Site Selection Problem



          A provincial leader must choose one city in the province to receive a new industrial park.

We assume that each provincial leader has the same objective function defined over three attributes.

We test below for heterogeneous preferences. The provincial leader’s probability of placing park

i in city j is a function of expected economic growth, expected inequality reduction, and rewarding

a social connection. 5 Provincial leader’s career prospects are determined by the central

government (Jia et al., 2015).

          The provincial leader’s expected utility from building a park in city j is expressed in

equation (1).



𝑈𝑈𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ∗ = 𝛽𝛽1 ��������
               ∆𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽2���������������
                                ∆𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺_𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽3 𝐶𝐶𝑂𝑂𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑗𝑗 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖   (1)



          We model the provincial leader as choosing the expected utility maximizing location for

the park. Under the assumption that 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is a random variable from a standard Type 1 extreme value

distribution, this yields the standard conditional logit formula.




5
  The site selection of a park includes two steps – choose a city for the park and then choose a location within the city
for the park. The city choice is of the first order importance, and this decision is made by provincial leaders (after
they receive the park quota from the central government). The choice of a location within a city is a secondary decision
made by the city’s leaders. In our previous work (Zheng et al., 2017), we study the within city consequences of park
locational choice.

                                                                   5
         We measure the expected economic gain as the expected increase in the value-added (GDP)

                                  �������� . The expected inequality reduction is measured as the
that park i will bring to city j, ∆𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺

expected decrease in the within-province city-level Gini coefficient (based on GDP per capita)

attributed to the growth generated by this park, ���������������
                                                 ∆𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺_𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺. 6 Expected economic growth and

expected inequality reductions will directly increase a provincial leader’s promotion likelihood.

Below, we report reduced form estimates testing whether provincial leaders are more likely to be

promoted if their region is experiencing greater economic growth and reduced income inequality.

         We build a comprehensive database of social connections between provincial leaders and

city leaders to construct the connection measure, CONNECTION (see the data section, and

Appendix 1). We are unable to quantify a dollar value of these personal benefits so we include a

dummy variable indicating whether the provincial leader is connected to the urban leader.

         We assume that provincial leaders are aware that they face a counter-factual treatment

effect problem because they do not know what the GDP growth caused by a new park would be

for each city in the choice set. As we discuss in the next section, we model the provincial leaders

as econometricians who use all available information to impute this counter-factual expectation.

Intuitively, a leader must predict what would be the GDP growth in each city if he assigns a park

there. Throughout this paper, we assume a symmetry in solving this prediction problem between

the econometrician and the decision maker. This approach allows us to circumvent the generated

regressor problem (see Murphy and Topel, 2002). Under our assumption of symmetry, we are

able to recreate the provincial leader’s perceived tradeoff at the time he/she makes the allocation



6
  This is a city-level Gini coefficient, instead of an individual-level one. If the placement of a park in a city leads to
the increase of this city-level Gini coefficient but also trigger some poor people from poor areas in that province to
migrate to this city, it may not necessarily cause an increase of the individual-level Gini coefficient. However, our
interviews with city and provincial leaders indicate that the upper-level officials care more about such a place-based
city-level inequality measure.

                                                            6
decision. Provincial leaders will recognize that they may sacrifice significant expected economic

growth by helping a political connection. 7 This is an “economic price” because there is a direct

connection between local economic growth and being promoted within the CCP.

         After estimating equation (2), we obtain estimates of the average provincial leader’s

revealed preferences for expected economic gains (𝛽𝛽1), expected inequality reduction (𝛽𝛽2) and

strengthening the loyalty of their connected city leaders (𝛽𝛽3). 8 We use the estimated coefficients

to directly estimate the economic cost of capital misallocation – the expected amount of GDP this

political leader is willing to sacrifice for helping his connected city leader.

         By estimating our conditional logit models for subsets of our data, we test for whether the

objectives of provincial governments change over time. After Hu Jintao became China’s President

in 2002, the Chinese Communist Party has paid more attention to the inequality issue. The leaders

of poor provinces may continue to prioritize economic growth , while the leaders of rich provinces

have started to put more effort on “balanced development”.



Data Construction

         Our data set covers 276 prefecture-level cities during the period of 1988-2008. 9 We collect

additional data from the China city statistical yearbooks. We use GIS to calculate a city’s straight-

line distance to the nearest highway entrance, airport, railway station and the main seaport. (see

Appendix 1 for variable definitions and summary statistics).


7
  We acknowledge that we ignore province level general equilibrium effects triggered by the park. We are implicitly
assuming that a new park located in city j generates new activity or attracts firms from outside the province, and it
would not lead to significant reshuffling of economic activity (such as population migration) within the province.
We also are assuming away any cross-city spillover effects. Alder et. al. (2016) directly test for park spillovers and
find some evidence of positive spillovers for cities close to the treated city.
8
  In equation (1), we will control for a vector of city and park attributes. There may be other unobserved variables that
also affect a park’s placement across cities. We assume that these unobservables are uncorrelated with our X vector.
9
  We exclude four municipal cities and those in Qinghai, Tibet, and Ningxia. There was no new national- or provincial-
level park built after 2008.

                                                           7
         During our study period, 1,417 national and provincial level industrial parks were built in

these 276 cities. Each went through a formal approval process. They have political autonomy in

designing and experimenting with new institutions and preferential policies (Lu et al., 2016; Alder

et al., 2016). 10 The “Bulletin List for the Official Boundaries of Chinese Industrial Parks”

published by Ministry of Land and Resources in China provides information of each park’s

establishment year and the city it is located in. Cities in a province compete with each other to

obtain a quota (permission) to build a provincial-level park, or obtain a quota (permission) to

compete on behalf of the province for building a national-level park. Provincial leaders allocate

the scarce resource of the park quotas (permissions) to cities 11.                  Figure 1 presents the spatial

distribution of national- and provincial-level industrial parks across cities over time in China 12.

The cities in eastern area of China account for more than half of the parks and most of them were

built before 2002.




10
   Industrial parks are authorized by different level governments: state, provincial, or prefecture (or below) government.
Those parks authorized by the state and provincial governments enjoy more favorable policies, such as lower interest
rate loans, larger tax, land price and utility price discounts. We only focus on those parks because many of the lower-
level industrial parks did not obtain formal approval from the central and provincial governments and violated the
relevant laws and regulations. In 2003, the central government investigated industrial parks regarding their potential
violation of land use regulations and this resulted in a large number of those lower-level industrial parks being
abolished (see Cartier (2001) and Adler (2013)).
11
    In China’s administrative hierarchy, prefecture-level city government ranks below central and provincial
governments. In terms of their administrative boundaries, a prefecture-level city comprises a core urban area
(containing several districts/counties) and a surrounding peripheral area which include remote counties (and the towns
in those counties). A city leader (party secretary or mayor) has jurisdiction over all the area within this administrative
boundary.
12
   We divide China into three greater regions: Eastern region including Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Liaoning, Hebei,
Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Shandong, and Guangdong, Hainan, and Guangxi; Central region including Inner
Mongolia, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Shanxi, Anhui, Jiangxi, Henan, Hubei, and Hunan; Western region covering Shananxi,
Gansu, Qinghai, Ningxia, Xinjiang, Choingqing, Sichuan, Guizhou, and Yunnan Guangxi (Tibet is excluded due to
missing data).

Predicting Economic Growth and Income Inequality Dynamics Induced by New Parks



       We now explain how we construct the three key measures in the provincial leader’s

objective function (equation (1)). We need to estimate the expected park treatment effect on each

                                                    ��������). We first create a propensity score
city’s GDP if that city received a specific park i (∆𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺

measuring the likelihood that each city receives a park (see Appendix Table 3). For each treated

city, we construct a control group of four cities with very similar propensity scores of winning an




                                                  9
industrial park in the same year (see Appendix 2). We then run a difference-in-difference model

to quantify the GDP increase after the treated city receives that park:



        log(𝑌𝑌𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 ) = 𝛽𝛽0 + 𝛽𝛽1 ∗ (𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 ∗ 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑)𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 + 𝛿𝛿𝑗𝑗 + 𝜏𝜏𝑡𝑡 + 𝜀𝜀𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 .                 (2)

        Where Y indicates the GDP for city j in in year t. 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑗𝑗 is a dummy for whether city j is

treated in year t (receiving a park). The dummy 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑡𝑡 = {0,1} denotes pre and post-treatment period.

𝛿𝛿𝑗𝑗 and 𝜏𝜏𝑡𝑡 are city and time fixed effects. 𝜀𝜀𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 is an error term. The results are reported in Appendix

Table 4.

        This park treatment effect may vary across different cities. Some studies have found that

industrial parks have a larger growth effect if the city features better economic fundamentals, and

there are co-agglomeration benefits between the city’s incumbent industries and the new industries

introduced into the park (Li and Shen, 2015; Zheng et. al., 2017). Therefore, we decompose this

treatment effect by assuming it is a function of city-park-year attributes (natural endowment X,

economic fundamentals Z, park attributes and year dummies T):

        log𝑌𝑌𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 = �𝑏𝑏0 + 𝑏𝑏1 ∙ 𝑋𝑋𝑗𝑗 + 𝑏𝑏2 ∙ 𝑍𝑍𝑗𝑗 + ∑ 𝑏𝑏𝑡𝑡 ∙ 𝑇𝑇𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 � ∙ (𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 ∗ 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑)𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 + 𝛿𝛿𝑗𝑗 + 𝜏𝜏𝑡𝑡 + 𝜀𝜀𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗   (3)

        With the year dummies we are able to capture the trajectory of a city’s GDP growth for the

first year, the second year and several years later after the park is built. We use the estimated

coefficients in the decomposition function to calculate the expected GDP increase and GDP per

capita increase (one year, two years or several years after the park placement) if that city receives

a park in that year. With these GDP per capita numbers, we then calculate the expected Gini

coefficient change for each option. Please refer to Appendix 2 for the details.

        Figure 2 shows the descriptive statistics of the one-year GDP increase and three-year Gini

coefficient change due to the introduction of a real or a hypothetical park by region and by time


                                                                  10
period. Here we divide China into three regions (see footnote #10) and our study period into two

regimes under two Chinese Presidents – Zemin Jiang (1989-2002) and Jintao Hu (2003-2008). On

average, the expected city GDP increases generated by parks are larger in the east region, and in

the latter period. At the same time, we can see that such expected GDP increase generated by an

average industrial park is significantly larger than the counterfactual effect if placing this park in

other cities. This indicates that provincial leaders do choose to place parks in the cities where those

parks can generate higher expected economic gains. This preference (measured in the gap between

real and hypothetical parks) is stronger in middle and western regions, and in the earlier period.

When looking at how industrial parks change the expected income inequality in a province (Gini

coefficient of GDP per capita), real parks in the east and middle regions do not have significant

effect on Gini coefficient, but those in the west region significantly deteriorate income inequality.

The regime change is clear – in the earlier period, the placement of industrial parks significantly

deteriorates income inequality, while this pattern reverses in the latter period.

Measuring Social Connections



           To test for the role of social connections as a cause of capital misallocation requires

measures of the social connections between local officials (city mayor or party secretary) and the

upper-level government leaders (provincial-level governor or party secretary). Past research on

the political economy of such connections has emphasized two criteria (Xu 2017). One is that this

social tie measure should be objective. The other is that such measure can solve the issue of

endogenous social network information. To meet these criteria, we measure social connections

between city leaders and provincial leaders along four dimensions: workplace, birthplace,

university/college, and political faction.




                                                                  12
       The first measure defines a city leader and a provincial leader to be connected if they once

worked in the same workplace, based on the assumption that politicians are more likely to be friend

with those who share the work experience in the same place. Jia et al. (2015) measure social

connections for provincial governors with top leaders in the central government using this shared

work experience approach. The second measure is based on the geographic location where

politicians were born. The underlying assumption is that politicians are more likely to keep close

relations with others who come from the same birthplace. Do et al. (2017) provide evidence for

favoritism towards one’s hometown by government officials in Vietnam. The third measure

defines social connections between city leaders and provincial leaders as they share the study

experience in the same university or college. This is based on the assumption that politicians are

more likely to form social ties in their alumni network. Fourth, we define city leaders and

provincial leaders to be connected through their political factions. The underlying assumption is

that politicians tend to be allies when they belong to the same faction (Francois et al., 2016). We

highlight two main factions within the CCP, tuanpai (the Communist Youth League of China,

CYLC) and non-tuanpai.

       To build these social connections, we construct a data set on the city and provincial leaders

between 1980 and 2010 in China by undertaking a large-scale data collection from Duxiu, a local

Scholar Search Engine with millions of digitized literatures, newspapers, journalists and books in

Chinese provided by China’s CNKI. This data set contains extensive biographic information on

each official including name, birth year, birth place, education record, the list of positions held in

the party or in the government in the past along with the period in which each position was held,

and the record of whether he had received the training in China’s Central Party School.




                                                 13
       CONNECTION is a dummy variable. Jia et. al. (2015) find that among all measures of

social connections, the workplace-based one works the best. We mainly use the workplace-based

social connections measure between city and provincial CCP party secretaries. Jia et. al. (2015)

follow a similar strategy. In China’s bureaucratic hierarchy, party secretary has a higher ranking

than the governor at the same administrative level (province or prefecture city). We also use the

connections between the other three pairs of leaders: city party secretary and provincial governor;

city mayor and provincial party secretary; city mayor and provincial governor. More details are

provided in Appendix 1.

The Association Between Province Economic Growth and the Leader’s Promotion Chances



       We first estimate a logit model where we fit a provincial leaders’ promotion likelihood as

a function of province level variables. We seek to learn about the provincial leaders’ incentives

given the Chinese central government’s promotion criteria. We follow the model specification and

variable construction in Jia et al. (2015). Table 1 reports the logit model results. The dependent

variable is a dummy indicating whether the provincial leader is promoted in year t.

Notes: ∆GDP is the average annual growth rate of that province since the leader assumed office until year t, measured as the
deviation from the sample mean (11.4%). ∆GINI_ GDP is the percentage change of Gini index (GDP per capita weighted by
population) since the leader assumed office until year t. CONNECTION_CENTRAL is a dummy indicating whether this leader is
connected to the seven to nine leaders in the Politburo Standing Committee in the central CCP. Provincial dummies, year
dummies (separate sets of year dummies for CCP secretary and governor in column (1)), and term dummies measuring how
many years the leader has held this position) are controlled for. Standard errors clustered at the province level are reported in
parentheses.


          Provincial GDP growth is highly and positively associated with provincial leader’s

promotion likelihood (Maskin et al., 2000, Jia et al., 2015). Within-province inequality decreases

matter more for the provincial party secretary’s promotion. We know that the provincial party

secretary has a higher rank and authority than the provincial governor. Thus, below we mainly

focus on the attributes of party secretaries. Not surprisingly, these provincial leaders’ social ties

with top leaders in the central government also help them to get promoted. These results support

the claim that provincial leaders have a career incentive to pursue economic growth. We now turn

to explore their preferences in siting new parks.



The Determinants of Industrial Park Placement



          Table 2 reports the baseline estimates of equation (2).                      New parks create a cumulative

growth process as a new agglomeration takes root. This means that the long run growth effects

are larger than the short run effects (see Zheng et. al. 2017). Across columns (1) to (4), we consider


                                                               15
the short-, medium- and long-run impacts, from 1 year to 10 years after the opening of a park. Here

�������� is the expected accumulated GDP increase over that period, and ∆𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺_𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺
∆𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺                                                                 ��������������� is the

expected change in the Gini coefficient of GDP per capita between the start and end year of that

period. The dummy CONNECTION equals one if the provincial leader and city leader in the park’s

city in the opening year are socially connected. In this baseline model we use the workplace-based

connection measure between the city and provincial CCP secretaries.

                                �������� and CONNECTION both have a statistically significant
        For each time horizons, ∆𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺

effect on the likelihood of site selection. When a provincial leader decides where to place a park,

he considers both short-run and long-run growth effects. For the short-run (one year), if a park is

expected to generate a 100 million RMB GDP increase to a given city, this city will enjoy a 0.76

                                                                         �������� is the expected
percentage point increase in the likelihood of receiving the park. Since ∆𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺

accumulated GDP increase, its coefficient shrinks from column (1) to (4) but the size of its effect

is stable.

        Controlling for the effects of a new park on economic growth and regional cross-city

income inequality, we find that social connections influence the siting of a park. This connection

variable is statistically significant at the 1% level in each of the four regressions. As shown in

column (1), the probability that a park is placed in a given city increases by 6.6 percentage points

when the local leader is connected.

        For the whole sample, income inequality is not a major consideration for provincial leaders’

park placement decision. The coefficient of ���������������
                                            ∆𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺_𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺 is insignificant for all time horizons. It

has a positive sign in the first year, and turns negative since the third year. This is a suggestive

evidence that the inequality concern only matters when provincial leaders consider a park’s long-

term impact.

         Our estimates allow us to calculate the misallocation costs induced by social ties. By taking

the ratio of the ∆GDP coefficient divided by the coefficient of the connection variable, we measure

the GDP loss a provincial leader is willing to sacrifice to reward connections. The last three rows

in Table 1 present these estimates. The annualized cost of social connections is quite stable for

short and long time horizons – about 850 to 875 million RMB, around 1.5% - 1.6% of that

province’s annual GDP. This is a large number. In Appendix 3, we perform some robustness

checks on the effect of social connections. We control for the city secretary’s individual attributes

(age, education attainment, tenure, and whether he/she was born in that province). We also include

the other three connection measures (based on college, birthplace and faction), or the connections

between other city and provincial leaders (city mayor, city party secretary, and provincial

governor). The results are quite stable. The economic price of supporting connections ranges

between 1.1% - 1.6% of a province’s annual GDP.

Evidence of Shifting Government Priorities


         We explore the heterogeneity in provincial leaders’ preferences along two major

dimensions: by region and by time period.                    China’s eastern region (coastal area) is the most

developed area, while the western region features poorer provinces. GDP growth is still the first

priority (compared to inequality concern) for officials in the poor regions. On the other

hand, Confucian culture may be more prominent in the inland regions (the middle and west) due

to the weaker influence of western countries. Social ties are a key mechanism to maintain social

order and stability in Confucian culture.

         Table 3 reports the results with the three-year cumulative GDP increase and Gini

coefficient change after the introduction of a park. We report the regional results in columns (1) to

(3). We find that the leaders of richer provinces (in the eastern region) have started to address

the inequality concern, while the leaders of poorer provinces (in the middle and western regions)

still put more effort on economic growth over equality. Social connections matter everywhere,

but the misallocation cost it triggers (measured in the share of provincial GDP) is higher in poorer

regions.

       Column (4) and (5) present the regression results for two regimes under two Presidents –

Zemin Jiang (1989-2002) and Jintao Hu (2003-2008). In Jiang’s regime, Chinese Communist Party

put economic growth as the first priority, and GDP growth was the major factor in local officials’

performance and promotion evaluation. Later, the rising inequality and associated social conflicts

pushed CCP to switch to a more “balanced growth” strategy. President Hu proposed his idea of

“scientific outlook on development” which emphasizes social stability and sustainability. We do

observe a clear regime change in our discrete choice model estimates. In Hu’s era, the Gini variable

becomes significantly negative, while the GDP effect is weaker. Provincial leaders are willing to

sacrifice more economic growth for an inequality decrease, so poorer cities get more chance to

receive a park. The misallocation cost of social connections is even higher in Hu’s era.




Conclusion



       This paper has contributed to the capital misallocation literature by studying the choices of

Chinese provincial leaders in allocating local economic development projects, namely new

industrial parks. These new sub-city employment centers bundle together an agglomeration of

firms co-located to reduce the transportation costs of ideas, and goods.

       By explicitly studying the place based investment site selection problem, we contribute to

the recent literature studying the consequences of such investments. Leading empirical papers

examining the impact of place based policies either use propensity score matching (Kline and

Moretti 2011) or “just missed treated” (Greenstone, Hornbeck and Moretti 2010) to overcome the


                                                 19
selection challenge that such spatial investments are not randomly assigned.                     In China, there are

major place based programs such as the creation of industrial parks where a large enough number

of these treatments have been built to allow for a more systematic examining of this political

selection equation.

         We have modeled the provincial leader as anticipating the expected gains that would be

realized if a new industrial park is placed in a given city. In this sense, our work explicitly

embraces Heckman et. al. (2006) essential heterogeneity approach. The decision to take a

treatment (in our setting assigning a park to a given city) is a function of the expected gain from

the treatment. In the standard essential heterogeneity research, the decision maker's objective is

to maximize a one dimensional criteria such as earnings. We have modeled provincial leaders as

choosing to site a park while trading off three key features of cities.

         While such parks are intended to stimulate economic growth and to reduce spatial income

inequality (by boosting the income of low income cities), provincial leaders have discretion over

where they site such parks. By creating a new social connections database, we document that

Chinese provincial leaders are willing to sacrifice some urban economic growth in order to help a

local leader who is a social connection. Political connections are a cause of capital misallocation.

Such decisions do impose some costs for the decision maker. In the Chinese Communist Party,

provincial leaders are more likely to be promoted if their province’s GDP is growing faster. Our

estimates suggest that a leader reduces his own promotion chances by about 1.8 percentage points

when he assigns a park to a connected friend. 13

  This calculation is based on the results reported in Table 2. The annualized cost of a social connection as a share of
provincial GDP is around 1.6%. Multiplying this number with the coefficient of ∆GDP in Table 1 column (1)
(1.133) yields that the cost of social connections will reduce provincial leaders’ promotion probability by 1.8
percentage points.

A. Measuring Social connections

We create four measures of connection based on information on workplace, birthplace, alumni
networks, and political factions. In China’s political system, the two top officials are both in charge
of local administrative affairs. At the city level, one is the party secretary and the other is the mayor.
At the provincial level, they are the party secretary and the governor. Thus, there are four pairs of
connections based on the four dimensions mentioned above. We summarize the shares of city-
level top officials who are politically connected to the corresponding provincial level key leaders
in Appendix Table 1. As shown in Column (2), roughly one quarter of the 107 provincial level
party secretaries are politically connected with his/her city-level subordinates (party secretaries) if
they have worked in the same workplace, based on the assumption that politicians are more likely
to befriend others who share a similar working experience in the same place.

B. City-level Attributes


To model a city’s economic fundamentals, we assemble a vector of city attributes. These time
invariant city level variables include; the longitude and latitude coordinates, the city’s spatial
distances to the nearest highway, airport, railway station, and the main seaport. We have also
collected information the city’s annual average temperature and rainfall. We also use the
topographic data to construct another two city-level geographic variables, the share of land with
slope smaller than 15 degrees and the ratio of water bodies. The first panel of Appendix Table 2
reports summary statistics for these geographic endowments variables at the city level.

The second set of fundamental city level variables are time varying. They include; per capita GDP,
per capita foreign direct investment, per capita fixed asset investment, total population, per capita
industrial output, per capita import, per capita export, per capita college students, and number of


                                                     22
existing state and province-level industrial parks. The data on these variables are drawn from the
annual China’s Urban Statistics Yearbooks. The summary statistics for these variables are
illustrated in the second panel of Appendix Table 2.

Appendix 2: Estimation of the City Specific Expected Park Induced Economic Growth
Effects


To estimate the expected counterfactual treatment effect of establishing an industrial park on local
economic growth we employ a difference-in-difference (DID) approach based on a set of city-
level characteristics including both geographic and economic fundamentals. Using the DID model
estimation results, we calculate what economic outcome (GDP and GDP per capita) a city would
achieve if it receives an industrial park. Using the data on predicted GDP per capita we calculate
what GINI coefficient in terms of economic equity would be in a province as the provincial
governor assigns an industrial park in one of the cities. Our analysis considers ten-year
accumulated economic growth outcomes associated with GDP and GDP per capita brought by an
industrial park. The constructions of the expected economic outcomes in cities and corresponding
GINI coefficient associated with economic equity are presented as follows.

A. Expected GDP growth

     We follow the treatment effects research design approach and assume that the economic
outcomes of observably similar locations would be, on average, identical for treated and control
cities (the conditional independence assumption, or CIA). A second key identification assumption
is that the treatment does not impact outcomes for the untreated one (the single unit treatment value
assumption, or SUTVA). See Footnote #6 in the text.
     We construct control cities for each treatment city employing propensity score matching
method. First, we restrict our sample into cities whose leaders do not have political connection.
Then we define a group of treatment cities and a group of control cities and estimate the probability
of treatment. Next, we estimate a propensity score model (PSM) based on city-level characteristics
including the geographic and economic fundamentals variables listed in Appendix Table 2. Finally,
we construct a group of control cities for each treatment city based on propensity scores. These
control cities are expected to have similar probability of winning an industrial park given these
city-level conditions.

The linear probability model of location choice of industrial parks is specified as follows:

prob(whether city j is home to park i) = 𝛼𝛼0 + 𝜃𝜃𝑋𝑋𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 + 𝜌𝜌𝑍𝑍𝑗𝑗 + 𝜔𝜔𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 (A1)

where 𝑋𝑋𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 is a set of time-invariant geographic fundamentals variables, 𝑍𝑍𝑗𝑗 is a set of economic
fundamentals that vary over time, and 𝜔𝜔𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 is an error term. Appendix Table 3 reports the results
on the location choice of industrial parks with statistically significant variables included. Based on
these estimated coefficients we construct the propensity scores and match a treatment city with
four control non-treated ones in an interval using the nearest neighbor approach.

statistic until all remaining covariates has a t-statistic larger than or equal to 2 (in absolute value). Among these covariates with
statistically significance,Parknum is the total existing industrial parks in city j in year t. FDI_PC and Export_PC, are city j’s per
capita foreign direct investment and per capita export, respectively. Totalarea is city’s total land area. Rain indicates average
rainfall. University indicates whether city j has a good university. Flatland<15°, and Latitude is city j’s share of land with slope
smaller than 15 degrees.

Then we conduct the estimations on the GDP growth effect of introducing an industrial park using
these PSM matched samples in a DID framework:

log𝑌𝑌𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 = 𝛽𝛽0 + 𝛽𝛽1 ∗ 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑗𝑗 + 𝛽𝛽2 ∗ 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑡𝑡 + 𝛽𝛽3 ∗ (𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 ∗ 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑)𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 + 𝛿𝛿𝑗𝑗 + 𝜏𝜏𝑡𝑡 + 𝜀𝜀𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 .                (A2)

where Y indicates the GDP for city j in in year t. 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑗𝑗 is a dummy for whether city j is a treatment
city or not. The dummy 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑡𝑡 = {0,1} denotes pre and post-treatment period. 𝛿𝛿𝑗𝑗 and 𝜏𝜏𝑡𝑡 are city and
time fixed effects. 𝜀𝜀𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 is an error term. The results are reported in Appendix Table 4. The
introduction of an industrial park is positively related to local economic growth. This is consistent
with the findings in Alder et al. (2016).

We allow the treatment effect of a park (𝛽𝛽3) to differ as a function of city level attributes that
include city-level characteristics (Xj), including geographic and economic fundamentals as
presented above, park-level attributes (Zj) including the size of a park, and time dummies
representing the t-th year after the park being estimated (Tjt). To implement this approach, we take
a parametric linear stand on the marginal treatment effect and substitute this expression into
equation (A2). This yields:

log𝑌𝑌𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 = �𝑏𝑏0 + 𝑏𝑏1 ∙ 𝑋𝑋𝑗𝑗 + 𝑏𝑏2 ∙ 𝑍𝑍𝑗𝑗 + ∑ 𝑏𝑏𝑡𝑡 ∙ 𝑇𝑇𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 � ∙ (𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 ∗ 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑)𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 + 𝛿𝛿𝑗𝑗 + 𝜏𝜏𝑡𝑡 + 𝜀𝜀𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗       (A3)

where 𝑏𝑏0 + 𝑏𝑏1 ∙ 𝑋𝑋𝑗𝑗 + 𝑏𝑏2 ∙ 𝑍𝑍𝑗𝑗 + ∑ 𝑏𝑏𝑡𝑡 ∙ 𝑇𝑇𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 represents the growth rate of GDP in city j from building
a new park in year t. Appendix Table 5 reports the estimation results based on expanded
specification (A3).

Note: Following the “top down” procedure in Crump et al. (2008), we drop the covariate with the smallest t-statistic until all
remaining covariates has a t-statistic larger than or equal to 2 (in absolute value). Among these covariates with statistically
significance, Population, GDP, output, import, and export indicates city-level total population, GDP, industrial output, import, and
export, respectively. Dis_highway, Dis_port, Flatland<15° are the spatial distance to the nearest highway, spatial distance to the
nearest seaport, the share of land with slope smaller than 15 degrees, respectively.
Robust standard errors are reported in parentheses, which are clustered at province-year level. * p < 0.10, ** p < 0.05, *** p < 0.01.



Finally, using such estimated growth rate of GDP we calculate the accumulated growth in GDP
(Delta GDP) from year 1 to year 10 for a city when it hosts or is assumed to host an industrial
park. The first panel of Appendix Table 6 provides the descriptive statistics for the estimated
∆GDPs.

B. Constructing the Expected change in the GINI coefficient


Another key variable in our revealed preference test of industrial park site selection is an equity
criteria measured by the GINI coefficient in GDP per capita. We construct this variable in two
steps. In the first step, we repeat estimate equations (A2) and (A3) but this time using GDP per
capita as the dependent variable. Appendix Table 7 and 8 present the estimation results. We
calculate the accumulated growth in GDP per capita from the first year to the tenth year using
estimates of 𝑏𝑏0 + 𝑏𝑏1 ∙ 𝑋𝑋𝑗𝑗 + 𝑏𝑏2 ∙ 𝑍𝑍𝑗𝑗 + ∑ 𝑏𝑏𝑡𝑡 ∙ 𝑇𝑇𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 for a city when it hosts an industrial park.

In the second step, we calculate the GINI coefficient in GDP per capita at the province year level
under the assumption that the park is built in a given city. Intuitively, if a poor city in a province
receives the park and if the park is effective at increasing that city’s GDP per-capita then the GINI
coefficient for the province declines after the park is placed there.
The descriptive statistics for the estimated ∆GINI_GDPs are presented in the second panel of
Appendix Table 6.

Note: Following the “top down” procedure in Crump et al. (2008), we drop the covariate with the smallest t-statistic until all
remaining covariates had a t-statistic larger than or equal to 2 (in absolute value). Among these covariates with statistically
significance, Dis_highway, Dis_port, Flatland<15°, and Latitude, are city’s spatial distance to the nearest highway, spatial distance
to the nearest seaport, the share of land with slope smaller than 15 degrees, and the latitude, respectively. GDP_PC, FAI_PC,
Output_PC, Import_PC, Export_PC, and Collegestu_PC are city-level per capita GDP, per capita fixed asset investment, per capita
industrial output, per capita import, per capita export, and per capita college students, respectively. Totalarea is city’s total land
area. Rain indicates average rainfall.

Appendix 3: Robustness Checks

We present several robustness checks. One possible concern with our estimation is omitted
variable bias. To address this issue, we augment the X vector in equation (2) to include additional
individual attributes for a city’s party secretary. These include his age, education attainment, tenure,
and whether he/she was promoted in that province. We also control for other three sources of
connections a provincial party secretary is connected to his/her subordinated friends, including
whether to share the same university to graduate, whether to be born in the same place, or whether
to belong to the same political faction. In addition, we consider the role of social connections of
provincial governor, another top leader at the provincial level by controlling for his/her four
dimensions of connections with the subordinated city party secretaries. As illustrated in Appendix
Table 9, the results are robust to controlling for these extra variables..
