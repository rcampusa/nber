Testing for Information Asymmetries in Real Estate Markets

                                             ABSTRACT

We study equilibrium outcomes in markets with asymmetric information about asset values among
both buyers and sellers. In residential real estate markets hard-to-observe neighborhood characteristics
are a key source of information heterogeneity: sellers are usually better informed about neighborhood
values than buyers, but there are some sellers and some buyers that are better informed than their peers.
We propose a new theoretical framework for analyzing such markets with many heterogeneous assets
and differentially informed agents. Consistent with the predictions from this framework, we find that
changes in the seller composition towards (i) more informed sellers and (ii) sellers with a larger supply
elasticity predict subsequent house-price declines and demographic changes in that neighborhood.
This effect is larger for houses whose value depends more on neighborhood characteristics, and smaller
for houses bought by more informed buyers. Our findings suggest that home owners have superior
information about important neighborhood characteristics, and exploit this information to time local
market movements.

        In many markets, market participants have differential information about important char-
    acteristics of heterogenous assets. Akerlof (1970), for example, analyzes a situation in which
    sellers of used cars have superior information relative to potential buyers. In other mar-
    kets, sellers are better informed than buyers on average, but not all buyers and sellers are
    equally well informed. Consider the residential real estate market: transaction prices include
    payments for both the land and the structure, each of which is hard to value and can be a
    source of asymmetric information between market participants.1 On average, home sellers
    are likely to have better information than potential buyers about neighborhood and house
    characteristics. In addition, however, some of the possible buyers or sellers might have an
    information advantage relative to their peers. For example, real estate agents might be par-
    ticularly well informed about neighborhood gentrification patterns and demographic trends,
    and buyers who have previously lived in the same neighborhood face less of an information
    disadvantage relative to buyers who are moving from further away.
        In this paper we argue that such asymmetric information is substantial and has impor-
    tant implications for equilibrium housing market outcomes. Our empirical analysis is guided
    by the predictions from a new theoretical framework for analyzing markets with many het-
    erogeneous assets and differentially informed agents. In our model, an agent’s valuation of
    a property depends on characteristics of both the neighborhood and the structure. Current
    home owners can observe these characteristics for their own property, but the valuation of
    their current unit also includes an idiosyncratic shock that captures, for example, the need
    to move for job-related reasons. All potential buyers value a property identically based on
    characteristics of the neighborhood and the structure, both of which they do not observe
    perfectly. We model information as the ability to differentiate between properties of differ-
    ent overall value and assume that some agents can do this better than others. Differential
    information across buyers is not only a realistic features of many asset markets, but will
    generate additional predictions that allow us to cleanly identify the presence of asymmetric
    information in markets with some degree of price predictability, such as housing markets.
        In this setting we cannot apply existing asset pricing models with heterogeneously in-
    formed agents, which typically rely on one of two standard notions of equilibrium. Models
    in the spirit of Akerlof (1970) assume that assets which buyers cannot distinguish are pooled
    at the same price. In our setting, whether or not two assets are distinguishable depends on
    the identity of the buyer: only some buyers can tell apart good and bad neighborhoods and
    houses. Therefore, the price pooling assumption cannot be made here, at least not without
1
    For example, the value of a house’s structure includes hard-to-observe aspects of construction quality
    (Stroebel, 2013). Similarly, local amenities such as crime rates or school quality that are capitalized in
    the value of the property’s land component are oftentimes in flux, and hard for market participants to
    observe (Guerrieri et al., 2010a).


                                                        2
further qualification. In models relying on rational expectations equilibria along the lines
of Grossman and Stiglitz (1980) each asset is divisible, clearly identified and has its own
separate market. Some traders may be less informed about the expected value of the asset,
but they can be sure to be trading the same asset as other traders. We want to capture
a stronger notion of relative informedness: some traders can tell whether two houses have
different fundamentals while others cannot. This implies that an uninformed buyer cannot
learn about the value of house A by looking at the equilibrium price of house B because he
does not know whether it is the same kind of house.
    We propose a notion of competitive equilibrium that respects traders’ individual ability
to tell houses apart from one another. We allow each house, in principle, to be traded at any
price. Sellers choose at what prices to (try to) sell their house; buyers choose at what price
to (try to) buy a house and use their information to select which house to buy. The prices at
which houses actually trade are determined by a form of rationing at every possible price, as
in the competitive equilibrium defined by Kurlat (2012). We derive conditions under which
more informed buyers choose better houses even though all houses that are observationally
equivalent to the least informed buyer endogenously trade at the same price.
    The model has several implications for equilibrium outcomes. First, the characteris-
tics of sellers in a neighborhood should predict subsequent price changes for houses in that
neighborhood. This is because some owners are more likely to sell in response to changes
in hard-to-observe and partially unpriced neighborhood characteristics. More responsive
owners might include those with better information, or those with houses that are more
affected by neighborhood trends. Consequently, the proportion of more-responsive owner
types among sellers is indicative of these neighborhood characteristics. As these character-
istics become more visible to all market participants, home prices will adjust towards the
true property value. Hence, appreciation during an ownership period will be correlated with
the composition of sellers at the time the house was purchased. Second, this effect will
be stronger for houses with a high neighborhood-β, since their value is more dependent on
neighborhood factors. Third, more informed buyers should obtain higher appreciation on av-
erage, because they are able to select better houses among the heterogeneous pool of houses
on sale. Fourth, the appreciation obtained by more informed buyers should be less sensitive
to hard-to-observe neighborhood characteristics (and hence seller composition) than that of
less informed buyers. Informed buyers select which house to buy based on their combined
information about both the structure and the neighborhood. Therefore they trade them off
in a way that less-informed buyers do not: conditional of buying from a worse neighbor-
hood, they are more selective on the structure, which reduces the effect of neighborhood
characteristics on the value of the houses they buy.


                                              3
    We test these predictions empirically using nearly 20 years of transaction-level house price
data from Los Angeles county, covering about 1.5 million property sales. We first document
that average neighborhood price appreciation correlates with changes in the composition
of sellers as predicted by the model. We focus on three measures of the composition of
sellers. First, we argue that real estate professionals should be particularly well informed
about changes in the quality of their neighborhood. Using data on the universe of real estate
licenses issued by the California Department of Real Estate, we find that a one standard
deviation increase in the share of real estate professionals amongst sellers in a neighborhood
predicts a decline in future annual neighborhood appreciation of 13 basis points. Second, we
argue that owners of houses whose value is more affected by neighborhood characteristics
(higher neighborhood-β houses) should respond more elastically to changes in neighborhood
characteristics, as the value of their house is more affected when the neighborhood changes.
Since neighborhood characteristics are primarily capitalized in the land component of a
property’s value, we propose the share of land in the total property value assigned by the
tax assessor as a proxy for the property’s neighborhood-β. We verify this by showing that the
prices of properties with a larger land share do in fact respond more to changes in average
neighborhood prices. Consistent with the model we find that a one standard deviation
increase in the average neighborhood-β of houses sold in a neighborhood is predictive of
future neighborhood-level price declines of 75 basis points annually. Finally, we argue that
longer-tenure residents are less elastic in their decision to move, and show that a one standard
deviation increase in the share of sellers who have only recently moved to the neighborhood
predicts neighborhood price declines of 47 basis points annually.
    In addition to determining the impact of seller composition on neighborhood level house
price changes, we also test directly whether seller composition is correlated with observable
changes in neighborhood characteristics. Using data from the California Department of Ed-
ucation and the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, we show that the share of socioeconomically
disadvantaged students in local schools as well as the average income and racial composi-
tion of new home buyers moves with our three measure of the composition of sellers in a
neighborhood in a way that is consistent with the model predictions. We also show that the
impact of changes in seller composition on subsequent price changes is indeed significantly
larger for houses with a higher neighborhood-β.
    While this evidence is highly consistent with the importance of asymmetric information
about neighborhood characteristics in housing markets, the significant autocorrelation of
house price change means that a relationship between seller characteristics and subsequent
return is by itself insufficient evidence for the presence of asymmetric information. For ex-
ample, it could be that all market participants are equally aware of future neighborhood


                                               4
level price declines, but more responsive owners react more strongly to them. To rule out
such alternative explanations, we control for past neighborhood level price changes in our
regressions, to remove the commonly predictable component of house price changes. Our es-
timated correlation between seller composition and subsequent house price changes remains
unchanged. In addition, we also consider how house appreciation varies with the charac-
teristics of the buyer, and argue that these findings are uniquely explained by information
asymmetries.
    We find that real estate agents purchase houses that experience almost a full percentage
point higher subsequent capital gains. We also identify a second set of buyers who are
likely to be better informed about neighborhood characteristics. Specifically, using the geo-
coded address of all transacted properties combined with the identity of the transactors,
we identify buyers who previously owned a house relatively close to the property they are
purchasing. We argue that these buyers are likely to be better informed about neighborhood
characteristics, and find that they indeed purchase houses that experience above-average
subsequent capital gains. This is hard to reconcile with an explanation in which all agents
are equally informed. Crucially, we also show that the impact of seller composition on
price appreciation is smaller for houses bought by real estate agents and for houses bought
by individuals who have previously lived closer to the house they are purchasing. This is
consistent with the model’s prediction that the capital gains of more informed buyers should
be less sensitive to hard-to-observe neighborhood characteristics than that of less informed
ones. Models of price predictability for reasons other than asymmetric information do not
generate these predictions.
    Asymmetric information in real estate markets has been considered in a number of differ-
ent settings. Garmaise and Moskowitz (2004) examine the importance of asymmetric infor-
mation about property values in commercial real estate markets. They use regional variation
in the quality of tax assessments to proxy for the importance of private information and show
that properties with less informative assessments attract more local buyers whose geographic
proximity allows them to obtain a better valuation of the property. Stroebel (2013) shows
that lenders differ in their information about the true quality of houses used as mortgage
collateral, and use this to subject less informed lenders to adverse selection on collateral
quality. Levitt and Syverson (2008) analyze the interaction between a home seller and her
real estate agent who has better information about the value of the house. They show that
agents exploit this information asymmetry to advise homeowners to sell too quickly relative
to when agents sell their own home. Bayer et al. (2011) analyze the roles of speculators
and middlemen in real estate markets, but find no evidence that these agents have superior



                                             5
    information that allows them to time changes in market prices.2 Chinco and Mayer (2013)
    argue that out-of-town investors are less able to time market movements relative to local
    speculators. Cheng et al. (2013) analyze whether managers working in mortgage securitiza-
    tion were aware of the housing bubble, but find no evidence that these agents had superior
    information that allowed them to time the market. Relative to this literature, the current
    paper is the first to document that neighborhood characteristics provide a significant source
    of information asymmetry in residential real estate markets, allowing owners to time market
    movements. It also is the first with an explicit empirical focus on understanding market
    outcomes when some sellers and buyers are better informed than their peers..
        We also contribute to a large literature that has tested the predictions from trading mod-
    els with asymmetrically informed agents in markets other than real estate. One important
    set of papers analyzes correlations between the trading behavior of firm insiders and sub-
    sequent stock returns. For example, Lorie and Niederhoffer (1968) measure the predictive
    properties of insiders transactions, and find that they forecast large movements in stock
    prices. See Jaffe (1974), Finnerty (1976), Seyhun (1986, 1992), Lin and Howe (1990) and
    Coval and Moskowitz (2001) for related studies. Easley et al. (2002), Kelly and Ljungqvist
    (2012) and Choi et al. (2013) show the empirical importance of information asymmetries in
    Grossman and Stiglitz (1980)-style asset pricing models applied to the stock market. In our
    setting, we show that the share of informed and elastic sellers predicts future neighborhood-
    level capital gains, suggesting that they, too, have insider information about characteristics
    of the neighborhood. However, in real estate markets the autocorrelation in house prices
    means that a relationship between sellers’ behavior and subsequent price changes by itself is
    not sufficient evidence for asymmetric information. To rule out alternative explanations, we
    analyze unique predictions from a model of differentially informed buyers and sellers.
        On the theoretical side, the model builds on Kurlat (2012), who proposes a definition of
    competitive equilibrium for markets with asymmetric information where some buyers have
    different quality of information. We adapt this definition to to account for the indivisibility
    of houses and, importantly, extend it to cases where also sellers are heterogeneous in various
    dimensions. This theory in turn builds on the literature that, following Akerlof (1970), has
    analyzed competitive equilibria in settings with asymmetric information (Wilson, 1980; Hell-
    wig, 1987; Gale, 1992, 1996; Dubey and Geanakoplos, 2002; Guerrieri et al., 2010b). Relative

    In other settings, more informed investors have been shown to be able to time market movements to their
    advantage. Brunnermeier and Nagel (2004) conclude that hedge funds were able reduce their exposure to
    tech stocks before the dot-com bubble burst. Temin and Voth (2004) study a sophisticated investor, Hoare’s
    Bank, who successfully traded on knowledge of the South Sea bubble. Cohen et al. (2008) show that portfolio
    managers perform better on holdings of stock when they attended school with senior management or board
    members. Cohen et al. (2010) estimate that analysts outperform by up to 6.60% per year on their stock
    recommendations when they have an educational link to the company.

to this literature, the current model allows different buyers to be differentially informed. The
model also relates to the literature on markets where more- and less- informed traders coexist
(Grossman and Stiglitz, 1980; Kyle, 1985). While this literature has typically focused on
settings with a single asset or several clearly distinct assets and aggregate uncertainty about
supply and/or payoffs, here the setting is closer to the original Akerlof (1970) model, with
many heterogeneous assets but no uncertainty about aggregate variables.
    In the next section we present a new competitive equilibrium framework for analyzing
markets with heterogeneously informed buyers and sellers, which is mapped to the real
estate market in Section 2. Section 3 describes the datasets used in our empirical application.
Section 4 tests the predictions from the model, showing the significant presence of asymmetric
information about neighborhood characteristics in the residential real estate market.


1     Model
1.1    Agents and preferences
There is a unit measure of houses. Current home owners decide whether to offer their homes
for sale. If an owner stays in his house, he will derive utility

                                     u = [βθ + (1 − β) η] ε                                   (1)
                                                                       
from living in it. θ is distributed according to Fθ , with support in 0, θ̄ . It is a common shock
to all houses in a given neighborhood but takes different values in different neighborhoods. It
represents neighborhood-level factors such as school quality and crime rates. η is distributed
according to Fη , with support in [0, η̄]. It takes a different value for each house and captures
house-specific factors such as construction quality and maintenance. β is the relative weight
of neighborhood-level factors in the overall value of the property. For now assume that it is
a fixed parameter and the same for every house; heterogeneity in β across houses will play
a role later. We refer to v ≡ βθ + (1 − β) η as the total value of a house. The distribution
of v, denoted F with density f and support [0, v̄] results from the convolution of βθ and
(1 − β) η. Values of ε are distributed according to G, with support in R+ . This variable
captures idiosyncratic shocks to the quality of the match between a house its current owner,
resulting from changes in family structure or job-related relocation needs. Low values of ε
(mismatches between a house and its current owner) are the source of gains from trade. The
fact that ε enters equation (1) multiplicatively means that the potential gains from trade are
proportional to the value of the house. θ, η and ε are independent. There is a large mass
of potential buyers of houses. They all have identical preferences, and their valuation for a

                                                7
    house is equal to its total value v, i.e. ε = 1 for all potential buyers.3

    1.2    Information
    Both θ and η are private information of each house’s current owner. Buyers can be of two
    types, informed or uninformed. Uninformed buyers have no information on either θ or η for
    any house.4 This need not mean that the buyer finds all houses literally indistinguishable;
    there could be a certain amount of public information, such as each house’s number of
    bedrooms or widely known features of the neighborhood, which is already built into the
    prior distribution F . In other words, we are focusing on houses that look indistinguishable
    to uninformed buyers.
        Informed buyers receive a signal from each house, given by:

                                             s(v) = I[v ≥ b]                                            (2)

    for a house of total value v, where b > 0. This signal allows informed buyers to determine
    whether any given house is a relatively good house (v ≥ b) or a relatively bad house (v < b).
        There is a measure nU of uninformed buyers and a measure nI of uninformed buyers.
    We will focus on the case where nU is large and nI is small, i.e. there is a large number of
    potential buyers but a relatively small number (in a sense to be made precise later) of them
    are informed.


    1.3    Equilibrium
    We study a competitive equilibrium of this economy, abstracting from transactions costs and
    search frictions. We propose a notion of competitive equilibrium that respects uninformed
    buyers’ inability to tell houses apart from one another. This definition is adapted from
    Kurlat (2012), modified to account for the indivisibility of individual houses and for having
    only two types of buyers, and adjusted to allow us to analyze the role played by differentially
    informed sellers.
        Trading takes place as follows. There exists a finite set of prices P ⊆ [0, v̄] at which a
    house may trade.5 An auctioneer calls out the prices in P in descending order. At every
    price, owners decide whether to put their house on sale or not. If an owner does not put his
3
  Allowing for buyer-specific utility for each house would not affect the main predictions from the model.
4
  Extending the model to allow for an infinite number of differentially informed buyer types does not affect
  any of the model’s predictions. Please contact the authors for details.
5
  Finiteness is assumed to avoid mathematical complications but is not essential. One can think of prices
  being rounded to the nearest dollar.



                                                     8
    house on sale at price p then he withdraws from the market and cannot put it on sale at any
    price p0 < p; therefore owners’ decisions can be summarized by a reservation price.
        At every price, potential buyers must decide whether to buy a house among those on
    offer. If an uninformed buyer buys a house, he picks one at random from among the houses
    that are offered. If an informed buyer buys a house, he can be selective and only accept
    houses for which he observes s(v) = 1, i.e. only relatively good houses; he picks a house at
    random from among the relatively good houses on offer.6 Letting S(p, v) denote the supply
    of houses of value v at price p, the expected value of the house bought by uninformed and
    informed buyers respectively will be:

                                                     R v̄
                                                            vS (p, v) dv
                                          v̄ U (p) = R0 v̄                                                 (3)
                                                             S (p, v) dv
                                                      R v̄0
                                                            vS (p, v) dv
                                           v̄ I (p) = Rb v̄                                                (4)
                                                        b
                                                             S (p, v) dv

    as long as the denominator is positive; if the denominator in (4) is zero, then the buyer will
    not find an acceptable house at price p.
        Note that, depending on buyers’ decisions, many of the houses that are offered at any
    price p will remain unsold; some of these will perhaps be sold at lower prices. As in Gale
    (1996), we do not assume that supply equals demand at any particular price. Instead, the
    probability of trade is what clears the market at every price.
        We denote the reservation price for owners with a house of value v and idiosyncratic
    shock ε by pR (v, ε) and the probability that a house of value v sells at price p by η(p, v).

    Definition 1. A competitive equilibrium consists of:

      1. Reservation prices pR (v, ε) for every {v, ε};

      2. Measures of houses dU (p) and dI (p) demanded by uninformed and informed buyers
         respectively at each price p ∈ P ∪ ∅, with P ∪∅ dU (p) = nU and P ∪∅ dI (p) = nI ;7
                                                   P                    P


      3. Supply S(p, v) for each {p, v}.

      4. Selling probabilities η(p, v) for each {p, v};
6
 Assuming buyers always receive a random house from among the acceptable ones requires assuming that the
 relative proportions of different acceptable houses do not depend on which other buyers buy at the same
 price. A sufficient condition for this is to impose that uninformed buyers pick houses first. Kurlat (2012)
 shows that if one allows for different possible orderings, this is indeed the one that emerges in equilibrium.

  4. The probabilities of selling are consistent with agents’ decisions:

    Equation (7) says that the supply of houses of value v at price p will be equal to the
total number of owners who (i) have a house of value v, (ii) are willing to sell at price p,
i.e. have ε ≤ vp and (iii) have tried and failed to sell their house at every price higher than
p. Equation (8) is interpreted as follows: for each type of buyer, the probability of selling
a house of value v is the ratio of the demand of that buyer (provided he accepts houses of
value v) to the total supply of houses that buyer accepts. Adding up over uninformed and
informed buyers results in (8).
    Under assumptions 1-3 below, the equilibrium will be such that all trades of houses that
look indistinguishable to uninformed buyers take place at the same price p∗ . Thus, even
though the equilibrium construct allows for trading at many possible prices simultaneously,
the on-equilibrium trading behavior is actually quite simple: all houses that are observation-
ally equivalent to uninformed buyers trade at the same price, but informed buyers can pick
better houses at that price.

    Assume that dU (p∗ ) > 0 and dU (∅) > 0 (which will be true under assumptions 1 and 2

    Informed buyers instead will obtain a house with expected value

    Equations (10) and (11) imply that v̄ I (p∗ ) > p∗ so informed buyers strictly prefer buying a
    house to not buying one, and therefore dI (∅) = 0. It remains to show that they would rather
    buy at price p∗ instead of at some other price, i.e. that dI (p∗ ) = nI .

                                     S (p∗ , v) dv

        Assumption 1 says that there are sufficiently few informed buyers that they cannot buy
    all the good houses that are offered at price p∗ .
        If dI (p∗ ) = nI , then condition (8) says that the fraction of houses of quality v sold at
    price p∗ must be:
                                                dU (p∗ )           nI I(v ≥ b)

                                                                      S(p ∗ , ṽ)dṽ
                                                                  b

        In equilibrium, dU (p∗ ) must be such that η(p∗ , v) = 1 for all v ≥ b. In other words,
    uninformed buyers buy just enough houses so that all the relatively good houses are sold.
    The reason is that if they bought fewer houses than this, then some houses, including high-v
    houses, would remain unsold at price p∗ and their owners would also attempt to sell them at
    price p∗ − ; buyers would then prefer to buy at price p∗ −  instead of price p∗ and we would
    not have an equilibrium at p∗ . Conversely, if uninformed buyers bought any more houses,
    some informed buyers would not be able to buy a house because they would run out; they
8
    Equation (10) could have more than one solution. In that case, the equilibrium corresponds to the highest-
    price solution.

would therefore have an incentive to preempt this by buying at price p∗ +  and we would
not have an equilibrium at p∗ . Hence, in equilibrium it must be that

Assumption 2 formalizes the condition that the number of uninformed buyers be sufficiently
large to buy dU houses as given by equation (13). This justifies the underlying assumption
of equation (10) that uninformed buyers get no surplus and some choose not to buy. For any
v < b, the selling probability will be given by (12) and will be lower than 1, meaning that
some houses will remain unsold. The owners of those houses will offer them on sale at all
prices p ∈ [vε, p∗ ) in addition to offering them at price p∗ . Buyers, if they wanted to, could
choose to buy houses at those alternative prices. In order to establish that in equilibrium
they do not do so and trade takes place at the single price p∗ , we must verify that at any
price p < p∗ the adverse selection problem is so much more severe than at p∗ that buyers
have no incentive to buy at p.
    By (7), for p < p∗ the supply of houses of quality v at price p is
                                               p
                                S(p, v) = G               f (v) (1 − η(p∗ , v))                      (14)

Assumption 3. For any p < p∗ , v̄ U (p) − p ≤ 0.

Assumption 3 ensures that uninformed buyers do not wish to buy from the residual supply
at a lower price that by buying from the original supply at price p∗ (informed buyers would
never buy at prices below p∗ because all the houses that they would accept have been sold at
p∗ ). Assumption 3 will hold if the left tail of the distribution of house qualities is sufficiently
fat and/or the left tail of the distribution of idiosyncratic shocks for owners is sufficiently
thin that even at prices approaching 0 the adverse selection effect is strong enough to prevent
trade. If assumptions (1)-(3) hold then the equilibrium for houses that appear identical to
the least informed buyer can be characterized by:

   1. An equilibrium price given by (10).

   2. Average qualities obtained by buyer b given by (10) and (11).

   3. Selling probabilities for house quality v given by (12).

   4. Demand from uninformed buyers given by (13).

                                                       12
Notice that one significant feature of the equilibrium is that uninformed buyers cannot learn
about the quality of individual houses by observing equilibrium prices since (i) they cannot
infer the quality of house B from the price of house A because to do so would require
establishing that the houses are truly similar, which is precisely what they cannot do and
(ii) in equilibrium, all observationally equivalent houses trade at the same price anyway.
     Appendix A.1 provides an example to illustrate the features of the equilibrium as well as
the content of assumptions (1)-(3).


2     Predictions of the model
2.1    Mapping the model to the data
We assume that owners in our data have bought houses in a market that is well described
by the above model; by the time they resell their house, v has become public information,
so the sale price is v + u, where u is a mean-zero independent random variable that cap-
tures any unexpected shocks that take place during the owner’s tenure. A buyer’s expected
appreciation during his tenure is therefore v − p∗ .
    Our main object of interest in the empirical analysis will be the price appreciation expe-
rienced by different owners, which we relate to the model’s predictions for v − p∗ . One of the
main tests of the model is to see how appreciation differs across neighborhoods. We will as-
sume that within a neighborhood, θ is the same for all houses for a given period and the law
of large numbers applies with respect to η; therefore any average effects for a neighborhood
are due to shocks to θ.


2.2    Composition of sellers
Suppose that owners of houses belong to one of two possible groups, A and B, with prob-
abilities πA and πB . These two groups differ with respect to the conditional distribution of
the ε shock, which we denote by GA and GB (the unconditional distribution is still G).
                                                              ∗
Proposition 1. Suppose that GgBB(ε)
                                (ε)
                                    ≥ GgAA(ε)
                                          (ε)
                                              for every ε ≥ pv̄ . Then the proportion of sellers
who belong to group A among sellers in neighborhood j is increasing in θj .

Proof. See Appendix A
                                             ∗
Marginal sellers are those for whom ε = pv , while those with lower ε are infra-marginal.
The condition GgBB(ε)
                  (ε)
                      ≥ GgAA(ε)
                            (ε)
                                says that group B has more marginal sellers (as a fraction of
infra-marginal sellers) than group A and therefore its supply is more elastic with respect to


                                                 13
             ∗
changes in pv . Proposition 1 says that in neighborhoods that experience negative shocks,
sellers should include a relatively higher share from more elastic groups in the population,
                                                          ∗
because the more elastic groups respond to low v (high pv ) by putting their houses on sale.
The following prediction is a direct implication of Proposition 1:

Prediction 1. Group composition of sellers in a neighborhood should predict subsequent
appreciation.

    A high proportion of sellers from inelastic groups means that θ (and therefore average
v in the neighborhood) is high but this has not yet been captured in the price. When
this shock is revealed, at least in part, during the following owner’s holding period, he will
experience higher-than-average house appreciation. The model so far is agnostic regarding
which groups of owners have more or less elastic supply, so in principle any predictability of
house appreciation on the basis of the group composition of sellers can be considered evidence
in favor of the model. A stricter test of the model is to see whether high returns correlate with
a high proportion of sellers from groups where there are a priori theoretical reasons to believe
that they have more elastic supply. In the following, we consider three groups of potentially
more elastic sellers: those who are better informed about neighborhood characteristics, those
who own houses whose value changes more with neighborhood characteristics, and those who
have only recently moved to the neighborhood.

2.2.1   More and less informed sellers

The model so far has considered owners that are perfectly informed about the neighborhood
quality θ. Suppose we instead allowed some owners to be better informed than others.
In particular, assume a group of owners are informed and observe θ perfectly while others
are less informed and only observe a noisy signal x, and assume that whether an owner is
informed is independent of the realization of θ. Denote the conditional expectation of θ given
                                                          p∗
x by θ̂ (x). The informed will sell their house if ε ≤ βθ+(1−β)η while the uninformed will sell
                     p∗
theirs if ε ≤ β θ̂(x)+(1−β)η .

Proposition 2. The proportion of informed among sellers is higher in the worst neighbor-
                                                  
hood (θ = 0) than in the best neighborhood θ = θ̄

Proof. See Appendix A

   Proposition 2 says that in the lowest-θ neighborhood we should expect to see a high
proportion of informed owners among sellers, while in the best neighborhood the proportion
should be lower. Proposition (2) does not necessarily imply that the fraction of informed

                                               14
    sellers decreases monotonically with θ, but this is true for many common cases; for instance
    it is true if θ and x are Normally distributed. Overall, the logic behind Proposition 2 is that
    informed owners’ selling decisions react more strongly to θ, simply because they know about
    its realization. This leads to the following prediction:

    Prediction 1.a. The fraction of informed sellers in a neighborhood should be negatively
    associated with subsequent appreciation of houses in that neighborhood.

    2.2.2      Neighborhood-β of transacted homes

    Suppose that different houses within a neighborhood have different loadings on neighborhood
    and idiosyncratic factors so the value of a house is v = βh θ + (1 − βh ) η, where βh is different
    for different houses. Assume that the distribution of βh within a neighborhood is independent
    of the realization of the neighborhood-quality shock θ. This shock affects different houses in
    the same neighborhood differently depending on their value for βh and we would therefore
    expect the supply response to θ to depend on βh .9

    Proposition 3.

       1. Assume θ̄ ≥ η̄. Then the proportion of owners who choose to sell is increasing in βh in
          the worst neighborhood (θ = 0) and decreasing in βh in the best neighborhood (θ = θ̄).

       2. The proportion of owners who choose to sell in a neighborhood of quality θ does not
          change with θ for houses with βh = 0 and decreases with θ for houses with βh = 1.

    Proof. See Appendix A

       A neighborhood-level shock has a larger impact on high-βh houses than on low-βh houses.
    Therefore, high-βh owners will put their house on the market in response to low θ (or with-
    draw them from the market in response to high θ) to a greater extent than low-βh owners.
9
    In general, changing the weights on θ and η means that the distribution of v, and therefore possibly the
    equilibrium price, will be different for houses of different βh . One case where this does not happen is if
    house-specific and neighborhood-level shocks are drawn from the same distribution (i.e. Fθ = Fη ) and we
    only consider local deviations of βh around βh = 12 . In this case,

The comparison is unambiguous for the extreme cases of comparing βh = 0 and βh = 1,
or for comparing the propensity to sell in the best and worst neighborhoods. With more
assumptions about distributions it is possible to make stronger statements. For instance,
                                                           2
if ε ∼ U [a, 1], η ∼ U [0, η̄], θ < η̄ and β = 0.5, then d Pr[Sell|θ,β]
                                                             dθdβ
                                                                        < 0. This says that for
uniform distributions, as long as the weight of neighborhood and structure factors in the
total value of the house is close to even, then one can ensure that the effect holds locally, not
just in comparing the extremes of the distribution. Overall, the logic behind Proposition 3 is
that higher-βh owners’ selling decisions react more strongly to θ. This leads to the following
prediction:

Prediction 1.b. The average neighborhood-β of houses sold in a neighborhood should be
negatively associated with subsequent appreciation of houses in that neighborhood.

2.2.3   Sellers of different tenure

A further dimension of heterogeneity among home owners is how long ago they have bought
their house; the distribution of ε could be different depending on the owner’s tenure. In
                                                  g(ε)
general, it is possible to think of reasons why G(ε)    might be either increasing or decreasing
in the owner’s tenure.
    Suppose owners receive idiosyncratic shocks every period and ε results from the sum of
all these shocks over time. This will generate three effects. First, ε will have higher variance
for long-tenure owners who have received more shocks. Other things being equal, a more
dispersed distribution means more owners are either very well or very poorly matched with
their house and thus have inelastic decisions. Second, if each period’s shocks have non-zero
mean, then the distribution of ε will shift over time. Arguably, it makes sense to assume that
the shocks are likely to have a negative mean, as owners are initially well matched with their
house and match quality tends to deteriorate thereafter. This induces a downward drift in
ε, which increases G(ε) over time, reinforcing the prediction that long-tenure owners should
have lower elasticity. Third, long tenure owners are a selected sample, since they are the ones
that chose not to sell their house in the past. The selection into non-selling eliminates the
left tail of the distribution each period, potentially introducing a positive drift, which lowers
G(ε) and possibly makes long-tenure owners more elastic. The more selective the non-seller
sample (i.e the higher the likelihood of selling the house), the stronger this countervailing
effect.
    In Appendix A.2 we work through a numerical example that suggests that long-tenure
owners are likely to have less elastic supply. This implies that when θ is high, the relatively
elastic short-tenure owners should be less likely to sell, leaving a high proportion of long-


                                               16
tenure sellers among sellers. If the example is correctly calibrated, this suggests the following
prediction:

Prediction 1.c. The proportion of long-tenure sellers in a neighborhood should be posi-
tively associated with subsequent appreciation of houses in that neighborhood.

   However, because the prediction comes from a stylized two-period model and relies on
functional form assumptions, the relative elasticity of different owner groups is ultimately
an empirical question more than an unambiguous theoretical prediction. Therefore, in our
empirical analysis we focus on whether the composition of sellers by tenure is a consistent
indicator of θ across the various specifications where the model indicates that it should be.


2.3      Differential effect by neighborhood-β
Suppose, as in section 2.2.2, that different houses within a neighborhood have different βh .
The sensitivity of house values to neighborhood level shocks will depend on each house’s βh .

Proposition 4. The response of a house’s value to a shock to the quality of its neighborhood
is increasing in βh .

Proof.

                                         v = βh θ + (1 − βh ) η
                                     2
                                    ∂ v
                                         =1>0
                                   ∂θ∂βh



Proposition 4 implies that high-βh houses appreciate more than low-βh houses after a high
neighborhood shock θ. The shock itself is unobservable, but one empirical implication of
this is that when the seller composition in a neighborhood suggests that θ is high, then one
should expect to see, not just higher subsequent appreciation overall but a disproportionate
effect on high-βh houses.

Prediction 2. Seller composition in a neighborhood should predict more subsequent ap-
preciation (in absolute value) for high-β houses.




                                               17
2.4    Differential effects by buyer information
A straightforward implication of the model is that, by being able to select better houses at
the same price, more informed buyers experience higher subsequent price appreciation.

Proposition 5. The expected value of a house conditional on being bought by an informed
buyer is higher than its expected value conditional on being bought by an uninformed buyer.

Proof. Immediate from equations (10) and (11).

Proposition 5 immediately implies the following prediction:

Prediction 3. More informed buyers should obtain higher appreciation.

A second implication of the model is that the expected appreciation of a house bought by
an informed buyer is less sensitive to the neighborhood quality than that of a house bought
by an uninformed buyers.

Proposition 6. Assume β θ̄ > b. Then, conditional on buying in a sufficiently good neigh-
borhood, the expected value of houses bought by informed and uninformed buyers is the same.

Proof. See Appendix A

    Conditional on buying a house in a neighborhood that turns out to be bad, the infor-
mation of the buyer will have a strong impact on the expected subsequent appreciation
of the house. The reason is that informed buyers will only buy high-η houses in such a
neighborhood while uninformed buyers might buy any house. In a good neighborhood, how-
ever, most houses will be acceptable to informed buyers so, conditional on buying in such
a neighborhood, they will be drawing from a sample that is not so different from the one
that uninformed buyers draw from; therefore buyer information has less impact on expected
subsequent appreciation. In the limit of a sufficiently good neighborhood, then all houses
are acceptable to all buyers and buyer information has no impact. Proposition 6 implies the
following prediction:

Prediction 4. The differential appreciation obtained by informed buyers should be nega-
tively associated with seller compositions that predict high neighborhood appreciation.

    In other words, both being bought by an informed buyer and being located in a neigh-
borhood where few of the sellers are from elastic groups should predict a high appreciation
for a given house, but the interaction of these two variables should be negative.

3    Data description
To conduct the empirical analysis, we combine a number of datasets. The first dataset
contains information on the universe of ownership-changing housing deeds in Los Angeles
county between June 1994 and the end of 2011. We observe approximately 7.15 million
deeds covering such transactions. Properties are uniquely identified via their Assessor Parcel
Number (APN). Variables in this dataset include property address (including latitude and
longitude of each property), contract date, transaction price, type of deed (e.g. Intra-Family
Transfer Deed, Warranty Deed, Foreclosure Deed) and the identity of the buyer and seller.
It also reports the amount and duration of the mortgage and the identity of the mortgage
lender. Figure 1 shows the location of each of the properties with transactions in our dataset.
From this dataset, we extract all arms-length transactions for which transaction prices reflect
the true market value of a property. This procedure, which excludes, amongst others, intra-
family transfer deeds and foreclosure deeds, is described in Appendix B. There are about
1.45 million arms-length transactions.




                                 Figure 1: Transaction Sample
Note: This map shows the location of all houses for which we observe a transaction over between June
1994 and December 2011 for the Los Angeles area.




                                                 19
         The second dataset contains the universe of residential tax-assessment records for the year
     2010. This dataset includes information on property characteristics such as construction year,
     owner-occupancy status, lot size, building size, and the number of bedrooms and bathrooms.
     The tax assessment records also include an estimate of the market value of the property in
     January 2009, split into a separate assessment for the land and the structure. This will
     be important, since the price of properties with a larger share of total value constituted
     by land should change more in response to neighborhood characteristics than the price of
     properties with a smaller land share. In other words, we propose that the land share in total
     value might be a good proxy for neighborhood-β. Section 4.1 shows empirically that this is
     indeed the case. Figure 6 in Appendix B.3 provides an example of two properties and their
     associated land share. As a check whether the relative values assigned to land and property
     by the tax assessors appear realistic, Figure 2 shows how the fraction of total value that is
     constituted by land varies across Los Angeles county. As one might expect, land is more
     valuable relative to the structure in the downtown area and near the coast. Importantly for
     our purposes, there is also significant variation in the land share measure for houses that are
     relatively close to each other (i.e. in the same “neighborhood”).
         We also use data from the California Department of Real Estate on the universe of
     real estate agent and broker licenses issued in California since 1969. We propose that such
     real estate professionals may be particularly well informed about changes in neighborhood
     characteristics relative to other buyers and sellers. We merge this license data to the housing
     transaction data using the name of the transactors reported in the property deeds. This
     allows us to identify properties that have been bought or sold by a real estate professional.
     In particular, we classify a property as having been bought or sold be a real estate professional
     if at the time of sale there was an active real estate agent or broker license issued in Los
     Angeles county to somebody of that name.10

     4.1     Measuring Neighborhood - β
     One of the key characteristics that differentiated houses in the model described in section
     1 was the neighborhood-β of the individual homes. That is, houses differed in how much
10
     This will introduce measurement error, since we misclassify people with common names to be real estate
     agents. However, this should not introduce systematic bias into our analysis other than attenuation bias. For
     houses jointly bought or sold by more than one individual (for example, by a married couple), we assign the
     property to have been bought or sold by a real estate professional if one of the transactors’ names matches
     with an active real estate agent or broker license.

     Note: This figure shows the distribution of the fraction of total property values that is made up from
     land, as reported in the assessment records. Land share in total value is increasing from green to red.

     their value varies as neighborhood characteristics change. To test the model, we must first
     determine a measure of each house’s neighborhood-β. As suggested above, neighborhood
     characteristics have a larger effect on the land value component of a property than on the
     structure value component. This is because in     Sources:
                                                            the USGS, ESRI, TANA, AND,

     structure that capitalizes neighborhood amenities (e.g. Arnott and Stiglitz, 1979; Davis and
     Heathcote, 2007; Albouy, 2009).11
         In this section we show that the land share in total value of each house as identified by
     the tax assessor is indeed a good proxy for the neighborhood-β of that house. We consider a
     zip code as the neighborhood of interest. For each pair of arms-length transactions of house i
     located in zip code n with first sale in quarter q1 and second sale in quarter q2 we calculate the
     annualized capital gain of the house between the two transactions. In addition, we measure
     average price movements in that zip code over the same period, ZipCapGainn,q1 ,q2 . We do
     this by determining the annualized change in the median transaction price. In addition,
11
     We might expect the value of the structure to also be affected in the short-run, but less so than the value of
     the land.


                                                               21
we construct a measure of the land share in total value for each house, LandSharei , by
exploiting that the assessor records provide each house with a separate valuation of the land
and the structure component. We then run the regression specified in equation (15) for all
repeat sales between June 1994 and December 2011.

CapGaini,n,q1 ,q2 = α + β1 ZipCapGainn,q1 ,q2 + β2 ZipCapGainn,q1 ,q2 × LandSharei + i (15)

    The results are presented in Table 1. In column (1) we drop the interaction between
ZipCapGain and LandShare. The coefficient on ZipCapGain shows that, reassuringly, on
average house price movements closely track movements of the zip code median price. In
column (2) we include the interaction. The positive coefficient β2 shows that houses with a
larger land share in total value move more in the direction of the market, both when prices
increase and when prices decrease. This suggests that the land share of a house is indeed
an appropriate proxy for the neighborhood-β of that house. In column (3) we only include
transaction pairs from zip codes with at least 5,000 transactions between June 1994 and and
December 2011. For those zip codes the measurement of average neighborhood level price
changes is more precise. The results are unchanged when looking at this subsample.

4.2    Changes in Seller Composition Predict Price Changes
In this section we test Prediction 1, which says that if sellers have superior information about
neighborhood characteristics, then changes in the composition of sellers in a neighborhood
should be predictive of future price changes of homes in that neighborhood. We regress the

     annualized capital gain of houses between two arms-length transactions, CapGaini,n,q1 ,q2 , on
     control variables and the composition of sellers in neighborhood n and quarter q1 . We focus
     on three measures of seller composition, suggested by Predictions 1.a., 1.b., and 1.c. respec-
     tively: (a) the fraction of sellers that are real estate professionals, and are thus particularly
     well informed about neighborhood characteristics, (b) the average land share of transacted
     houses and (c) the average time sellers have lived in their home.12 Table 2 shows summary
     statistics of the seller composition variables for two definitions of a neighborhood: a zip code
     and a 4-digit census tract. We show both the sample-wide standard deviation, as well as the
     within-neighborhood standard deviation.

     Note: This table shows summary statistics for the seller composition by quarter and neighborhood for two different definitions
     of neighborhood: zip code and 4-digit census tract. Standard deviations are shown both unconditionally and conditional on the
     particular neighborhood (i.e. showing the within-neighborhood standard deviation). The sample period for share of informed
     sellers and average seller land share is June 1994 to December 2011; for the share of sellers with tenure exceeding 3 years the
     sample period is July 1997 to December 2011.



        We then run regression 16 using different geographies as our definition of a neighborhood.
     The regression includes neighborhood fixed effects as well sales quarter pair fixed effects, to
     remove aggregate (Los Angeles-wide) market movements in house prices over time.

     Our measurement of home tenure is censored, since for sellers who initially bought a property before the
     beginning of our sample period (June 1994) we cannot observe actual tenure, but only know that it must
     have been longer than the time since the beginning of the sample. To deal with this, we define a long-tenure
     seller to be someone who moved into the neighborhood more than 3 years ago. We then consider the impact
     of the share of long-tenure sellers amongst the total population of sellers, and only look at the return between

code. Standard errors are clustered at the quarter by zip code level. Column (1) analyzes
the impact of the share of real estate agents amongst home sellers on the subsequent return
of homes without controlling for home and buyer characteristics. A one conditional standard
deviation increase in the share of sellers that are real estate professionals is associated with
a 13 basis points decline in the annualized return of houses. In column (2) we add a large set
of control variables Xi , including information on the property (age, building size, number
of bedrooms and bathrooms, information on pool and air conditioning, property type), the
buyers (whether they are married, Asian or Latino) and the mortgage financing (the loan-
to-value ratio, the mortgage duration, and whether it is a VA, FHA or jumbo mortgage).
Appendix B describes these control variables in more detail, and provides summary statis-
tics. The estimated correlation between changes in the seller composition and subsequent
returns is unchanged by the addition of these control variables. This suggests that the cor-
relation is not driven by observable differences in the composition of houses or buyers that
might confound our estimates of the impact of the composition of sellers (see Altonji et al.,
2005). This is comforting, since we argue that the correlation is driven by hard-to-observe
information that current inhabitants have about neighborhood characteristics.
    In columns (3) - (4) we consider the effect of changes in the composition of transacted
houses towards those with a higher land share in total value. We argued that an increase in
the average land share of transacted homes should predict future declines in neighborhood
prices since the owners of homes with a higher neighborhood-β should be more elastic in their
response to sell upon hard-to-observe negative neighborhood shocks. The results in column
(4) suggest that a one conditional standard deviation increase in the average land share
of houses sold is indeed associated with a 75 basis points decline in subsequent annualized
capital gains in that neighborhood.
    In columns (5) and (6) we analyze the impact of a change in the share of long-tenured
sellers. The results in column (6) suggest that a one conditional standard deviation decrease
in the share of sellers with tenure of more than three years is associated with a decline in
annualized capital gains of houses in that neighborhood by about 47 basis points. We argue
that this is consistent with owners that have only recently moved into the neighborhood being
more elastic in their decision to sell when neighborhood characteristics change. In column
(7) we jointly include all three measures of neighborhood composition. The magnitude of the
estimated contribution of each of the three measures falls somewhat, as one would expect if
each is a noisy measure of the same underlying neighborhood characteristics.
    The results presented in Table 3 suggest that the characteristics of sellers within a zip
code are correlated with subsequent neighborhood price changes. However, there might be
additional relevant information about the immediate neighborhood of a particular property

that is not reflected in the composition of all sellers in a zip code, but only in the composition
of sellers in the more immediate vicinity of a property. Table 4 reports results from regression
16 with a neighborhood being defined as a four-digit census tract. While there are 293
unique zip codes in our sample, there are 1,255 unique 4-digits census tracts. The results
in columns (1) - (3) include census tract fixed effects in addition to the sales quarter pair
fixed effects. As before, increases in the share of informed sellers and the average land share
of transacted homes predict subsequent declines in neighborhood level capital gains, while
an increase in the average tenure of sellers predicts increases in neighborhood level capital
gains. The magnitude of the estimated effect is smaller than the ones estimated at the zip
code level, probably due to more noise in the measures of seller composition and the resulting
attenuation bias. In addition, columns (4) - (6) include an interaction of zip code fixed effects
with the sales quarter pair fixed effects in addition to census tract fixed effects. This allows
the time movement of house prices to differ by zip code. Here, the identification comes from
differential variation of seller composition across census tracts within the same zip code.
Since this removes neighborhood characteristics that are common for different census tracts
within the same zip code, the estimated coefficients are unsurprisingly smaller.
    In Appendix B we provide various robustness checks to this analysis. In particular, we

tenure results are not driven by the presence of “flippers”, and that the results extend to
considering subsequent ownership periods of the house.

    One important question is why less informed home buyers do not condition their choice
of house, or at least their choice of neighborhood, on the composition of sellers if it is truly
informative about neighborhood characteristics. One reason is that in practice this infor-
mation is unavailable or extremely hard to obtain in real time. For example, it usually
takes months before deed records are updated and accessible to the public. In addition, the
bulk-level transaction-level deeds information that would be required to analyze changes in
the seller composition, is not directly provided by Los Angeles county, but only accessible
through commercial data providers at costs that are prohibitive to individual home buyers.
In addition, the very significant transaction costs in the housing market (about 6% of pur-
chase price) make this market unattractive to arbitrageurs who might have the resources to
purchase real time data access.

                                                                26
     4.3     Predictability in House Prices
     In markets like the stock market, for which we have strong theoretical and empirical reasons
     to believe that they are relatively efficient and frictionless, an uninformed marginal investor
     should not be able to predict price changes. In such markets, the fact that some traders’ be-
     havior predicts price changes constitutes strong evidence that they are better informed than
     the marginal investor. In housing markets, however, it is a well established empirical fact
     that aggregate price changes are at least somewhat predictable (see Ghysels et al., 2013, and
     the references therein). This predictability complicates the interpretation of our results up
     to now as tests for asymmetric information: finding a correlation between seller composition
     and subsequent returns is a necessary, but not a sufficient condition to detect asymmetric
     information. One alternative explanation could be that seller composition predicts appreci-
     ation because more elastic groups of owners simply respond more to commonly anticipated
     changes in neighborhood-level house prices, rather than to private information.13
         We argue in two ways that such alternative explanations that do not rely on asymmetric
     information are unable to explain our findings. First, in this section we explicitly control for
     what the literature has found to be the main source of house price predictability, by showing
     that the correlation between seller composition and subsequent returns remains unchanged
     after conditioning on past price changes. Second, in section 4.6 we provide strong evidence
     for Prediction 4, which is unique to a model with asymmetric information. These tests
     consider the interaction of buyer and seller informedness, and show that the impact of seller
     composition on subsequent returns are particularly big for houses purchased by uninformed
     buyers. This is inconsistent with a story in which seller composition is driven by price
     movements that are predictable by all market participants.
         Case and Shiller (1989, 1990) and a long subsequent literature find that house price
     appreciation in the short-run is positively serially correlated. Hence it could be that the only
     reason why the composition of sellers predicts appreciation is that elastic groups of owners
     react more strongly to changes that everyone can predict on the basis of past appreciation. If
     this were the case, then controlling for past capital gains in regression 16 should significantly
     reduce the correlation between seller composition and returns. To show that this is not the
     case, we run regression 17, where we control for past capital gains of houses in the zip code
     over the past 12 and 24 months.14
13
     Any Los Angeles-wide price predictability is already controlled for through the φq1 ,q2 fixed effects.
14
     This uses the same median sales price index as Section 4.1. Similar results are achieved when controlling for
     price changes over the past 3, 6 and 36 months. Please contact the authors for details.

     The results in Table 5 show that, indeed, past capital gains in a zip code have strong
     predictive power for future capital gains. However, importantly, the inclusion of past returns
     as a control variable does not affect the magnitude or statistical significance of the estimated
     relationship between seller composition and future returns. This suggests that the predictive
     power of seller composition for future returns is not just driven by the autocorrelation of
     returns. In other words, sellers are reacting to information beyond what is contained in past
     returns.15


     4.4     Seller Composition and Neighborhood Demographics
     So far our evidence has shown that changes in seller composition can predict the future capital
     gains of houses, and can do so over and above what would be predictable from past house
     price changes. This is a prediction from a model in which sellers are better informed and
     reacting to ongoing changes in neighborhood characteristics that are difficult for potential
     buyers to observe. In this section we test for whether changes in seller composition actually
     predict changes in neighborhood characteristics that are observable at the zip code level.
         We employ two datasets that contain information about annual zip code level demo-
     graphic information. It is important to notice that none of these datasets was available
     to home buyers at the time of purchasing the house; this means that demographic shifts
     measured in these data were not easily observable in real time. The first dataset contains
     information from the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act’s (HMDA) Loan Application Registry,
     which provides details on the near universe of mortgage application in major Metropolitan
     Statistical Areas. It includes details on the year of mortgage application, the census tract
     of the house and the applicant’s income and race. We use this data to construct an annual
     zip code level measure of (i) the share of African-American mortgage applicants and (ii) the
     average income of all mortgage applicants. We then run regression 18, where we regress
     these demographic measures on the seller composition in that year. As in Section 4.3 we
15
     Controlling for past capital gains accounts for a main source of common predictability but not necessarily
     for every possible source. In other words, the evidence in Table 5 does not rule out the possibility that,
     rather than reacting to private information, owners are reacting to other commonly-known information, not
     observable to the econometrician, that also predicts appreciation. This story, however, would not generate
     Prediction 4, i.e. the negative interaction between the effect of seller composition and buyer informedness.
     If seller composition were just a proxy for commonly known information that is not observed by the econo-
     metrician, this would not mean that the advantage of informed buyers is especially great in neighborhoods
     that are predicted to underperform.

     Note: This table shows results from regression 17. The dependent variable is the annualized capital gain of the house between
     the two sequential arms-length sales. The seller composition and the past capital gains variables are measured at the quarter
     × zip code level. All specifications include sales quarter pair fixed effects, zip code fixed effects, and control for characteristics
     of the property (property size, property age, property type, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, whether the property has
     a pool or air conditioning), characteristics of the financing (mortgage type, mortgage duration and loan-to-value ratio), and
     characteristics of the buyer (married, Asian, Latino). Standard errors are clustered at the quarter × zip code level. Columns
     (1) - (4) include sales pair where the first sale was after June 1994, columns (5) - (7) include sales pairs where the first sale was
     after June 1997. Significance Levels: ∗ (p<0.10), ∗∗ (p<0.05), ∗∗∗ (p<0.01).

     at the zip code level.

        The results are shown in Table 6. A one conditional standard deviation increase in the
     share of informed sellers is associated with a 0.2 percentage point increase in the share of
     African-American mortgage applicants (off a base of 5.7 percent), and a $1, 400 decline in
     the average income of mortgage applicants in that zip code (off a base of $123, 900). A one

     conditional standard deviation increase in the average land share of sellers is also corresponds
     to a 0.2 percentage point increase in the share of African-American mortgage applicants and
     a $2,600 decline in the average income reported in mortgage applications. A change in the
     share of short-tenured sellers is not statistically related to the share of African-American
     mortgage applicants, but a one standard deviation increase in this value corresponds to a
     $2,800 decrease in applicant income. This evidence suggests that sellers do in deed react to
     changes in neighborhood demographics which are hard to observe in real time.

         We also use a second dataset to provide us with zip code level demographic informa-
     tion. In particular, we obtain annual data from the California Department of Education
     on the demographics of the student population between 2000 and 2011 at the school level.
     From this data we construct for each zip code a student-population weighted measure of
     demographics of all schools in that zip code, and then measure the share of students that
     are classified as socioeconomically disadvantaged.17 Table 7 shows results from regression
     18 replacing ZipCode Demographicsn,y with the share of socio-economically disadvantaged
     students. The results show that a one conditional standard deviation increase in the share

     A “socioeconomically disadvantaged” student is defined as (i) a student neither of whose parents have
     received a high school diploma or (ii) a student who is eligible for the free school lunch program.



                                                                  30
     of informed sellers coincides with a 0.67 percentage point shift in the demographics of the
     student population towards socioeconomically disadvantaged students (off a base of 60%).
     Similarly, a one conditional standard deviation increase in the average land share of trans-
     acted homes corresponds to an increase in the share of socio-economically disadvantaged
     students by 0.5 percentage points. Finally, a one conditional standard deviation increase in
     the share of sellers with only a short ownership-tenure is associated with a 0.64 percentage
     point increase in the share of children that are economically disadvantaged.

         These results show that the composition of sellers in a neighborhood is indeed related
     to changes in neighborhood demographics in the way predicted by the model. While these
     demographic shifts might be hard for buyers to observe in real time (for example, because the
     relevant data is usually only released with significant delay), sellers are likely to have better
     information. As these demographic shifts become common knowledge they will be reflected
     in prices. This explains why current seller composition predicts future capital gains.18
18
     In addition, in appendix B.7 we show that current seller composition also has some predictive power for
     future demographics, over and above what is predictable using current demographics. This suggest that
     current sellers do not only have an information advantage in detecting current demographic shifts, but might
     also have an insight into predicting future demographic shifts.




                                                                    31
4.5    Importance of Neighborhood-β
In this section we consider to what extent the impact of neighborhood seller composition
varies across different houses within the same neighborhood, testing Prediction 2. Since
neighborhood amenities are capitalized in the land value of properties, we would expect the
impact of seller composition on price changes to be larger for houses with a larger land share
component in total value. To measure whether this is indeed the case, we run regression 19,
where LandSharei is the house-specific share of total value made up by land, as reported
in the assessor data. The coefficient of interest is β3 , which measures the increase in the
responsiveness of capital gains to seller composition when the house has a larger land share.

 CapGaini,n,q1 ,q2 = α + β1 × SellerCompositionn,q1 + β2 × LandSharei +                    (19)
                       β3 × SellerCompositionn,q1 × LandSharei + Xi0 β2 + ξn + φq1 ,q2 + i

The results of this regression are presented in Table 8, for neighborhoods defined as both zip
codes and 4-digit census tracts. The effect of all three measures of average seller characteris-
tics is larger for houses with a larger land share. In column (1) we can see that a move from
the 25th to the 75th percentile in the land share distribution (i.e. 47% land share to 75%
land share) increases the response of annualized capital gain to a one conditional standard
deviation increase in the share of informed sellers in a zip code by about 8 basis points. A
similar move in the land share distribution will increase the response of capital gains to an
increase in the average land share of sellers by 19 basis points (column 2). Finally, moving
from the 25th to the 75th percentile in land share distribution will increase the response of
capital gains to a one conditional standard deviation change in the share of sellers who have
lived in their house for more than 3 years by 8 basis points (column 3). Columns (4) - (6)
show similar effects when we consider a census tract to be a neighborhood.


4.6    Relative Informedness of Buyers
The model also suggests that more informed buyers should obtain higher average appreciation
(Prediction 3) and that this advantage should be especially strong conditional on buying
houses from bad neighborhoods (Prediction 4). To test these results, we construct three
measures of better-informed buyers. Our first measure presumes that real estate professionals
are more informed about the true value of houses on sale, and tests the predictions by
replacing Inf ormedBuyeri in regression 20 with a dummy variable for whether or not the

agents that are not real estate agents. This is consistent with real estate agents being better
at picking good deals from the set of homes on offer. In columns (2) - (4) we show that,
consistent with Prediction 4, the difference in the capital gain of houses purchased by real
estate agents and other individuals is particularly big in neighborhoods that are predicted
to underperform. As discussed above, the reason for this is that in good neighborhoods,
informed buyers find most houses to be a good deal, and thus behave similarly to uninformed
buyers, who cannot tell good and bad houses apart. In bad neighborhoods, however, informed
buyers use their information to only select homes that are a particularly good bargain, while
uninformed buyers continue to be unable to tell good and bad houses apart.

     have purchased or sold a different house in the same zip code in the past year. Having lived
     in the same zip code should provide buyers with better information relative to buyers who
     have not done so.19 About 5% of all houses are bought by individuals who have previously
     lived in the same zip code. The results are presented in Table 10.

         Column (1) shows that those buyers who previously owned a house in the same zip
     code purchase homes that have a 1.1 percentage point higher annual capital gain. This is
     consistent with Prediction 3. Columns (2) - (4) test Prediction 4. We can see that the
     effect of seller composition on the capital gains of houses bought by neighborhood insiders
19
     We only observe the previous location for individuals who were previous owners in a neighborhood. This
     means that we will assign a value of “0” to current buyers who have previously rented, even if they lived
     in the same neighborhood. This will downward-bias our estimate of SameZip and its interaction with the
     seller composition.



                                                                      35
     is significantly lower.
         We also generate a second, more continuous measure of buyer informedness. For those
     houses bought by people that we observe selling a house anywhere in Los Angeles county
     within 12 months of the purchase, we construct a measure of the log-distance in kilometers
     between the house they sold and the house they bought to proxy for Inf ormedBuyeri in
     regression 20.20 This variable has a mean of about 2.01, and a standard deviation of 1.48.
     We conjecture that the further these buyers previously lived from the house they are now
     purchasing, the less likely they are to have information about neighborhood trends. The
     results are presented in Table 11. The sample size is smaller than for our other regressions,
     because we do not always find a previous seller with the same name. The balance of homes
     is bought either by people who were previously renters, or by people moving from outside of
     Los Angeles county.
         Column (1) shows that buyers who previously lived further away buy houses that under-
     perform otherwise similar houses bought by people that lived closer by. This is consistent
     with agents that lived closer having superior information about characteristics of the neigh-
     borhood that allow them to pick better deals. Again, columns (2) to (4) show that the
     capital gains difference between those houses bought by neighborhood insiders and outsiders
     is particularly big in bad neighborhoods, i.e. those where the share of informed sellers and
     the average land share of sold homes is high, and the share of long-tenured sellers is lower.
         In this section we provided evidence that buyers who have had past experience in the
     same zip code, who lived closer by and who are real estate professionals purchase houses that
     subsequently outperform otherwise similar homes bought by less informed agents. Their
     superior information seems to allow them to pick better properties, though in the case of
     real estate agents they might also be better at selling the house and achieve a higher resale
     price (Levitt and Syverson, 2008). This is consistent with Prediction 3. In addition, and
     consistent with Prediction 4, this advantage is lower when the predicted neighborhood quality
     is higher. This provides further evidence for our interpretation of the correlation between
     seller composition and subsequent price changes to be driven by superior information of
     the sellers. If seller composition were just a proxy for commonly known information that
     is not observed by the econometrician, this would not explain why better informed buyers
     outperform, or why seller composition is less predictive of returns bought by more informed
     buyers.
20
     For houses bought by an individual with a name that shows up more than once as a seller in the previous
     12 months we take the distance to the geographically closest sale. The results are very similar when we pick
     the average across all observed sales.

5       Conclusion
In many markets, sellers of an asset are better informed than buyers about the true value of
the asset. In addition, there might also be information heterogeneity among both buyers and
sellers. We argue that residential real estate is an example of this type of market. Sellers
are better informed than buyers about both neighborhood characteristics and structural
attributes of a house, but among both buyers and among sellers some are better informed
than others. We propose a new theoretical framework for empirically analyzing such markets
with many heterogeneous assets and differentially informed agents. We then analyze the
universe of housing transactions in Los Angeles county between 1994 and 2011 to quantify
the impact of this type of asymmetric information on equilibrium market outcomes. We find
that changes in the seller composition towards (i) more informed sellers and (ii) sellers with
a larger supply elasticity predict subsequent price declines of houses in that neighborhood.
This effect is unaffected by the inclusion of past price changes as a control variable, and is

                                                                 37
larger for houses whose value depends more on neighborhood characteristics.
    Importantly, our model and associated equilibrium concept allows us to consider the role
of differentially informed buyers. This generates a set of additional predictions that are
unique to a model with asymmetric information, and allows us to reject alternative expla-
nations that rely on differential elasticity of reacting to commonly known information, for
example due to differential transaction costs. We find that more informed buyers buy houses
that experience higher ex post appreciation. Importantly, we also find that the correlation
between seller composition and subsequent returns is smaller for houses bought by more
informed buyers. Our findings suggest that home owners have superior information about
important neighborhood characteristics, and exploit those to time local market movements.
    It is well known that asymmetric information can severely undermine the liquidity of
markets. Many markets deal with this problem through some combination of regulations
such as laws against insider trading and contractual practices such as seller warranties. In
real estate markets, legal disclosure requirements and the involvement of real estate agents
are intended in part to mitigate the natural information advantage of sellers over buyers.
Our results suggest that there remains substantial information asymmetry, involving hard-
to-observe features of both neighborhoods and houses, that is immune to these remedies.
Furthermore, the differential information is not limited to a difference between buyers and
sellers but exists within each of these groups, which creates an advantage for those who are
more informed relative to their peers.
    While our empirical analysis focuses on the residential real estate market, the information
structure we consider is similar in other important financial markets. For example, in the
venture capital market the success of start-up firms is a combination of both the promise of
their particular industry (e.g. mobile payments, social gaming), as well as the skills of the
individual entrepreneurs. Some venture capitalists are better at identifying promising com-
panies (either in promising industries, or with skilled entrepreneurs) than others (Hochberg
et al., 2007). Since investment term sheets are usually not publicly disclosed and venture
capital investments are indivisible (i.e. it is not possible for other firms to automatically co-
invest with more informed VCs at the same terms) less informed venture capitalists cannot
learn about the value of individual companies by observing prices paid by more informed in-
vestors. Similar empirical tests could be conducted to test for the magnitude of asymmetric
information both between venture capital investors as well as between entrepreneurs.

For this example, the equilibrium price given by (10) is p∗ = 0.46, and quantities supplied
and demanded are as follows:

At p∗ , all the v = 0 houses are put on sale, but only some of the higher-quality houses (those
whose owners have a low realization of ε). Uninformed buyers buy 0.5 houses, drawn at
random. The average quality they obtain is equal to p∗ , so they are indifferent to how many
houses they buy. Since nU = 1 > 0.5, assumption 2 holds. Since b = 0.6, informed buyers
only accept houses of v = 1, and they all buy houses. Since the supply of good houses is
0.07 > nI , assumption 1 holds.

                                                 39
         The 0.5 houses bought by uninformed buyers are exactly enough so that all v = 1 houses
     are sold. Instead, some v = 0 and v = 0.5 houses remain unsold and will be offered on
     sale at prices below p∗ by owners for whom ε is sufficiently low. It remains to check that
     uninformed buyers do not prefer to buy at those prices instead of at p∗ . Figure 3 shows the
     average quality that uninformed buyers would obtain if they tried to buy at prices p < p∗ .
     In all cases, the average quality would be below the price, so these buyers cannot obtain a
     surplus. Hence, assumption 3 holds and we have an equilibrium.

      Note: This figure shows the average value of houses that owners would be willing to sell at prices below
      p∗ in the example. In all cases, the average quality is below the price so uninformed buyers would not be
      willing to buy.




     A.2      Example: Tenure and Elasticity
     Suppose an owner’s potential tenure consists of two periods. In the first period, he receives
     a shock x1 ∼ N (µ, 1) and his match-quality is ε = m(x1 ), where m(·) is any continuous
     monotonic function. Owners sell their house if ε ≤ ε∗ .21 If the owner keeps his house and
     becomes a long-tenure owner, he receives a second, independent, shock x2 ∼ N (µ, 1) in the
     second period. The match quality of a long-term owner is ε = m(x1 + x2 ). Again, he sells if
     ε ≤ ε∗ .

     Abstracting from heterogeneity in house quality.


                                                                        40
    Figure 4 shows the regions of the parameter space where each group of owners is more
elastic. Long-tenure owners are less elastic than short-tenure owners for sufficiently low ε∗
(which makes the selection effect weak) and for sufficiently low µ (which leads to a downward
drift). A low ε∗ implies a low probability of selling in the first period while a low µ leads
to higher probabilities of selling in the second period relative to the first. This makes it
possible to delimit the frontiers between the two regions in terms of the probability with
which owners sell in each of the periods, as shown in the right panel.
    In our empirical section, we divide owners into short and long tenure depending on
whether they have been in their house longer than three years. In our sample, the proportion
of owners who sell their house within three years is 0.2. For longer-tenure owners the match
between the model is less clear, since the model has a finite horizon and in reality ownership
is open-ended. However, we can compute the relative hazard rate of selling for owners who
have been in their house more or less than three years. In a two-period model, this translates
directly into a relative probability of selling. Since in our sample the selling hazard of long-
tenure owners is 1.35 times that of short-tenure owners, this would correspond to a selling
probability of 0.27. Probabilities of selling of 0.2 and 0.27 respectively, which result from
ε∗ = −0.5 and µ = −0.16 are well within the region where the long-tenure owners are
predicted to have less elastic supply.

Proposition 1. Suppose that GgBB(ε)
                                (ε)
                                    ≥ GgAA(ε)
                                          (ε)
                                              for every ε ≥ pv̄ . Then the proportion of sellers
who belong to group A among sellers in neighborhood j is increasing in θj .

Proof. Conditional on house quality v, house supply from group A and group B respectively
are                            ∗                                 ∗

The proportion of group A among sellers in a neighborhood where the neighborhood shock

                      πA|Sell (θ) = πA|Sell (βθ + (1 − β) η) dFη (η)



Taking the derivative with respect to θ and using (21):
                                                                            !

Proposition 2. The proportion of informed among sellers is higher in the worst neighbor-
                                                  
hood (θ = 0) than in the best neighborhood θ = θ̄

Proof. Given θ and η, the fraction of informed owners who choose to sell is

                                 p∗                         p∗

                                                      42
so integrating across η, the fraction of informed owners who choose to sell in a neighborhood
of quality θ is
                                                         p∗
                                             Z                   
                    Pr [Sell|θ, Informed] = G                       dFη (η)               (22)
                                                   βθ + (1 − β) η
Similarly, for uninformed sellers,
                                                                                             !

so integrating across realizations of x:
                                                                                      !
                                                                        p∗

For any non-degenerate distribution Fx|θ , 0 < θ̂ (x) < θ̄ for all x. Equations (22) and (23)
                                                                                        
then imply that Pr [Sell|0, Informed] > Pr [Sell|0, Uninformed] and Pr Sell|θ̄, Informed <
                     
Pr Sell|θ̄, Uninformed , which gives the result.

Proposition 3.    1. Assume θ̄ ≥ η̄. Then the proportion of owners who choose to sell is
    increasing in βh in the worst neighborhood (θ = 0) and decreasing in βh in the best
    neighborhood (θ = θ̄).

  2. The proportion of owners who choose to sell in a neighborhood of quality θ does not
     change with θ for houses with βh = 0 and decreases with θ for houses with βh = 1.

                                                    , so the proportion of owners of houses with
βh who sell in a neighborhood of quality θ is:

B     Empirical Appendix
B.1     Data Cleaning
Arms-length Transactions: The procedure to identify arms-length transactions follows
Stroebel (2013). We identify all deeds that contain information about arms-length transac-
tions in which both buyer and seller act in their best economic interest. This ensures that
transaction prices reflect the market value of the property. We include all deeds that are
one of the following: “Grant Deed,” “Condominium Deed,” “Individual Deed,” “Warranty
Deed,” “Joint Tenancy Deed,” “Special Warranty Deed,” “Limited Warranty Deed” and
“Corporation Deed.” This excludes intra-family transfers and foreclosures. We drop all ob-
servations that are not a Main Deed or only transfer partial interest in a property. We also
drop properties with transaction prices of less than $25,000 and more than $10,000,000.
Death of Owner: We identify those repeat sales pairs for which we observe a death of
the owners up to twelve months before the second sale (“forced moves”). The death of an
owner is identified if either (i) the seller on a deed is classified as an “estate”, “executor”,
“deceased” or “surviving joint owner” or (ii) if we observe one of the following: “Affidavit
of Death of Joint Tenant” or “Executor’s Deed.”


B.2     Control Variables
Table 5 shows summary statistics for the control variables used in the regressions. Most of
these controls are not included linearly in the regression, but by splitting them into groups
of values represented by dummy variables. This allows for a more flexible functional form.
The results are not sensitive to the exact definition of groups.
House Characteristics: Building size is controlled for by adding dummy variables for
10 equally sized groups. To control for the number of bedrooms and bathrooms, we add a
dummy variable for each possible value. We construct the age of the property by subtracting
the construction year of the house from the year of sale. Controls for age are included
by including four equally sized buckets. We include an “investment property” dummy for
properties that are identified as such in the assessor data.
Buyer and Financing Characteristics: We control for whether the buyer is a single
individual or a married couple, which is reported in the deeds data. We also control for
whether the buyer is Asian or Latino. While this information is not provided in the deeds
records, we do observe the names of the buyers. We match the surnames of buyers to
the 1000 most common Asian and Latino surnames from the 2000 U.S. Census to build
an “Asian” and “Latino” indicator variable. The loan-to-value (LTV) ratio is included by

dummy variables for mortgages with an LTV ≤ 80%, between 80% and 90%, between 90%
and 97%. and > 97%. We also control for the duration of the mortgage, and whether it is a
VA or FHA-insured mortgage.


B.3      Measuring Land Share
We calculate the share of each property’s total value made up of land from data in the tax
assessment records. In particular, tax assessors report a separate valuation of both the land
and “improvements”. Improvements include all assessable buildings and structures on the
land. Figure 6 shows an example of two neighboring homes in Los Angeles county. The
two houses sit on identically-sized lots. The southern-most house, however, has a larger
structure built on it, and thus the share of land in overall value as reported in the tax
assessment records is lower.


B.4      Robustness I: Non-random selection into observing repeat
         sales
One might be worried that the subsample of houses for which we observe a resale is not
representative of all homes in a particular neighborhood, and that such a selection might
lead us to incorrectly estimate the true correlation between seller composition and the average

     capital gain of homes in the neighborhood.22 To address such concerns, in Table 12 we show
     results from regression 16 similar to Table 3, but restrict the sample to sales pairs where
     the second sale is precipitated by a plausibly exogenous event. In particular, we only look
     at those repeat sales pairs where we observe the death of the original owners in the 12
     months preceding the resale.23 We argue that such sales are more plausibly prompted by the
     observed death than by other factors such as the value of the house. The results show that
     the correlation between neighborhood seller composition and subsequent capital gains is of
     the same magnitude in the sample of forced moves as it is in the entire sample, and even
     somewhat larger for the share of informed sellers. This suggests that selection into observing
     repeat sales does not significantly bias our estimates.
22
   For example, this might be a problem if owners who experience high idiosyncratic capital gains on their house
   are more likely to sell and thus enter our sample more often than other owners in the same neighborhood.
   If seller composition affected the probability of these idiosyncratic capital gains events, this would lead us
   to overestimate the correlation between seller composition and average house price movements.
23
   These events can be identified in the deeds data as described in Appendix B.

B.5      Robustness II: Presence of “Flippers”
One concern might be that our measure of average seller tenure does not, in fact, pick up
owners that are moving out of the neighborhood, but instead picks up the share of “flippers”
among the sellers, who buy houses to resell them quickly at a profit, often after substantial
remodeling or renovation. This could bias our results in either direction, depending on
what kinds of neighborhoods tend to attract more flippers. If flippers are more active in
overpriced neighborhoods (perhaps because they are trying to time the housing market),
then this could drive the correlation we observe in the data: high flipper activity would show
up as a larger share of sellers that have a short ownership-tenure and would predict low
subsequent appreciation.
   To rule out that this is the main driver of the observed correlation, we identify a set of
transactors that we classify as flippers, and then repeat the analysis above by only calculating
the average tenure amongst those sellers not identified as flippers. Similar to Bayer et al.
(2011), we use the fact that the deeds data records the name of buyers and sellers to classify
transactors as flippers. We apply three classification rules. Our first two rules classify an
agent as a flipper if someone with that name has engaged in at least 3 transactions over the
sample period, with more than 30% (40%) of them being bought and resold within 2 years.
Our third rule excludes all transactors that are classified as companies, since some flippers

might buy and sell homes through incorporated entities. Table 13 shows that the results are
very robust to only considering the average tenure of sellers that are not classified as flippers.

Note: This table shows results from regression ??. The dependent variable is the annualized capital gain of the house between
the two repeat sales. In column (1) tenure is measured amongst all sellers, in column (2) we exclude sellers that have more
than two transactions and at least 30% of them were resales within 2 years, in column (3) we exclude sellers with at least
two transactions of which at least 40% are resold within 2 years. In column (4) we exclude all sales by sellers identified as
companies. All specifications include sales quarter pair fixed effects, zip code fixed effects, characteristics of the property
(property size, property age, property type, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, whether the property has a pool or air
conditioning), characteristics of the financing (mortgage type, mortgage duration and loan-to-value ratio) and characteristics
of the buyer (married, Asian, Latino). Standard errors are clustered at the quarter × zip code level. Significance Levels: ∗

B.6       Robustness III: Ownership Period of Second Buyer
The model in section 1 has only two periods and assumes that all the private information is
revealed by the time a buyer sells the house. In reality, information is likely to be revealed
gradually over time. If so, then one should expect some of it to be revealed only after
the buyer has resold the house and thus affect the appreciation experienced by subsequent
owners. To test for this, we need to observe at least three arms-length transactions of the
house. We calculate the appreciation between the last two sales, as shown in Figure 7, and
determine to what degree this is predicted by the seller composition at the time of the first
sale. In other words, we run regression 25, where q1 , q2 and q3 represent the calendar quarters
of the first, second and third sale.

   CapitalGaini,n,q2 ,q3 = α + β1 SellerCompositionn,q1 + χq1 + φq2 ,q3 + ξn + Xi0 β2 + i                               (25)

Table 14 shows the results separately for samples where we allow up to fours years and up
to six years between sale one and sale two. For longer time horizons between the first and

second sale more of the initially unobservable neighborhood characteristics will have been
revealed, which leaves less scope for initial seller composition to predict additional differential
capital gain.
   We can see that following an increase in the share of informed sellers, houses in that
neighborhood continue to underperform, even during the ownership period of subsequent.
The effect is smaller the more time has passed between the first and second transaction, and
the more of the initially private information of the first owners will have been revealed and
taken into account by the second buyer. Similar effects can be seen for changes in our other
two measures of seller composition, the average land share of sold homes and the average
tenure of sellers.


B.7     Predicting Future Neighborhood Characteristics
In Tables 6 and 7 we showed that the seller composition did not only predict future capital
gains, but also contemporaneous demographic developments that might not be perfectly
observable to many buyers. In this section we test whether the seller composition in addition
predicts future demographics, controlling for current demographics and past capital gains,
as well as zip code and year fixed effects.

quarter × zip code level. All specifications include characteristics of the property (property size, property age, property type,
number of bedrooms and bathrooms, whether the property has a pool or air conditioning), characteristics of the financing
(mortgage type, mortgage duration and loan-to-value ratio) and characteristics of the first buyer (married, Asian, Latino).

future demographics in the zip code, even if not all specifications are statistically significant.
