                                          ABSTRACT

We estimate causal effects of cash-on-hand on college enrollment decisions of students from low-
income families. Using population-level, administrative data from United States income tax
returns, we exploit variation in tax refunds received in the spring of the high school senior year.
The variation in tax refunds results from the kink point between the phase-in and maximum credit
portions of the Earned Income Tax Credit schedule. The results suggest tax refunds received in
the spring of the high school senior year have meaningful effects on college enrollment.

1. Introduction
        How does cash-on-hand affect college enrollment decisions of students from low-
income families? Motivated by the private and social benefits of college education and
the differences in college enrollment rates between students from higher and lower
income families, a significant body of prior research has examined the impacts of family
income on college enrollment. 1 While this research has demonstrated that additional
family income can have meaningful impacts on college enrollment decisions, it is still
unclear if additional cash transfers at the time of college enrollment decisions can also
have meaningful impacts on college enrollment decisions. On the one hand, students may
face up-front, out-of-pocket college enrollment costs, and these costs may represent a
barrier to entry for students from low-income families. In this case, additional cash-on-
hand at the time of college enrollment decisions may have positive impacts on college
enrollment rates for students from low-income families. On the other hand, college
preparedness and preferences for college enrollment may be entirely determined prior to
the time of college enrollment decisions. In this case, additional cash-on-hand at the time
of college enrollment decisions may have no impacts on these decisions. Quantifying the
causal effects of cash-on-hand is challenging because students from households with
more cash-on-hand may also have higher income, higher ability and longer planning
horizons, or higher college preparedness, and each of these factors could obscure the
causal impacts of additional cash-on-hand.
        In this paper, we implement a novel research design to estimate the effects of
cash-on-hand on college enrollment decisions of students from low-income families. To
study the effects of cash-on-hand at the time of college enrollment decisions, we exploit
quasi-experimental variation in tax refunds received during the spring of the high school
senior year. The quasi-experimental variation in tax refunds arises from policy
nonlinearities in the tax code, or more specifically, from nonlinearities in the benefit
schedules for the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and the Child Tax Credit (CTC).
These nonlinearities cause observationally similar households to receive different
amounts of tax refunds at a time when high school senior dependents are making college

enrollment decisions. More formally, we use population-level administrative tax data,
and we implement a Regression Kink Design (RKD) to relate changes in tax refunds at
kink points in the EITC and CTC benefit schedules to changes in enrollment rates around
these kink points.
        The results indicate that an additional $1000 from tax refunds that arrive in the
spring of the high school senior year increases college enrollment by roughly 0.50
percentage points. This result is based on our analysis sample around the first kink point
in the EITC benefit schedule. In this sample, average pre-tax income is about $11000, the
average tax refund is about $5000 and enrollment is about 21%. Further analysis
indicates some additional results. First, we find effects of cash-on-hand from tax refunds
received in the spring of the high school senior year, but not from tax refunds received in
spring of the high school junior year. This indicates that the timing of the additional
income may be important. Second, we find evidence of enrollment effects that are
persistent up through 4 years after the high school senior year. This indicates that
additional cash-on-hand in the spring of the high school senior year leads to new
enrollments as opposed to just earlier enrollments. These results also indicate that some
students from low-income families may use the additional cash-on-hand to enroll in 4-
year college programs. Finally, we do not find evidence of similar cash-on-hand effects
for students from higher income families where EITC benefits phase-out completely.
        The research design and results offer multiple contributions to the prior literature.
First, in the literature examining family income and college enrollment, 2 it is difficult to
find credible quasi-experimental variation in income for low-income families, and even
more difficult to find this variation in income at a time when students are making college
enrollment decisions. Our research design contributes to this literature by overcoming
these difficulties with quasi-experimental variation in tax refunds received during the
spring of the high school senior year. Moreover, this research design allows us to
examine issues related to timing of additional income, persistence in effects of cash-on-

hand from the senior year and heterogeneity in cash-on-hand effects at different points in
the income distribution.
        Second, the research design and results contribute estimates of income effects to
the literature examining how tax policies and student aid policies affect college
enrollment. 3 Previous studies generally focus on education tax credits and traditional
student aid such as grants. Such aid policies typically operate through price effects, as
they lower the relative price of college enrollment if a student enrolls in college. Building
on this literature, our findings highlight income effects from the tax refunds. While tax
refunds need not be spent on higher education, the lump-sum payments may help
households cover any out-of-pocket college costs. Our findings support the idea that
additional cash-on-hand increases college enrollment for families that benefit from the
EITC, but we do not find similar effects at higher income levels, so similar cash-on-hand
effects may not extend to other areas of the income distribution. 4 Beyond the student aid
literature, this study also builds upon earlier studies documenting how tax policies affect
child outcomes over the life-cycle. 5
        Third, this study contributes to a growing literature that develops and applies
RKD as an empirical strategy to estimate causal effects based on policy nonlinearities. 6
The analysis is based on a large sample size: nearly all high school seniors in the United
States between 2001 and 2011. This population-level administrative data allows us to

Gurgand, Lorenceau and Melonio (2011), Lochner and Monge-Naranjo (2011), and Solis (2012). These
papers primarily exploit quasi-experimental variation in enrollment-contingent student aid. Dynarski and
Scott-Clayton (2013) summarize the student aid literature and indicate that additional $1000 of student aid
increases college enrollment by roughly 2 to 4 percentage points. For evidence on the effects of education
tax credits on college enrollment, see Long (2004), Turner (2011a,b), LaLumia (2012) and Bulman and

  Recent work by Bulman and Hoxby (2015a,b) examines the impact of tax-based federal student aid over a
broader segment of the income distribution and finds no enrollment effects. Bulman and Hoxby (2015a,b)
study the American Opportunity Tax Credit and the Tuition and Fees Deduction. Unlike the EITC from the
high-school senior year, this credit provides students and their families with a benefit after they incur
college costs. This timing difference may also account for the different patterns of enrollment.

implement a research design based on slope changes around tax kink points. Since it is
unlikely that other factors change exactly at the tax kink points, this research design
offers highly credible estimates of causal effects. As RKD relies on identifying kinks in
the enrollment-income profile, it is important to distinguish between kinks and
nonlinearities in the enrollment-income function. We consider multiple strategies to
address this methodological concern. Specifically, in addition to looking at further
analyses of timing, persistence and other points in the income distribution, we also
consider placebo analyses, controlling for income polynomials and other strategies.
         This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the data, institutional
background and cross-sectional analysis. Section 3 presents the main empirical analysis
to estimate causal effects of tax refunds on college enrollment. Section 4 discusses
evidence on liquidity and informational constraints to provide some context for the
estimates presented in Section 3. Section 5 discusses the conclusions from the analysis.
2. Background & Data
2.1 The Earned Income Tax Credit and the Child Tax Credit

         The EITC is a refundable tax credit that provides benefits to low-income working
families. As the credit is refundable, taxpayers may benefit from the EITC even when
they have no tax liability. The EITC amounts are primarily determined based on tax
filing status, the number of qualifying children, and income. 7 Qualifying children for the
EITC are relatives who are under age 19 or permanently disabled and who resided with
the tax filers for at least half of the year. 8
         The EITC benefit schedule is characterized by three regions: the phase-in region
where the credit is increasing in income, the maximum credit region where the credit
value is constant in income, and the phase-out region where the credit is decreasing in
income. The value of the credit is a function of earned income and adjusted gross income
(AGI). Earned income includes wages, salaries and tips and net earnings from self-
employment. Benefits from unemployment insurance, workers compensation, food
stamps, Medicaid, TANF, SSI, social security, disability and child support do not count

7
  Eligibility for the EITC also includes a ceiling on investment income, from such sources as dividends,
rental properties etc. In 2014, the limit on investment income was $3350.
8
  Children between ages 19 and 24 can also count as qualifying children if they were full-time students for
any five months of the calendar year.

as earned income. Adjusted gross income includes total gross income for the taxpayer
minus adjustments for certain expenses. 9 As the name suggests, taxpayers must have
positive earned income to claim the EITC. Starting from no earned income, the credit is
phased in. As earned income continues to increase, taxpayers reach the maximum credit
region of the EITC schedule.
         The income variable for determining the value of EITC benefits changes at the
beginning of the phase-out portion of the schedule. The rules for determining benefits are
as follows. 10 If earned income is equal to AGI, EITC benefits are computed using earned
income. If earned income is not equal to AGI and AGI is below a phase-out earnings
threshold, then EITC benefits are computed using earned income. If earned income is not
equal to AGI and AGI is greater than or equal to the phase-out threshold, then EITC
benefits are computed using the maximum of AGI and earned income. Appendix Table 1
lists the exact phase-out AGI thresholds.
         Following these rules, we define EITC income as the income that is used to
compute EITC benefits. Figure 1A illustrates a stylized EITC benefit schedule in the
case where AGI equals earned income for a family with two dependents. The figure
highlights that the EITC benefit schedule has three kink points: EITC Kink 1 where the
phase-in portion meets the maximum benefit portion, Kink 2 where the maximum benefit
begins to phase out and Kink 3 where the credit becomes fully phased out. 11 Appendix
Table 1 lists the exact values for EITC Kink 1, and Appendix Table 2 lists the exact
values for EITC Kinks 2 and 3.
         In addition to the EITC, the Child Tax Credit (CTC) and Additional Child Tax
Credit (ACTC) offer taxpayers benefits of up to $1000 per qualifying child. These two
tax credits are effectively a single tax credit with the CTC being the non-refundable
portion and the ACTC being the refundable portion. 12 We refer to the combined CTC and
ACTC as the CTC. Like the EITC, the CTC phases in with earnings and is phased out at
higher levels of income. From 2001 through 2008, the CTC begins to phase in at EITC

   IRS Publication 596 provides the official documentation of the rules and eligibility criteria for this credit.
11
   We recognize that there is also a kink point where the credit begins to phase in. However, empirically
there are very few families with high-school seniors at this low level of income.

Kink 1 (either near the 2 qualifying children Kink 1 value in 2001-2007 or near the 1
qualifying child Kink 1 value in 2008; Appendix Table 1 lists the income thresholds at
which the CTC phases in). Unlike the EITC, qualifying children for the CTC must be
younger than age 17. As the analysis sample consist of taxpayers with high school senior
dependents who are age 17 or 18, the CTC applies only for those taxpayers in the
analysis sample who have a younger child in addition to the high school senior
dependent. Figure 1A presents an example of the CTC benefit schedule for a married
filing jointly family with two dependents in 2005.
2.2 EITC Kink 1
       Within a given year, the first EITC kink point varies only by the number of
qualifying children. Appendix Table 1 lists the specific earnings thresholds for each tax
year for the EITC as well as the earnings thresholds for the CTC. In the EITC phase-in
portion, EITC benefits increase by $0.34, $0.40 and $0.45 per dollar of earned income
based on one, two, or three or more qualifying children respectively. In some years, the
CTC begins to phase in at the first EITC kink point so that tax refunds continue to
increase as earnings increase in the maximum credit region of the EITC benefit schedule.
       To provide intuition for our RKD specification at the first EITC kink point, Figure
1B plots a simulated example of the change in tax refunds at EITC Kink 1. The figure
illustrates that tax refunds increase at a faster rate for earnings levels below the kink point
because EITC benefits increase in the phase-in region. To the right of the kink point,
EITC benefits no longer continue to phase-in since individuals are in the maximum credit
region. Intuitively, the slope of tax refunds decreases as tax refunds no longer increase at
the higher rate. In some cases, tax refunds still continue to increase to the right of the
kink because the CTC begins to phase in at a rate of $0.10 per dollar of income at the first
EITC kink point, though this credit does not apply to all families in the analysis sample.
For families without a CTC qualifying dependent (a dependent child under age 17), the
slope change in tax refunds at the first EITC kink point is roughly $0.34 because the
slope changes from $0.34 (the EITC phase-in rate) to 0. For taxpayers in the analysis
sample that have one high school senior dependent and at least one other younger child,
the CTC does apply and the slope change in tax refunds at the first EITC kink point is
roughly $0.30 because the slope changes from about $0.40 (the weighted average over

7
the EITC phase-in rates based on the fractions of taxpayers with two, or three or more
qualifying children) to roughly $0.10 (the Child Tax Credit phase-in rate).
2.3 Data
         To analyze the effect of cash on hand on college enrollment we use information
from the population of U.S. tax returns and from the Social Security Administration
(SSA). To focus on high school seniors, we create our sample by first pulling all Social
Security Numbers (SSNs) from the SSA data for individuals who are 17 or 18 during the
years 2001 to 2011. For these observations, we assign high school cohorts based on the
month and year of birth. In each year, the cohort of high school seniors is defined as
individuals who were 18 as of December 31 and who were born in September through
December and individuals who were 17 as of December 31 and who were born in
January through August. In aggregate, this approach matches well to the number of high
school seniors reported by the Department of Education. For example, for 2007 the U.S.
Department of Education reports a total of 4.21 million high school seniors, whereas we
find 4.09 million in the tax data. 13 Next, we look for tax returns that claim these
individuals as dependents during the sample period, retaining information on family
structure (married, number of dependents) and income from the 1040 tax form. Given
our focus on tax returns claiming high school seniors, we restrict the sample to returns
that file as either head of household or married filing jointly. 14
         To measure college enrollment, we use the 1098-T tax form. To remain eligible
for Title IV federal student aid, schools are required to send a 1098-T form to nearly all
students, and to the IRS. 15 Chetty et al (2011) and Chetty, Friedman and Rockoff

13
   This approach may misclassify some individuals. In particular, since we do not have data directly from
schools on their senior students, their graduation and subsequent enrollment, our ability to specifically
identify high school seniors, on-time high school graduation, and college enrollment may be limited in the
tax data. However, such misclassification is not likely to be problematic for our specifications. In the RKD
case, as long as this misclassification does not vary across the EITC kink point we examine, this will not
have an effect on our estimates. Intuitively, measurement error in defining the senior year may impact the
average enrollment rate but should not have a differential effect on the slope of the enrollment profile at the
tax kink. Further, we find evidence that the age profile is smooth through the tax kinks. For the difference
in difference analysis, as long as the misclassification is constant across the different family structures
affected by the policy change, then the measurement error will be differenced out.
14
   There are relatively few married filing separate or qualifying widower returns claiming a high school
senior.
15
   This form is used to verify educational expenses for certain tax-based aid programs. Exceptions to the
1098-T filing rule include: courses for which no credit is earned; nonresident alien students; and students
whose qualified tuition is covered by a formal billing arrangement between the institution and the student’s

8
(2013a,b) also use the 1098-T to measure college enrollment. Chetty et al (2011) find that
enrollment from as measured by the 1098-T form is comparable to enrollment reported in
other data including the Current Population Survey and the U.S. Department of
Education.
2.4 Analysis Sample
         To construct the analysis sample we include individuals that are -$6000 to
+$3000 (in earned/EITC income) around the first EITC kink point. We restrict to at most
+$3000 to avoid interactions with the second kink point. Additionally, we exclude high
school seniors who died at any time between 2001 and 2012, late-filed tax returns (so we
can ensure that the tax refunds are received in the spring of the high school senior year
and not later), taxpayers with any self-employment income, and taxpayers with more than
a $1000 difference between W2 earnings and total earned income. We impose the non-
W2 income restrictions because many non-W2 income sources cannot be third party
verified. Previous studies (see Saez 2010 and Chetty, Friedman and Saez 2012) highlight
evidence of individuals with these income sources sorting along the tax schedule, which
violates the identifying assumptions behind the RKD approach Card, Lee, Pei and Weber
(2015). We also remove a small number of returns that are likely to have errors in key
income measures. 16
         Table 1 shows summary statistics for the analysis sample. The EITC Kink 1
sample consists of roughly 1.4 million high school seniors between 2001 and 2011.
Mean enrollment for this sample is roughly 21 percent, suggesting that as many as four
out of five children from these families do not attend college in the fall after their senior
year. Roughly one in five families are married, with the remainder coming from single-
parent households, of which nearly all are female headed families. On average, there are
1.7 children per family, so that many families in the sample benefit from both the EITC
and the CTC. These tax refunds help boost income to $16,200 on average after taxes,
compared to just over $11,300 of pre-tax income.

employer. As a check we also verify that our enrollment results do not change when we use data from the
universe of Pell grant recipients, including those with Pell grants that cover all of their education costs who
may not receive a F1098-T form.
16
   We also exclude taxpayers with large differences between taxpayer entered values and computer verified
values for total income, AGI, tax refunds and EITC benefits. Specifically, taxpayers with differences of
more than $100 in total income, AGI or tax refunds, and differences of more than $10 in EITC benefits, are
excluded.

3. Empirical Analysis
3.1 Regression Kink Design
        To identify the impact of cash-on-hand on college enrollment near the first EITC
kink point we use a fuzzy regression kink design. 17 This approach relates the change in
the slope of the enrollment function to the change in slope of tax refunds at the tax kink
point. To implement the fuzzy RKD, we estimate both the change in the enrollment-
income profile and the tax refund-income profile at EITC Kink 1. The estimate of the
impact of cash-on-hand on college enrollment is the ratio of these slope changes at the
tax kink point. We compute earned income relative to that kink point, denoted by
kinkdist. This measure allows us to pool the data across groups to estimate changes in the
slopes of enrollment and after-tax income at each kink point. We exploit differences in
the location of these kink points across groups in the placebo tests.
        Following Card, Lee, Pei and Weber (2015) and Nielsen et al (2010), we consider
the following constant-effect, additive model to examine the effects of refunds on college
enrollment,
                           𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑖 = 𝛽𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑖 + 𝑔(𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑖 ) + 𝜀𝑖 .
The subscript i refers to the individual who is a high school senior. The variable enrolli is
an indicator equal to one if individual i enrolls in college in the year after his or her high
school senior year. The variables refundi and kinkdisti are based on tax returns filed in the
spring of individual i’s senior year on which individual i is claimed as a dependent. The
refundi variable measures the tax refund and kinkdisti measures the distance ($2011)
relative to the specified kink point. The function g(.) is a continuous function. The tax
refund function, refundi=refund(kinkdisti), is assumed to be a continuous and
deterministic function of earnings (equivalently of earnings relative to the kink point)
with a slope change at the kink point (i.e. at kinkdist=0). If g(.) and E(ε|kinkdist=k) have


17
  Even though the tax refund function is deterministic we use a fuzzy RKD rather than a sharp RKD. The
fuzzy approach allows us to empirically estimate the change in slope of tax refunds and show that it
matches the statutory slope change. The trade-off of using the fuzzy RKD in place of the sharp RKD is a
potential loss of precision. As a result, implementing the fuzzy RKD should result in relatively more
conservative inferences about the impact of tax refunds on enrollment, compared to using a sharp RKD
specification.

The numerator of this expression captures the change in the slope of the conditional

                𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑖 = 𝛾𝛾𝛾𝛾𝛾𝛾𝛾𝛾𝑡𝑖 + 𝛿 𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 𝐷𝑖 ∗ 𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑖 + 𝛾2 𝑋𝑖 + 𝑣𝑖 .
where Di is an indicator variable equal to one if earnings fall below the kink point, i.e.
𝐷𝑖 = 1(𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑖 < 0). The variable X denotes a vector of covariates included in the
regressions. The fuzzy RKD estimator is then given by
                                                     𝛿� 𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒
                                              𝛽̂ =             .
                                                       �
                                                     𝛿 𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟
         The vector of covariates includes dummies for year, filing status, and number of
kids. Intuitively, the coefficient 𝛽̂ reflects the impacts on enrollment of additional cash-
on-hand coming from increases in tax refunds, or equivalently from increases in after-tax
income, in the spring of the high school senior year.
         When estimating these enrollment and refund regressions for Kink 1, we choose a
baseline bandwidth of (-$6000,+$3000) around the kink point, which is the largest
possible bandwidth that does not overlap with any other tax kink points. 18 The large
bandwidth also allows us to account for nonlinearity in the enrollment-income profile that
is separate from discontinuous changes at the tax kink point. While it is possible to use
different bandwidths for the numerator and denominator, we present results based on
using the same bandwidths for the enrollment and after-tax income regressions. In this

18
  The choice of -$6000 is motivated by choosing a lower bound that does not get too close to the zero
earned income threshold; since the lowest value of EITC Kink 1 is $7140 in 2001, a distance of -$6000
relative to this kink point is just slightly above the zero earnings threshold. The choice of the +$3000 is
motivated by choosing the highest bound that does not reach the beginning of the phase-out region (i.e. the
lowest value of EITC Kink 2, see Appendix Tables 2 and 3 for key EITC points).

case we estimate the fuzzy RKD using an instrumental variables approach based on
estimating the following regression
                              𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑖 = 𝛽𝑟𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑖 + 𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑡𝑖 + 𝜀𝑖
in which we instrument for tax refunds using the interaction 𝐷𝑖 ∗ 𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑖 .
3.2 Regression Kink Estimates
        Figure 2 presents the main graphical evidence for the regression kink analysis.
Figure 2A plots tax refunds against earnings relative to the kink point, and Figure 2B
plots enrollment against earnings relative to the kink point. We construct these plots by
computing average tax refunds and enrollment rates within $100 bins of income relative
to the respective kink points. We generate the fitted values by using the individual-level
data and regressing the enrollment indicator on kinkdisti and kinkdisti*Di. We then plot
the average of the fitted values in each $100 bin of income relative to the kink. Note that
while we bin the data in $100 increments for the figures, the estimated slopes in the
figures correspond to regression output from underlying individual-level data. Figure 2A
highlights a kink in tax refunds at the first EITC kink point and Figure 2B shows a slope
change in enrollment rates at the same kink point.
        Table 2 presents the quantitative results corresponding to the graphical evidence
in Figure 2. The estimated slope change in enrollment is -0.15 and the first stage change
in the slope of after-tax income (tax refunds) is -0.34. Using the IV specification to
estimate the ratio of these two coefficients, the RKD estimates indicate that a $1000
increase in after-tax income (tax refunds) causes roughly a 0.45 percentage point increase
in college enrollment. We get similar results when we consider enrollment that is at least
half-time, with an IV result that is 0.42 percentage points per $1,000. 19 We find similar
results for 1 and 2 child households separately, though in each case the standard errors
are sufficiently large that we cannot rule out zero effects. Note that the income point
corresponding to Kink 1 varies across 1 child and 2 child cases so that the separate results
suggest that there is an enrollment kink for each group at the same location as the tax
kink point but that the enrollment kink point occurs at different income levels. We return
to this point below in the robustness checks, where we show that there is no

  We are not able to perfectly observe enrollment intensity, as the F1098-T form indicates only whether
enrollment is at least-half time or not.

12
corresponding kink for the alternate case (i.e. there is no enrollment kink among 1 child
families at the income level corresponding to the kink for 2 children families).
3.3 Evidence on the Identifying Assumptions
         Identification with the RKD methodology requires that (1) taxpayers do not sort
along the tax schedule and that (2) other covariates do no change in the tax kink points.
This section presents evidence that both of these key assumptions hold at the first EITC
kink point.
         To study sorting along the tax schedule, we examine frequencies of taxpayers
around the kink point. Figure 2C presents plots of the frequencies of taxpayers around
EITC Kink 1. Prior to our sample restrictions (i.e. when we include all tax returns around
the first EITC kink point), we find significant evidence of bunching around the kink
point. This is consistent with previous evidence in the income tax literature (see Saez
2010 and Chetty et al 2013). After excluding individuals with self-employment earnings
or other non-third party verified income, as well as individuals with more than a $1000
difference between earned income and AGI, we find no evidence of sorting along the tax
schedule in the sample. 20
         To examine if any covariates change at the tax kink point, we regress enrollment
on a set of covariates, obtain predicted enrollment values, and then test for a kink in
predicted enrollment using the above RKD regression specifications. Intuitively, if the
aggregate effect of the covariates in our specification has a kink at the tax kink point,
then the predicted enrollment values will also have a kink. 21 However, as none of the
covariates are expected to change at the tax kink point, we can verify that there is no
evidence for a kink in the covariate predicted enrollment rates. In addition to dummies
for year, filing status and number of kids, we also include linear controls for senior year




20
   We follow Card, Lee, Pei and Weber (2015) and formally test for a kink in the frequencies by estimating
a series of polynomial models using the binned frequencies. The polynomial models allow the first and
higher order derivatives to change at the kink point, and we test for a kink in the frequencies based on
whether or not there is a statistically significant change in the linear piece of the polynomial at the kink
point. Overall, the frequencies appear smooth.
21
   Note that it is possible for the aggregate effect of the controls to be smooth through the kink while the
individual controls have offsetting kinks. We do not find any evidence for this possibility. Instead, we find
no evidence that each control has a kink. We use the predicted enrollment measure as a convenient way to
summarize this overall finding.

13
income and junior year income (i.e. income in the calendar years of the start of the senior
and junior years respectively) when computing covariate predicted enrollment values.
       Figure 2D presents the graphical analysis of covariate predicted enrollment. The
plot shows that there are no detectable changes in covariate predicted enrollment when
predicting enrollment using a rich set of covariates from the tax data. Additionally, while
the tax data do not contain data on federal student aid eligibility, we have verified that
there are no specific changes in federal student aid eligibility that correspond to the
income levels of the tax kink points. Individuals in the first EITC kink sample generally
qualify for zero Expected Family Contribution and maximum Pell grants.
3.4. Robustness
       We examine the robustness of the RKD estimates in a variety of ways. First, a
natural concern may be that the RKD estimates result from a nonlinear relationship
between enrollment and earnings. However, we emphasize that the RKD estimates are
based on variation in earnings relative to EITC Kink 1 and not just variation in earnings
levels. The variation in the EITC Kink 1 values across households with different
numbers of qualifying children allows us to control for nonlinear enrollment-earnings
relationships that are not co-linear with the RKD running variable (earnings relative to
the kink). We can control for earnings polynomials that account for nonlinear
enrollment-earnings relationships that are common across households. However, our
identification strategy does not allow us to control for separate nonlinear enrollment-
earnings relationships across households with different numbers of qualifying children
because the RKD estimates are based exactly on this variation.
       We start to address the concerns about nonlinear enrollment-earnings
relationships by first plotting the empirical relationship between enrollment and earned
income for the EITC Kink 1 earnings range. Using this data, we create $100 bins of CPI-
adjusted earned income and compute mean enrollment in each bin. Figure 3 presents a
plot of mean enrollment (y-axis) for each earned income bin (x-axis). The graphical
evidence suggests perhaps a relatively linear relationship between enrollment and earned
income for this income range, or at least there does not appear to be evidence of a
downward kink similar to the reduced form evidence plotted in Figure 2B. This suggests



14
that the reduced form evidence for the RKD estimates emerges only when earned income
is re-centered relative to EITC Kink 1 for each group.
        We further address concerns about nonlinearity in the enrollment-income
relationship by explicitly accounting for this relationship when estimating the RKD
results. We find that the baseline results are robust to a number of different income
controls, including adding a 5th order polynomials in earned income and AGI, and
separately 5th order polynomials in earned income from the senior and junior years. 22
Moreover, in the controls with junior year income, we also include controls for junior
year earnings relative to EITC Kink 1 as well as an interaction between this earnings
relative to the kink and an indicator for earnings being above the junior year kink (i.e. we
include the analogous variables to kinkdisti and kinkdisti*Di based on junior year earned
income). These results are in Appendix Table 3. Overall, these findings are consistent
with the interpretation that the RKD estimates at EITC Kink 1 are not driven by
nonlinearity in the enrollment-income relationship.
        A second natural concern about the robustness of the RKD estimates at EITC
Kink 1 relates to whether the estimated slope changes in tax refunds and enrollment are
actually occurring at the statutory kink points, or if the estimated changes result from
nonlinearities and/or kink points close to EITC Kink 1. In the spirit of the permutation
test suggested by Ganong and Jaeger (2014), we implement a placebo test to address this
concern. For this analysis, we vary a placebo kink around the true kink point and verify
that the largest estimated kink in tax refunds and enrollment occurs at the true EITC kink
point. We choose a distance from the true kink point p = -4000, -3900, …, +2000 and
define a placebo kink point based on this distance, pkink = kink1 + p. Using this placebo
kink point, we define earnings relative to the placebo kink point, pkinkdisti and an
             𝑝
indicator 𝐷𝑖 = 1(𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑖 < 0). We then estimate the slope changes in tax refunds
and enrollment at the placebo kink using the following regressions,
                                              𝑝                 𝑝
       𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑖 = 𝛼1 𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑖 + 𝛼2 𝐷𝑖 + 𝛿 𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒,𝑝 [𝐷𝑖 ∗ 𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑖 ] + 𝛼2 𝑋𝑖 + 𝑢𝑖
                                              𝑝                  𝑝
      𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑖 = 𝛾1 𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑖 + 𝛾2 𝐷𝑖 + 𝛿 𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟,𝑝 [𝐷𝑖 ∗ 𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑖 ] + 𝛾2 𝑋𝑖 + 𝑣𝑖

22
  We define junior year earned income as earned income for the primary taxpayer (parent) in the year prior
to the dependent’s high school senior year. Because data for some information returns is only consistently
available in 2001 onwards, we cannot track parents of the 2001 high school senior cohort to prior years.
Thus, when including junior year income controls, the estimates are only based on the 2002-2011 cohorts.

15
We then plot the estimated slope changes, 𝛿 𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒,𝑝 and 𝛿 𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟,𝑝 , for each of the placebo
kink points p = -4000, -3900, …, +2000 and verify that the highest estimated slope
changes occurs at the true kink point.
       Figure 4 presents the estimated slope changes when varying the placebo kink
points in $100 increments around the true EITC kink points. Figure 4A presents the
estimated placebo slope changes for tax refunds, and Figure 4B presents the estimated
slope changes for enrollment. The plots highlight that for tax refunds and enrollment, the
largest estimated kink points seem to occur at Kink 1. This is consistent with the
assumption that the RK estimates result from the kink in tax refunds at the statutory kink
point, and not from a spurious nonlinear relationship between enrollment and earnings
relative to the group-specific kink point.
       We also examine the robustness of the RKD estimates at EITC Kink 1 in
relationship to (1) additional control variables and alternative sample restrictions, (2)
alternative bandwidths, (3) and alternative clustering of the standard errors. The results
are presented in Appendix Tables 4, 5, and 6 respectively. In general, the baseline
estimate appear robust to these changes. Finally, Appendix Table 7 presents estimates
based on including quadratic and cubic function of the running variable. Specifically, we
estimate regressions of the following form for the first stage and reduced form (the IV
specification is analogous):
           𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑖 = 𝛼𝛼(𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑡𝑖 ) + 𝛿 𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒 𝐷𝑖 ∗ 𝑔(𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑖 ) + 𝛼2 𝑋𝑖 + 𝑢𝑖
          𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑖 = 𝛾𝛾(𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑡𝑖 ) + 𝛿 𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 𝐷𝑖 ∗ 𝑔(𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑖 ) + 𝛾2 𝑋𝑖 + 𝑣𝑖 .
where g(.) denotes a linear function (baseline), a quadratic function, or a cubic function.
In general, the standard errors for all of the estimates increase as we move from the linear
function of the running variable to the quadratic and cubic functions. The first stage
results are essentially unchanged. With the quadratic function, the reduced form results
continue to indicate a statistically significant downward kink in enrollment at EITC Kink
1. Consistent with the reduced form, the IV estimates in the quadratic case indicate a
statistically significant impact of cash-on-hand on enrollment, but the standard errors are
large enough so that the baseline estimate from the linear case (0.45) is included within
the 95% confidence interval. In the cubic case, we do not detect any statistically impacts



16
of cash-on-hand on enrollment as the standard errors are more than double the standard
errors in the quadratic case.
3.5 Timing of Income and Enrollment
         Our baseline results relate tax refunds in the high school senior year to college
enrollment the next year. To determine the relative importance of the timing of tax
refund payments, we examine whether tax refunds in the spring of the high school junior
year also affect college enrollment. For this analysis, we replicate the RKD based on
income in the high school junior year. In particular, we draw the sample of returns that
are around the first EITC kink point in the high school junior year. 23 Thus, with this
junior year sample, the first stage is based on the slope change in tax refunds at EITC
Kink 1 in the junior year.
         Table 3 presents regression kink estimates for both the junior and senior EITC
Kink 1 samples. 24 In both samples, we test for kinks in tax refunds in the junior year and
senior year. Thus, we verify that in the junior year K1 sample, we find a kink in tax
refunds in the junior year and not in the senior year, and similarly for the senior year K1
sample, we find a kink in refunds in the senior year and not the junior year. The reduced
form column highlights the main results for these samples: there does not appear to be
any evidence of a kink in enrollment based on junior year earnings relative to EITC Kink
1. Thus, the estimates indicate that changes in tax refunds in the high school senior year
affect college enrollment, but changes in tax refunds in the high school junior year do
not.
         We next examine the persistence of the enrollment effects from tax refunds
received in the spring of the high school senior year by estimating the on enrollment in
later years. On the one hand, if enrollment decisions just after high school are persistent
then we expect that there would be a kink in college enrollment rates in later years. On
the other hand, if enrollment decisions are not persistent so that some individuals who

23
   Similar to the analysis based on tax returns from the high school senior year, we examine evidence on the
identifying assumptions for the regression kink analysis in the high school junior year, and we verify (1)
that taxpayers do not sort along the tax schedule in the junior year and (2) that there is no kink in covariate
predicated enrollment.
24
   The senior year K1 sample used in Table 3 is not identical to the baseline EITC K1 sample because it
only includes cohorts 2002-2011, whereas the baseline sample includes the 2001 cohort. Because some
data for parent taxpayers is only available from 2001 onward, we cannot compute junior year earned
income for the 2001 cohort.

17
were enrolled drop out and others who were not enrolled become enrolled, then we would
not expect to find evidence of a kink in enrollment two years after the high school senior
year.
         We estimate the impacts of tax refunds in the spring of the senior year on these
additional enrollment outcomes by estimating separate regressions for each year after the
high school senior year. 25 Figure 5A presents the IV estimates of the impacts of tax
refunds in the spring of the high school senior year on enrollment in each year after the
high school senior year. The baseline RKD estimate from Table 2 corresponds to the
estimate shown at 1 year after the senior year. While the standard errors are sufficiently
large that many of the estimates may not be statistically different from 0 or from each
other, we focus on the pattern of the point estimates. The point estimates suggest a
positive effect in each of the first four years, consistent with the interpretation of
increased enrollment and persistence at four-year colleges. To put the estimates from
Figure 5A into context, Figure 5B plots mean enrollment for each year after high
school. 26
3.6 Heterogeneity by Geography and Prior Income
         Motivated by recent evidence that shows meaningful differences in
intergenerational mobility across geographic locations in the United States (Chetty,
Hendren, Kline and Saez 2014), we examine geographic heterogeneity in enrollment. 27
Figure 6 illustrates a heat map of county-level enrollment rates for high school seniors in
the 2001 cohort. 28 This map is based on the full population of high school seniors in the


25
   We note that, because data is available only for cohorts 2001-2012, this analysis drops one cohort for
each additional year after the high school senior year. For example, we can use cohorts 2001-2011 when
looking at enrollment 1 year after high school, cohorts 2001-2010 when looking at enrollment 2 years after
high school, cohorts 2001-2009 when looking at enrollment 3 years after high school, etc.
26
   Figure 5B indicates that, 10 years after high school (i.e. at age 27 and 28), enrollment is at roughly 13%.
This estimate is consistent with population estimates from the National Center for Education Statistics
(NCES) and Census:
http://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/indicator_cea.asp
http://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d14/tables/dt14_103.20.asp
http://www.census.gov/hhes/school/data/cps/2014/tables.html [Table 2]
27
   We have also examined heterogeneity across (1) urban versus rural counties and (2) high versus low
EITC bunching counties (Chetty, Friedman and Saez 2014). There did not appear to be any systematic
differences across these dimensions. These results are available upon request.
28
   For this map, we restrict the sample of counties based on the sample size with the county. Specifically,
we compute the number of high school seniors in each county in each year, and we restrict the mapped
counties to those that are in the top 75% of the sample size distribution in 2001 (i.e. those counties that

18
respective cohort, not just the seniors in the EITC Kink 1 sample, and enrollment is
measured in the year after the high school senior year. The heat map illustrates significant
geographic heterogeneity in college enrollment. Lower enrollment places have
enrollment rates below 30%, and high enrollment places have enrollment rates about
55%. The high enrollment places are concentrated in the Midwest, Northeast and
California coast. Appendix Figure 1 illustrates similar heat maps for the 2006 and 2011
high school senior cohorts, and overall, the geographic heterogeneity in enrollment
appears consistent across years.
         Using the county-level enrollment rates in each year, we calculate county-
enrollment quintiles. Specifically, in each year, we categorize counties into the top 20%
of enrollment rates, the next 20%, etc. down to the lowest 20% of enrollment rates. The
first row of Table 4 presents the average county-level enrollment rates for counties in
each quintile. Similar to the heat maps, the average county enrollment rates range from
below 30% for counties in the lowest quintile to above 60% in counties in the highest
quintile. Table 4 also presents average enrollment for seniors in the EITC Kink 1 sample
who reside in counties in each quintile. Consistent with prior literature highlighting the
importance of geographic locations in determining economic outcomes (Chetty et al 2014
and Chetty et al 2016), we note that, even conditional on being in the EITC Kink 1
sample, enrollment rates vary across the county-enrollment quintiles, ranging from below
15% in the lowest county quintile to roughly 30% in the highest county quintile.
         Below the enrollment rates, Table 4 presents the regression kink estimates for
each county-enrollment quintile. The first stage slope changes in tax refunds are
essentially identical across county-quintiles as expected. The reduced form slope
changes in enrollment vary slightly across the quintiles. Given that the IV point estimates
are all positive and of similar magnitudes, and given that the standard errors are
sufficiently large that we cannot rule out that the estimates are equal across quintiles, we
conclude that cash-on-hand effects appear to be similar for students from low-income
families in higher and lower enrollment counties.




have at least 144 high school seniors in 2001, and 144 is the 25th percentile of the sample size distribution
across counties in 2001).

19
        Next, we examine heterogeneity based on prior income to understand if cash-on-
hand effects are similar across more permanently low-income families and more
transitorily low-income families. Intuitively, cash-on-hand effects may be smaller for
transitorily low-income families since these families may be less likely to be liquidity
constrained and students from families with higher permanent income may have higher
college preparedness. For this analysis, we restrict the sample to high school senior
cohorts in 2005 through 2011 and then calculate average AGI over the 4 years prior to the
high school senior year. We also restrict the sample to taxpayers who do not have any
self-employment income in any of the four years prior to the high school senior year.
Because the income levels for EITC Kink 1 differ based on the number of EITC
qualifying children and year, we create quintiles of average AGI within groups based on
the high school senior year and the number of qualifying children. We then estimate the
RKD regression specifications within the samples defined by the average AGI quintiles. 29
        Table 5 presents the results based on average AGI in the 4 years prior to the high
school senior year. First, the full sample results verify that for this sample of high school
seniors in the 2005-2011 cohorts, we find similar cash-on-hand effects as in the baseline
EITC Kink 1 sample based on the 2001-2011 cohorts. In particular, the results in Table 5
serve as a robustness check for the baseline results in Table 2 since the sample is further
restricted to not have any self-employment income in any of the four years prior to the
high school senior year, whereas the baseline EITC Kink 1 sample only imposed a
sample restriction based on not having any self-employment income in the high school
senior year only.
        Next to the full sample results, Table 5 presents the regression kink estimates for
the lowest four prior AGI quintiles and the highest prior AGI quintile. While the lower
quintiles are roughly similar, the highest quintile is noticeably different. Specifically, in
the highest quintile, the mean of the average prior AGI is roughly $51000, which is more
than four times as large as the mean of the average prior AGI for taxpayers in the lowest
four quintiles. Furthermore, enrollment is noticeably highest for high school seniors in
the highest quintile at just under 30%, compared to roughly 20% for high school seniors


29
  Some high school seniors are missing average AGI if they were not claimed as a dependent on a filed tax
return in any of the 4 years prior to the high school senior year.

20
in the lower prior AGI quintiles. This suggests that the highest quintile consists of some
high school seniors from transitorily low-income families. The regression kink estimates
highlight that, even though the first stage kink in tax refunds is similar across these
groups, we only estimate a statistically significant kink in enrollment for the more
permanently low-income taxpayers in the lowest four prior AGI quintiles.
       Figures 7A and B present graphical evidence on the reduced forms for these two
groups. While a noticeable kink can be observed in the lowest four prior AGI quintiles,
no kink is noticeable in the highest quintile. Moreover, for the higher permanent income
sample, enrollment is higher at every level of earnings relative to the kink, and
enrollment does not appear to vary much by earnings relative to the kink. This is
consistent with enrollment being relatively uncorrelated with transitory income in the
senior year for taxpayers with higher permanent incomes. Overall, we conclude that cash-
on-hand effects appear to be significant for high school seniors from more permanently
low-income families, and these effects may not be as significant for seniors from families
with higher permanent incomes.
3.7 Effects at Higher Income Levels: EITC Kink 2 and Kink 3
       We also investigate RKDs at EITC Kinks 2 and 3. Appendix Table 2 lists the
income values for EITC Kink 2 and Kink 3. As mentioned in section 2.1, the income
measure used to determine EITC income benefits changes around EITC Kink 2. As a
result, the definition of the running variable changes around EITC Kink 2, and this rules
out the RKD at this kink point.
        Appendix Figures 2A and 2B illustrate the main issue at EITC Kink 2. For these
plots, we define EITC income as the income measure used to determine EITC benefits.
Specifically, we follow the rules discussed in Section 2.1 (and in IRS Publication 596 or
EIC Worksheet B) so that EITC income is equal to earned income when AGI is less than
the phase-out threshold, and EITC income is equal to the maximum of earned income and
AGI if AGI is above the phase-out threshold. As illustrated in Appendix Figure 2A, we
are able to empirically reproduce the EITC benefit schedule. However, even though the
EITC benefit schedule can be reproduced with this running variable, Appendix Figure 2B
demonstrates that the frequencies change discontinuously at EITC Kink 2. Intuitively,
taxpayers can only be on the maximum credit region close to EITC Kink 2 if their AGI is

21
less than the phase-out threshold and their earned income is less than EITC Kink 2. On
the other hand, taxpayers can be on the phase-out portion of the benefit schedule just
above EITC Kink 2 if their AGI is above the phase-out earnings threshold and either their
AGI or earned income puts them in the phase-out income range. Thus, there is a
discontinuous increase in the number of individuals who are in the phase-out income
range as opposed to the maximum credit income range. The discontinuous change in the
frequencies at EITC Kink 2 violates the RKD identifying assumptions and hence
invalidates the RKD at EITC Kink 2. 30
        We also estimate an RKD at Kink 3 (the point at which benefits are completely
phased out), but do not find evidence of an enrollment kink. Appendix Figure 3 illustrates
the graphical evidence on the (A) first stage, (B) reduced form, (C) frequencies and (D)
covariate prediction, and Table 6 presents the first stage, reduced form and IV regression
results. The first stage results show evidence of a slope change in tax refunds at EITC
Kink 3: below the kink point, tax refund decline relatively quickly since EITC benefits
are being phased out as AGI increases, and above the kink point, tax refunds decline
relatively slowly since EITC benefits have declined to 0 and are no longer phased out.
The regression results indicate a slope change in refunds of $0.14 per dollar of income.
Turning to the reduced form evidence, there does not appear to be evidence of a kink in
enrollment at EITC Kink 3. However, in examining the magnitude of the first stage slope
change and the standard error of the reduced form slope change, we note that there is not
sufficient statistical power in the EITC Kink 3 setting to rule out effects similar to the
EITC Kink 1 setting. We acknowledge that, given the magnitude of the first stage slope
change in the EITC Kink 3 setting, the analysis is statistically under-powered to rule out
that there are positive cash-on-hand effects that are smaller than the effects estimated at
EITC Kink 1. As shown in Appendix Table 2, EITC Kink 3 occurs at higher income
levels than EITC Kink 1, (for example, for head-of-household taxpayers with 1
qualifying child, EITC Kink 1 is at roughly $9,100 in 2011 and EITC Kink 3 is $36,052;

30
   We have also tried implementing an RKD at EITC Kink 2 using the restricted sample of individuals with
earned income equal to AGI. However, even within this restricted sample, the frequencies are not smooth at
EITC Kink 2. Some taxpayers who would have had AGI equal to earned income and been just above the
phase-out earnings threshold report adjustments so that they have AGI below the phase-out earnings
threshold and hence they qualify for maximum EITC benefits. Thus, within the restricted sample, the
frequencies illustrate missing mass just above EITC Kink 2.

22
for head-of-household taxpayers with 2 qualifying children, EITC Kink 1 is at $12,780
and EITC Kink 3 is at $40,964, so it may be reasonable to expect that cash-on-hand
effects may be smaller for households at higher income levels, and the EITC Kink 3
results are consistent with this intuition.
4. Discussion
        There are multiple reasons why tax refunds in the spring of the high school senior
year may have a meaningful effect on college enrollment. First, tax refunds for many
families in the analysis samples are large enough to have a substantive effect on college
enrollment, and they arrive in a lump sum at a time when many youths make their
enrollment decisions. Based on data from the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study
(NPSAS), Table 7 shows the distribution of annual college tuition and fees net of grant
aid by institution type and year. Based on this distribution of costs and the summary
statistics on tax refunds in Table 1, tax refunds could cover a significant portion of
overall college costs or out-of-pocket college costs, particularly at 2-year and 4-year
public colleges where students may not have room-and-board costs if they are living at
home.
        Another reason that tax refunds in the spring of the high school senior year could
be economically significant is because of credit constraints or informational constraints. 31
Even though financial aid may be widely available, we present evidence of information
asymmetry and incomplete take-up of financial aid which suggests that existing programs
may not effectively alleviate credit and information constraints for all students. Table 8
presents percentages of enrolled students who do not apply for federal student aid (e.g.
Pell grants) using NPSAS data. The evidence highlights that, at the lowest income levels
(i.e. below $40000 of income), roughly 50% to 70% of enrolled students applied for aid.
Below $40000, virtually all of the enrolled students are likely to be eligible for aid. Yet
as shown in Table 9, about 60% of low income students who do not apply for aid thought
they were ineligible. This percentage does not vary much by income levels even though
eligibility for income levels above $50000 decreases sharply with income.

Wiederspan (2013) and GAO (2012).

5. Conclusions
          We examine the impacts of cash-on-hand on college enrollment decisions. We
find evidence of meaningful effects of tax refunds received in the spring of the high
school senior year on college enrollment decisions of students from low-income families.
Regression results indicate that an additional $1000 of after-tax income in the spring of
the high school senior year increases college enrollment by roughly 0.50 percentage
points.
          Consistent with the interpretation that tax refunds in the high school senior year
relax credit constraints, we find evidence that tax refunds received in the junior year have
little to no effects on college enrollment. While many tax benefits and financial aid
programs offer aid with complicated forms or aid that arrives after individuals have
financed their college costs, our findings are based on income that arrives prior to
incurring any enrollment costs when many youths are finalizing their enrollment plans.
Providing additional family resources for college through the tax code ensures that take-
up is complete among tax filers, which may increase the effectiveness of the transfers. In
the context of student aid, it is likely that most marginal youths are from tax filing
families, 32 so that targeted tax benefits can relax binding credit constraints. Studying the
impacts of tax refunds and information on tax benefits on higher education outcomes
remains an interesting avenue for future work.

Notes: These figures plot simulated federal tax amounts that are calculated using the NBER TAXSIM calculator. Panel
A shows the EITC and CTC schedules for the case of a taxpayer with two children (one kid of age 14 and another of
17) with married filing jointly status for the year 2005. The solid line represent the EITC benefit schedule and dashed
line represents the CTC benefit schedule. Using the same case as Panel A, Panel B plots tax refunds as a function of
earnings relative to the EITC kink point. For the tax calculations, earned income is from W2 wages only, and earned
income is equal to AGI.

Notes: For Panels A and B, the circles show the mean tax refund and enrollment rate within each $100 bin of earnings relative
to the tax kink points, respectively. The solid lines show fitted values within each $100 bin of earnings relative to the kink
points. Fitted values are obtained from regressions using the individual-level data in which tax refund or an enrollment
indicator is regressed on a linear control for earnings relative to the kink point and a dummy for earnings less than the kink
point interacted with the linear control. $100 bins are assigned based on rounding earnings relative to the kink point to the
nearest $100 amount. Panel C plots the number of tax returns within $100 bins around each tax kink point. The red squares
are frequencies including the self-employed; the blue triangles are frequencies when excluding the self-employed and the
black circles are frequencies when excluding individuals with a difference between W2 wages and wages reported on the
1040 form of more than $1000. This difference is attributable to non-third party verified wages. For Panel D, the circles show
mean predicted enrollment rates within each $100 bin of earnings relative to the tax kink points. Predicted enrollment is
computed by obtaining fitted values from a regression of an enrollment indicator on dummies for calendar year, filing status,
and number of dependents and a linear control for earned income in the senior year.
               Figure 3. Enrollment by Earned Income




Notes: This plot is based on the full sample of high school seniors from 2001 through 2011 with CPI-
adjusted income in the range shown, not just the EITC Kink 1 sample. Enrollment is measured in the year
after the high school senior year, and income is based on earned income in the high school senior year.
Similar to the EITC Kink 1 sample, individuals with any self-employment income are excluded from the
sample. The circles represent mean enrollment within each $100 bins of CPI-adjusted earned income. The
solid line plots mean fitted values within each bin. The fitted values are obtained from regressing an
enrollment indicator on a linear control for earned income. The estimated intercept and slope with respect
to earned income are 18.835 are respectively (0.086) and 0.169 (0.007), where enrollment is scaled to be
either 0 or 100% and the slope with respect to earned income is scaled to be in $1000 of earned income
(standard errors are in parentheses).

Notes: These figures plot the estimated slope changes when varying the placebo kink points in $100
increments around the true EITC kink points. In particular, placebo kink = kink1+p, where p ϵ {-4000, - 3900,
…, +2000}. For each figure, the triangles show the slope change in tax refund and enrollment rate relative to
the placebo kink points. The horizontal dotted lines show the estimated slope changes at the true kink
point. Fitted slope changes are obtained from regressions using the individual-level data in which tax refund
or an enrollment indicator is regressed on a linear control for earnings relative to the placebo kink points, a
dummy for earnings less than the kink point and an interaction between the dummy variable and the linear
control. Each figure also shows dotted lines for the 95% confidence interval bands around the estimates.
Panel A shows the placebo results for the first stage and panel B shows the placebo results for the reduced
form estimation.

Notes: These ﬁgures plot heat maps of county-level enrollment rates for high school seniors in the 2001, 2006 and 2011 cohorts. Enrollment
rates are listed as the fracDon of high school seniors in the cohort who enroll in the year aFer the high school senior year. The sample of
counDes is restricted based on the sample size within the county. Speciﬁcally, we compute the number of high school seniors in each county
in each year, and we restrict the mapped counDes to those that are in the top 75% of the sample size distribuDon in 2001 (i.e. those counDes
that have at least 144 high school seniors in 2001, where 144 is the 25th percenDle of the sample size distribuDon across counDes in 2001).

Notes: The circles represent mean enrollment within each $100 bins of earnings relative to EITC Kink 1. The solid lines show
mean fitted values within each $100 bin of earnings relative to the kink points. Fitted values are obtained from regressions using
the individual-level data in which tax refund or an enrollment indicator is regressed on a linear control for earnings relative to the
kink point and a dummy for earnings less than the kink point interacted with the linear control. $100 bins are assigned based on
rounding earnings relative to the kink point to the nearest $100 amount. The sample is restricted to high school senior cohorts in
2005 through 2011 who do not have any self-employment income in any of the 4 years prior to the high school senior year.
Quintiles of average AGI are computed within groups based on the high school senior year and the number of qualifying children.
High school seniors who were not claimed as dependents in a year prior to the high school senior year have missing prior AGI,
and these observations are included in the lowest 4 quintiles sample.

Notes: Dollar values are CPI adjusted to 2015 dollars. Pre-
tax income is total income, which is measured on line 22 of
Form 1040. This total income measure is the sum of all
income listed on Form 1040. Balance due captures the net
amount due; it is negative if a net refund to the taxpayer is
due. After-tax income is the sum of pre-tax income and the
balance due.

Notes: Within each year, county enrollment quintiles are computed by categorizing counties into the top 20% of enrollment rates, the next 20%, etc. down to
the lowest 20% of enrollment rates). The first row presents the average county-level enrollment rates for counties in each quintile. The regression kink slope
changes are then estimated using the EITC Kink 1 high school seniors who reside in these quintiles.

Notes: This table presents results based on average AGI in the 4 years prior to the high school senior year. The sample is restricted to high school senior cohorts in 2005
through 2011 who do not have any self-employment income in any of the 4 years prior to the high school senior year. Quintiles of average AGI are computed within
groups based on the high school senior year and the number of qualifying children. High school seniors who were not claimed as dependents in a year prior to the high
school senior year have missing prior AGI, and these observations are included in the lowest 4 quintiles sample.

Notes: These ﬁgures plot heat maps of county-level enrollment rates for high school seniors in the 2001, 2006 and 2011 cohorts. Enrollment
rates are computed as the fracDon of high school seniors in the cohort who enroll in the year aFer the high school senior year. The sample of
counDes is restricted based on the sample size within the county. Speciﬁcally, we compute the number of high school seniors in each county
in each year, and we restrict the mapped counDes to those that are in the top 75% of the sample size distribuDon in 2001 (i.e. those counDes
that have at least 144 high school seniors in 2001, where 144 is the 25th percenDle of the sample size distribuDon across counDes in 2001).

Notes: In Panels A and B, Distance to Kink measures EITC Income relative to EITC Kink 2. EITC income is defined as the income measure used to
determine EITC benefits. Following official rules described in IRS Publication 596, EITC Income changes around EITC Kink 2. Specifically, EITC
income is equal to earned income when AGI is less than the phase-out threshold, and EITC income is equal to the maximum of earned income
and AGI if AGI is above the phase-out threshold. For Panel A, the circles show the mean tax refund within each $100 bin of earnings relative to
EITC Kink 2. The solid line shows fitted values within each $100 bin of earnings relative to the kink 2. Panel B plots the number of tax returns
within $100 bins around each tax kink 2 point. The red squares are frequencies including the self-employed; the blue circles are frequencies
when excluding the self-employed and the black triangles are frequencies for wage earners.

Notes: All panels plot values by $100 AGI bins relative to the tax kink, where $100 bins are assigned based on rounding AGI
relative to the kink point to the nearest $100 amount. For Panels A and B, the circles show mean tax refunds and enrollment
rates. The solid lines show fitted values obtained from regressions using the individual-level data in which tax refund or an
enrollment indicator is regressed on a linear control for AGI relative to the kink point, a dummy for earnings less than the
kink point and an interaction between the dummy variable and the linear control. Panel C plots the number of tax returns in
the following ways: the red squares are frequencies including the self-employed; the blue triangles are frequencies excluding
the self-employed and the black circles are frequencies when excluding individuals with a difference between W2 wages and
wages reported on the 1040 form of more than $1000. This difference is attributable to non-third party verified wages. For
Panel D, the circles show mean predicted enrollment rates. The solid lines show fitted values of predicted enrollment rates
computed by regressing an enrollment indicator on dummies for calendar year, filing status, and number of dependents and
linear controls for senior year income.

Notes: Technical documentation on EITC program eligiblity and benefit rules are available in IRS Publication 596. Nominal dollar values are listed.
Historical EITC parameters are available at www.taxpolicycenter.org/. Beginning in 2002, the phase-out points for married filing jointly taxpayers
were higher than the phase-out points for head-of-househod filers. Conditional on the number of qualifying children, the differences between the
phase-out points for head-of-household and married filing jointly taxpayers is 0 in 2001, $1000 in 2002-2004, $2000 in 2005-2007, $3000 in 2008,
$5000 in 2009, $5010 in 2010, $5080 in 2011.
