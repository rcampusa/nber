        ESTIMATING EXPECTED EXCHANGE RATES UNDER TARGET ZONES



                                         ABSTRACT


       This paper develops a simple econometric procedure for estimating expected exchange

rate under target zones. We employ the linear projection methodology to make predictions

without relying on any prior structural or distributional assumptions, and at the same time

demonstrate that such a methodology has to be modified in an important way to account for

the presence of the fluctuation band. Our empirical results show that the band effect is

nontrivial for narrow target zones such as the Bretton Woods system. We also develop a

method to estimate the shapes of the unconditional distributions of exchange rates under

target zones. The empirical results show that the unconditional distributions of exchange

rates can take several different shapes, which may correspond to possibly widely different

monetary and exchange-rate intervention policies. We also show how to use the projection

equations and the information about the band to test the credibility of the exchange rate

regimes.

1 Introduction
Movements of asset prices are often subject to band restrictions. En the case of
exchange rates, these bands characterize every system of fixed exchange rates—from
the international gold standard onwards. The upper and lower limits of fluctuation
of currencies' exchange rates are in many instances announecd publicly: for example,
under the Bretton Woods regime the price of dollars in terms of member currencies
was restricted within a band nfl percent on either side of central parities; under the
European Monetary System (EMS) bilateral exchange rates of most currencies are
allowed to fluctuate within bands of 2.25 percent on either side of central parities.
   The theoretical implications of target zones were not studied until recently. See,
(or example, Krugman (1988), Bertola and Caballero (1989), Bertola and Svensson
(1990), Svenssnn (l991a), and Lindberg and Sdderlind (1991). These studies find,
among other things, the following consequences of a target zone: (1) 'Phe exchange
rate distribution is bounded on both the upper and lower sides. (2) The unconditional
distribution depends on the type of monetary intervention policy involved and the
structural relations assumed. (3) The conditional distribution is heteroskedastic. (4)
The interest rate differential as a measure of expected realignment is imprecise.
   Following the theoretical literature, a number of empirical papers have appeared,
aiming at estimating the unconditional distributions of exchange rates and testing the
credibility of target zones. Among these, see in particular Flood, Rose and Mathieson
(1990), Giovannini (1990), L,indberg, Svensson and Södcrlind (1991), Rose and Svens-
son (1991) and Svensson (1991b,c). Typically, they compare interest-rate differentials,
which are used as proxies of expected exchange-rate changes, with information about
the exchange-rate bands. Such comparisons lead to propositions abnut the credibility
of the bands.
   Two challenging problems remain in the empirical studies of exchange rates under
the target zones. The first is the presence of the hand restriction on the exchange
rates. Since rational agents should include the announced band as part of their
information set, it is important for the econometrician to explicitly take that into
account. The second has to do with the difficulty in estimating the exchange rate
distribution. Since the distribution varies with the intervention policies assumed, and
since the theoretical models have closed form solutions for only a few simplified policy
rules, it is difficult to estimate a distribution corresponding to the true underlying
policy and model structure.
   In what follows we present a method for estimating expected excbange rates within
target zone bands and a method for estimating the unconditional distribution of
exchange rates which are not cnnditional on any fundamental model of exchange
rates. The spirit of our test derives from the projectiomequation methods to estimate
expectations, as discussed, for exaniple, by Abel and Mishkin (19S3). The advantage
of this methodology is its generality: projection equations are often alternatives in
tests of structural models. We show, however, that in the case of target zones the
projection-equation methodology of estimating expectations has to be modified in an
important way, to account for the presence of target zones.
   The general test procedure followed in this paper is like that of liose and Svensson
(1991), Svensson (199lc) and Liodberg, Svenssnn and Söderlind (1991). Unlike these
authors, however, we explicitly account for the distributional implications of target
zones. We show that failing to do so leads to estimation bias and develop a new
econometric procedure that is unbiased and asymptotically efficient. Our procedure
does not lunge on special assumption on the distribution of the projection error, but
can allow for a large family of distributions which can approximate those implied
by the theoretical models. To illustrate our empirical methodology, we apply it two
datasets taken from different exchange-rate regimes, including the Bretton Woods
regime and European Monetary System.
   The rest of the paper is orgaoized as follows Section 2 develops a method of
estimating expected exchange rates under target zones and applies the method to
testing the credibility of exchange rate regimes. Section 3 presents a method to
estimate the unconditional distributions and applies it to the data. Finally, section 3
contains a few concluding remarks.
2 Estimating Expected Exchange Rates within Band and
    Testing the Credibility Exchange Rate Regimes
2.1 The Estimation
Following Svensson (lYOla), we decompose the log exchange rate (so into the sum-
mation of the log central parity (c0) and the log percentage deviation from the central
parity (x1), the latter is restricted by the fluctuation band (—L C x C L). We call it
the exchange rate within hand. Our task in this section is to estimate the expected
exchange rate within baod.
   Conventional estimation methods are developed for random variables that are un-
bounded and, preferably, normally distributed. To deal with the hounded exchange
rates with unknown distribution, we first transform the random variable into an un-
bounded one, and then employ estimation methods that do not rely on distributional
assumptions.
   We now transform the expected exchange rate within band, r, into a new variable


                                               —LSXOL.                             (1)

  We adopt the above transformation on both technical and conceptual grounds
Technically, the range of the transformed variable y; is unconstrained, we can, in
principle, use conventional techniques to estimate the parameters Conceptually, as
we mentioned before, we need to take the band restrictiun into account since it is an
essential part of the agents' information set. Our definition of y turns out to be a
measure of exchange rate inside the band that takes into account the presence of both
bounds. To see this consider the terms L + z and L — z. The former is the distance
between the exchange rate inside the hand and the lower limit of the band, and the
latter is the distance between the exchange rate inside the band and the upper limit
of the band. The ratio of the two terms is therefore a measure of the position of
the exchange rate relative to the upper and lower limits of the band. Therefore the
band information is naturally embedded in our transformed variable y (the log of
the ratio).

                                           3
     Following the projection methodology we propose the following linear projection
equation for y:
                                            = zfi + u,,                                        (2)
where a, is the vector of information variahlcs. ji is a vector of parameters to be
estimated, and 11, is contemporaneously independent of z.
     In estimating expected exchange rates within bands the projection horizon is usu-
ally longer than the sampling intervals of the data. To make full use of the sample
information we follow the strategy developed in Hansen and lIodrick (1980), Cumby,
Huzinga and Obstfeld (1983), and Hansen (1982) to obtain consistent estimates of 9
and its covariance matrix.' Following Svcnsson (1991c) we also use the Newey-West
(1985) modification to account for the conditional heteroskedasticity.
     The projection equation gives the estimate of the expectation of y as zfl. To
estimate the expected values for x, consider the reverse transformation:

                                          exp(-2)_i
                                          exp(t)+1
Since    is asymptotically normal and efficient (See Hansen (1982)), and its covariance
matrix (14) can be calculated using the Newey-West (1982) procedure, it follows that
p7 is asymptotically normal with mean z,j3 and variance ztz, +c'e/T, where e is the
vector of residual terms and T is the sample size. We can then obtain the asymptotic
density function for x, using the cliange-of-variaNes procedure;

                          1(x,)
                                       L
                                       -/
                                  =t2 2 ( ln&±11._z,/3
                                         \'.J4V0z,+e'e/T
where (') is the standard normal density functiion. The expected value of x, is given
by
                                     1, =      x,f(x,)dx,.
    The usual GLS and maximum likelihood estimators are inconsistent in the case of autocorrelated
errors, lithe indepeodent variables are not ecenometrically exogenous (See Cumby and l{u:zinga,
 1990). n the case of exchange rate models, most information variables are predetermined rather
than exogenous.


                                                4
   The 95% confidence intervals can then be numerically calculated for each                l)ue
to conditional heteroskedasticity, the confidence interval is asymmetric. So its tipper
and lower bounds need to he computed separately. Specifically, the upper bound at
time t, B', can be computed numerically as the solution to the following nonlinear
equation:

                                   J    f(x1)dx1 = 47.5%.                                   (3)

Similarly, the lower bound Bfr can be obtained by solving

                                   f f(x4)dx = 47.5%.                                       (4)

By construction       and   its confidence interval can only fall between —L and L.
   The advantage of the above method is its simplicity and generality. It does not
assume any structural relations between the exchange rate and the fundamentals,2
rather it relies on the projection equation to extract information useful in predicting
exchange rates. It does not impose restrictions on the distribution of the exchange
rate. The band restriction, however, is explicitly imposed in a natural way.

2.2 Comparison with Existing Estimation Methods
One way to estimate the expected exchange rates within target zones is to use a fully
specified model and numerically simulate the probability densities and compare the
simulated moments with the empirical moments. This is known as thc simulated
method of moments (see Lindberg and S&ierlind (1991)). The method is tied to the
particular model structure. It gives accurate estimates of the model parameters if
the model is the true description of the mechanism generating the data. If, however,
the model is not a good approximation to the true exchange rate mechanism, either
because of the difficulty in selecting proper fundamental variables or because of the
oversimplified assumptions about the intervention policy, then the estimated exchange
rates will be imprecise. In the latter case, our unconstrained method can often give
improved estimation. Another commonly used procedure applies the OLS directly
   3This is desirable due to the poor empirical performance of nearly all structural models for
eachange rates.


                                              5
to the data within the band. The method is completely unconstrained: it is riot
only flexible in the choice of lundamentals and the distribution, but also imposes
no band restrictions on the exchange rates. The motivation for this method is that
the OhS is robust to the distributional assumptions, so it should be applicable to
distributions of any shapes and forms, including the bounded distributions. However,
this method is problematic for the following reasons: the OhS requires the error
tern to be identically distributed and uncorrelated with the regressor. But when the
dependent variable is subject to the band restriction, these conditions no longer hold.
To   see   this, let the OhS regression equation be



where by the assumption of the OLS, e1 is an independently and identically distributed
random variable with mean zero, and is uncorrelated with z. But the target zone
restriction requires that
                                       —L S .v1 5

which implies
                                 —L—z/3e1 S L—z/3.
As we can see, the error term is regulated by the upper bound {L — tfi) and the
lower hound (—L — fl,       so its distribution depends on the value of the independent
variable at time 1. i.e., it is not identically distributed, and it is correlated with
the regressor. Also the zero mean assumption does not hold in general. The OhS
estimator is therefore biased.
     The economic interpretation of these biases is simple: since the band restriction
is part of the information set for the rational agents. the agents can exploit the
information to predict future monetary interventions. For example, when the cur-
rent exchange rate is too close to the upper limit, it can only be expected to move
downward, and the agents know how much room (the lower limit) there is for the
downward movement, if the target zone is credible. Therefore the baod restrictions
has to be imposed in the empirical estimation. Ignoring them introduces a correlation
between information and surprises which is not exploited by agents if they use simple

                                             6
OLS projections, and therefore implies a deviation from the rattonal expectations
hypothesis.

2.3     An Empirical Illustration
We now aply the econometric methodology developed above to data from the Eu-
ropean Monetary System and the Bretton Woods regime. The data are compiled as
follows. For the Brettort Woods period, the end-of-month spot exchange rates are
from the International Financial Statistics, the three month forward exchange mar-
gin (a proxy used to construct the interest rate differential) is obtained from Gruhel
(1966). For the EMS period, the monthly exchange rates are the last daily quote of
each month from the data set compiled by Andrew Rose.3 The three-month interest
rates data are from the international database currently maintained at the Federal
Reserve Board. The money supply data for both the Bretton Woods and the EMS
regimes are from the IFS tape. To focus on the target zone problem, we have adjusted
the values of a Few large observations so that thdy lie inside the hand.
   While in the EMS fluctuation bands are 2.25 percent on either side of the central
parity, under Bretton Woods they were only 1 percent on either side of the dollar
parity.4 Hence the width of the Bretton Woods bands we study here is less than half
the width of the EMS bands.

2.3.1   Projection Equations

We use various information variables to estimate the projection equations. Specif-
ically, we use current y;, its higber order terms, interest rate differential (we use
forward exchange margin is used as a proxy of interest rate differential for the Bret-
ton Woods period), money supplies (for countries with monthly data available), and
regime dommies corresponding to different central parities. The point estimation
results are reported in Table 1 through 6.
   3\Ve thank Lan Svenseon For having made available the EMS data set originally developed by
Andy Rose. That data set is described in Flood, Rose and Matlueson (1990).
   'The implication is that bilateral fluctuation bands for non-dollar exchange rates were 4 percent
wide.
  To compare our method with the conventional method, we also report the results
of the conventional projection equation which ignores the band restrictions. Such un-
restricted model regresses      on x, and its higher order terms, and other information
variables used in the constrained model.
  Figures 1 through 6 are the estimated 95% confidence intervals for expected ex-
change rates within hand (with 47.5% confidence region on either side of the esti-
mates), The solid lines are the results our restricted model (with band restriction
imposed via the transformation procedure), while the dotted lines are results of the
convectional linear projection of x,. As we can see, in the former case the estimated
values and confidence intervals are all within the band, but in the latter case, we find
many periods when the estimated values and confidence intervals lie outside the band,
which is clearly inconsistent with the presence of the band. The problem is more se-
rious during the Bretton Woods regime, when the band is narrower (1 %). Also,
when the band restriction is imposed, the confidence intervals are mostly asyrnmet-
nc, which is a direct consequence of special form of the conditional density function
under the target zones.
  IL is interesting to note that, under the band restriction, even when the projection
error is large (e.g. the Belgian franc under the EMS), the restricted confidence interval
tends to fill the whole target zone but is bounded by the latter. This implies that even
when the information set is noisy the information sbout the band is still exploited.
  Svenssnn (1991c) found mean reversion in the exchange rate within the band and
show that the interest rate differential needs to be adjusted for the expected rate of
devaluation within the band to yield the correct expected devaluation. This is also
confirmed in our empirical results: the adjustment on the interest rate differential is
sizable in mnst cases. The coefficient for the current WI 5, like the case of unrestricted
models, usually far less than 1, even though y' it is hy definition unrestricted has
a larger range of fluctuations in the data. This implies the fluctuations within a
given target zone are transitory, mean reversion processes. This implies that the
central bank allows temporary fluctuations within the band wlule deferring long-ruts
adjustment to later realignment of central parity.
2.3.2 Testing the Credibility of Exchange Rate Regimes

Rose and Svensson (1991) and Svensson (199k) formulate a method to test the cred-
ibility of exchange rate regimes. The essence of the test is to compare the estimated
expected exchange rate devaluation with the announced official target, and see if they
are significantly different, The expected exchange rate devaluation is shown to he the
interest rate differential adjusted for the expected depreciation within band, i.e.,

               E1Ac1 + p1[E1(i11realignment) — Ei(xm÷iIno realignment)]
               =    — — E(a1ftO realignment),                                             (5)

where 1 and i are the domestic and foreign interests respectively. The left-hand side
of (5) can be interpreted as the expected rate of devaluation: it is the combination of
the expected change in the central parity and the expected change in the deviation
from the central parity. See Rose and Svensson (1991) for more discussions.
   A test of credibility of the target zone is a test that the left-hand side of equation (5)
is equal to zero. It is constructed as follows: First, estimate Em(zimno realignment)
and compute its confidence interval. Then sobtract the confidence interval from the
interest rate differential i — 1'. At any time i, we conclude that the band is credible if
zero (which corresponds to the central parity) is contained in the resulting confidence
interval.
   Figures 7 to 12 contain the results of the credibility tests. They report the es-
timated 95% confidence intervals for the expected devaluation three month ahead.
Again, we report results of both the restricted model (solid lines) and unrestricted
model (dotted lines). Figures 7 and S show the case of the pound sterling and the
Deutsche mark under the Bretton Woods system. The confidence intervals given
by the unconstrained model are much wider than those implied by the constrained
model. As a result, there are many periods when credibility is clearly rejected by
the restricted model but not by the unconstrained model. This has to do with the
erroneous estimates of confidence intervals for the expected future exchange rates (see
figures 1 and 2). For the EMS period (figures 9 to 12), the difference of confidence
intervals are evident, but less striking than the case of the Bretton Woods period,

                                             9
suggesting that the baud restrictions are less severe when the band is wider (2.25%
under the EMS). Also, under the EMS, frequent rejections of credibility occur for the
Belgian franc (figure 9), the Danish krona (figure 10), and the French franc (figure
Ii), and the rejections tend to occur at roughly the same time, suggesting that most
credibility problems are a result of common shocks faced by these countries. The case
of Dutch guilder is shown iii figure 12. As we know, the guilder was kept well inside
the target zone, and the fluctuations were very small except for the beginning part
of the EMS period. Not surprisingly, we find very few rejections of credibility for the
guilder.

3 Estimating the Unconditional Distributions
3.1 The Methodology
In this section we discuss a way to estimate the unconditional distribution of exchange
rates under the target zones. Theoretical target zone models (e.g., ICrugman (1991)
and Liridberg and SSderliud (1991)) are constructed on the basis of the standard asset
price model for the exchange rate:

                                 s(t) = fit) + cedE[s(f)]/dt,                       (6)

which states that the current exchange rate depends on its fundamental value 1(t)
and the expected future exchange rate. The central hank intervenes by altering
such fundamentals as the money supply in accordance with the target zone policy.
Krugman postulates an infinitesimal intervention policy which occurs only at the
limits of the target zone5 and shows that the asymptotic (unconditional) distribution
of the exchange rate is U-shaped (bimodal). See Flood, Rose and Mathieson (1990)
for more discussions. Lindberg and SSderlind consider the case of intra-marginal
intervention with the degree of intervention being proportional to the deviation of
money supply from its targeted level.6 They conclnde that the asymptotic distribution
of the exchange rate is hell-shaped. The bell-shape is cnnsistent with the notion of
  5The policy Isads to s regulated Brownian motion specification foe 1(1).
  5This specification leads to a regulated Ornstein—tJhlenbeck process for f(t).



                                                10
mean reversion due to the nature of the assumed intervention policy. In both cases
the distributions are bounded (truncated) by the targeted exchange rate band.
   The target zone models have closed form solutions only for a few simplified specifi-
cations of intervention policies such as those mentioned above. The models themselves
usually do not address the question of what the economic fundamentals should be
included in determining J(t). It is conceivable that other specificatLous of the funda-
mentals and of the intervention policies will yield different forms of distributions.
   The abovediscussions suggest that in formulating a general estimation procedure,
one should explicitly take into account the band restriction, but at the same time
should be flexible on the selection of the fundamental variables and on the assumption
about the distributional forms. In this spirit, Flood, Rose and Mathieson (1990) plot
the data frequency charts for various currencies. The disadvantage of that eye-balling
method is that it is not a formal estimation. Here we propose a way to parameterize
and estimate the density curves under target zone restrictions.
   The underlying density function is not known, However, there is a rich tradition in
probability studies to mimic different shapes of density curves using a limited number
of parameters. A classical example is the Pierson family of distributions, which can
mimic most known distributions. In our particular problem, we require a mimicking
system that captures different shapes of density curves for data with upper and lower
hounds. Johnson (1949) and Johnson and Kotz (1970) develop a parameterization
system (known as the S system) for the bounded data. They use the standard normal
density function as a basic building block, together with a transformation function
with only four parameters, two for the shaping function, and two for the lower and
upper bounds, to describe a rich variety of distributions. The same methodology is
followed in the Box-Cox transformation procedure. Following thLs methodology, we
propose the following transformation

                                                  —LSL,                                 (7)




                                           11
where L is the hall-width of the symmetric band.7 The transformed variable y is
assumed to be N(O, 1). As such, the distribution of x given £ is determined uniquely
by the two transformation parameters y and 6. With different combinations of
and 6. one tan numerically simulate almost all relevant density curves for the random
variable Xt with lower and upper bounds. The density curves can take the documented
U-shape and bell shape, as well as other shapes that are not documented in previous
literature. When -y = 0 the density curve is symmetric. The normal distribution
corresponds to the case 6 —e cc.
   Maximum likelihood is a natural way to estimate the density curve without im-

Maximizing the likelihood [unction I we can obtain estimates of and 6. The density
curve can be numerically generated [or the estimated parameters. We can then exam-
ine what kind of intervention policy is more likely to be consistent with the exchange
rate data, as we will demonstrate in the empirical section-

a.2 Empirical Results
Table 7 reports maximum-likelihood estimates of the parameters and 6 which char-
acterize the shape of the unconditional distribution of z. As we argued in section 4, a
value of y close to zero indicates that the estimated unconditional distribution of x is
approximately symmetric. A value of 6 close to zero implies a U-shaped unconditional
distribution, while when 6 gets large the distribution approximates a bell-shape.
   TThe procedure can be extended easily to asymmetric bands.

                                              t2
   For the Bretton Woods sample,8 tl1e unconditional distribution of .r for the pound
sterling is symmetric (7 insignificantly different from zero), arid is between the iii-
modal and the bell shape, as shown in figure 9. Figure 10 shows the ease of the
Deutsche mark during the Bretton Woods period. The distribution is an asymmetric
U, with most of the probability mass concentrated by tIre lower edge of the fluctuation
band (stronger DM).
   Figures 11 to 14 report the plots of the estimated unconditional distribution for x
during the EMS for tIre Belgian franc, Danish krnna, French franc and Dutch guilder,
respectively. In the case of the EMS the U-shaped distribution is prevalent, while the
hell shape is observed, interestingly, only in the case of the guildcr.
   As we know, the U-shaped distribution is a prediction of the FCrugman (1990)
model, in which the monetary intervention occurs on the edges of the band, while
the bell-shaped distribution (e.g.. the case of the guilder) is consistent with the type
of intra-niarginal intervention policy described by Lindberg and Söderlind (1991).
The asymmetry in most of the distributions implies that the central bank may be
actually defending an implicit upper or lower bound. The distribution of the pound
is an intermediate case between the bell shape and the U shape, which may imply a
monetary policy that lies in between the marginal and intra-marginal interventions.
   Recall that the transformed variable y differs from our previously defined y only
by the parameters and 6. which further change the mean and variance of the den-
sity curve. The normal assumption is nol a strong restriction to the original variable
r. but is a convenient tool to simulate the underlying distribution. In the condi-
tional projection estimations, we did not impose the normal distribution assumption,
however, with our estimated fl y is asymptotically normal.

4 Concluding Remarks
This paper has developed techniques to estimate the exchange rate distributions and
the expected changes in exchange rates when the latter are constrained within a given
band. The techniques have the advantage of riot relying on a structural model, and
  8We used the daily sample from the Rose dataset,


                                             13
not imposing any particular shape to the unconditional distribution of the exchange
rate, while at the same time explicitly exploiting the information contained by the
presence of fluctuation limits,
   Our empirical results show that the presence of the hand can indeed affect the
estimates of the expected fnture exchange rates and the credibility tests. The effect
is large when the band is tight. It is therefore important to take the band restrictions
into account whenever the band restriction is likely to be binding.
   The empirical results also show that the unconditional distributions of exchange
rates can take several different shapes, which may correspond to possibly widely
different monetary and exchange-rate intervention policies. The possibility of widely
different models of fundamental determinants of exchange rates within fluctuation
bands underscores the use of atheoretical projection equations like those developed
in this paper.
