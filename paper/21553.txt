Established by a three person committee in 1914, the structure of the Federal Reserve System has
remained essentially unchanged ever since, despite criticism at the time and over ensuing
decades. With Congress now considering reforms to the System, this paper examines the original
selection of cities for Reserve Banks and branches, and of district boundaries. We show that each
aspect of the Fed’s structure reflected the preferences of national banks, including adjustments to
district boundaries after 1914. Further, using newly-collected data on interbank connections, we
find that banker preferences mirrored established correspondent relationships. The Federal
Reserve was thus formed on top of the structure that it was meant to replace.

1.Introduction

        The Federal Reserve System recently reached a centennial milestone. President Woodrow

Wilson signed the Federal Reserve Act on December 23, 1913. The Act assigned to a Reserve

Bank Organization Committee (RBOC) the task of determining the number of Federal Reserve

districts (between eight and twelve), the boundaries of each district, and the location of a Reserve

Bank within each district. The RBOC acted quickly, announcing the selection of 12 cities for

Reserve Banks and the locations of district boundaries on April 2, 1914. The choices made by

the RBOC were criticized at the time and are widely viewed as out of date today. For example,

the RBOC placed four Reserve Banks (Boston, New York, Philadelphia and Cleveland) within

just a few hundred miles of each other and two Reserve Banks in the state of Missouri, but

assigned only four Banks (Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas and San Francisco) to serve nearly

the entire western two-thirds of the country. Various proposals have been made over the years to

restructure the Fed to reflect changes in the geographic distributions of U.S. population and

economic activity.1 However, despite calls for reorganization at various times in its history, the

structure of the Federal Reserve System has remained largely fixed since 1914, with only minor

adjustments to district borders and branches. Congress is currently considering legislation that

would establish an independent commission to review and suggest possible changes to the

structure of the Federal Reserve System, including to the number and location of Federal

Reserve Banks and district boundaries.2

        This paper examines the determinants of the entire structure of the Federal Reserve

System, including Reserve Bank cities, district boundaries and branch office locations as laid out

  Senate bill S.1484, The Financial Regulatory Improvement Act of 2015, would, among other things, establish an
independent Federal Reserve Restructuring Commission to study the appropriateness of restructuring the Federal

in 1914. Better understanding of the reasons underlying the Fed’s original design can inform

ongoing debates about restructuring the System. The choices made by the RBOC in 1914 have

proved important historically. Commercial banks rely on the Federal Reserve Banks for

payments services and liquidity in times of need.3 The Fed’s performance in carrying out these

functions has real economic consequences. For example, during the Great Depression, the

Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s liberal lending policy resulted in superior economic

performance in the portion of Mississippi served by the Atlanta Fed than in the portion served by

the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, which had a more conservative policy (Richardson and

Troost, 2009; Ziebarth, 2013). Further, the establishment of a Reserve Bank appears to have

conveyed long-term economic benefits on at least some of the cities where they were located

(Odell and Weiman, 1998).

         There remains a debate about the criteria used by the RBOC to select the locations of

Federal Reserve Banks and district boundaries. Many studies conclude that in selecting cities for

Reserve Banks, the RBOC relied heavily on the results of a survey of national banks (e.g., Odell

and Weiman, 1998; Meltzer, 2003; McAvoy, 2006; Binder and Spindel, 2013), but studies

disagree about other criteria that influenced the RBOC’s decisions. Moreover, most studies

examine only the selection of cities for Reserve Banks and do not consider the location of district

boundaries or branch offices.4

         The authors of the Federal Reserve Act clearly anticipated the need for branch offices. As

Carter Glass explained in April 1914: “The banking operations and the commercial transactions

of any given territory will be practically maintained as they exist today, for the reason that such

3
  The Federal Reserve Act required all banks with federal charters, i.e., national banks, to become members of the
Fed, but membership was made optional for state chartered banks. Fed services and discount window loans were
generally not available to nonmember depository institutions until the Monetary Control Act of 1980.
4
  McAvoy (2004) is an exception. He shows that the territories assigned to Federal Reserve districts generally align
with the responses of national banks to the RBOC survey, but does not test alternative hypotheses.

                                                          2
territory will transact its business with the branch bank instead of the Regional Reserve Bank, if

more convenient” (Weed, 1914, p. 4).5 As such, the RBOC likely considered possible branch

locations when it selected cities for Reserve Banks and delineated district boundaries. In forming

most districts, the RBOC had no choice but to combine territories whose national banks favored

different cities for the location of a Reserve Bank. The subsequent establishment of branch

offices thus linked more banks with their preferred city and helped knit together distinct markets

within Reserve districts. In addition, the establishment of branches seems to have encouraged

state-chartered banks to join the Federal Reserve System.6 Hence, a comprehensive examination

of all components of the Fed’s structure helps to better understand the organization of the System

as a whole.

        We confirm that the responses of national banks to the RBOC survey were important for

structuring the Federal Reserve System. Both the total number of votes and county-level tallies

help explain the cities chosen for Reserve Banks, regardless of the control variables included in

the model. Moreover, we find that the votes also help explain the location of branches of Reserve

Banks and district boundaries. Most Federal Reserve districts were formed by joining together

contiguous blocs of counties that had supported different cities for Reserve Banks, with branch

offices opening in many of the cities that were not awarded Reserve Banks.

        Given their importance for the System’s structure, we also seek to explain the votes of

national banks for individual cities. Despite the emphasis of previous studies on how the

preferences of national banks helped shape the structure of the Federal Reserve System,

researchers have not systematically investigated the underlying determinants of those

(http://www.federalreservehistory.org/People/DetailView/14).

  Tippetts (1929) reports that many state banks joined the Federal Reserve System only after the opening of a nearby
branch office.

preferences. However, in a study about the establishment of Federal Reserve Banks in Atlanta

and Dallas, Odell and Weiman (1998) note that leading banks in those cities had developed

substantial correspondent banking businesses by the early 20th Century, holding deposits and

providing services for banks located in their respective regions. Further, both Atlanta and Dallas

were top choices for Reserve Banks among national banks in their regions, suggesting that

correspondent ties may have helped garner support from national banks already accustomed to

doing business with financial institutions in those cities.

       Using newly-collected information on the locations of the correspondents of all U.S.

national banks, we find that the number of correspondent links to a city explain both the total

number of votes for the city and the number of counties from which it received the most first-

choice votes. The Federal Reserve was thus formed on top of the existing interbank network

structure that it was meant to replace.

       The next section discusses why the Federal Reserve was established, focusing especially

on how the System’s geographically-decentralized structure was designed to overcome banking

system flaws that reformers saw as contributing to instability. Subsequent sections examine i) the

selection of cities for Federal Reserve Banks and branches, ii) the delineation of Reserve district

boundaries, and iii) the importance of established correspondent relationships for explaining the

expressed preferences of national banks for the location of Federal Reserve Banks.



2.Why the Fed has a Geographically-Decentralized Structure

       The Federal Reserve System was established to overcome features of the U.S. banking

and payments systems that contemporaries viewed as contributing to banking panics. Those




                                                  4
problems included an “inelastic” currency stock and the concentration of the nation’s bank

reserves in New York City and other money centers (Bordo and Wheelock, 2013).7

        Two features of the U.S. banking system encouraged the nation’s bank reserves to amass

in large banks in New York City and a few other cities. First, unit banking laws restricted most

banks to a single office location.8 Interbank relationships were thus necessary to operate the

payments system, and banks often held deposits with correspondent banks in large financial

centers to make payments and to collect checks and drafts on distant locations. Second, the

National Banking Acts allowed most national banks to apply their deposits with correspondents

in large cities toward their legal reserve requirements. Only national banks in designated central

reserve cities – New York City, Chicago, and St. Louis – were required to fully satisfy their

requirement by holding reserves in the form of lawful money in their vaults.

        Reflecting the importance of agriculture in many areas of the country, the demands for

money and credit were highly seasonal and somewhat varied across regions. The interbank

network allowed banks throughout the country to hold surplus funds on deposit with

correspondents in the larger cities and draw down their balances or borrow from their

correspondents when local demands for money and credit were high (e.g., James, 1978; James

and Weiman, 2010). Although the timing of the harvest varied somewhat across regions,

“seasonal stringency” in money markets was a perennial challenge. Furthermore, the network

transmitted shocks across the banking system when demand for liquidity spiked and money

center banks were forced to suspend deposit withdrawals, as in the Panics of 1893 and 1907



7
  The National Monetary Commission's final report in 1911 lists seventeen defects of the American banking system,
most of which pertained to liquidity risk across seasons or the nation's inefficient monetary system
(https://fraser.stlouisfed.org/scribd/?title_id=641&filepath=/docs/historical/nmc/nmc_243_1912.pdf#scribd-open).
8
  Even among the few states that allowed branching, most restricted branching to a bank’s home city or county
(Carlson and Mitchener 2006).

                                                        5
(Kemmerer, 1910; Sprague, 1910; Calomiris and Gorton, 1991; Wicker, 2000; Carlson and

Wheelock, 2016).

        Reform proponents sought to protect local markets from disruptions elsewhere in the

system as well as lessen both the banking system’s dependence on the interbank market and the

central role of the major New York City banks in particular. Although the option of allowing

banks to branch throughout the country was proposed, branching was not politically feasible,

particularly in light of concerns about a “money trust."9 Accordingly, the Federal Reserve Act

called for the establishment of eight to twelve relatively autonomous districts, each with a

Reserve Bank to hold the legal reserves of its member banks, “rediscount” their commercial and

agricultural loans (and thereby furnish “elastic” supplies of currency and reserves), and operate

the payments system.10

        The Federal Reserve Act assigned the task of designating the locations of Federal

Reserve Banks and district borders to the RBOC, which consisted of Secretary of the Treasury

William McAdoo, Secretary of Agriculture David Houston, and Comptroller of the Currency

John Skelton Williams. The Act provided the Committee with little explicit guidance, except

“That the districts shall be apportioned with due regard to the convenience and customary course

of business and shall not necessarily be conterminous with any State or Sates” (38 Stat. 251,

Section 2, paragraph 1). The only true constraint was on the minimum size of Reserve Banks.

The Act specified that “No Federal reserve bank shall commence business with a subscribed


9
  The Pujo Committee hearings (May 1912 to January 1913) reflected this fear of concentrated bank power. This
congressional subcommittee was called to investigate the concern that a small group of New York City banks
(particularly J.P. Morgan) controlled an excessively large share of bank assets either through their ownership or
management. The committee's reports are available from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis
(https://fraser.stlouisfed.org/title/?id=80).
10
   At the time, most loans were made on a discount basis. A member bank could obtain additional reserves or
currency by rediscounting loans with its Reserve Bank. An amendment to the Federal Reserve Act in 1917 permitted
direct loans (“advances”) from Reserve Banks to their member banks, collateralized by loans that were acceptable
for rediscount. See Hackley (1973) for a legal history of Federal Reserve Bank lending.

                                                       6
capital less than $4,000,000” (Section 2, paragraph 14), which effectively established a lower

bound on the size of districts. Seen in Figure 1, the geographic distribution of the number and

size of national banks in 1914 dictated that districts covering southern and western states would

have to be large in area to encompass enough banks to support a Reserve Bank.

         The RBOC received proposals from 37 cities seeking Reserve Banks and held public

hearings in 18 cities. Bankers and other civic boosters supported their proposals by offering

information about the size and strength of their local banks, the extent of their transportation and

communications linkages with other cities, and by presenting testimonials from bankers and

businessmen from throughout their regions in support of their city’s bid for a Reserve Bank.11

The RBOC also solicited the preferences of the System’s future member banks directly.

Specifically, the RBOC requested all national banks to 1) name their first, second and third

choices for the location of their Reserve Bank, and 2) to recommend eight to twelve cities (in no

particular order) across the country for Reserve Banks.12

         On April 2, 1914, the RBOC announced that twelve districts would be formed, identified

the boundaries of those districts, and named the cities that would have Reserve Banks.13 By

November 1914, the Reserve Banks were open for business. The RBOC (1914a) listed several

criteria that had guided its decisions. In addition to noting that each district must include enough

member banks to furnish the minimum $4 million required to capitalize a Reserve Bank, the

RBOC sought to provide a “fair and equitable division of the available capital for the Federal

11
   Transcripts of RBOC hearings and other documentation are available from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis
(https://fraser.stlouisfed.org/theme/#!14).
12
   The RBOC seems to have discounted the latter recommendations, noting that a few cities that were recommended
many times (e.g., Denver and New Orleans) had little local support (RBOC, 1914a).
13
   The RBOC did not explain its decision to establish the maximum 12 districts allowed under the Federal Reserve
Act. According to Hammes (2001), H. Parker Willis “strongly recommended” a 12-district plan in a report he
drafted as chair of a technical committee appointed to advise the RBOC, though later Willis (1923) wrote that it
might have been more “convenient” to have formed only nine districts. Conceivably, the RBOC created 12 districts
in an effort to bolster political support for the System and to dilute the influence of large city bankers, who generally
preferred a System comprised of a small number of large districts.

                                                            7
Reserve banks among the districts created” (p. 4). The RBOC further stressed the importance of

the “mercantile, industrial, and financial connections existing in each district and the relations

between the various portions of the district and the city selected for the location of the Federal

Reserve bank,” and “the geographical situation of the district, transportation lines, and the

facilities for speedy communication between the Federal Reserve bank and all portions of the

district” (pp. 3-4).14

        The Federal Reserve began to establish branches almost from the System’s inception.

Between 1914 and 1920, the Federal Reserve Board authorized 24 branches at the request of

Reserve Banks and their member commercial banks. A few more branches were authorized in

ensuing years, but the vast majority of the system was in place by 1920. The branches provided a

full range of payments services, cash delivery, and discount window loans to member banks

under the direction of the Reserve Bank and a local board of directors. According to Carter

Glass, “For practical purposes the branch banks are the real working elements of the system. It is

these branch banks which, in most instances, do the rediscounting” (Weed 1914, p. 3). Typically,

branches were opened in cities that were distant from the Reserve Bank, and thus were more

common in larger districts.15



3.Banker Preferences and the Selection of Reserve Bank and Branch Locations

        Several studies have concluded that the RBOC weighed heavily the results of its survey

of national banks in selecting Reserve Bank cities (e.g., Bensel, 1984; McAvoy, 2004, 2006;

Binder and Spindel, 2013). Table 1 lists the total number of “first-choice” votes for every city


14
   See McAvoy (2004; 2006), Binder and Spindel (2013) or Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis (2014, pp. 53-81) for
additional information about the RBOC and its selection of Reserve Bank cities and districts.
15
   For example, no branches were opened in the First (Boston) or Third (Philadelphia) districts, yet five were
eventually opened in both the Fifth (Atlanta) and Twelfth (San Francisco) districts.

                                                       8
that received at least 10 first-choice votes in the RBOC survey, as well as information gleaned

from unpublished county-level maps prepared by RBOC staff.16 The maps indicate the number

of first-choice votes cast in each county for each city, allowing us to calculate the total first-

choice votes and number of counties “won” by each city. Because the maps were preliminary

tallies prepared by the RBOC staff before all votes had been received, the vote totals shown on

the maps are less than the totals published in the RBOC reports. However, the ranking of cities

based on the county-level data from the maps and the reported vote totals are similar.17 Hence,

our empirical analysis uses the maps to identify the winning city for each county, defined as the

city that received the most first-choice votes from national banks located in the county.

         Table 1 identifies the 37 cities that requested Reserve Banks (which includes both

Minneapolis and St. Paul, and Dallas and Fort Worth), the 12 cities chosen for Reserve Banks,

and the cities that subsequently were chosen for branches of Reserve Banks.18 The 12 cities

selected for Reserve Banks had considerable support from national banks. All were among the

top 18 in first-choice votes, and nine were among the top 12 vote recipients. With the exception

of Cleveland (which received fewer first-choice votes than either Pittsburgh or Cincinnati), the

RBOC located a Reserve Bank in the city that received the most votes in each district that it

formed.




16
   The maps are located with other RBOC materials in Records of the Federal Reserve System, 1878-1996, Record
Group 82, National Archives and Records Administration, which are available from the Federal Reserve Bank of St.
Louis (https://fraser.stlouisfed.org/archival/#!1344). See McAvoy (2004) for discussion of the state maps.
17
   The maps also frequently lack votes for counties with major cities, likely because they were the top choice among
most banks located in the county and, hence, there was no need to indicate the relative strength of support for the
city.
18
   The RBOC recorded separate votes for each city of the following pairs: Minneapolis and St. Paul; Dallas and Fort
Worth; Kansas City, Kansas and Kansas City, Missouri; and New York City and Brooklyn. However, we combine
the pairs under the assumption that the selection of one city would exclude the other from consideration. Note that
these combinations allow us to count many first-choice votes that listed both cities. For instance, 44 votes specified
the “Twin Cities” or “Minneapolis or St. Paul,” which we have included in the vote total for Minneapolis/St. Paul.

                                                          9
         Banker preferences likely also influenced the selection of branch cities. The Federal

Reserve Board authorized branch offices at the request of Reserve Banks and their member

banks, and two RBOC members—Treasury Secretary McAdoo and Comptroller of the Currency

Williams—served on the original Board. By 1920, branches had been placed in 15 of the 20

cities that received the most first-place votes other than those chosen for Reserve Banks.

Branches were quickly established in cities that by all accounts were strong contenders for

Reserve Banks, including Baltimore, Cincinnati and Pittsburgh. Branches were also opened in

several medium-sized cities that had received substantial numbers of votes and were located far

from the headquarters of their districts, such as Denver, Los Angeles, Louisville, and New

Orleans.

3.1Empirical Model of Selection of Reserve Banks and Branch Cities

         To test the importance of the RBOC survey on the selection of cities for Reserve Banks,

we estimate a linear probability model using information about the 35 cities that requested a

Bank. The model controls for various other economic and political variables that could plausibly

have also influenced the selection of cities for Reserve Banks.19 To provide a comprehensive

examination of different hypotheses concerning the choice of cities for Reserve Banks, we start

with the combined set of variables used by McAvoy (2006) and Binder and Spindel (2013),

which include a variety of controls for banker preferences, economic and financial development,


19
   We use a linear probability model (LPM) rather than logit or probit for both technical and practical reasons. The
relatively small number of observations (12 cities chosen for Reserve Banks among 35 applicants) and additional
restrictions of a nonlinear model prevent the simultaneous inclusion of all variables necessary to test
comprehensively different hypotheses about the selection of Reserve Bank cities in such a model. When we estimate
a logit or probit model on a subset of variables, we always find that coefficients on national bank votes are
statistically and economically significant, regardless which other variables are included. However, the constraint that
predicted values fall between 0 and 1 in the nonlinear models results in instability in coefficient values when the
model is fully determined (though the coefficients on the voting variables retain statistical significance). Angrist and
Pischke (2009) and Wooldridge (2010) support the use of a LPM to estimate marginal effects. Similarly, we report
LPM results for other regressions in the paper, but obtain qualitatively similar results when using nonlinear models
for the other binary regressions.

                                                          10
and political considerations. To these, we add newly collected information on correspondent

relationships and state bank capital. By including a large number of variables, we lessen the

chance that a plausible alternative to the national bank votes explains the selection of cities for

Reserve Banks and branches. Table 2 presents the definition of each variable, corresponding

hypothesis, and data sources.

         The model takes the following form:

                𝑅𝑒𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑒𝐶𝑖𝑡𝑦𝑖 = 𝑎 + 𝛽1 𝑉𝑜𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑖 +𝛽2 𝑋𝑖 + 𝛽3 𝐶𝑜𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑝𝑜𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑠𝑖 + 𝑒𝑖 (1)

where 𝑅𝑒𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑒𝐶𝑖𝑡𝑦𝑖 is a dummy variable that takes the value 1 if a Reserve Bank was placed in

City i, 𝑉𝑜𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑖 is either the logarithm of total first-choice votes for City i or the log of the number

of counties “won” by City i (i.e., number of counties in which the city received a plurality of

first-choice votes), 𝑋𝑖 is a vector of city and state-level census and political variables,

𝐶𝑜𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑝𝑜𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑠𝑖 is the logarithm of the number of unique bank-to-bank links between City i

and all other locations,20 and 𝑒𝑖 is a vector of Huber–White corrected standard errors.

         We estimate a similar equation for the selection of branch cities, but expand the sample to

include all non-Reserve Bank cities with at least 30,000 people in 1910 and add a set of district

dummy variables. The changes are necessary to realistically capture the decision-making process

behind establishing a branch. A branch could have been opened in any large city, and districts

covering larger areas were more likely to need branches. The model is:

             𝐵𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑐ℎ𝐶𝑖𝑡𝑦𝑖 = 𝑎 + 𝛽1 𝑉𝑜𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑖 +𝛽2 𝑋𝑖 + 𝛽3 𝐶𝑜𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑝𝑜𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑠𝑖 + 𝑑𝑖 + 𝑒𝑖 (2)

where 𝐵𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑐ℎ𝐶𝑖𝑡𝑦𝑖 is a dummy variable that takes the value 1 if a branch was opened in City i

before 1920, 𝑑𝑖 is a vector of district dummy variables, and the rest of the variables retain their

aforementioned definitions.
20
  The variable is based only on correspondents of national banks. Our definition accounts for national banks that
had multiple correspondents in a single city and thus captures the intensity of the links to a given city. However,
results are qualitatively similar if we define the variable as the number of banks that had at least one link to a city.

                                                            11
         Table 3 presents coefficient estimates for Equations (1) and (2). The first five columns

pertain to the selection of Reserve Bank cities and the remaining five pertain to the selection of

branch cities. The estimation results strongly support the hypothesis that banker preferences

influenced the selection of both Reserve Bank and branch cities, regardless whether we measure

preferences using the number of first-choice votes or number of counties won.21 The estimates

indicate that doubling the number of votes received would increase the probability of a city’s

being chosen for a Reserve Bank by 16.9 percent and the probability of being chosen for a

branch by 15.8 percent. The statistical significance of the voting variables is reduced, however,

when the number of correspondent links is also included in the model, suggesting that the

variables capture similar influences. Conceivably, many bankers voted for cities where they

already had established correspondent relationships, which we test in various ways below.

         We find some support for the view that politics played a role in locating Reserve Banks

and branches, as indicated by positive and statistically significant coefficients on the number of

representatives a state had on Congressional banking committees. That said, any effect of

committee membership was likely small. First, the selection of Reserve Bank and branch cities

align closely with the national bank votes. Second, membership on the banking committees was

highly correlated with the size of a state’s banking sector. For instance, 13 of the 14 states with

the most total national bank capital had at least one representative or senator on a banking

committee, and together they made up over half of both committees.22 Thus, membership on the

banking committees likely was correlated with aspects of a state’s banking sector not directly

21
   In other regressions (which are available from the authors upon request), we included the number of second-
choice votes received by a city. However, because the number of second-choice votes is highly correlated with the
number of first-choice votes, only the coefficient on first-place votes is statistically significant when both variables
are included in a model of the selection of cities for Reserve Banks. While second place votes may not have made a
difference for the average Reserve Bank city decision, they still could have influenced outcomes of marginal cases,
as discussed by Odell and Weiman (1998). County-level tallies of second-choice votes are not available.
22
   The banking committees are also correlated with voting patterns as the 13 cities with the most votes were all in
states that had at least one member on the banking committees.

                                                           12
captured in the model, such as lending or deposit volumes or other services. Moreover, the

banking committee variable is no longer significant for the choice of Reserve Bank cities if New

York, which had three representatives on the House and Senate banking committees, is dropped

from the estimation. New York City was undoubtedly going to get a Reserve Bank; the real

decisions for the RBOC concerned the location of the other Banks and district boundaries.

        We find some differences in the effects of other variables on the selection of Reserve

Bank and branch cities. For Reserve Banks, growth in national bank capital is important when

not controlling for correspondent links. For branch locations, the level and growth of city

population is important, as is distance to the district’s Reserve Bank. A city was more likely to

obtain a branch, the larger its population in 1910 and growth over the preceding decade, and the

farther it was from the district’s headquarters. The negative and statistically significant

coefficient on telephones per capita is something of a puzzle and likely spurious. Because the

number of telephones per capita is included to capture the development of local communications,

we would anticipate it to have a positive impact on the selection of cities for Reserve Banks and

branches. However, the data are observed at the state-level, rather than city level, which makes

the variable a less than ideal measure of a city’s communications infrastructure. Further, the

apparent influence of telephones per capita on the selection of branch cities is driven entirely by

the St Louis district.23

4.Banker Preferences and Reserve District Boundaries

        Our regression results support the view that the RBOC survey of national banks

influenced the selection of Reserve Bank and branch cities. Conceivably, the survey was also

23
  While Illinois and Missouri had high numbers of telephones per capita, the selection of Chicago, St. Louis and
Kansas City for Reserve Banks limited the need for branches in either state. Instead, branches of the St. Louis Bank
were established in Arkansas, Kentucky and Tennessee—all states that had relatively few telephones per capita. The
coefficient on the telephones variable becomes statistically insignificant if the two states are omitted from
estimation.

                                                        13
important for the setting of district boundaries. Some evidence for this conjecture is presented in

Table 4, which reports the percentage of counties in each district whose national banks had

favored 1) the city selected by the RBOC for the Reserve Bank in their district, and 2) a city

selected for a branch office in their district.24

         The table shows that the 12 cities chosen for Reserve Banks were the preferred choice of

national banks in 55 percent of all counties (with recorded votes) included in their districts.

Perhaps not surprisingly, New York City was the first choice among banks in all 60 counties

assigned to the New York district, and Boston, Chicago, Minneapolis and Philadelphia were the

first choice in over 70 percent of the counties assigned to their districts. However, the cities

selected for Reserve Banks in all other districts were the top choices of no more than half the

counties in their districts. In forming those districts, the RBOC merged blocs of counties that had

supported different cities. Branch offices were subsequently opened in many cities that had won

sizable blocs of counties but were not chosen for a Reserve Bank. For example, Cleveland won

only 22 percent of the 136 counties assigned to its district, whereas Cincinnati and Pittsburgh—

the two cities in the district where branches were subsequently located—combined to win 60

percent of the district’s counties. Thus, the three cities together won 82 percent of counties

assigned to the Cleveland district. Across all Federal Reserve districts, the RBOC assigned 84

percent of the 1,847 counties with at least one recorded vote to a district that included a Reserve

Bank or branch city favored by a plurality of the county’s national banks.25

         In forming districts, the RBOC sought to maintain “mercantile, industrial, and financial

connections.” Thus, the committee likely considered groups of counties that voted similarly as

24
   We omit counties with no recorded votes. Many of the counties without votes were in the West and had neither a
national bank nor large city. The percentages when all counties are included or using modern Federal Reserve
boundaries are available from the authors upon request.
25
   In calculating these percentages, counties with the same number of votes for two different cities (i.e., a tie vote)
are included in the county total and counted as non-matches.

                                                           14
inseparable blocs to be fit together to form Federal Reserve districts of sufficient size and to

match more national banks with their preferred city. For example, Willis (1923, pp. 587-88)

claims that the RBOC included the southeastern part of Louisiana in the Atlanta district to ensure

that the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta had the minimum $4 million capital, even though banks

in that region had mostly voted for New Orleans and had closer banking and commercial ties to

St. Louis. A branch of the Atlanta Bank was opened in New Orleans shortly after the system was

established.

         The correspondence between Federal Reserve district boundaries and the results of the

national bank survey is apparent in Figure 2. The maps show the district borders set by the

RBOC (Panel A), the counties won by the city chosen for each district’s Reserve Bank (Panel B),

and the counties won by each district’s Reserve Bank and branch cities (Panel C).26 Unshaded

counties had no recorded votes (either because the county had no national banks, none returned a

ballot, or their votes were not transcribed) or voted for a city that was not chosen for a Reserve

Bank or branch.

         The maps show that district boundaries generally matched voting patterns. Some

divisions are clear and match geography. For instance, support for Philadelphia ran to the

southern border of Pennsylvania and thus matches the Philadelphia/Richmond district boundary.

However, voting patterns also explains some of the less straight-forward geographic divisions

between districts. For instance, nearly all counties in Iowa voted for and were assigned to the

Chicago district, including those that are closer to either Minneapolis or Kansas City. Moreover,



26
  In Panel C, we shade with a single color all of the counties whose banks voted for a given Reserve Bank city or
any of the branches that were established in the district. Counties shaded in black are those where two or more cities
received equal numbers of votes. We add the first-place votes for Reserve and branch cities before determining the
outcome of each county-level vote. This eliminates any potential ties between Reserve Bank and branch cities. For
instance, we would assign two votes for Cleveland for any county that supplied one vote for Cleveland and one for
Cincinnati.

                                                          15
nearly all of the mid-state district splits align with the voting data. For instance, the district

boundary lines in Illinois and Pennsylvania largely match the voting blocs of Chicago/St. Louis

and Philadelphia/Pittsburgh.

           Not all district borders were set precisely with voting blocs. For example, the RBOC

assigned several counties in Wisconsin and the upper peninsula of Michigan to the Minneapolis

district, despite having been won by Chicago. Similarly, the committee assigned a handful of

counties in Arizona and New Mexico to the Dallas district that had been won by Kansas City or

San Francisco. Still, for the most part, the district boundaries correspond closely with the voting

patterns observed in the county-level data.

           In addition to their explanatory power for the initial district boundaries, banker

preferences also help explain the few boundary changes made after the Fed was established. The

Federal Reserve Board adjusted district boundaries at the request of member banks. Banks were

probably more likely to request a change if they had been assigned to a district that did not

include their preferred Reserve Bank city. For example, banks in central and eastern Wisconsin

that voted for Chicago yet were placed in the Minneapolis district quickly petitioned to be moved

to the Chicago district, arguing that the RBOC had acted “Without due regard to the convenience

and customary course of business” (Weed 1914, p. 1). Banks in western Connecticut and

northern New Jersey asked to be moved to the New York district for similar reasons.

           Table 5 examines the relationship between boundary changes and voting patterns. The

Federal Reserve Board moved 84 counties with recorded votes from their originally-assigned

districts to other districts.27 Of those, 70 percent were moved to a district that included the

Reserve Bank city or a branch city that had won the county’s vote in the RBOC survey. Only 9

counties (10.7 percent) were moved out of a district that included the city that won the county’s
27
     Including counties with no recorded votes, the Board moved 121 counties from their originally-assigned districts.

                                                           16
vote, and 6 percent were moved between districts in which neither included the city that won the

county’s vote. The remaining 13.1 percent of counties moved had split votes, usually between

cities in both the original and new districts. For instance, single votes were recorded for both St.

Louis and Kansas City in Johnston County, Missouri. The county was initially placed in the St.

Louis district but later moved to the Kansas City district.

4.1 The Relative Importance of First-Choice Votes and Distance for District Boundaries

       It seems clear that the RBOC relied heavily, but perhaps not exclusively, on the results of

its survey of national banks in selecting Reserve Bank cities and setting district lines. The

Committee also claimed that it considered “the geographical situation of the district,

transportation lines, and the facilities for speedy communication between the Federal Reserve

bank and all portions of the district.” Accordingly, the RBOC may have preferred to limit the

distance between Reserve Bank offices and their members in an effort to ensure timely delivery

of services and access to the Fed’s discount window. We use a multivariate regression model to

examine the relative importance of distance and banker preferences. Because there are many

possible outcomes (i.e., one for each Fed district), we look at the choice around each district

separately. The dependent variable (𝐷𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑡𝑖 ) is a dummy variable that takes the value 1 when

County i was placed in the specified district and 0 otherwise. This approach generates 12

regressions of the form:

               𝐷𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑡𝑖 = 𝑎 + 𝛽1 𝑉𝑜𝑡𝑒𝐶𝑜𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑖 +𝛽2 𝐷𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒𝐶𝑜𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑖 + 𝑒𝑖 (3)

where 𝑉𝑜𝑡𝑒𝐶𝑜𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑖 is a dummy variable that takes the value 1 if a plurality of banks in County

i voted for the Reserve Bank (or a branch) city of the county’s district, and 𝐷𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒𝐶𝑜𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑖 is

a dummy variable that takes the value 1 if County i was nearer to its district’s Reserve Bank (or a




                                                 17
branch) city than to any other district’s Reserve Bank or branch cities.28 Knowing that both

variables are likely important, the model essentially sets up a horse race between the two.

         Although we could use a sample containing all U.S. counties for each regression, the

RBOC's stated goals would not have allowed it to place, say, a county on the West Coast in a

district in the Northeast. We thus limit the sample for each district regression to counties that

were in the specified district or a neighboring district. The approach minimizes extraneous

information and allows us to study the margins that would have concerned the RBOC.

         We estimate Equation (3) in two ways for each district. We first consider only the

distance to and votes for Reserve Bank cities, and then we consider the distance to and votes for

Reserve Bank and branch cities. Table 6 reports the results. When considering Reserve Bank

cities only, voting is more important than distance for the New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, and

Minneapolis districts, whereas distance is more important for the Boston, Cleveland, Richmond,

Atlanta, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco districts. The coefficients for voting and

distance are not statistically different from one another for the St Louis district. When branch

cities are included, the county-level vote totals are almost always more important than distance

for explaining whether or not a given county is included in a particular district. The coefficient

on the vote dummy is larger than the coefficient on the distance dummy for 10 of the 12 districts.

The coefficients on voting and distance are not statistically different for the Dallas district, and

the coefficient on the distance dummy is larger for the Boston district.29




28
   We calculate each county's GPS coordinates as an average of the bank locations in the county.
29
   Distance likely matters more than votes for Boston because many counties in western Connecticut, Massachusetts,
and Vermont that favored New York City were instead assigned to the Boston district. Further, if we redefine
VoteCorrecti to equal 1 if a plurality of banks in County i voted for any city in its district, the coefficient on the
variable increases and the coefficient on distance decreases for most districts, and the effect of voting becomes much
larger than distance for the Atlanta district.

                                                         18
        The regression results tell a story. County-level voting patterns were clearly important for

districts where a single city had sufficiently wide support and bank capital to establish a Reserve

Bank. Therefore, when voting for branch cities is excluded, distance appears relatively more

important for determining the boundaries of districts where no single city received enough

support for a Bank. However, this ignores the possibility that the RBOC foresaw branches as

likely in cities that anchored large blocs of counties which were joined to form districts. Because

branch offices were subsequently opened in many of the cities that had received substantial

support for a Reserve Bank, the results of the RBOC survey of national banks dominate distance

for nearly all districts when we compare the importance of votes for Reserve Bank and branch

cities with distance to the nearest city with a Reserve Bank or branch.

        The results beg yet another question: What factors led the RBOC to go against the votes

of national banks? Of 1,874 counties with at least one recorded vote, 292 were placed in a

district that did not include the city favored by a plurality of the county’s national banks (59 of

those counties were later moved into their preferred district). Since banks in many of the

mismatched counties had voted for a city that was neither chosen for a Reserve Bank nor became

a branch location, we focus on the 1,126 counties whose banks voted for one the 12 cities chosen

for a Reserve Bank. Of those, 141 were placed in a district that did not include the city favored

by the county’s banks in 1914, and 41 of those counties were later moved into their preferred

district.

        We estimate the following regression:

   𝐴𝑔𝑎𝑖𝑛𝑠𝑡𝑉𝑜𝑡𝑒𝑖 = 𝑎 + 𝛽1 𝐷𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒𝑡𝑜𝑉𝑜𝑡𝑒𝑖 +𝛽2 𝐷𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒𝑡𝑜𝐷𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑡𝑖 + 𝛽4 𝑍𝑖 + 𝑑𝑖 + 𝑒𝑖 (4)




                                                 19
where 𝐴𝑔𝑎𝑖𝑛𝑠𝑡𝑉𝑜𝑡𝑒𝑖 is a dummy that takes the value 1 if County i was placed in a district other

than the one favored by the banks in that county.30 𝐷𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒𝑡𝑜𝑉𝑜𝑡𝑒𝑖 is the logarithm of the

distance from County i to the city that won the county's vote, and 𝐷𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒𝑡𝑜𝐷𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑡𝑖 is the

logarithm of the distance from County i to the Reserve Bank city of the district to which the

county was assigned. The two distances allow us to determine whether the RBOC was more

inclined to go against the preferences of a county’s banks the further the county was from the

county’s favored city and the closer it was to the Reserve Bank city of another district. 𝑍𝑖 is a

vector that includes County i's population, logarithm of national bank capital, and logarithm of

state bank capital. Finally, district dummies capture whether certain districts were more or less

likely to include counties whose banks favored a different Reserve Bank city.

         The results reported in Table 7 indicate that counties were more likely to be placed

outside their preferred district the farther they were from the city favored by the county’s banks

and the closer they were to a Reserve Bank or branch city in its assigned district. The coefficient

on population is significant and positive, indicating that the RBOC was more likely to place

larger counties outside their preferred district, perhaps in an effort to make districts more equal in

terms of population.

         The coefficients on the district dummies in column (2) indicate the extent to which there

were district-specific differences in the assignment of counties to other than their preferred

districts.31 For example, the negative coefficient for the New York district indicates that, relative

to the omitted Boston district, banks in counties assigned to the New York district were

significantly less likely to have preferred being placed in a different district.


30
   We drop counties with tie votes from the sample because the tie often was between a city in the county’s original
district and one in the district to which it was later moved.
31
   The results are similar albeit with opposite signs when including dummies for a county’s vote outcome rather the
district outcome.

                                                         20
5.Banker Preferences and Correspondent Relationships

       The previous sections have provided considerable evidence that the results of the RBOC

survey of national banks strongly influenced the selection of cities for Federal Reserve Banks

and branches, and the delineation of district boundaries. However, what did the survey results

represent? Testing the hypothesis suggested by Odell and Weiman (1998), we examine whether

voting patterns reflected established correspondent relationships.

       Many bankers expressed their preferences in hearings before the RBOC. Bankers often

cited their existing business relationships and markets for why they favored a particular city for a

Reserve Bank. For example, a Hopkinsville, Kentucky, banker testified that Louisville was his

first choice for a Reserve Bank because “we are very intimately associated with them in a

business way, and in a social way too. Next to Louisville, our choice is St. Louis…. The majority

of the national bankers in eastern Kentucky have accounts in St. Louis. It would be very much to

the advantage of our community if we could not get in the Louisville district to come to St.

Louis” (RBOC 1914b, pp. 1760-1761).

       Some bankers did not express a preference for a particular city, but instead emphasized

the importance of keeping their market area within a single Federal Reserve district. For

example, an El Paso, Texas banker and president of the local clearinghouse testified: “El Paso

comes before your Honorable Committee, not as an applicant for a regional Reserve Bank… but

simply asking that our territory be kept intact. By our territory, I mean that part which we

consider the trade territory of El Paso….” When asked whether this region would be better

served by a Reserve Bank in San Francisco, Denver, or Kansas City, the banker responded, “I do

not think there is very much difference …. I should say that any of those three points would

serve this district equally well.” (RBOC 1914c, pp. 3101-3103)



                                                 21
         As the quotes make clear, established correspondent relationships and trading partners

were important considerations for the placement of Reserve Banks and district boundaries.

Banks sought correspondents in cities where they had frequent need for payments services, and

cities with good transportation services at the center of major agricultural or commercial areas

often became significant correspondent banking centers (Duncan and Lieberson, 1970; Odell and

Weiman, 1998). Those cities were likely candidates for Reserve Banks and branches because

they met several of the RBOC’s stated criteria for selecting Reserve Bank cities, including

having extensive transportation and commercial ties within their regions.

         We recorded the locations of all correspondents listed for every national bank in the

January 1913 Rand McNally Bankers Directory. Table 8 reports the number of correspondent

links to every city with at least 10 links.32 For example, national banks from throughout the

United States reported 7,119 correspondent relationships with banks located in New York City—

more than twice as many links than to any other city. Of the 7,454 national banks listed in the

directory, approximately 84 percent reported at least one New York City correspondent, and

some banks had multiple correspondents (which is why the number of links to New York City

exceeds 84 percent of 7,454).33

         Figure 3 provides examples of the density and reach of correspondent banking links to

various cities. Whereas New York City and Chicago attracted business from throughout the

nation, Boston and Philadelphia attracted most of their correspondent business from banks in the

Northeast, though many banks in major cities throughout the country also had correspondents in


32
   Most national banks had either two or three correspondents, usually located in larger cities. Although banks in
major cities often had correspondents in other large cities, the vast majority of correspondent links were from
country banks to big city correspondents. The variation in the types of correspondents and respondent banks are thus
relatively similar across locations. State bank correspondents display similar patterns. If anything, state bank were
more likely to have their second correspondent in a smaller and closer city than national banks.
33
   Chicago was the nation’s second largest city and commercial center, and its banks also attracted correspondent
business from throughout the country, with some 35 percent of all national banks having a Chicago correspondent.

                                                         22
Boston or Philadelphia. Minneapolis/St Paul and San Francisco were almost entirely regional

correspondent centers with only a few links to banks in other regions. Finally, Atlanta and Dallas

drew nearly all of their correspondent business from within their own states.

         Most of the cities chosen for Reserve Banks were already national or major regional

correspondent banking centers, and all received substantial numbers of first-choice votes in the

RBOC survey of national banks. Still, the RBOC passed over a few cities with significant

correspondent banking links that had also received large numbers of votes. For example, as

Figure 4 shows, Baltimore had more correspondent links and drew business from a larger

geographic area than did Richmond, and both Pittsburgh and Cincinnati drew from larger areas

than did Cleveland.34 Richmond, however, received more first-choice votes than Baltimore and

won substantially more counties. By contrast, Cleveland received fewer votes, won fewer

counties, and had fewer correspondent links than either Pittsburgh or Cincinnati, suggesting that

its selection was based on other criteria.35

         Next, we investigate how closely the county-aggregated votes align with established

correspondent connections. For each city that received a plurality of votes in at least one county

outside the city’s home county, Table 9 reports 1) the total number of non-home counties won;

2) the percentage of counties won where the city also had the largest share of correspondent

links; 3) the percentage of counties won where the city and another city had equal numbers of

correspondent links (and no other city had more links); and 4) the percentage of counties won




34
   Citizens of Baltimore were so incensed at being passed over that they petitioned the Federal Reserve Board to
move the Reserve Bank of the 5th Federal Reserve District from Richmond to Baltimore (which the Board turned
down) (https://fraser.stlouisfed.org/docs/historical/nara/nara_rg082_e02_b2661_01.pdf).
35
   The RBOC (1914a, p. 24) noted that Cleveland was one of the nation’s six largest cities and that the
“geographical situation and all other considerations fully justified” the placement of a Reserve Bank in all of those
cities. Otherwise, the committee did not comment on the selection of Cleveland, rather than Pittsburgh or Cincinnati.

                                                         23
where the city had fewer correspondent links than another city.36 For example, 24.2 percent of

the counties won by Atlanta had more correspondent links to Atlanta than to any other vote-

receiving cities, and 27.4 percent of the counties won by Atlanta had the same number of links to

Atlanta as to another city (and fewer links to all other cities). By contrast, 48.4 of the counties

won by Atlanta had more correspondent links to other cities. Across all cities, 64.9 percent of the

counties won had more correspondent links to the given city than to any other cities, and another

18.2 percent of counties won had the same number of correspondent links to the city and another

city (and fewer links to all other cities).37

         The final column of Table 9 reports the percentage of counties won by each city that were

closer in distance to the city than to any other city that received votes. For example, 46.8 percent

of the 63 counties won by Atlanta (excluding its home county) are closer to Atlanta than to any

other city that received votes. In general, voting patterns align more closely with correspondent

links than with distance, especially among cities that won more than 15 counties. For example,

only 25 percent of counties won by Kansas City are closer to Kansas City than to another city

that received votes. However, 87 percent of the 150 counties won by Kansas City had more

correspondent links to Kansas City than to any other city. By contrast, voting patterns align more

closely with distance than correspondent links primarily for cities that won few counties. For

example, only one of the nine counties won by Charlotte had more correspondent links to

Charlotte than to any other city, but all were closer to Charlotte than to any other city that

received votes. In general, the correspondent links of national banks were somewhat more




36
   Given their legal status as central reserve cities, we drop correspondent links to New York City, Chicago, and St
Louis when calculating the percentages for all other cities, and drop New York City correspondents when
calculating the percentages for Chicago and St Louis.
37
   Many of the counties with equal numbers of correspondent links to two cities had only one bank.

                                                         24
concentrated among the larger financial centers than were their votes, though clearly voting

patterns followed established correspondent relationships to a large degree.

5.1Empirical Model of First-Choice Votes

       Whereas voting patterns generally mirrored preexisting correspondent linkages, those

links, and hence votes, might simply have reflected a city’s size and financial depth. Thus, we

examine the effect of correspondent links on the total number of votes and total number of

counties won by cities while controlling for other factors, such as whether a city was a

designated reserve or central reserve city under the National Banking Act. We estimate city-level

regressions similar to Equation (2), where the dependent variable (Votesi) is the logarithm of

either the number of first-choice votes or the number of counties won by City i. The sample

contains all cities with urban populations above 30,000 regardless of whether they were

subsequently chosen as a Reserve Bank or branch city. The model is:

           𝑉𝑜𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑖 = 𝑎 + 𝛽1 𝐶𝑜𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑝𝑜𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑠𝑖 +𝛽2 𝑋𝑖 +𝛽3 𝑅𝑒𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑒𝐶𝑖𝑡𝑦𝑖 + 𝑠𝑖 + 𝑒𝑖 (5)

where 𝑅𝑒𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑒𝐶𝑖𝑡𝑦𝑖 is a dummy that takes the value 1 if City i was a reserve or central reserve

city, 𝑠𝑖 is a vector of state dummies, and the rest of the variables retain their aforementioned

definitions. Because New York City and Chicago were much larger, received many more votes,

and had many more correspondent links than other cities, we estimate the specification both with

and without those two cities to ensure they are not driving the results.

       Table 10 displays the estimation results for Equation (5). In all four specifications, the

effect of correspondent links is large and statistically significant. A doubling of the number of

correspondent links would increase a city’s expected number of votes by 44 to 69 percent and

number of counties won by 30 to 52 percent. The effect of correspondent links is stronger when

New York City and Chicago are excluded. Encouraged by statutory reserve requirements and the



                                                 25
advantages of the correspondent network's payment services and interest income, most national

banks had at least one New York City or Chicago correspondent. However, most national banks

also had correspondents in regional centers that were closer to home, and likely would have

preferred those cities for the location of their Reserve Bank. Indeed, excluding links to New

York City and Chicago, the main correspondent location of national banks in over 75 percent of

counties was within 200 miles (most of the counties with larger distances to their principal

correspondent are in the West where counties and distances between cities are larger). Thus, the

relationship between number of votes received and number of correspondent links is closer for

most cities than it is for New York City and Chicago.

       The estimation results indicate that both the number of votes and the number of counties

won were also influenced by city population in 1910 and the percentage change in population

over the prior decade. The results are strongest for the percentage change in population,

however, as the coefficient on 1910 population is smaller and not statistically significant in

regressions that exclude New York City and Chicago. A large increase in population was

perhaps a reflection of expanding economic activity that attracted votes from banks hoping to

find new business opportunities by becoming affiliated with a Reserve Bank in a growing city.

Similarly, the coefficient on national bank capital is smaller (and is much less close to being

statistically significant) in both sets of regressions when New York City and Chicago are

excluded. At the margin, New York City and Chicago received more votes because of the size of

their banking markets. After controlling for correspondent links and other local characteristics,

the amount of local banking capital did not influence the number of votes that most cities

received. We also find a positive impact of being an urban commercial and transportation center,

as reflected in Bensel’s (1984) “urban center” designation, on the number of votes received.



                                                 26
However, the negative coefficients on the number of businesses in the city listed by Bradstreet

are puzzling and perhaps suggest that the type rather than number of businesses influenced

preferences.



6.Conclusion

       The RBOC's decisions have been the source of much criticism. Early on, critics charged

the RBOC with passing over important banking centers, such as Baltimore and New Orleans,

while locating Reserve Banks in smaller, less established cities, such as Richmond, Atlanta, and

Dallas. Political considerations were viewed as the impetus for the placement of two Reserve

Banks in Missouri, and influential on the selections of Richmond, Atlanta and Cleveland.

       Our research finds that, in selecting cities for Reserve Banks and drawing district

boundaries, the RBOC was guided primarily by the preferences of national banks rather than

partisan politics. Those preferences also explain the selection of cities for branch offices in the

System’s early years. Further, we show that national banks favored cities for Reserve Banks

where they already had established correspondent relationships and, hence, the Federal Reserve

System was laid on the foundation of the existing interbank network.

       The RBOC placed more Reserve Banks in the eastern half of the nation than in the west

for two reasons: 1) Eastern cities received far more votes from national banks than cities in the

West and South; and 2) the Federal Reserve Act stipulated that each Reserve Bank have a

minimum capitalization paid in by its member banks. Given the sparse population of national

banks (and people) in the South and West, Federal Reserve districts in those regions had to be

larger than those of the Midwest and Northeast simply to amass enough capital to organize a




                                                 27
Reserve Bank. Further, by putting more Reserve Banks in the Northeast, the RBOC lessened to

some extent the dominance of banks in New York City, the nation’s financial capital.38

         The question remains whether there should now be more Reserve Banks in the West or

South, either by moving some from the Northeast or establishing new districts. The shift of

population and economic activity to the West and South since 1914 suggests that were the

locations of Reserve Banks and district boundaries set today, the Federal Reserve System map

would look very different. However, whereas the System’s structure has not changed

significantly in 100 years, both the mission and the technology of central banking have changed

dramatically. In the early days, when the Fed’s interactions with its member banks were

conducted mainly in person or through the mail, minimizing transportation times between

Reserve Bank offices and member banks was crucial for performing the System’s mission as

lender of last resort and for operating the payments system efficiently. Today, however, most of

the interactions between the Reserve Banks and commercial banks are electronic, so close

proximity to a Reserve Bank or branch is no longer as important for most member banks.

Moreover, the Reserve Banks now play a significant role in monetary policymaking—a concept

not contemplated by the Fed’s founders. Although the Fed’s decentralized structure arguably

promotes good policymaking by helping to ensure that different points of view are heard, and

that different regions of the country are represented, modern communications technology reduces

the need for physical proximity to a Reserve Bank. Perhaps more important than the physical

locations of Reserve Banks is the distribution of monetary policymaking authority on the Federal

Open Market Committee. Some argue that the Reserve Banks outside of New York should have

a stronger voice on the FOMC (e.g., Fisher, 2015), while others propose to weaken or remove

establishing a central bank that was dominated by either Washington or Wall Street.

altogether the Reserve Banks from monetary policymaking. Those who favor a continued or

expanded role for the Reserve Banks contend that the System’s regional diversity and political

independence contribute to better policymaking. A system that is responsive to differing

economic conditions that might exist across the regions of a large and diverse nation was

certainly a principle on which the Federal Reserve was established and remains relevant today.

Notes: The table presents the results of a linear probability model where the dependent variable is listed at the top of each column. The Reserve Bank City
regressions include only cities that requested a Reserve Bank, whereas as the Branch City regressions include all cities with an urban population above 30,000 in
1910 that were not chosen for a Reserve Bank. Huber–White standard errors are provided in brackets. * denotes significance at 10%; ** at 5% level and *** at
1% level.

Notes: The percentages are not mutually exclusive as a county could both be the closest and have the most correspondent links
with a given city. Counties with tie votes and those without votes are omitted. Correspondents in New York City, Chicago, and
St Louis are dropped from all cities. Correspondents from New York City are dropped from Chicago and St Louis. The
weighted average is obtained by taking the ratio of the total number of correct counties to the total number of counties, and is
thus a weighted average of the individual city fractions.
