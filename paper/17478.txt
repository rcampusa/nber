                                              ABSTRACT

We analyze the effects of a school-based incentive program on children's exercise habits. The program
offers children an opportunity to win prizes if they walk or bike to school during prize periods. We
use daily child-level data and individual fixed effects models to measure the impact of the prizes by
comparing behavior during prize periods with behavior during non-prize periods. Variation in the
timing of prize periods across different schools allows us to estimate models with calendar-date fixed
effects to control for day-specific attributes, such as weather and proximity to holidays. On average,
we find that being in a prize period increases riding behavior by sixteen percent, a large impact given
that the prize value is just six cents per participating student. We also find that winning a prize lottery
has a positive impact on ridership over subsequent weeks; consider heterogeneity across prize type,
gender, age, and calendar month; and explore differential effects on the intensive versus extensive
margins.

1         Introduction

The World Health Organization reports that increasingly sedentary lifestyles are “one of

the more serious yet insufficiently addressed public health problems of our time,” as they

lead to elevated risks of obesity, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, colon cancer, high blood

pressure, osteoporosis, lipid disorders, depression, and anxiety.1 As these health concerns

have gained prominence in policy discussions, researchers have recently begun to study how

health-related behaviors might be improved by altering incentives. In particular, researchers

have explored the role of incentives in the formation of exercise habits (Charness and Gneezy

2009), weight loss (Volpp et al. 2008; Cawley and Price 2011), and smoking cessation (Volpp

et al. 2009). However, very little research in this area has focused on children’s health-related

behaviors despite the fact that obesity rates have tripled among American youth over the

last thirty years. This paper aims to fill this important gap in the literature by considering

how an opportunity to win prizes affects children’s exercise habits.

        Specifically, we analyze the effects of a school-based incentive program that was imple-

mented with the intention of promoting physical activity through healthy modes of trans-

portation.2 At participating schools, principals specified “prize periods” which usually lasted

one week. Children who rode their bicycle to school each day of a prize period were entered

into a lottery to win a ten-dollar cash prize or a ten-dollar voucher to a local bicycle store.

We estimate the effects of the program with daily child-level data on which kids rode or

walked to school from seven schools in and around Boulder, Colorado, spanning the 2006-07

though 2009-2010 school years. Because we have longitudinal data and variation in the tim-

ing of prize periods across different schools, we are able to address two types of selection that

might otherwise bias the estimates. In particular, our preferred models exploit within-child

variation over time by including individual fixed effects in order to address the possibility

that the program affects the composition of children at the schools under consideration.

Further, our preferred models exploit variation in the timing of prize weeks across schools

by including exact-date fixed effects in order to address the possibility that school principals

chose prize weeks on the basis of weather forecasts or other day-specific attributes common

to the schools.

       Our study is motivated by two particularly salient statistics that suggest that the elementary-

school years are especially deserving of research. First, the obesity rate has risen more dra-

matically for elementary-school-aged children than it has risen for either older or younger

children.3 Second, the obesity-age profile is sharply positive during the elementary school

years and flat at older ages. In 2007-2008, for example, the obesity rate was 10.4 percent for

children aged two to five, 19.6 percent for children aged six to eleven, and 18.1 percent for

those aged twelve to nineteen. The pattern of slightly falling obesity rates from elementary-

school-ages to middle- and high-school ages has been quite stable since the late-1970s. In

contrast, the gap in obesity rates between pre-school-aged children and elementary-school-

aged children has changed dramatically over time. While the gap was virtually non-existent

in the 1960s, it has grown steadily over the past several decades. Today the obesity rate for
   3
     From 1963-1965 to 2007-2008, obesity rates rose from 5.0 percent to 10.4 percent for children aged two
to five, from 4.2 to 19.6 percent for children aged six to eleven, and from 6.6 to 18.1 percent for those aged
twelve to nineteen. These and other statistics mentioned in this paragraph are discussed from Ogden et al.
(2010) whose analysis uses data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).

                                                      2
elementary-school-aged children is nearly twice the rate for pre-school-aged children.

       Only one other study considers the effects of incentives on children’s health-related be-

haviors. In particular, Just and Price (2011) analyze the impact of incentives for healthy

eating. Their experiment, which provided rewards to children for eating fruits or vegetables

during five treatment days over a span of two to three weeks at fifteen schools, finds dra-

matic results—a reward valued at approximately 25 cents per child increases the fraction of

children eating fruits or vegetables by 27 percentage points (80 percent). Our study com-

plements Just and Price (2011) in several ways. Most obviously, they explore one of the two

recommended behavioral changes that have the potential to reduce obesity (diet), while we

explore the other (exercise). Further, both studies consider the efficacy of non-cash prizes

relative to cash prizes.4 In addition, while they consider a school-based incentives over a

relatively short time horizon, we consider an incentive program that spans several school

years. A challenge that both studies face is a lack of data on health outcomes, such as body

mass index, which would be useful in order to measure the extent to which the observed

behavioral improvements lead to improved health.

       We find that the incentive provided during prize periods increases the probability that

a child rides her bicycle to school by 3.9 percentage points, or 16.4 percent. Given that

prize value was small (ten dollars) and that the lottery aspect of the reward mechanism

meant that only one child was given such a prize (implying a prize value of six cents per

participating student), these results highlight a low-cost approach to promoting exercise
   4
     Just and Price (2011) also explore how the timing of the reward (immediately versus one month later)
affects behavior.




                                                   3
among children. We also find suggestive evidence that cash prizes have greater effects than

vouchers of equal value. Further, conditional on eligibility, we find that winning a prize

lottery has a persistent effect, motivating children to ride more often in subsequent weeks.

We also explore heterogeneity across age, gender, and the time of year and consider the

extent to which there are differential effects on the intensive margin versus the extensive

margin.

    The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the program and

data in greater detail. Section 3 reports the results of our empirical analysis. Lastly, Section

4 provides concluding remarks.




2     Program Design and Data Description

The intervention we consider was aimed at increasing physical activity among children by

promoting non-motorized transport to and from school. The incentive structure provided

by the program was as follows: in order to encourage children to exercise, those who rode or

walked to school every day during a pre-announced “prize period” had their names entered

into a drawing to win a prize. The prize, given to a single child at the end of each prize

period, was ten dollars in cash during the first two years of the program, but was replaced

by a ten-dollar voucher to neighborhood bicycle stores in subsequent years. In order to

encourage a broader base of winners, after a child won a drawing, she was ineligible for

future drawings if any children who fulfilled the requirements had not yet won a drawing.




                                               4
Prize periods were chosen throughout the year at the discretion of each school’s principal.5

More than 81 percent of prize periods spanned exactly five days, although shortened school

weeks, severe weather, and principal discretion led to some prize periods which lasted six

days (0.9 percent), four days (14.0 percent), three days (1.8 percent), and two days (1.2

percent).

       The data used in this study were collected as a part of the program’s implementation.

Information on gender and age was collected from the online registration form for the pro-

gram. Our data on active commuting behavior was collected by radio-frequency identification

(RFID) tags. These were affixed to each child’s bicycle helmet, so that her arrival to school

could be recorded by RFID readers installed close to the school’s bicycle racks. Once such

a tag was is in place, participating students needed only pass under a RFID reader in order

to register as having actively commuted in a given morning.6 While the program was con-

ceived around the idea of promoting activity through increased bicycle use, other forms of

active commuting (e.g., foot-powered scooters, pogo sticks, skateboards) were also allowed,

including walking. “Walkers” were also given RFID tags and were not distinguished from

“riders” in the data. In the text, we generally use ”bikers” and ”riding” since biking was

the dominant active commuting method.7

       Our data shows which days each student did and did not actively commute to school for

the duration of the program. Since it crucial to our ability to obtain a valid counterfactual for
   5
     We discuss the potential for this discretion to introduce bias—and the steps we take to address this
concern–below.
   6
     A video of RFID in action is available at http://www.streetfilms.org/boulder-goes-bike-platinum/. In
addition, parents could log into a password-protected website and manually enter their child as having
actively commuted to school if her child forgot to pass under the reader.
   7
     RFID tags cost $1.15 each, the reader costs $6,890, and annual annual maintenance costs $950.

the riding behavior observed during prize periods, it is important to note that children had

an incentive to report whether they actively commuted to school during non-prize periods

as well. In particular, the program also included end-of-year rewards based on cumulative

activity throughout the year—as students accumulated more non-motorized trips to school,

they became eligible for increasingly valuable prizes at an end-of-year drawing, with top

prizes including iPods R and digital cameras.8 As such, our estimates should be interpreted

as the effect of the ten-dollar incentive over and above the effects of the end-of-year incentives.

We also note that administrators reminded students that cheating in the active-commuting

initiative was equivalent to cheating on a test and, at some schools, students were required

to sign an honor code claiming that they would not cheat.9

       Our sample includes all children with at least one recorded active commute at seven

participating schools within a 15-mile radius of Boulder, Colorado.10 All of the schools

include the children in Kindergarten through sixth grade, although two schools also include

children in grades seven and eight. Overall, the data spans the four school years running

from the fall of 2006 to the spring of 2010 but, because the program was not implemented

at every school in every year, the duration of the time series varies from school to school. In

particular, the sample includes four years of data for three schools; three years of data for

one school; two years of data for one school; and one year of data for two schools. These

eight schools provide 1,589 child observations, 3,113 child-by-school-year observations, and
   8
     One school which we include in the analysis focused solely on end-of-year awards. As such, it serves
solely to help identify day-of-year fixed effects.
   9
     In the end, administrators report that they have not found cheating to be a problem.
  10
     More data was made available but inconsistencies in the application of treatment made the value of their
inclusion questionable. For example, in one school, prizes were promised by the principal but not awarded
to eligible children.

536,613 child-by-exact-day observations.

    Summary statistics for the sample are shown in Table 1. 57 percent of the children in

the sample are male and the average age is approximately nine. Because the program was

introduced to different schools at different times, some schools contribute more observations

than others and a relatively large share of the data comes from later years. Approximately

half of the observations correspond to prize periods, suggesting that principals were quite

active in implementing the program. However, just 20 percent of observations correspond

to prize periods with cash rewards, because a majority of the data comes from later years

when vouchers were used instead of cash. On average, across prize periods and non-prize

periods, children in the sample chose to ride to school a quarter of the time. The next section

explores the extent to which prize periods had an effect on the decision to ride.




3     Empirical Analysis

3.1    Overall Effects of the Program

To begin, we focus only on within-child variation over time to estimate the effects of being

in a prize period on the probability of riding on a particular day. In particular, we estimate

the linear-probability model,



                                Rideid = βP rizeid + αiy + uid ,                           (1)




                                               7
where Rideid is an indicator variable equal to one if child i actively commutes to school

on calendar day d; P rizeid is an indicator variable equal to one if there is a prize period

ongoing on date d at child i’s school; αiy are child-by-academic-year fixed effects; and uid

is a random error term. The set of child-by-academic-year fixed effects control for all of a

child’s characteristics in a given year, including the characteristics of her school, that might

be related to both their probability of riding and the specification of prize periods. This

accounts for several sources of potential sources bias. For example, with these fixed effects

in the model, the estimates would continue to be unbiased even if schools where riding to

school was very popular had more prize periods. Implicitly, this model uses each child’s

probability of riding during non-prize periods as the counterfactual for her probability of

riding during prize periods. The identifying assumption, which will be relaxed in subsequent

specifications, is that principals do not systematically choose to have prize periods at times

of the year when children are systematically more/less likely to ride to school. We have

estimated the standard errors separately clustering on the individual, school-by-year, and

school—we report the most conservative estimates which cluster at the school level.

   The estimated effect of prize periods based on Equation (1) is reported in Column 1

of Table 2. This estimate suggests that students are 2.0 percentage points more likely to

ride on during prize periods than non-prize periods, although the estimate is not statistically

significant at conventional levels. In Column 2, we include day-of-the-week fixed effects. This

controls for any direct effects of particular days on ridership, but also accounts for potentially

non-random prize-period lengths (i.e., those not falling on the usual Monday–Friday pattern)



                                                8
that would otherwise influence the estimated treatment effect. These controls do not change

the estimated effect of prize periods.11

       It is important to note that any systematic relationship between weather patterns and

the specification of prize periods may bias the estimated effects presented in columns 1 and

2. The direction of this potential bias is unclear, however. Although students are likely to

ride less when weather is bad, principals may respond by increasing or decrease the incentive

to ride during these times. We address this potential issue in Column 3 by including year-by-

month fixed effects and in Column 4 by including year-by-week fixed effects. These estimates

suggest that the prize periods significantly increase the probability a child actively commutes

by 4.2–4.8 percentage points, or 17.6–20.4 percent. That these estimated effects are larger

than the estimated effects in columns 1 and 2 suggests that prize periods tend to be more

frequent during months (weeks) of the year when riding behavior tends to be low.

       Our preferred model takes the controls for time of year as far as the data allows by

including exact-date fixed effects in the empirical model:



                                 Rideid = βP rizeid + αiy + γd + uid .                                  (2)



In this model, the estimates exploit variation in the timing of prize periods across different

schools. As such, the estimates use the change in riding behavior from day g to day h at a

schools where days g and h were treated similarly (i.e., both occurred during prize periods or

neither occurred during prize periods) as a counterfactual for the change observed at schools
  11
   The estimates on each day of the week (not shown) reveal that there tends to be relatively-high ridership
on Wednesdays and low ridership on Mondays and Fridays.


                                                     9
in which one occurs during a prize period and the other does not. The estimate based on this

model is are shown in Column 5. This estimate implies that prize periods increase ridership

by 3.9 percentage points, or 16.4 percent.12



3.2       Effects of Cash Prizes Versus Voucher Prizes

As described above, prize winners were given cash during the first two years of the program

while they were given certificates worth ten dollars at nearby bicycle stores in subsequent

years. Thus, the estimated effects discussed in the previous section represent a weighted

average of the effects of the different reward schemes. In order to explore the extent to

which the cash prizes used in the first two years of the program had different effects from

the vouchers used in subsequent years, we add to the empirical models discussed above an

interaction between an indicator for being in a prize week and an indicator for years in which

cash prizes were awarded. As such, our preferred model is



                     Rideid = βP rizeid + δP rizeid × Cashy + αiy + γd + eid ,                            (3)



where β is the effect of prize periods in which the prize is a voucher and δ is the additional

effect of prize periods in which there is a cash prize the effect of over and above the effect of

prize periods in which the prize is a voucher.

       Panel A of Table 3 presents the results of this exercise. Although it is not statistically
  12
     Although the estimate only changes slightly across the specification that controls for year-by-week fixed
effects and the specification that controls for exact-date fixed effects, we note that such a change is not
unreasonable given that prize-periods did not always span the five days of a week.



                                                     10
significant, our preferred estimate in Column 5, which includes child-by-year and exact-date

fixed effects, suggests that cash prizes induce levels of active commuting approximately four-

and-a-half-times higher than voucher prizes. The point estimates imply that the opportunity

to win a voucher increases the probability a child rides by 3.2 percentage points (13.6 percent)

while the opportunity to win cash induces a 14.4 percentage-point increase (61 percent). This

finding is consistent with Just and Price (2011) who also find children to be most responsive to

cash, in addition the general expectation that individuals should prefer unrestricted rewards

to those that impose restrictions on use (Waldfogel 1993). Further, to impose restrictions that

relate closely to the activity being incentivized—recall, the vouchers were only redeemable

at area bicycle stores—may be even more costly. For example, whether vouchers that could

be used to purchase toys or candy would yield the same drop off in incentive power remains

an open question.

   Because cash prizes were awarded in the first two years of the program and vouchers in

the second two, the reduced incentive of vouchers found in Panel A might actually reflect a

more-general dampening effect of the program over time. In order to explore rule out this

explanation, we estimate



 Rideid = βP rizeid +δP rizeid ×Cashy +ηP rizeid ×Y earsOf P rogramid +αiy +γd +eid , (4)



where the variable Y earsOf P rogram is the number years since the program was imple-

mented at an individual’s school. This equation separately estimates the additional effec-

tiveness of cash (δ) and the extent to which the program becomes more or less effective over


                                              11
time (η). The results of this analysis, shown in Panel B, indicate that additional effect of

cash is not due to changes in the effect of the program over time. Further, they suggest that

the efficacy of the program does not diminish in subsequent years after introduction.



3.3    Heterogeneity Across Gender and Age

Obesity rates vary with gender and age, and in Table 4 we look at whether the program

had heterogeneous effects on riding by gender and age. First, columns 1 and 2 estimate

the effects separately for males and females using our preferred model. These estimates are

nearly identical. Both male and female children ride 24 percent of the time on non-prize-

period days, the opportunity to win a prize increases male ridership 4.0 percentage points

and increases female ridership 3.7 percentage points. These estimates correspond to effects

of 16.9 percent and 15.6 percent, respectively.

   In columns 3 through 7 we report the estimated effects for subsamples stratified by age in

two-year increments. Across these columns, prizes appear to have similar effects across ages

five through ten, increasing ridership 4.1 to 4.5 percentage points. However, the program

appears to lose power at older ages, as the estimated treatment effect is 3.5 percentage points

for eleven- and twelve-year-olds and only 1.2 percentage-points (and no longer statistically

significant) for thirteen- and fourteen-year olds.




                                              12
3.4       Heterogeneity By Time of Year

Incentives might have different effects at different times of the year, perhaps because of

whether or spillovers from school holidays. Figure 1 plots the estimated effect of prize

periods by the month of the year. The estimation strategy continues to control for child-by-

year and exact day fixed effects, but breaks the estimated effect of prize weeks out by month

with a series of month indicator variables interacted with prize week status:



                         Rideid = βm M onthm × P rizeid + αiy + γd + eid .                             (5)



       In Figure 1, we present estimated-treatment effects (and associated 95-percent confidence

intervals) for each month of the year. These estimates reveal a systematic pattern, with the

strongest effects occurring towards the beginning and end of the school year. Although we

cannot rule out other mechanisms, this may be due to increased costs of active commuting

during the winter. In support of this hypothesis, the estimated-prize-week effect is much

larger in November than October while November had far less precipitation than October

during the years we consider.13
  13
    In particular, Boulder, Colorado had 3.71 inches of precipitation in October of 2006 versus 0.74 inches
in November of 2006, 1.38 inches of precipitation in October of 2007 versus 0.47 inches in November
of 2007, 1.18 inches of precipitation in October of 2008 versus 0.13 inches in November of 2008, and
3.26 inches of precipitation in October of 2009 versus 0.93 inches in November of 2009. These and

3.5    Effects on the Extensive Versus Intensive Margins

In order to consider the intensive and extensive margins of commuting behavior, we collapse

the data to the child-by-week level. As such, we regress measures of activity on whether or

not the week corresponded to a prize period. This analysis is restricted to five-school-day

weeks in which there was no prize period or in which a prize period spanned the entirety

of the week. We continue to use a linear probability model and to control for student-level

characteristics in a flexible manner by including student-year and week fixed effects in the

empirical model. As outcome variables, we use the probability that a child rode to school

more than D times in a given week for D = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}.

   Column 1 of Table 4 focuses on the extensive margin, estimating the impact of a prize

period on the probability that a child rides to school at least once in a given week. The

estimates imply that prize weeks raise the probability a child rides one or more times by

approximately 10 percentage points, which corresponds a 24 percent increase over non-prize

weeks where 41 percent of the children ride at least once. Given the outcome variable under

consideration, this estimate can be interpreted as evidence that the incentive induces children

to ride who typically would not.

   Columns 2 though 5 of Table 4 focus on the intensive margin, sequentially estimating

the effect on the probability that a child rides to school more than one, two, three, and four

times in a given week. Although the estimated percentage point impacts tend to fall moving

from left to right, which suggests that the incentive has relatively weak impacts at higher

margins, the story is different when one considers the baseline probabilities with which chil-



                                              14
dren tend to ride more than D days in a given weak for each D. In particular, the percent

impacts increase monotonically in D. These estimates suggest that prize periods increase

the probability that a child rides to school five days in a week by 65.9 percent. The growing

percentage impact across columns 2 though 5 indicates that there are disproportionate ef-

fects of prize periods on children’s commuting behavior—the number of children riding five

days is increased proportionally more than the number riding four or more days, the number

of children riding four or more days is increased proportionally more than the number of

three or more days, and so on.




3.6    Effects of Winning A Prize Lottery

In this subsection, we analyze the effect of winning a prize lottery on a child’s subsequent

activity. Because there are multiple mechanisms through which winning may affect a child’s

riding behavior, it is not clear ex ante what effects one should anticipate. As described in

Section 2, once a child has won a prize she cannot be selected in future drawings, unless

there are no other eligible children who have not yet won a prize. As such, winning may

reduce a child’s subsequent riding behavior by reducing the impact of prize periods. On the

other hand, being rewarded for their activity may lead children to associate more positive

feelings with riding to school, inducing them to ride more often.

   In order to measure the effect of winning a prize drawing, we estimate a model with a

series of indicator variables that reflect whether a child won a prize in the past fifteen days in



                                               15
addition to a series of indicator variables that reflect whether a child was was eligible to win

a prize (by riding every day of a prize period) in the past fifteen days. That is, we estimate


                           15
                           X                      15
                                                  X
                Rideid =         δk W ini,d−k +         βk Eligiblei,d−k + γiy + γd + eid ,   (6)
                           k=1                    k=1



where Rideid is an indicator variable that equals one if child i rides on exact date d, W ini,d−k

is an indicator variable that equals one if child i won a prize drawing k days ago, and

Eligiblei,d−k is an indicator variable equal to one if child i was eligible to win a prize drawing

held k days ago, while γiy and γd are child-by-year and exact-day fixed effects, respectively.

Essentially, this model compares the activity of prize-drawing winners to the activity of

children who were eligible but not selected in a prize drawing.

    We present these estimates in Figure 2. They show that being selected in a prize drawing

has a positive impact on children’s activity. Further, the effect appears to persist for at least

two weeks. Beyond two weeks, the effect appears to fade to zero.




4     Conclusion

In this paper, we have assessed the efficacy of a school-based program for promoting physical

activity among children. Using data generated as part of the Freiker/Boltage pilot program,

our findings indicate that children are highly responsive to small weekly prize lotteries that

reward active commuting to school. Although there is suggestive evidence that ten-dollar-

cash prizes have the greatest effect, ten-dollar vouchers to a local bicycle store increase



                                                    16
increase ridership by 13.6 percent. Prize periods encourage ridership along the extensive

margin and all intensive margins, increasing the number of children who ride once per week,

twice per week, and so on. In addition, winning a prize lottery also motivates children to

increase their activity even though, under the program rules, it substantially reduces their

probability of winning future lotteries.

   To our knowledge, we provide the first systematic study of the effects of economic incen-

tives on children’s exercise behavior. The results suggest that school-based initiatives can

be successfully employed as a tool to increase physical activity, even with very inexpensive

rewards. Future work will be necessary to explore whether children respond similarly in

alternative settings and whether alternative reward mechanisms might be more effective.

Notes: All estimates are based on linear probability models in which an indicator variable
for being in a prize period is interacted with each month of the year, in addition to child-
by-school-year fixed effects and exact-date fixed effects. 95-percent confidence intervals are
shown around point estimates.

Notes: All estimates are based on linear probability models that include a set of indicator
variables for having won a prize drawing k school days ago for k = {1, 2, . . . , 15}, in addition
to a similar set of indicator variables for having been eligible to win a prize drawing in prior
days, child-by-school-year fixed effects and exact-date fixed effects. 95-percent confidence
intervals are shown around point estimates.
