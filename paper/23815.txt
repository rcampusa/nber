Search Engines and Data Retention: Implications for Privacy and Antitrust

September 2017
JEL No. K21,K24,K40

                                         ABSTRACT

This paper investigates whether larger quantities of historical data affect a firm's ability to
maintain market share in Internet search. We study whether the length of time that search engines
retained their server logs affected the apparent accuracy of subsequent searches. Our analysis
exploits changes in these policies prompted by the actions of policymakers. We find little
empirical evidence that reducing the length of storage of past search engine searches affected the
accuracy of search. Our results suggest that the possession of historical data confers less of an
advantage in market share than is sometimes supposed. Our results also suggest that limits on
data retention may impose fewer costs in instances where overly long data retention leads to
privacy concerns such as an individual's ``right to be forgotten."

I.        Introduction

Currently, Internet search attracts legal scrutiny on both sides of the Atlantic (Goldfarb and
Tucker, 2011a). In this heavily concentrated market, one firm, Google, accounts for 70% of
the search market in the U.S. and over 90% of the search market in the European Union.1
Public and legal controversy surround why and how such dominance in the market may arise.
         One argument presented in the policy debate is that the ability of search engines to store
historical data on its users’ searches may confer long-term advantages. These advantages
subsequently allow a dominant search engine to maintain its market share in the long-term.
This practice of “data retention” has been quite controversial. Proponents indicate that the
storage of data is necessary to provide high quality searches to users in the future. Critics
allege that any benefits from such “network effects” in search are minimal and are outweighed
by a loss in privacy and data security and accompanied by an increase in antitrust concerns.
         This antitrust debate reflects how data retention is deeply intertwined with legal devel-
opments in privacy and data security. At the moment, much privacy regulation focuses on
obtaining informed consent, and less emphasis exists over how long data may be stored after
a person’s consent has been acquired. However, the length of time of data storage is key
for both privacy protection and the security of an individual’s data. Successful attempts at
de-anonymizing clickstream or search engine log data have relied on providing a history or
time series of people’s searches or web browsing behavior that did not reveal an identifiable
pattern.
         Despite the policy debate and interest surrounding search engines and data retention, no
empirical work exists to date on the effects of data retention on the accuracy or quality of
search results. When establishing the legal framework for data retention, policymakers must
     1
    Pouros (2010) reports Google’s market share for the five most populous countries in the European Union:
United Kingdom (93%), France (96%), Germany (97%), Spain (97%), and Italy (97%). Population measures
were obtained from nationsonline.org, and the list of countries within the European Union is obtained from
the official European Union website.

weigh the benefits and costs of data retention to firms, private citizens, and society, so it is
important to establish first whether and how much benefit exists from the practice of data
retention.
    We report on the results of our empirical study to measure the benefits that companies
may receive from having large quantities of data. Specifically, we use variation in guidelines
surrounding the length of time that search engines can store an individual’s data as an
exogenous shifter of the amount of data available to a search engine.2 We then study how
the accuracy of search results changes before and after the policy change. We measure the
accuracy of search results by whether the customer navigates to a new website or whether
the customer had to repeat the search either on that search engine or another search engine.
    We find no empirical evidence of a negative effect from the reduction of data retention
on the accuracy of search results. Our findings are apparent in the raw data as well as in
a regression analysis of panel data with fixed effects to control for changes over time and
across search engines. Our regression analysis suggests not only insignificance but also that
the likely economic effects of the imprecisely measured coefficients are small.
    We believe that absence of a decline in the accuracy of searches suggests little long-term
advantage in market share bestowed by longer periods of data retention. Some potential
explanations exist for the lack of an advantage. First, historic data may be less useful for
accurately predicting current news than is sometimes supposed. Given that recent develop-
ments in search have highlighted consumers’ desire for more current and recent news, large
of amounts of historic data may not be useful for relevancy. Second, the precise algorithms
that underly search engines algorithms are shrouded in secrecy. Third, a substantial fraction
of searches are unique: 20% of searches that Google receives each day are searches that
Google has not received in the last 90 days (AdWords, 2008). Of course, we also recognize
   2
     The term “exogenous” shifter refers to how differences in the length of data retention policies are inde-
pendent of the outcome of the policy.

the possibility that our measure of search accuracy may be too direct to pick up nuances in
the precise quality of search results.
      Our results have implications for the new debate in the legal literature on the right to be
forgotten (Rosen, 2012). In the European Union in particular, this “right to be forgotten,”
has been gaining increasing traction as a potential foundation of privacy regulation (Bennett,
2012)3 . As pointed out by Korenhof et al. (2014) the timing of data retention plays a part
in this debate as longer periods of data retention make it difficult for digitally recorded
actions to be forgotten. As US policymakers, companies, and consumers keep an eye towards
developments in the EU, concerns exist over whether legal actions abroad could “take over
the American Internet, too” (Dewey, 2015).
      Part II provides the background for this debate, including context on the existing regu-
latory landscape, controversies over search data, and the changes in data retention policies
that we study. Part III describes our study design and methodology and presents our empir-
ical results. Part V discusses our results and their implications. Finally, Part VI concludes
with recommendations for future study.

II.      Background and Institutional Setting

A.      Existing Regulatory Landscape

Firms’ policies on data retention are deeply intertwined with broad legal and policy con-
cerns over privacy, security, and antitrust. Privacy laws encompass any policy or legislation
that governs the use and storage of personal information about individuals whether by the
government, public, or private entities. As Hetcher (2001) points out, the Internet can often
lead to a “threat to personal privacy” due to the “ever-expanding flow of personal data
online.” This notion of privacy and security of personal data has become one of the more
significant public policy concerns generated by the Internet, leading to “legal and regulatory

                                                     4
challenges” (Salbu, 1998).
      One challenge faced by the US legal system is that currently most privacy laws at the
federal level predate the technologies, such as the Internet, that “raise privacy issues” (Salbu,
2014). In recent years, innovations such as behavioral advertising, location-based services,
social media, mobile apps, and mobile payments lead to heated debates over an individual’s
privacy and security. The issue is pressing among lawmakers, as the GAO prepared a report
in conjunction with the inquiry by Senator Rockefeller over data collection for marketing
purposes.4 According to Salbu (2014), the report suggests that the “US privacy debate will
increasingly look to international standards and privacy concepts.” For instance, the report
cites the Fair Information Practice Principles as the de facto international standard.
      Consequently, the need for understanding the effects of data retention on search quality
is a crucial component for the debate. Given that most innovations and regulations occur in
the EU, we study here the effects of changes in those policies abroad and their implications
for the US Internet.
      Our study is related to a privacy concern that began abroad and quickly spread to US
policy debate: the right to be forgotten. The right to be forgotten “soared into public view”
internationally recently when the European Court of Justice “ordered Google to grant a
Spanish man’s request to delete search results that linked to 1998 news stories about the
man’s unpaid debts” (Roberts, 2015).5 While at present no formal right to make requests
to delete data from the Internet exist in the US, proponents of privacy laws argue that such
a right to be forgotten exists in the US through privacy torts and credit reporting rules.
      As a result, companies are often left to determine their own policies for the storage and
use of data. Differences in policies across companies may reflect external pressure such as
court rulings and public sentiment. In our empirical study below, we will use variation in

data-retention policies from public pressure by the European Commission.

B.        Changes in Data Retention Policies

Table 1 summarizes the variation in data-retention policies that we use in our study. The
first two changes in search data retention that we study were prompted by pressure from the
European Commission’s data protection advisory group, the Article 29 Working Party. In
April 2008, the group recommended that search engines reduce the time they retained their
data logs.
         The first search engine to respond to this challenge was Yahoo!. Yahoo’s Chief Trust
Officer Ann Toth declared that its decision to anonymize its user personal information after
90 days “set a new industry standard for protecting consumer privacy. This policy represents
Yahoo!’s assessment of the minimum amount of time we need to retain data in order to
                                                                                                 6
respond to the needs of our business while deepening our trusted relationship with users.”
         In January 2010, the chief privacy strategist at Microsoft announced that Microsoft would
delete the Internet protocol address associated with search queries at six months rather than
18 months.7

                               Table 1: Timeline of policy changes
                        Date       Search Engine Change in Storage Policy
                    December 2008 Yahoo!            13 to 3 months

                     January 2010     Bing             18 to 6 months

                      April 2011      Yahoo!           3 to 18 months


         In the last example, we study a change in Yahoo! policy where they increased the amount
of data they kept. Yahoo claimed that “going back” to 18 months was required in order
to “keep up” in the competitive environment against other search engines. Yahoo! offers

highly personalized services that include shopping recommendation as well as customized
news pages and search tools that “can anticipate what users are looking for.” According to
Anne Toth, Chief Trust Officer at Yahoo!, “To pick out patterns for such personalization,
Yahoo needs to analyze a larger set of data on user behavior.” Since this change was prompted
by internal competitive motivations rather than exogenous changes in the strictness of EU
enforcement of the data directive, we use this policy as a robustness check to our main
analyses.8
      In sum, our study focuses on changes in the data retention policies. We observe changes
in the length of data retention for Yahoo! and Bing. Since Google did not change its data
retention policy, we do not observe changes in Google’s policy.
      It is also important to highlight that not all de-identification and anonymization proce-
dures were the same. Figure 1 is a representation of Search Engine policies as of February
2009 by Microsoft. The figure makes a distinction between de-identification (where the abil-
ity to match search queries with other identifying information is removed) and anonymization
which involves the removal of IP addresses. In general the policies we studied were targeted
towards anonymization. The policies come in the wake of the release of the AOL search
engine log query data for 658,000 users within the US that demonstrated how a series of
search engines queries over time could reveal an individual’s identity. For example, reporters
were able to identify Thelma Arnold, a 62-year-old widow who lives in Lilburn, Georgia as
AOL searcher “No. 4417749” from the content of her searches.9

III.      Empirical Analysis

A.      Study Design and Methodology

Our study design relies on natural experiments to exploit changes in the data-retention
policies of major search engines. A natural experiment is a situation in which entities are
randomly exposed to a treatment or control policy.10 In our study, we compare companies
with different policies of the length of data retention due to external pressure from policy-
makers. The treatment group here is the search engine with the change in the length of data
retention, and the control group consists of search engines with no change in data-retention
policies. The idea is that the control group will allow us to control for other seasonal patterns
in users’ search behavior that are unrelated to the change in data retention. In this way,
we will not attribute spurious factors to the change in data retention. In other words, the
control group describes the counterfactual of how we would expect the treatment group to
behave in the absence of the policy change.
      Given recent changes in data-retention policies at major search engines, this methodology
provides us with several experiments that we study. We describe the search data that we
use below, and then we report in the raw data as well as regression analysis of the policy
changes. Our regression analysis models the outcome variable (a measure of the quality of
search) as a function of other explanatory variables.

B.     Search Data

Our analysis relies on data from Experian Hitwise. Hitwise assembles aggregate data using
the website logs from Internet Service Providers. The information is combined with data
from opt-in panels to create a geographically diverse sample with usage data from 25 million
people worldwide.11 Since we study policy changes that affect search engines in Europe, we

use data from Hitwise on the search behavior of UK residents.
   We are interested in whether a change in policies of data retention affected the accuracy
of search. As a measure of accuracy, we examine whether a consumer repeats a search or
navigates to a new site. Hitwise reports the top 20 sites that users navigate to after visiting
a particular site. We observe the fraction of outgoing traffic to each of these “downstream”
sites from each of the major search engines during a given week.
   We restrict our sample to outgoing traffic from the three major search engines: Yahoo!,
Google, and Bing. We identify which downstream sites are search sites by examining sites
that contain the domain of any major search engine. Our category of search sites excludes
mail, book, or wiki sites, which serve a different purpose than general search. We collect
data for the two months before and after each policy change in our sample.
   Table 2 reports the summary statistics for the downstream search sites in our sample.
Each observation in our final sample represents a search engine-website-week combination.
For instance, we can observe the percent of outgoing traffic from Yahoo! Search that navi-
gated to a particular search site during the first week of February 2009. The average search
site received 0.85 percent of all outgoing clicks from a search engine.

C.    Graphical and Regression Analysis

As a preliminary analysis, we explore the change in traffic to search sites before and after
each major policy change. Figure 2 summarizes the fraction of traffic to search engines
among the top 20 downstream sites from Bing and other search engines. The pre- and post-
periods refer to the time before and after the Bing’s policy change from 18 to 6 months of
data retention. As seen in the figure, traffic to search sites remained relatively constant over
this period of time.
     In Figure 3, we summarize the fraction of traffic to all downstream search sites before and
after Yahoo’s policy change from 13 to 3 months of data retention. Total traffic to search
sites from Yahoo! remained relatively unchanged over this period compared to traffic from
other search engines.

                                                    13
   The figures suggest that changes in data retention policies did not shift downstream traffic
from search engines. To formalize the analysis, we run difference-in-differences regressions
at the website level for downstream traffic to the top 20 firms for each of the policy changes
in our sample. For instance, to analyze Bing’s policy change, we estimate the percentage of
visits to website i after visiting search engine j in week t:


                  %visitsijt = β0 + β1 P ostt × Bingj + δj + αi + ρt + ijt


where δ is fixed effect for the originating search engine j, and P ost is an indicator variable
equal to 1 for the weeks of Bing’s change in storage policy. The controls α are downstream-
website fixed effects, which allow each website to have a specific intercept in the regression
line. The controls ρt are weekly fixed effects to allow each week to have a specific intercept,
since variation in the volume and interest of searches may occur across weeks. The coefficient
β1 on the interaction term P ost×Bing measures the effect of change in Bing’s storage policy
on subsequent visits to search sites with the corresponding change in search sites from traffic
originating on Yahoo! or Google as a control. We estimate this specification using ordinary
least squares and cluster our standard errors at the website level to avoid the downward bias
reported by Bertrand et al. (2004).
   To summarize, the regression model describes the relationship between the dependent
or outcome variable and a group of explanatory variables. Our coefficient of interest β1
measures the extent to which storage policy may increase or decrease subsequent visits to
search sites. If the coefficient is positive, this suggests that reducing the length of data
retention increased the number of repeat searches on the search engine, i.e., the quality of
search results decreased. If the coefficient is negative, this suggests that reducing the length
of data retention decreased the number of repeat searches on the search engine, i.e., the
quality of search results increased.

scribed in Schwartz and Seaman (2013), “statistical significance is the probability that an
observed relationship is not due to chance.”12 If a coefficient is not statistically significant,
this means that we cannot reject the hypothesis that the coefficient is equal to zero, i.e., the
policy had no effect on the outcome variable.
       We report our results in Table 3 for the specification as described by equation (1). We
run a similar regression analyzing the effect of Yahoo!’s policy change, and we report those
results in Table 4. Both tables indicate that the change in storage policy did not have an
effect on downstream visits to search sites. The estimated effect is small and statistically
insignificant. To rule out possible delays in implementation, we run our regressions using
varying windows of 2, 4, and 6 months.

     See Getting Started with Statistics Concepts. “A p-value of less than 0.05 is usually considered statisti-
cally significant....(“When a result has less than a 5 percent change of having been observed but is observed
anyways, it is said to be statistically significant.”) A 5% probability is equal to a p-value of 0.05 or less.
Results with a p-value of less than 0.01 are considered highly statistically significant...(a 1% chance “repre-
sents a ‘higher’ level of significance because it indicates a less probable outcome and hence a more rigorous
statistical test.”

D.     Robustness Check

As a robustness check, we examine a third policy change by Yahoo!, which lengthened the
data retention period from 3 to 18 months. The policy change contrasts with the two policy
changes in the prior section, which decreased the length of data retention. Reassuringly, we
find that our results are also statistically insignificant.

IV.     Discussion and Policy Implications

Our findings suggest that long periods of data storage do not confer advantages in search
quality, which is an often-cited benefit of data retention by companies. Of course, a few
caveats exist. First, our study focuses on blanket policies by firms towards data retention
policies and finds little observable effects on search accuracy as measured by the need to
repeat searches. However, we do want to highlight that the kind of policies studied in this
paper are very different from the recent cases concerning the right to be forgotten in the
European Union which have focused on the individual rather than blanket data retention
policies.13

                                                   17
   Furthermore, our finding of little effect of longer periods of data retention contrasts with
other work that has found significant costs from different types of privacy regulation on
commercial outcomes (Miller and Tucker, 2009; Goldfarb and Tucker, 2011b, 2012). We
recognize that the difference may reflect the importance of data recency and current results
to the search engine business model.
   Our findings also suggest important policy implications. Unlike the EU, the US does not
have a “single overarching privacy law.”14 If long periods of data retention do not generate
higher quality of searches, this suggests that the costs of privacy laws for users and companies
may be lower than otherwise presumed. The debate thus far has centered on whether more
privacy is worth the cost. Our results suggest that the costs of privacy may be lower than
currently perceived.
   Privacy concepts differ between the US and other legal regimes in the EU (Laux, 2007).
In the EU, the user owns a “set of legal rights entitling him to control data that are describing
him, regardless of who had access to the data.” In the US, whoever has rightfull access to
the data “owns” the data. While our results do not necessarily suggest that privacy concepts
in the US need to change, our results suggest that other policy innovations such as consent
use may be useful. In the EU, a consent requirement allows a user to prevent any use of the
data that he or she does not agree to. This notion is similar to intellectual property rights,
e.g., Copyright, Patent, and Trademark rights. Alternatively, policymakers may choose to
adopt blanket policies that directly govern the length of data retention.
   In addition, our empirical results contribute to the antitrust debate over search engine
dominance. We do not find evidence of an advantage in search quality for search engines
that adopt longer periods of data retention. This suggests that a dominant search engine
with a large fraction of market share does not necessarily maintain its dominance in the long-

term due to its access of historical data on users. Of course, we do not rule out that other
antitrust concerns may exist as to why market concentration remains so high in Internet
search markets.

V.      Conclusion and Recommendations for Future Study

This paper investigates whether retention of large sets of data by firms that offer Internet
search provide measurable changes to their performance from the perspective of consumers.
Specifically, we study how the length of time that search engines retained their server logs
affected the apparent accuracy of subsequent searches. Our analysis exploits changes in these
policies prompted by the actions of the European Commission. We find little empirical
evidence that reducing the length of storage of past search engine searches affected the
accuracy of search. Our results suggest that the possession of historical data confers less of
an advantage to firms who own the data than is sometimes supposed.
     Our results also suggest that restrictions to data retention provoked by privacy concerns
may impose fewer costs if directed at limits on the recency of data (e.g, “right to be forgotten”
policies). More generally, the length of data retention has become an issue in this debate over
privacy (Korenhof et al., 2014). The question is whether the benefits of privacy (less data
retention) for consumers outweigh any potential costs to consumers (lower quality search
results). Our study suggests that retaining data for shorter periods of time does not lead to
lower quality searches; in other words, we do not find a cost to privacy in our setting.
     Several avenues beyond the scope of this study exist for future research. The first is that
it is not clear that search engine responsiveness to a search query is the only area where
consumer might benefit from a search engine retaining data. Other benefits may include
testing new algorithms or fraud prevention. The second is that the policy changes we study
occurred in Bing and Yahoo!. Unsurprisingly, these two search engines lacked the market
share of Google and were experimenting with differentiating themselves via user privacy in


                                               19
order to try and regain market share. Consequently, we study the effects of a reduction in
data retention for firms that were not the market leader. If in the future, Google changes
its data retention policy, this would a useful exercise for study. The third avenue for future
research is that we do not know whether longer term effects exist due to the change in
retention policies. Our data is truncated partly because Yahoo! reversed its previous data
retention policy.
   Given several interesting directions for future study, we believe that our study is a useful
first step in measuring the effect of data retention policies on consumer behavior.
