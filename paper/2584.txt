         The Role of Export Subsidies When Product Quality Is Unknown




                                  ABSTRACT


         We explore in this paper the role of export subsidies when goods
   arriving from foreign countries are  initiallyof unknown quality to
   domestic consumers, who learn about  their qualityonly through
   consumption.   If,when confronted with such goods, consumers view price
   as a signal of quality, a role for export subsidies can arise. In
   particular, we show that absent export subsidies, entry of high quality
   firms may be blocked by their inability to sell at prices reflecting
   their true quality. Export subsidies enable high quality producers to
   begin exporting profitably even while unable to credibly convey their
   high quality to consumers in the "introductory" period. Thus, in
   breaking the entry barrier for high quality firms, export subsidies can
   raise average quality in the merket and a welfare—improving role for
   export subsidies emerges. Moreover, even when high quality firms find
   it possible to signal their high quality to consumers through an
   introductory pricing strategy, a role for government policy can arise:
   the signal (low Introductory price) represents a  transferof surplus
   from foreign producers to domestic consumers which, as we show below,
   can be avoided with an appropriate export tax/subsidy polIcy,

        Recent advances in the theory      of international trade     have shed   new

light   on   the reasons for and effects of export subsidies.         One body of

literature focuses on cross—market effects of export subsidies (see,              for
example, Kemp, 1966, 1969: Jones, 1967; Brecher and Feenstra, 1983:

Feenstra, 1096: and Itoh     an   'iyoo,    1087).    These models share the

characteristic that the subsidy—induced terms—of—trade loss in one

market is offset by    a   terms—of—trade gain in another, raising the

possibility of national benefit from a policy of export subsidization.

Another body of literature, as reviewed by Brander (1986), has focused

primarily on the role of export        subsidies   as a means to 'enhance the

strategic position of domestic firms engaged in competition for world

markets with foreign rivals" (p. 26).         This 'profit—shifting" motive has

been the subject of a large number of recent          articles.

        We explore in this pacer a different motive for export subsidies,

based on the notion that goods arriving from foreign countries may

initially be of unknown quality to domestic consumers, who learn about

their quality only through consumption.            Nelson (1970) refers to goods

whose cuality can be known only after they have          been   purchased as

"experience goods."     Examples of such goods would typically include

technologically sophisticated consumer products, consumer durables, and

services that have an element of custom design.           If, when   confronted
with   such goods, consumers view price as a signal of quality, a          role   for


export subsidies can arise.
         The rotion that inforratlrne1 msyrre'ris provide a rationale for

trade    policy   has been addressed by       several ore zious authors,Lt

'onnenfeld, Weber,       and    Pen7icn (40p)       examIned   the welfare effetos o'
minimum   ouality standards on imports which are of             unknown     cicelity to
domestic consumers,           Payer (1984) exrlcred     the possibility of beneficis'
export    sobsidies in the presence of initially uniformed concuners, but

did so   wihout ocdelina exrlioitly the ccoess of consumer i'amninz sod

related to our     own   i5    that of   Grossman and Porn     (1986),   Tho   explore the
-ossibllitv that infant—industry protection              rgt be welfare-4rprovinm
in a merket for experience moods served initially by established foreimn
suppliers. while theirs is a model of both eiverse selection and moral
hamard, (temporary) protection is shown to be tnlface—wcraening, as it
leaves unaffected the problem of moral hamard and exacerbates the
problem of adverse meleoticn, The latter effect rocurs in their model
because protection simply allows lcwertbaneverage cualit firms to
enter, reducing the avenge ouality of orcdvoticn in the cerket, and
hence welfare.
      in contrast, our model explores a situation in which, absent
export subsidies, entry of high quality firms ray be blooked by their
inability to sell at prices refleoting their tnie auality: export
subsidies enable hIgh quality producers to begin exporting profitably
even while unable to credibly convey their high quality to consumers in
                                              the entry barrier for high
the "Introductory" period. Thus, in breaking

and a welfare—improving role for export subsidies ernerges.! Moreover,

even when high   qi.iality   firms find it possible to signal their high

quality to consumers through an introductory pricing strategy, a role

for government policy can arise:       the signal (low introductory price)

represents a transfer of surplus from foreign producers to domestic

consumers which, as we show below, can be avoided with an appropriate

export tax/subsidy policy.

      Tn one respect, the role played by export subsidies in the

presence of uninformed consumers bears a fundamental resemblance to the

profit—shifting motive noted above:       in each case, export subsidies

allow firma to precommit to actions that would be incredible absent the

government intervention.       In another respect, however, the two policies

are quite different:     while profit—shifting (end terms—of—trade

shiftins) subsidies are beggar—thy—neighbor policies, the export

subsidies explored in this paper are oareto improving.       As such, the

implications that emerge for an appropriate domestic policy response to

export subsidies differ merkedly from those of the crofit—shifting and

terms—of—trade shifting models.

      After developing the basic model in section II, we consider the

effect of export subsidies in section III.       were we establish a welfare

enhancing role for export subsidies both when a high quality      exporter
can distinguish itself from a low auality firm through its pricing

strategy and when it can not.       Section IV considers several extensions

of the basic model, including the introduction of a correlation between

                                                                of a
product qualities of the exporting country, and the possibility
policy response by the government of the importing country.                                Section V

oonoludes.

        The   foreign firm has a               two—period        life,    The   first   period of the
firm's life is its "introductory" phase, while the second period
corresponds to a "mature" chase, The latter phaee can be thoueht of as
capturing the dsoountsd profits of a possibly infinite future, The
firm produces a product whose cuality is either "high" or "low," where
the firm's quality            is   determfned exogenously                at   the beginning of   its
life   according to a commonly known probability distribution,
Accordingly, we         define a quality index p                    as:




                                   q   =   I

                                                                                        5 Pooh (q=H).

                                           —5-.




         It is perhaps easiest th irrine           the firm engaging in an
effort    which rrv   oroduce   a high   cuality    good   (with probability
        or ny   generate a "dud."!        The important point is that auality is

not itself a choice variable——this is a model of adverse selection, not

moral hazard.

         We assume that the product is an experience good:             while the

consumers rap learn      puality :erfecly         after purchase, the cuality of the

product cannot be determined by inspection (see Nelson, 1970).                    The

domestic consumer thus does not know the quality of the foreign firm's

product as its introductory phase begins.             He may, however, be able to

infer ito ouality type from observed introductory pricing behavior, a

point we take up below.1          In each period,      the consumer chooses either to


buy one unit of the product or not to buy it at all.               With    ii()    and

"(q)     defined   respectively, as the utility of consuming one unit of a

good of puality       c€(t,W}    nd   Its unit cost     o production, we assume
that


         u(H) > 0(H) > 0(L) > u(L) =       0.


Thus,    high quality production is relatively costly, the high cuality

good is worth its cost, and tbe low quality good is not:                  the product


either "works" or it doesn't.L'

        We assume that each foreign government has at its disposal a non

distortionary means of redistributing income among its citizens, so that
                                                             national
policies which increase (real) national income will increase
                                                          observed by

         The    me          advances to the nuture          phase only      if   a    sale was      wede

during       the introductory phase.! In this case,                     the domestic consumer has


experience with the foreign product from his introductory phase

consumption, and the quality                   of   the product is known to him.                    The

foreign firm chooses its nature phase price                        P     aware that           the domestic
consumer       knows the cuality of its product.                   Finally, knowing             q      and

observing          P    ,     the    domesti consumer chooses whether or not to                        make a

repeat purchase of the foreign good.
The   Equilibrium Concept
         We now         croceed     to define informally a sepuential equilibrium
(reps     and Wilson,             1982) for the game.    sequential equilibrium is                           a

coupling       of strategies and beliefs such that i) every player moves

optImally at every information set given his beliefs and the equilibrium

strategies of other olayers, and 2)                     at   every information set reached on

the equilibrium path, beliefs agree with Bayes' rule.

         Some further notation will prove helpful.                       Let                   and        P(L)
                                                                                      P1(H)
be the respective introductory prices of a high and low cuality firm.

Let                     be a consumer's introductory phase belief function:
        b1(P1)
             gives the probability with which the domestic consumer believes
bI(PT)
a foreign firm charging an introductory price
                                                                       P1
                                                                                 to be     high quality.
         Seoaration          is said to occur in the introductory phase if


P1(H)    4   P(L).           In     this   case,   the consumer can infer quality               exactly
after    seeing the introductory price.                     To put the point differently, when

p(H) 4       P(L),          Bayes' rule requires                        = 1          and
                                                            b1(P(H))

b1(P1(L))
               =       0.    When
                                      P1(H)
                                               =

      We employ these restrictions because they impart a standard of

plausibility and because they simolify the exoosition of the ensuing

analysis.    We note, however, that our results are not fundamentally

dependent upon the proposed restrictions.




                     ITT.   The Pole of rxoort Subsidies


      In this section, we establish three basic results.    First, in the

absence of export subsidies, high quality firms may be unable to find

buyers In the domestic market.     Incomplete information about quality can

therefore act as a barrier to welfare ImprovIng exports.    Moreover, this

barrier emerges even though fixed costs of production and competition

from incumbent producers in the domestic country are absent      the high

quality firms are unsuccessful because they cannot distinguish

themselves from low quality firms.    Second, with no private information

about firm quality but with the ability to precommit to a tax/subsidy

program over the two—period life of the firm, the foreign government can

increase foreign welfare by undertaking an export tax/subsidy program

which supports a separating equilibrium with only high quality firms

exporting.   Thus, as in the rent—shifting export subsidy literature, the

ability of governments to precommit where firms are unable to do so can

provide a rationale for government intervention.    Third, even in the

absence of the ability to precommit to 8 two—period policy, the foreign

government may be able to raise foreign welfare from its no—export level

(and leave domestic welfare unchanged) with an export subsidy in the
                                                               —12—



introductory phase that supports a                              pooling     equilibrium in which first

period exports take place.

ortrrers
          We    hegn       by asking under what conditions a high cuality firm will

find it impossible to export profitably to the domestic market.                                           Theorem

I   provides the answer.


Theorem        1:     In the absence of subsidies, fcreiry firms will he urahle to

export to the domestic market, regardless of ouality type,                                      if


                    u(.)        c(s)]     +   ciU(H)           c(p)] < a

                                                       -
and

          dqP(P)      >    c().                                                                            (9)



Proofl      To prove this we show that under the conditions of the theorem,

a   pooliog equilibrium                  in which sales take               place would lead     to     negative

profits        for   a high cuality firm, and that a separating equlibrius with

sales also implies negstve profits.                                Thus,        the only   possblity
resaining is an             equilibrium          in which sales do not take place.

          Suppose first that                               =           =         and an introductory       sale
                                               P1(H)           91(L)       P1
occurs,        Then             =         5                and, if the firm is high quality,
                           P1       P1        ÔHU(H)
          = UCH).           Put the first ccndltion of the thecrem then implies that

the present value of same profits for a high ouality firm are

negative.           This is contradictory.
                                                    —13—




         Suppose   then that                *                    Then the low quality firm is
                                   P1(H)         P1(L).
revealed and rrkes      no       sales.    Thus, to rake sales and orevent mimicry,

         < C(L)    is required.       But according to the second condition of the
P(H)
theorem, this implies that            P(H)          <           and hence,            also leads to

negative game profits for a high quality firm.                           This too   is
contradictory.

       Thus,   the only      rossility left                is    that no sales take

place.

       To sell a new product, an investment in information diffusion must

be incurred.       This investment is really a low                     price   which insures the

consumer aRainmt the possibility of low cuality.                             Peparation corresponds

to full insurance; cooling is a form                    of      nartial insurance.       The first

condition of Theorem         1    simply establishes conditions under which the

cost of partially insuring the consumer in the introductory phase

exceeds the future profits that come from the diffusion of product

ouality    information.          The second condition ensures that                  orovidirig   full

insurance is no less costly.

         The conditions of Theorem              1   are more likely to be satisfied the

higher the discount rate in the                 forei           country, the lower the

probability that      hizh       quality   production            will result from the foreign

R&D effort, the smaller the social surplus associated with the hfgh

quality    sood,   and the lower the unit               cost      of producing the low ouality

product.     These conditions suggest that                      such   informational barriers to

                                                           sectors of
exporting would be most likely to arise in the new—product

relatively unproven technological capabilities,          In any case, when these

conditions are satisfied, a role for "infant industry" export subsidies

may arise.      We now explore this role.

The Role of Suhsdies

      The notion that a governsent program of export subsidies can raise

national welfare has been discussed in the context of oligopolisto firm

interaotion by Spenoer and Rrander (1953) and Prander and Spenoer

(1955),   The    fundamental   insieht of theae oaoers i5 that a eovernment
ray take actions which allow firms to commit to irarkat behavior whfoh
they could not credibly pursue in its absenoe. In changing the nature
of the strategio fnteraotlon betiaen domestio and foreign firms,
government intervention can shift rents sway from the rest of the world
and toward the firms     of the intervening oountry.
      Commitment plays a crucial role in the welfare effeots of export

subadies in      the present model as well,    To isolate this role, we assume

that the forefgn    government has no   rrvate inforratfon about     firm
quality in the introductory ohase when setting its exoort subsidy
program, Thus, only rature phase subsidies can be offered to firms          on   a

quality   oontingent besis,     Nonetheless,   f   the foreign government can
preoommit    to a two—period export tax/subsidy program, then its ability

to oommit where the firm can not nises the oossibility of welfare—

enhanoing export subsidies in the present model as well.          The following

theorem summarizes this result,

export tax/subsidy program, then it can increase foreign national

welfare over any no—intervention equilibrium with an export tax/subsidy

program                      where the introductory phase tax                  is   siven by


              =   - (u(H)    -   c(L))      <   0                                              (10)

and the mature phase             subsidy        is given by


         —*
         S    =   rex   o,   —c(H) - c(s))
                             1_

with     C > 0     and where it Is understood that S                      is    to be paid in the

mature phase only if the firm is observed to be high quality.


°roof:       To prove Theorem 2, we first demonstrate that, under this export

tax/subsidy program, a separating eauiltbriunt will obtain.                             We then show

that foreign welfare in a seoaratin eauiljbriurn under the tax/subsidy

program is higher than under any equilibrium without government

intervention.

       Suppose first that a pooling equilibrium arises in which sales

take place.        Then      P(H)       =   P(L)         P1.
                                                                  If the firm is low quality          and

makes a sale, its profits in the pooling eouilibrium, taking account of

the introductory government tax, will be


              +         C(L)     =
                                        (1-óH)u(H)        < 0                                  (12)

This is a contradiction.                Thus, in a pooling equilibrium, no sales would

be made.      However, a         hizh   quality firm can senarate and earn positive

game profits under this tax/subsidy program.                          In particular, with the

tax           imposed by the foreign government in the introductory phase, an

introductory price of                           = U(H)       will not be mimicked by a low

if   S           is strictly positive                according to   (ii),   and   larger profits   when

(11) implies              S        =   0.    Thus,    the tao—period export suhady program will
force seperation.
         Finally,             welfare in the foreign country under this program is easy

to comoute.              Under the assumptions of the model, the export tax/subsidy

payments         are simply transfers between the foreign government and the
foreign          firm,    and net out of the welfare oeIoulatons.                    SInce no sales

        The impact    of       the policy outlined in Theorem 2 can be understood

only    high cuality exports will occur, implying that world surplus is

maximized.       However, absent government intervention, the cost of the

firms signal       (its low introductory price) acts to transfer social

surplus from the foreign firm to domestic consumers.                                             The government

program of Theorem 2 will in                 this          case consist only of an introductory

tax on exports       (*    will be zero) which ensures that the firm signals

its    quality   with its introductory price,                           hut     allows the cost of the

      Theorem 2      establishes a rule for escort subsidies when the
government      is ignorant of oualiç but finds polfoy commitment over the

arsument, the ability of the government to preoommit is crucial.             Unlike

the rent—shifting subsidy, the use of exmort subsidies outlined in

Theorem 2 leads to a Pareto oreferred outcome:             it is not a bessar—thy-

of this kind infeasible.          The next theorem establishes the oossibility

of a role for esmort subsidies when the government finds it inpossible

to preoommit to a two—period program.

in the absence of export subsidies, no exports will occur.             Suppose

directions,    First we explore the role of export subsidies in the

presence of several potential export goods when oualities are correlated

across markets,    We then relax the assumption of a oassive domestic

government, and consider its response to the ezport policies of the

foreign country.

The stamp       'Produced        Abroad"   can therefore         be informative to a domestic

consumer who has           information     about other foreign products.                  To explore

this source of information, we assume that                        firm   2 can not export to

market 2 until after firm l's introductory obese in market 1.

         The consumer in market 2 is 'communicatively linked" to the market

1   consumer:       The market 2 consumer learns about the introductory phase

of play in market           I,     Thus, while             is the prior which initializes

the market 1 gnme, the market 2 prior derends on the first phase of

market I play.            If firm l's product is not tried, then the prior is

derived- from the belief which the market                    I    consumer holds after

asymmetry would           e irrelevant if qualities were uncorrelated.                       However,

since correlation is present, the initial consumer experience with firm

        Theorem 4   establishes that quali    correlation need not diminish a

country's "fly—by-night" incentive to subsidize exports.             When the firms

in a ccunt' are unsuccessful in the exccrt market,          and when the

underlying cerameters (preferences, cost functions, and                  are not

expected to change in such a way as to make success in the export market

scre likely in the future, an export subsidy may be attractive, both

because of the fly-by—night surplus captured if the firms turn cut to be

low quality, and because of the reputoticnal benefits tc future

exporters if the firms turn cut to be high quality.

ImpcrtinCove rnment     Response

        Thus far the importing government has been completely          ssive,
taking no policy scticns     n   response to the export subsidy program

abroad,    An imccrtant characteristic of this exoort subsidy is that it

is ncnxplcitive:       the   importing ccunt' is not harmed.         As such,

unlike profit shifting and terms—cf—trade shifting subsidies, the

appropriate response from the importing government may well he a note of
                                                                                   be

so that it is the mature phase surplus that allows the high cuality firm

to   export at a loss in the introductory phase and still make positive

game profits.         Then we    have   the following result.



Theorem    :     Under conditions (20)          and   (21),    the inevitahiljt-   of the

domestic countryts mature chase rent extracting tariff                     c    will induce

the foreign government to enter into an introductory phase export

subsidy program if

and will preempt exports from occuring at all if

                 -   0(H))   ÷

Proof     With          extractinz all mature phase surplus and                    <   c(p)
high quality firm would suffer game losses at the cooling                      once
     < 0(H),     and thus no exports would occur absent a government

subsidy.       The subsidy will be forthcoming if surplus from exports is

positive (condition (22)) and will not be forthcoming if surplus is

negative (condition (23)).                                                         0,.fl.

        Under condition (22), Theorem 5 implies that the inevitability of

future protection in response to successful imports——or in response to

introductory "dumping"                  < 0(H))   of hIgh qualIty goods-—induces an

barrier to entry. This point            was    '-st made '     Fain    ''956), following
his study of twenty industries. More rroently, Th'malensee (1982),
Bagwell fl985), and Farrell '10P5 have stablished the existence of
this barrier in a vsriety of nodels, lur                  theorem     .+o4ld   thus seem more

general than the specfal esourptons employed.
       We   argue that subsidies can overcome thIs barrier and increase
welfare. The qualitative flator of tha erg'unenm ices not appear to
depend on our special cost and demand funotions.1, A more interesting
consideration is the possibility of              many   types and/or quality choices.
The model could incorporete quality           choice   relatively easily if the

probability of successful R&D,                 were    to be modeled    as a choice
                                        oH,

variable of the firm.         For example, suppose that                is   a function of

observable inputs of resources by the exporting firm.                   In this case,

there   would exist an incentive to overinvest in R&D so as to raise

and break the entry barrier,        The role of export subsidies would then be

to   achieve    the socially arpropriate      °T   exoenditure level in the

exporting country,

        It is also intriguing to consider the role of subsidies when the

importing      country has   domestic   firms in the relevant industry.             In such

a model, the successful entry of a foreign              firm   can   cause   a loss in

domestic producer surplus, and so the          otil       colicy for an importing

country becomes more complex.

        The model suggests a number of other extensions.                    One wonders, for

example, what     would   happen if rational consumers were unable to observe

perfectly the subsidy choices of the foreign government.                      Another

interesting extension concerns the use of quotas and VER's.                     How do

these polIcies affect the signallins game between firms and consumers?

These and other related extensions would seem to be fruitful issues for

future research.

      There    is a second, less       forsl objection to           the       p1

      equilibrium.         Popular intuition holds that high                 prices    go with

      therefore be that           higher   prices do not go with higher expectations

      about product quality.           Notice,      though that     if       pooling occurs at

              then                 can be strictly increasing in               P.         If we are

      Both of these restrictions are implications of the refinement
      suggested by 0rossn and Perry (1986) as well as the refinement
      proposed by Okuno—Fujiwara and Postlewaite (1987).

      Since             is zero in this case,        implementation of the policy does

      not require government precommitment to a second period policy.

      The one case in which the program of Theorem 2 will be a beggar-
      thy—neighbor policy is when separation would have occurred without
      intervention, Here the program is simply a first oeriod export
      tax, and involves no export subsidy.

      A different interpretation, suggested to us by Dani Rodrik, is
      that high quality producers fail to internalize the post1ve
      externality of their sales on the profits of low ouslity
      producers. The export subsidy is then viewed as a way of
      internalizing        this
                         externality.
