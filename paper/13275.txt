Pension Plan Characteristics and Framing Effects in Employee Savings Behavior

                                                 ABSTRACT

In this paper we document the importance of framing effects in the retirement savings decisions of
college professors. Pensions in many post-secondary institutions are funded by a combination of an
employer contribution and a mandatory employee contribution. Employees can also make tax-deferred
contributions to a supplemental savings account. A standard lifecycle savings model predicts a "dollar-for-dollar"
tradeoff between supplemental savings and the combined regular pension contributions made on behalf
of an employee. Contrary to this prediction, we estimate that each additional dollar of employee contributions
leads to a 70 cent reduction in supplemental savings, whereas each dollar of employer contributions
generates only a 30 cent reduction. The asymmetry - which is consistent with different "mental accounts"
for employer and employee contributions - provides further evidence of the sensitivity of individual
savings decisions to the precise details of their pension plan.

       Savings rates vary widely across people, even among those with similar age, income, and

family structure (Bernheim, Skinner, and Weinberg, 2001). As with other outcomes of

individual choice, the interpretation of this heterogeneity remains controversial. A strictly

neoclassical view is that individuals solve a lifecycle planning problem and reach different

decisions depending on their preferences. Although this perspective provides the basic

framework for most economic analyses, a growing body of research suggests that savings

decisions are also affected by a variety of “non-neoclassical” factors, including framing effects

(Shefrin and Thaler, 1992) and the default provisions of pension plans (Madrian and Shea, 2001;

Choi, Laibson and Madrian, 2004).1

        In this paper we provide new evidence of framing effects in the retirement savings

behavior of college and university faculty. Many post-secondary institutions in the United States

offer a defined contribution pension plan funded by the combination of an employer contribution

and a mandatory employee contribution.2 Employees can also make a tax-deferred supplemental

contribution to the same asset fund. A standard lifecycle savings model predicts a “dollar-for-

dollar” tradeoff between the combined regular pension contribution made on behalf of an

employee and his or her supplemental savings. In the presence of framing or mental accounting

effects, however, employees may view their own required pension contribution as more salient,

or more closely substitutable with supplemental savings. In this case, the employee component

        A related literature on procrastination (Akerlof, 1991; O’Donoghue and Rabin, 1998)
and time-inconsistent preferences (Laibson, 1997 Laibson, Repetto, Tobacman, 1998) asks why
on average people appear to delay planning for retirement and end up saving “too little”
(Lusardi, 2000).

         For example, the employer may contribute 10% of salary, and the employee is required
to contribute 5%. A similar distinction between payers arises in the Social Security payroll tax.
About one fifth of institutions offer plans with a matching formula. As discussed below, we
exclude such plans from our analysis.
of regular pension contributions will exert a larger effect on supplemental savings than the

employer component. We test for such differential responses using a unique data set combining

10 years of salary and pension information for tenured and tenure-track faculty at a sample of

colleges and universities with TIAA-CREF pensions.

       Our findings confirm that framing effects matter. Controlling for total compensation

(i.e., the sum of wages and employer pension contributions), supplemental savings are

significantly lower when a larger fraction of the regular pension contribution is “labeled” as an

employee contribution. The discrepancy is large: we estimate that supplementary savings are

reduced by about 70 cents per dollar of employee contributions to the regular pension, but only

30 cents per dollar of employer contributions. We interpret these findings as further evidence

that behavioral departures from a strict neoclassical choice framework can help to explain the

observed variability in savings behavior and wealth outcomes, even among highly educated

workers with relatively secure careers.



II. Previous Literature

       Our work builds on a number of strands of the existing literature on savings behavior.3

One well-known set of papers studies the effect of tax deferred savings accounts on overall

savings rates. Poterba, Venti, and Wise (1996, 1998) argue that tax deferred savings

mechanisms like IRA’s and 401(k) programs lead to a net increase in savings, while Gale and

Scholz (1994), Engen, Gale, and Scholz (1996), and Gale (1998) argue that the balances in these


       3
        Savings behavior is intimately connected to intertemporal consumption. See Deaton
(1992) for an evaluation of the literature up to the early 1990s, and Browning and Lusardi (1996)
for a more recent survey.

                                                 2
savings vehicles are offset by reductions in other forms of household wealth. The question we

address is closely related, but we avoid some of the difficulties in this literature by focusing on

the offset between savings flows that are treated equally by the tax system, and by using the

same data sources to measure pension contributions and supplemental savings.

       A second and related literature examines the quality of the information available to

decision-makers. Surveys show that many workers lack basic information on their public and

private retirement benefits (Bernheim, 1994; Gustman and Steinmeier, 2001). Since employee

pension contributions appear as salary reductions on a worker’s monthly pay stub, whereas

employer contributions do not, information asymmetries may explain why employee

contributions appear to “matter more”. Given the fact that total pension contributions are

reported quarterly to the employees in our sample, we suspect that information problems are less

severe in our setting than in many others. Nevertheless, imperfect information can lead to

behavior that is consistent with the framing effects we identify here.

       A third body of research establishes that seemingly minor details about a defined

contribution pension plan – such as the “default” arrangements for plan participation – have

relatively large effects on pension savings behavior (see Choi, Laibson, and Madrian, 2004, for a

recent survey). In an influential study, Madrian and Shea (2001) found that a change in the

default option governing 401(k) enrollment (from “not enrolled” to “enrolled”) led to an

increase in plan participation. Confirmatory evidence is presented by Choi, Laibson, Madrian

and Metrick (2005) and Choi, Laibson, and Madrian (2004). Other studies have examined the

effect of allowing employees freedom of choice in the allocation of pension contributions

(Papke, 2004; Huberman, Iyengar, and Jiang, 2003), and the effect of default options in asset


                                                  3
allocation choices (Beshears et al., 2007).

       Finally, our research is related to studies of mental accounting and savings behavior.

Although the term “mental accounting” encompasses a wide range of behaviors (see the review

by Thaler, 1999), a basic premise is that people divide different income sources into different

“accounts”, and treat the balances in different accounts as imperfect substitutes. For example,

O’Curry (2000), Kooreman (2000), and Milkman et al. (2007) demonstrate a link between the

source of an income gain and people’s willingness to spend the gain on different things. Shefrin

and Thaler (1988) use this approach to explain the excess sensitivity of consumption to

temporary income shocks. Thaler (1990) posits that a mental accounting process can explain

why people do not reduce their savings dollar-for-dollar by the amount of their pension wealth.

Assuming that employees assign their own pension contribution to a different mental account

than their employer’s contribution, our empirical analysis provides a simple test of imperfect

fungibility between mental accounts.



III. Some Features of Faculty Retirement Savings Programs

       Before presenting a theoretical framework for modeling the effect of pension

contributions on employee savings, it is useful to outline some of the main features of typical

faculty retirement programs. As in other sectors, there are two basic types of faculty retirement

programs: defined benefit (DB) plans, which provide a pension benefit based on an employee’s

age, years of service, and average salary; and defined contribution (DC) plans, which create a

retirement fund owned by the employee (Mitchell and Schieber, 1998). Typically, DC pensions

are funded by payments from the employer and the employee into an asset fund like TIAA-


                                                 4
CREF or Vanguard. Employees usually have some choice in how funds are invested, but cannot

freely access the money until they retire or reach a minimum age.

       In a separate analysis, we matched pension characteristics to about 100 large US

universities that participated in the 1995-96 Faculty Survey conducted by the Higher Education

Research Institute at UCLA.4 We found that about 25 percent of faculty were employed at

institutions that only offered a DB plan, about 37 percent worked where only a DC plan was

offered, and the remaining 38 percent worked for employers that offered both DB and DC plans.

DB programs are particularly common at public institutions, where faculty are often included in

a broader pension program for state workers (see e.g. Berger et al., 2001, Table 6.2). The most

common DC pension fund is TIAA-CREF, which is available at about 72% of post-secondary

institutions nationwide, and an even higher fraction of four-year institutions (U.S. Department of

Education, 1997, Table 5.1).

       Our empirical analysis is based on a sample of faculty who participated in a DC fund

managed by TIAA-CREF in the mid-1990s. Table 1 provides a few examples of the DC pension

plans offered at various U.S. universities, illustrating typical variation in the generosity of plans

and in details of how benefits are calculated.5 The plans in place at Indiana University and

University of Michigan are typical of a large number of plans at universities and colleges

throughout the country. At Indiana, the university makes an annual contribution of 12 percent of

the employee’s salary. We refer to this type of plan as “noncontributory.” At Michigan, on the

       5
         The information in Table 1 comes from web sites of these institutions. We are unsure
whether these institutions participated in the Princeton Retirement Survey that forms the basis
for the following analysis, as we do not know the identities of survey participants.

                                                  5
other hand, the university contributes 10 percent of salary, and the employee is required to make

a contribution of 5 percent. We label this type of plan “contributory.”

       A third type of pension arrangement is illustrated by the plans at American University

and Stanford. In these plans, the employer offers a minimum contribution rate together with a

“matching formula” that depends on the voluntary contribution rate of employees. While

matching formulas are relatively common in 401(k) plans used outside of academia (see Choi,

Laibson, and Madrian, 2005, for an interesting analysis of such plans) they are less common in

the post-secondary education sector. For example, among the 96 FRS institutions for which we

are able to obtain pension plan characteristics, only 19 had some sort of matching formula for at

least a fraction of employees. In our empirical analysis, we therefore focus on the savings

behavior of faculty at institutions with either no employee contribution to the regular pension (as

at Indiana University) or a fixed employee contribution (as at the University of Michigan).

       Because part of the compensation of professors in most pension plans is actually deferred

compensation, comparisons of nominal contribution rates, such as those listed in Table 1, can be

misleading. To address this issue, throughout this paper we express contribution rates as a

fraction of total compensation (current salary plus the employer’s contribution to the pension

account). We call this the “effective” contribution rate. As an illustration, consider the pension

plans of University of Michigan and Indiana University, listed in Table 1. At Indiana, the

effective contribution rate is 12/1.12= 10.714 percent. (That is, an individual with a nominal

salary of $100,000 has total compensation of $112,000, since the university also makes a

$12,000 contribution to the his or her pension). By comparison, the effective contribution rate at

the University of Michigan is (10+5)/(1.1) =13.64 percent, which consists of two parts, the


                                                 6
employer’s effective contribution rate of 9.09 percent (10/1.1) and the employee’s effective

contribution rate of 4.55 percent (5/1.1).

       In addition to regular pension programs, most colleges and universities offer

supplemental programs for tax-deferred savings known as 403(b) programs, or in the case of

TIAA-CREF as supplemental retirement annuities (SRAs).6 These so-called “elective deferral”

plans permit an individual to set aside part of his or her current earnings and avoid Federal and

(in most cases) State income taxes. Contributions to these plans are subject to a maximum

annual contribution limit, which was roughly $9,000 in the early 1990s.

       Elective deferral programs are intended to encourage saving for retirement, so there are

penalties for “early” withdrawals (prior to age 59-1/2).7 Most plans, however, waive the penalty

if the withdrawal is used for educational expenses, or to purchase a house. Many plans also

allow participants to borrow from their SRA balances. (It is not possible to borrow from, or to

offer as collateral, balances in regular retirement accounts). Because of their favorable tax

treatment and ready accessibility, SRAs provide an extremely convenient, and arguably the most

convenient, instrument for supplemental retirement savings by college and university professors.



IV. A Basic Model of Retirement Saving




       6
        SRA and 403(b) plans are available to employees of educational institutions and some
other non-profit organizations. These plans are similar to programs like 401(k) plans and the
Thrift Savings Plan for federal employees, but differ in certain details.
       7
        Funds withdrawn before age 59-1/2 are subject to a 10 percent tax penalty. Once an
employee reaches age 59-1/2, there is no penalty for withdrawing funds from the SRA,
regardless of whether the employee has retired or not. Withdrawals must begin before age 70-
1/2.

                                                 7
       We begin by outlining a simplified neoclassical model of savings that ignores uncertainty

over income, asset returns, or the timing of retirement. Assume that an individual’s adult life is

divided into T years of work and R years of retirement. The individual’s objective function is

(1)    1/$ 3t=1
             T+R
                 $t u(ct) ,

where ct represents consumption in period t, u( ) is a concave within-period utility function, and

$ is a discount factor. During any period t#T the individual earns a salary wt (in inflation-

adjusted dollars). The individual has a defined contribution pension, to which the employer

contributes p1t and the individual makes a required contribution of p2t. The individual can also

save an additional amount st in a tax-sheltered supplemental (SRA) program. Pension and SRA

contributions accumulate in a pooled fund with a fixed rate of return r. For simplicity, we will

assume that individuals have the same discount rate as the market, implying $=1/(1+r). Letting

At denote the value of combined assets at the beginning of any period t, assets in the next period

are:

(2)    At+1 = (1+r) ( At + p1t + p2t + st ).

The individual faces a constant marginal tax rate of J. Consumption in any working period is

related to supplemental savings by:

       ct = (1!J) ( wt !p2t !st ) .

Solving for st and substituting into (2) we obtain

(3)    At+1 = (1+r) ( At + wt + p1t ! ct /(1!J) )

for any working period t#T. Assuming that withdrawals from the pension fund are taxed at the

rate J, the same equation holds during periods of retirement with wt=p1t=0.8


       8
        Obviously, this model can be easily amended to include Social Security payments.

                                                 8
       Setting AT+R+1=0 and solving equation (3) backward yields the lifetime budget constraint

(4)    A0 + (1+r) 3t=1
                    T+R
                        (1+r)!t kt    =   (1+r) 3t=1
                                                  T+R
                                                      (1+r)!t ct /(1!J) ,

where kt = wt + p1t represents total compensation (salary plus the employer’s pension

contribution). Note that if savings are withdrawn from pre-tax earnings, and pension assets are

allowed to accumulate tax-free, the intertemporal budget constraint is equivalent to one in which

the current price of consumption is $1/(1!J), and the individual has earnings of kt in each period.

       Ignoring any upper or lower bounds on the amount of supplemental saving, the first order

condition for maximizing (1) subject to (4) yields the standard first order condition:

(5)    uN(ct ) = 8/(1!J) ,

where 8 is the multiplier associated with the lifetime budget constraint. In the absence of

borrowing constraints, the individual follows the permanent income hypothesis, setting ct = cP,

where cP is the annuity value of lifetime wealth. Supplemental savings are then given by

(6)    st =    kt ! cP/(1!J) !p1t !p2t

          =    S*t !p1t !p2t

where S*t / kt ! cP/(1!J) represents total desired savings in period t. Holding constant lifetime

wealth and current total compensation, supplemental savings are reduced dollar-for-dollar by the

sum of total pension contributions made by the employer and the individual in period t.

       If earnings early in life are relatively low equation (6) will require negative supplemental

savings (i.e., borrowing). Provided that interest on debt is tax-deductible (as is the case for

mortgage debt) this does not complicate the model, but it does introduce a distinction between

supplemental savings (which can be negative) and supplemental pension contributions (which

cannot). Specifically, if one assumes that an individual uses SRA contributions to save


                                                  9
whenever supplemental savings are strictly positive then

(7)      SRAt = max [ 0, S*t !p1t !p2t ] .

         A specification similar to equation (7) is also valid when individuals cannot borrow to

finance consumption early in their life cycle. In this case consumption will track disposable

income early in the career, with supplemental savings equal to 0, and follow an optimal path,

with strictly positive supplemental savings, later in life. Formally, letting :t (1+r)!t represent the

multiplier associated with the constraint st = wt !p2t !ct/(1!J) $0, equation (5) is replaced by

(8)      uN(ct ) = ( 80 + :t )/(1!J) ,   with   :t $0,   wt !p2t !ct/(1!J) $0 ,

         and    :t (wt !p2t !ct/(1!J)) = 0 .

Note that an individual who is constrained to “over-save” early in life will have higher

consumption (and lower supplemental savings) later in life. This will be reflected by a lower

value for the multiplier 80 in equation (8) than for 8 in the unconstrained case (equation (5)).

         To illustrate the implications of (8), define c0 by uN(c0 ) = 80/(1!J) . Note that c0

depends on lifetime wealth and on the “bite” of the sequence of borrowing constraints faced by

the individual (with c0 = cP when these constraints are not binding). Assuming that positive

supplemental savings are deposited as SRA contributions, we again get a simple censoring

model:

(9)      SRAt = min [ 0, S0t !p1t !p2t ] .

where

         S0t = kt !c0 /(1!J) .

This differs from equation (7) only in the substitution of c0 for cP in the definition of desired total

savings.


                                                    10
        Equation (7) (or the alternative (9)) specifies a very simple model for observed SRA

contributions. For estimation purposes it is convenient to express the model in terms of SRA

savings rates. Dividing by total compensation in period t, the SRA contribution rate is:

        SRAt/kt = max [ 0, Ft !B1t !B2t ]

where

        Ft =    [ S*t ! c0 /(1!J) ] / kt =   1 ! c0 /(1!J)/kt ,

        B1t = p1t/kt , and B2t = p2t /kt .

The advantage of this specification is that the SRA contribution rate is expressed in terms of the

total desired savings rate Ft and the pension contribution rates B1t and B2t which are specified in a

given pension plan (see Table 1 for examples). In our empirical analysis below, we assume that

the desired savings rate at age t can be proxied by a function of age and total compensation, plus

an error term that reflects unobserved taste factors:

        Ft = X( + ,t .

Assuming that , is normally distributed, this implies that the observed SRA contribution rate is

generated by a Tobit model:

(10)    SRAt/kt = max [ 0, X( + R1 B1t + R2 B2t + ,t ]

where R1 = R2 = !1.



Framing Effects, Mental Accounting, and Imperfect Information

        Although a conventional savings model suggests that people should treat employer and

employee pension contributions as fully fungible (holding constant total compensation), a

behavioral perspective suggests that people may treat them differently. In particular, suppose that


                                                 11
people combine pre-tax savings deductions from their gross salary in one mental account, and

employer pension contributions in another. Limited fungibility across mental accounts then

implies that SRA contributions will be less affected by employer pension contributions than by

employee contributions. In terms of equation (10), this suggests that R2 = !1, and R1 > !1. At the

extreme, complete lack of fungibility between the two mental accounts would lead to the

prediction that R1 . 0.9

       As we noted earlier, an alternative explanation for a differential effect of employer and

employee contributions on SRA savings is differential information. An employee’s pension

contribution appears as a salary deduction, whereas the employer’s contribution is not directly

reported. If some fraction of people are unaware of their employer’s contribution their behavior

may mimic the behavior of savers with a different mental account for the employer’s contribution.

In our specific context, however, complete lack of information seems unlikely, because people

with a pension account managed by TIAA-CREF receive quarterly statements that inform them of

the combined amount contributed to their pension, and the fund balance. Indeed, to the extent

that people use their quarterly pension statements as the source for information on their savings,

they will automatically treat the employer and employee contributions as fungible. Thus, we

suspect that differential information about the two sources of pension contribution is unlikely to

explain the savings behavior of faculty, although we cannot rule out this explanation.




        9
         To the best of our knowledge, previous studies of the offset between pensions and
savings have not distinguished between the employer and employee pension contributions, and
have instead assumed that R1 = R2 =R. Since the employer contribution tends to be as big or
bigger than the employee contribution (at least in our sample) one would expect estimates of a
pooled parameter R to be closer to the value of R1.

                                                12
V. Data

       We analyze data from the Princeton Faculty Retirement Survey (FRS), a large sample of

faculty at US universities and colleges. Ashenfelter and Card (2001) provide a detailed

description of how the sample was designed and collected. The complete FRS sample contains

records on salary and other administrative variables from 104 four-year colleges and universities

for the period from 1986 to 1997, although not all schools provided data for all years.10 These

administrative data from schools were merged with information from pension accounts held in the

TIAA-CREF system, including premiums paid during the year and balances in each account at

the end of each year, for each professor in the sample.

       In addition to this information, we have collected details of the pension plans for almost

all of these schools. This information includes the contribution rate of the institution, the required

contribution rate of the individual (for contributory plans), and whether the plan provides

matching incentives.11

       The FRS sample was collected in two waves. In the first wave, a total of 44 schools

provided information for faculty over the age of 50. The 56 schools in the second wave provided

data for faculty of all ages. When relevant, we have used information from both waves in our

analysis here. Our sample of schools is somewhat reduced because some schools did not provide

information for all of the variables that we have used in our analysis, or because we were unable


          10
         From these 104 schools we have excluded four “pilot” schools because they did not
provide all of the necessary detail in data from TIAA/CREF.
          11
          The identity of the schools (and individuals, of course) is unknown to us. Details of
pension plans were collected by the same group that administered the original FRS, and provided
to us with an identification number only. This allowed us to match plan characteristics to
institutions.

                                                 13
to obtain details of the pension plan at the school. In the end, we have professors from 78

colleges and universities.

       Most faculty at the schools in our sample participate in TIAA-CREF as their primary

retirement program. That is, they hold active accounts at TIAA-CREF, and

their employer deposits premiums into those accounts during the years we analyze. (Schools that

do not offer TIAA-CREF as a pension carrier were excluded from the FRS sample.) However,

some institutions also offer alternative retirement programs. For example, many state colleges

and universities offer new faculty a choice of participating in a TIAA-CREF defined contribution

pension plan or in the state employee pension program, which is often a defined-benefit plan.

Employees at some schools also have the option to allocate their regular pension contributions to

other pension providers (such as Fidelity or Vanguard) that compete with TIAA-CREF. Since the

only pension information we have comes from TIAA-CREF, however, we limit our sample to

professors whose primary retirement plan is administered by TIAA-CREF.12

       If a faculty member has his or her primary retirement fund at TIAA-CREF but uses an

alternative carrier for supplemental retirement savings we have no way of knowing the

contributions made to that plan. However, we believe it is plausible that employees whose

primary pension is managed by TIAA-CREF will use an SRA at TIAA-CREF for their tax

deferred supplemental savings. TIAA-CREF offers the same broad investment options for SRA

plans as it competitors, and the choice of a single provider simplifies record-keeping.

Nevertheless, the possibility that some supplemental savings are unobserved should be taken into



        12
         As shown in Ashenfelter and Card (2001, Table A2), roughly 80% of faculty members
in the FRS sample have primary pension accounts at TIAA-CREF.

                                                14
account in interpreting our empirical results.

       Our model describes the determination of annual supplementary savings contributions to

an SRA. Unfortunately, the administrative data from TIAA/CREF also includes “rollover”

transfers of certain types of pension-like funds into (or out of) SRA accounts. Thus, for a small

fraction of our sample we observe some very large “contributions” (exceeding legal limits and in

some cases exceeding total salary). We also observe some negative contributions. We drop from

our sample the few individuals who withdraw funds during a year, or who add more than 25

percent of total salary to their SRA during the year.13

       Our primary interest is in how the pension contribution rate of the employing institution

influences an individual’s decision to contribute to an SRA. As discussed earlier, pension plans

vary considerably across employers. Following our theoretical framework, we summarize an

institution’s pension generosity by the fraction of “total income” contributed to the pension plan,

measured with two variables: (1) the effective contribution rate by the employer, and (2) the

effective contribution rate required of the individual (which is 0 for non-contributory plans). As

noted earlier, we drop from the sample the roughly 20% of observations from institutions with a

matching formula in the pension plan.

       Potentially, we have data for each individual for each year between 1986 and 1996.

However, some individuals enter the sample during the period and others leave. Tables 2a and 2b

summarize the data that we use in the analysis. Table 2a presents our broadest sample, including

individuals from 78 institutions. Since some institutions did not provide information about other



        13
        The total number of these individuals constitute less than ½ of 1 percent of the sample.
Our results are not sensitive to their exclusion.

                                                 15
demographic characteristics, such as sex, race, and seniority, we have also analyzed a narrower

sample that includes individuals from 72 institutions. Table 2b presents summary statistics for

the narrow sample.

       The two samples appear to be quite similar in terms of the variables that we are most

interested in. Participation in SRAs is generally quite low – we see contributions to SRAs in only

about 20 percent of the person-years in our sample. Among those who did contribute to an SRA,

the average fraction of income contributed is about 7.5 percent.

       The average faculty member works for an employer who contributes a little more than 12

percent of salary each year to the employee’s pension plan. The average faculty member is about

49 years old, with about 14 years of seniority. Just over 21 percent of the sample is female, and

85 percent have a doctoral level degree.



VI. Results

       In order to focus on the substitution between regular pensions and SRAs, we estimate a

Tobit specification that is a slight modification of equation (10):

(11)   SRAt/kt = max [ 0, X( + R ( B1t + B2t ) + R* B2t + ,t ].

In this specification, the parameter R is the offset to supplemental retirement savings that results

from an additional $1 contribution to the regular pension, regardless of whether the employer or

the employee “makes” the contribution. The standard lifecycle model predicts R=!1. The

parameter R* represents the “excess offset” associated with an employee’s own contribution: the

conventional model predicts R*=0.

         Table 3 reports estimates of selected coefficients across different specifications and


                                                 16
samples.14 The first row reports our estimates of R. In columns (a), ©) and (e), the coefficient on

the “Total Pension Contribution Rate” shows that the desired SRA contribution rate declines by

0.5 to 0.6 percent points when the pension contribution rate increase by 1 percentage point, when

R* is restricted to be 0. This is substantially smaller (in absolute value) than the value of !1

predicted by a standard lifecylce model. One possible explanation for this finding is that some

SRA contributions are made to carriers other than TIAA-CREF, and are therefore unobserved in

our sample. As discussed by Hausman (2001), such mis-measurement will tend to lead to an

“attenuation bias” in a Tobit model, implying that the measured value for R will be biased toward

a value of 0.

       The specifications in columns (b), (d), and (f) allow differential offsetting effects from

pension contributions made by the employer and employee. This distinction is important: the

estimates of R* are highly significant, with t-ratios of roughly 2.5. The estimates imply that a 1

percent increase in the employer’s contribution rate reduces desired SRA contribution rate by

only about .25 to .30 (the value of R), while a contribution out of own salary decreases desired

SRA rate by 0.6 to 0.7 (the value of R+R*). Evidently, individuals treat their own pension

contribution as more important in deciding whether and how much to contribute to an SRA, even

though the difference between employer and employee contributions is essentially one of

labeling. An implication of this behavior is that faculty employed at schools with “contributory”

pension plans will tend to have lower retirement savings balances at each age, even holding




        14
         Note that in Tables 3 and 4 we report “clustered” standard errors, calculated by
clustering across all the person-year observations at each institution.

                                                 17
constant total compensation and the total contribution rate to their regular pension.15

       Table 4 shows the complete regression results for the model in column (f) of Table 3,

reporting the effect of personal characteristics on saving rates. Desired SRA contribution rates

are higher for those with higher incomes, at older ages, and with more seniority. Rates are also

higher for women and for non-white professors, as well as for those with a doctoral degree.

Relative to the others, professors in business and life sciences have higher desired contribution

rates, with the rates of business professors particularly high. (This could reflect higher extramural

incomes for these groups.)

       There is also an interesting time pattern of contribution rates–rates decline from 1986 to

1990, then increase again before falling to 1996 (the reference year for this set of dummy

variables). These year-to-year differences seem quite large compared to the overall savings rate

for SRAs in our sample.

       In both Tables 3 and 4, we have estimated the standard errors by clustering on the

institution, yielding rather large standard errors relative to the number of observations in our

samples. This choice reflects the fact that almost all of the variation from contribution rates

comes from differences across institutions, with little variation across individuals at the same

institution, or within person over time. A possible concern is that unobserved institution-specific

factors (such as the financial education programs described in Clark and d’Ambrosio, 2002) could

confound the relationship between pension features and average supplemental retirement



        15
          Even if some supplemental savings are unobserved (leading to a downward bias in the
estimate of R), the estimate of R* will be unbiased, provided there is no correlation between the
relative share of regular pension contributions made by employees and the likelihood of
observing supplementary savings in our sample.

                                                 18
contribution rates. Although this should be kept in mind, we have no reason to suspect that such

factors are related to the relative size of the employer and employee contribution rates at a given

institution.



VII. Conclusions

        We have examined the retirement savings behavior of a large sample of professors at

universities and colleges in the United States. A key feature of our data is that we observe the

total contributions to an individual’s primary pension plan, and the amounts contributed to a tax-

sheltered supplemental plan. A standard lifecycle model predicts that individuals with a more

generous pension plan (i.e., a plan with a higher contribution rate relative to total compensation)

will have lower supplemental savings. Qualitatively, we find strong support for this prediction.

Quantitatively, however, the evidence is less supportive of the standard model. In particular, a 1

percentage point increase in the contribution rate of the regular pension leads to only a 0.5-0.6

percentage point reduction in voluntary supplemental contributions – much less than the 1-for-1

offset of a rational lifecycle saver. This implies that people with more generous pension plans

reach retirement age with greater wealth, even controlling for lifetime earnings.

        We explore a potential explanation based on differential reactions to the regular pension

contributions made by employers and employees. To the extent that people assign their own

pension contributions and supplemental savings to one “mental account”, and their employer’s to

another, we would expect to see a higher degree of substitutability between the first two, and a

lower degree of substitutability between supplemental savings and employer pension

contributions. This insight is confirmed in the data: each percentage point increase in an


                                                 19
employee’s own contribution to the regular pension plan leads to a 0.7 point reduction in

supplemental savings, whereas a similar increase in the employer’s contribution generates only a

0.3 point reduction.

       Our findings lend further support to an emerging body of work which shows the

sensitivity of individual savings decisions to seemingly irrelevant features of their pension plan,

such as the default enrollment options, or the default asset allocation options (Choi, Laibson, and

Madrian, 2004; Beshears et al., 2007). The evidence here is perhaps especially surprising

because the sample consists of tenured and tenure-track college professors - a highly educated

group who work at large and highly stable employers. Even in this sample, however, the

“labeling” of pension contributions matters, and presumably leads to very different levels of

retirement wealth.
