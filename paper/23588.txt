What Sets College Thrivers and Divers Apart? A Contrast in Study Habits, Attitudes, and
Mental Health

                                           ABSTRACT

Students from 4-year colleges often arrive having already done very well in high school, but by
the end of first term, a wide dispersion of performance emerges, with an especially large lower
tail. Students that do well in first year (we call the top 10 percent Thrivers) tend to continue to do
well throughout the rest of their time in university. Students that do poorly (we call the bottom 10
percent Divers) greatly struggle and are at risk of not completing their degree. In this paper we
use a mandatory survey with open ended questions asking students about their first-year
experience. This allows us to explore more closely what sets Thrivers and Divers apart, in terms
of study habits, attitudes, and personal experiences. We find that poor time management and lack
of study hours are most associated with poor academic performance, and that those who struggle
recognize these weaknesses. Divers also report feeling more depressed and unhappy with their
lives. We posit an 'academic trap', whereby initial poor performance is related to poor time
management which in turn lowers expectations, which in turn leads to lower study time, and so
on. Thrivers, in contrast, study significantly more and meet with course instructors.

I. Introduction


With postsecondary enrollments having increased dramatically over the last several decades and
the importance of degree completion continuing to be emphasized by policy makers and parents
alike, more attention is being directed towards helping post-secondary students finish and exit
with valuable experience and skills (Oreopoulos and Petronijevic, 2013). Despite efforts to
increase student support, a large fraction of students still fail to graduate. In Canada, for
example, a quarter of students registered in a four-year university program do not complete their
degree within five years (Finnie, Childs and Martinello, 2014).        In the United States, the
postsecondary completion rate is less than 60 percent (NCES, 2016), and even among students
who do complete their degrees often do so with minimal grades and questionable human capital
acquisition.
       Many begin university after having done very well in high school. Figure 1, for example
shows the distribution of senior-year high school grades among first year economics students at
the University of Toronto. The median acceptance grade average is 86 percent, with a standard
deviation of only 3 percentage points. However, student performance diverges widely after only
one semester. Figure 1 illustrates this increasing variance, with an especially large lower tail
from students failing or near-failing their first-semester courses.    Incoming students arrive
having achieved stellar grade averages in high school, yet only a small fraction maintain these
averages into first year university, and most end up with dramatically lower grades.
       Prior research has shown that previous grades are among the best predictors of how well
college and university freshman will do, but other non-academic variables also help predict
performance.    Characteristics such as the Big Five personality traits – conscientiousness,
agreeableness, openness to experience, extraversion, neuroticism – and social background
sometimes rival cognitive skills in terms of predictive power for a variety of outcomes such as
educational attainment, earnings and health (Kautz et al., 2016; Almlund et al., 2011). For
instance, meta-analyses show that conscientiousness, a measure of the propensity to stay
organized, work hard and persist, is strongly positively associated with educational achievement
even after conditioning for cognitive skills (Poropat, 2009). Perseverance towards long-term
goals is also correlated with academic outcomes: the trait of grit is positively related with the
GPA of students with comparable SAT scores (Duckworth et al., 2007). Work by Mischel et al.


                                                2
(1989) and Kirby et al. (2005) suggests that the ability to delay gratification predicts future
achievement. Many such personality constructs individually correlate with measures of academic
success. However, few data sets allow identifying which variables among all these non-academic
measures that have been found to predict college grades best explain the high variance in student
performance relative to each other.
        In a previous paper (Beattie, Laliberté and Oreopoulos, 2016), we explored what
variables best predict unexpected poor or stellar grade performance in first year, after
conditioning on high school grade.1 To do so, we took advantage of a unique dataset combining a
survey of all first year economics students across all three campuses of the University of Toronto
(about 6,000 students) and administrative data containing application and performance
information. We found that while high school grade remains a strong predictor of subsequent
academic performance, several non-academic measures exhibit incremental predictive power.
Notably, conscientiousness, expected study hours and purpose-driven motivation were strongly
associated with successful and failed transition to postsecondary education.
        In this paper, we provide a broader picture of the experiences students go through in first
year by following-up with them by the start of second semester.                   These new pieces of
information allow us to explore more closely what sets top and bottom performers apart in terms
of their study habits, attitudes, personal experiences, and health. We collect original descriptive
data that is not commonly available in order to understand better the wide dispersion in first year
performance and its correlates. We look at factors such as mental health, sense of belonging,
ambition, and study habits. We also ask students open-ended questions on their biggest struggles
in university, what they think they could change to improve, and how the university might help.
Using this unique data set, we provide a descriptive analysis of the factors that set Thrivers
(students in the top 10 percent of the grade distribution) and Divers (students in the bottom 10
percent) apart in order to understand better the main issues related to the poor performance of
first year students, which may, in turn, help suggest opportunities for additional support to
reduce poor performance.
        The results show that poor time management, lack of study hours and tendencies to cram
for exams are the habits most strongly related with poor overall performance. We also find that

 In this the current paper, we refer to students in the top decile of the end-of-semester grade distribution
as Thrivers, and those in the bottom decile, Divers.


                                                     3
top performers are significantly more likely to use the free university resources available to
them and to meet with course instructors and tutors. In contrast, Divers are more likely to rely
on paid tutors. In terms of mental health, Divers are more likely to report feeling depressed and
face personal issues outside school. While a fraction of respondents believes that the university
could help by providing more mental health support and resources for non-native English
speakers, most Divers do not blame the university for their poor performance and rather suggest
that it is up to them to turn things around. However, when asked about what they should be doing
better, they often fail to come up with solutions. From this descriptive analysis, we suggest that
Divers are facing a vicious circle of poor performance, time and stress management that limit
them from identifying efficient solutions to improve their academic performance. We refer to
this vicious circle as an “academic trap”.
       The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. We describe in Section II the
randomized field experiment we implemented to collect an original set of variables on first year
students at the University of Toronto. Section III presents the results from the initial survey and
the main results from the follow up survey are discussed in Section IV. The results from the text
analysis are in Section IV. We conclude in Section V.




II. Setup and Data Collection


During the start of the 2016-17 school year, all undergraduate students enrolled in an
introduction to economics course at the three campuses of the University of Toronto were
required to complete a 'warm-up survey' and 'follow-up survey' as part of their participation
grade. Virtually all students (97 percent) completed the warm-up survey within the first three
weeks of school - a total of approximately 6,000 students. This represents about a third of all
first year students enrolled at this university, and almost 10% of the entire undergraduate student
population.2 The overall response rate for the follow-up survey was approximately 83 percent.



2
 The survey was administered as part of an ongoing field experiment. Students were randomly
assigned after completing the survey to different groups, with the control group receiving a one-
hour personality and non-cognitive skill test, and the treatment groups receiving information on


                                                4
The lower rate was largely due to students dropping their first year economics course, so that
there was no longer a grade incentive to complete. For students who did not drop, the response
rate was about the same as the initial survey.
       The set of variables that is collected as part of the warm-up survey contains detailed
background characteristics such as international student status and parental education, as well as
a large set of self-reported measures of study habits and subjective expectations. Linked
administrative variables include gender, citizenship, registration status, GPA, all courses taken
and grades received at the University of Toronto and, for the majority of students, the high
school performance measure used for admission.3
       The follow-up survey was administered at the start of the second semester (January
2017). The follow-up survey took only about 15 minutes to complete and included questions on
subjective well-being, study habits, as well as open ended questions on perceived reasons for
poor performance, the biggest challenges faced, and the type of help students could be using that
they are not currently getting.


III. Descriptive Statistics


Table 1 presents descriptive statistics from the initial survey (Fall 2016), and replicates key
results from Beattie, Laliberté and Oreopoulos (2016) using an updated cohort sample and not
conditioning on high school grade to provide a more descriptive picture.4 In column (1), we
report the mean value of the initial survey variables for all entering first year economics students.
The next three columns indicate the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles to provide more information
about the distribution of these variables. Column (5) shows the standardized mean difference of
these variables between Divers and the full sample (with standard errors in square brackets). For
example, self-reported weekly study hours in high school are, on average, 16 percent of a
standard deviation lower among Divers than the mean of the full sample. Column (6) shows the

goal-setting, mindset, and/or study advice (see Oreopoulos and Petronijevic, 2016, for more
details).

  Admission to Canadian universities is primarily determined by academic performance in high
schools. Other factors such as student essays and extracurricular activities are rarely included in
application materials.

  We do, however, condition on age, campus and cohort, to account for any differences in
grading standards.

corresponding comparison for Thrivers. Finally, the last column indicates the mean difference
between Thrivers and Divers – which is close to 40% of a standard deviation (approximately 4.3
hours per week).
      Relative to the full distribution, students who perform poorly tend to study fewer hours
both in high school and during their first year at university. They are more likely to study last
minute (0.14 s.d. above the mean) and less likely to finish what they start (0.07 s.d. below the
mean). Divers tend to work for pay more hours per week than an average student (0.16 s.d.
above the mean), they have lower expectations about their grades (0.17 s.d. below the mean) and
are less likely to aspire to go to grad school (8.5% below the mean). Unsurprisingly, they also
find the transition to college more challenging (0.11 s.d. below the mean). In terms of
demographics, international students are overrepresented in the bottom 10 percent, but first
generation status (i.e. neither of their parents is college-educated) does not predict Diver status.
      On the other hand, students among the top decile are less likely to wait at the last minute
before starting studying (0.18 s.d. below the mean) and more likely to have higher expectations
with regards to their grade (0.33 s.d. above the mean). Students who excel report studying more
hours, on average, in both high school and university. They are also spending less time at a paid
job and, to some extent, checking their phone.


IV. Results


IV.A. Study Habits


Our main results come from our follow-up survey, which took place at the beginning of the
second term (January 2017), and provided an opportunity to have students reflect on their
university experiences so far.5 Recall that students had to complete both the initial and follow-up
survey to receive a 2 percent course participation grade. Virtually every student who had not
dropped the course by January completed both surveys.
       Table 2 is in the same format as Table 1, comparing mean differences between Thrivers
and Divers. In Table 2, however, differences are calculated for self-reported study habits. For

5
 We emphasize that the results reported in this study are aimed at mapping important associations with
being a Thriver or Diver. They are not meant to imply causality between specific variables.


                                                  6
instance, one of the questions we asked students was, "Last term, when you had no immediate
deadlines (say over 2 weeks) about how many hours per week, on average, did you study
(outside of class) for all of your courses?".6 In the first row we can see that the mean response for
the full sample was 10.9 hours per week. Divers studied much less (0.30 s.d. below the mean or
approximately three hours less than the average student) and Thrivers studied over three hours
more than the average student (0.33 s.d. above the mean). This implies that on average, Thrivers
study close to seven hours per week more than Divers (p<0.01).
          We also asked students how many hours they expect to study in the Winter term when
faced with no immediate deadlines. On average, students reported higher intended hours than
what they said they did in the Fall, perhaps due to unrealistic expectations (mean of 15 hours per
week). The gap in expected hours between low and high performers persists, at 38 percent of a
standard deviation. Divers, far from intending to study more than the average in the upcoming
semester to make up for their past poor performance, still expect to study significantly less than
other students.
          In line with these results, Divers more often disagree with the statement that "I manage
my time well". The difference in response to this question between Divers and Thrivers is the
largest among all the study habits questions we asked (a difference of 69 percent of a standard
deviation). In addition, Divers were less likely to write down thoughts and ideas when studying
and less likely to remind themselves of their personal goals. They were less likely to meet with
their course instructor and free tutors (including TAs), but more likely to meet with an academic
advisor and paid tutors. Finally, Divers still report that they found the transition to college much
more challenging than the average student. Thrivers, on the other hand, were more likely to
report that they manage their time well and learn from their mistakes. They were more likely to
remind themselves about their goals and motivations for being in university, and they were also
more likely to meet with an instructor or free tutor. Thrivers were less likely to hire a paid tutor.
          Overall, the learning habit that appears to most distinguish a Thriver from a Diver is the
ability to find sufficient time to study. Meeting with instructors and tutors, learning from past
mistakes and thinking about personal goals also sets these types of students apart.
          In Figure 2, we look more carefully into the self-reported weekly study hours (excluding
hours spent in class) and show the distributions of study hours when there is no immediate

deadline for students with a fall grade above 85 percent and below 65 percent. We find that a
large share of low performing students devote five hours of study per week or less. While an
important share of top students also spends less than ten hours per week, Figure 2 shows that
they are also more likely to study between 15 and 30 hours per week.


IV.B. Mental Health and Overall Experience


We now turn to the results on mental health, life satisfaction and overall university experience.
Table 3 shows that, with the exception of whether students think the university is doing its best
to help support them and whether they think their university wants them to be successful, Divers
and Thrivers significantly differ on all measures.
       Students in the top decile of the grade distribution report to be more satisfied with their
life and their university experience. The gap between the average response in life satisfaction
between Thrivers and Divers is striking - more than half a standard deviation separates the two
groups. In comparison, the average subjective well-being gap between those unemployed and
working - is about 0.25 (Helliwell, 2003). Thrivers and Divers also differ markedly by how they
respond to feeling stressed and depressed.
       Thrivers are more likely to report that it is important for them to do well and feel more
confident about their abilities to succeed. Since the beginning of the academic year, they have
felt less depressed or stressed. They have a higher grade average for the first term (by
construction) and much higher expectations regarding their grades for the incoming semester.
High performing students also feel that they belong at their university and, for them, being a
student at the University of Toronto is an important part of how they see themselves.
       Divers are on average more likely to report a lower life satisfaction and are more likely to
have felt depressed over their first semester. Their grades during the Fall semester were more
than a full standard deviation below average, and they still expect to obtain relatively low grades
in the Winter semester (0.65 s.d. below the mean). Students in the bottom of the grade
distribution recognize that others understand the material more than themselves and are less
confident about their ability to do well, in line with prior results on the important of academic
self-efficacy, that is the belief in one’s ability to succeed (Richardson et al., 2012). We also find




                                                 8
that Divers are not as satisfied with their experience at the University of Toronto and are less
likely to feel that they belong to their university.


IV.C. Text Analysis of Student Outliers


In the follow-up survey, students were asked what their biggest challenges have been, what the
University of Toronto could do better, and what they plan to do differently. These questions
forced students to write a short response in their own words, providing a set of texts to use for a
text analysis. In this section, we focus on low performing students and present some of their
responses to understand better the main difficulties those students are experiencing.
        Figure 3 lists some examples of the biggest challenges reported by the poorest
performing students (the worst 25 in the sample). Interestingly, the challenges mentioned varied
quite widely. Time management, difficulty to deal with mental health problems and personal
issues, transitioning from high school to university and language barriers are examples of
challenges divers face. Students also mention their lack of motivation to study and work. When
asked what the University of Toronto could be doing more to help, many students reported that
they felt the University was doing what it could to help and that the problem rested more on their
shoulders. But some students did point out wanting more advice on how to manage their stress
and time (see Figure 4). Better coordination on the timing of the submission of writing
assignments, especially towards the end of the semester is another example of what they think
could be improved to help them succeed better. Divers would like smaller classes and be able to
talk more with their course instructors. In Figure 5, we list some examples of what students think
they should be doing more to help themselves and succeed better. Managing time, working more
and hiring a tutor are examples of what students think they should do better. Although they see
that there is a problem and are aware what their biggest challenge is, they do not have a clear
solution. We note that some students do not know what they should be doing better.
          Finally, we conduct a text analysis of the words used by Thrivers and Divers. The
methodology is identical to the text analysis in the initial survey.7 After cleaning the text through
Microsoft Word's spellcheck, we stem each word to remove grammatical endings such as verb

Beattie, Laliberté and Oreopoulos (2016).


                                                   9
tenses and pluralization. We then calculate a Pearson's chi-squared statistic to compare the share
of Thrivers (or Divers) who use a given word with the share of the entire sample who used it.
Very common words, such as prepositions and articles, are ignored, as are words which are used
by fewer than five Thrivers (or Divers). The results of the analysis are a set of words for each
question which are used significantly more often by Thrivers, and a second set of words which
are used significantly more often by Divers.
         The results in Tables 4, 5, and 6 show several patterns. Thrivers discuss workload and
time management more often as a common concern. When asked about their biggest challenges,
they use words such as “load”, “deadline", and “hour”, and when asked about what the
University of Toronto could do help them more, they mention `”breaks”. Thrivers are also more
likely to identify these issues as things they plan to work on, as they are more likely to use words
such as “focus”, and “schedule” when asked what they will try to do differently.
         This is consistent with the finding that students who end up being Thrivers are often
hard workers, as more hours spent studying allows students entering university to improve on
high school performance. It is interesting to note that Thrivers nevertheless seem to find
managing study time to be a challenge. This is consistent with the previous finding that
conscientiousness is an important factor in predicting success in the high school to university
transition, as students who can force themselves to work hard even when they do not want to are
more likely to thrive.
         Further, Thrivers are more likely to identify issues such as lack of office hours,
availability of meeting time with instructors, and study space. According to our survey, they
already use these services more than Divers. This suggests that Thrivers are taking advantage of
these resources but would like more of them.
         There are two major trends among Divers. First, when asked about challenges, Divers
are more likely to describe factors which may take time away from studying, using words such
as “health” and “job”. Our initial analysis identified these factors as predictors of academic
problems during the high school to university transition, but it is interesting to note that students
appear to be aware of the detrimental effects they have on their grades.
         Second, Divers seem to be more lost. When asked about challenges, Divers mentioned
used words like “language” and “understand”, and when asked what the University of Toronto
could do differently, Divers mentioned they needed more information about “details”. This



                                                 10
suggests that students who did poorly transitioning to university found the experience confusing
and overwhelming.


V. Conclusion


Most students are willing to respond honestly and meaningfully to questions about life
satisfaction, well-being, and overall experiences in school. Response rates to these kinds of
questions, however, tend to be very low, making it difficult to obtain a representative sample. In
this paper, we use a survey that all first-year Economics students (6,000 students - 25 percent of
all first year students at the University of Toronto) were required to complete for participation
grade, and linked responses to administrative data. Doing so provides a rare opportunity to
uncover important differences between top and bottom performing students
       The sharpest difference between Thrivers and Divers is in terms of how they spend their
time. Most Divers report studying for only 5 hours per week when not facing immediate
deadlines, and show a large tendency to cram. They also expresses awareness of their time
management problem, but nevertheless report expecting to raise study hours the following term
only slightly compared to the previous term, leaving them behind. In contrast, Thrivers study on
average more than half a standard deviation more than Divers and are much more confident
about their time management.
       Thrivers are also more likely to meet with their course instructors relative to the average
student, whereas Divers tend not to know where to get advice for academic success. When asked
about what the University of Toronto could do better, some Divers suggested they would like to
have more time to talk with their professors, but most attribute internal reasons behind their
struggles.
       Our results for the mental health and life satisfaction questions suggest that compared to
the average student, Divers are not enjoying their university experience. They are both more
likely to report feeling stressed and depressed. They claim that personal problems outside school
make their transition to college more challenging. The findings from the text analysis support
this result. When asked about their biggest challenges, divers were more likely to describe
factors which may take time away from studying such as “friends" and “job". Low performing
students report feeling more depressed and some believe that to perform better at school, they

should “try to be less depressed”. This highlights the fact that divers are less likely to know what
resources are available to them to obtain mental health support.
       The main contrasts we find are consistent with what might be called an “academic trap”,
in which poor performance is related to difficulty managing time and a tendency to study last
minute. This affects and is affected by overall life satisfaction as Divers are more likely to feel
depressed and report personal issues as the main challenge to their transition to college. Because
students in the bottom of the distribution are also less likely to know where to get academic
advice and less likely to meet course instructors and free tutors, they end up lacking guidance for
identifying efficient solutions to improve their academic performance. More proactive guidance
around time management and quicker response to catch early poor performance are possible
interventions worth considering.

                                         Sample Phrases

Trying to manage time efficiently

Not being able to focus properly and not getting the mental health treatment as regularly as I
would like.

I'm still in the transaction from high school to university and I felt stressed very much. I'm also
experiencing lots of stress from my family and relationship.

Adjusting to how different my 3rd world country high school was in comparison to UofT

Having no friends and the fact that no one wants to talk to me in my classes.

 Not enough inspiration for me to myself and sometimes I don't know which career should I
have.

For me, the biggest challenge is language, because English is not my first language, so I have
to take more time to understand what prof. teaches.

Finding motivation to actually sit down and study, in high school I got As without having to
do any work or study.

depression has been a huge hindrance in finding motivation to do work/go to class

Sometimes I feel like I am ready for the test or exam. However, after the exam I feel like I
don't know anything from my review.
Note: The sample phrases are taken from the responses of divers to the open question “What have been
the biggest challenges to your academic success so far?” in the follow-up survey.

                                           Sample Phrases

I think UofT is doing the best it could, now it's up to me.

I think UofT should create more groups to help those international students in order to help
them with their language problems.

Coordinate the timing of assignments and test so that they are better interspersed especially
towards the end of the semester.

Give students more advice about time management and how to manage stress.

Make the class size smaller. More time talking to professors.

try to be less depressed

Focusing a lot more in class and doing all my work.

I am thinking about how I will take a more diverse approach in seeking self-enhancement,
instead of mere academic success.

I need to have a tutor to help me study.

Managing time better

No idea to be honest
