                                           ABSTRACT

           During the first half of the nineteenth century the United States emerged as a major
producer of cotton textiles. This paper argues that the expansion of domestic textile production is
best understood as a path-dependent process that was initiated by the protection provided by the
Embargo Act of 1807 and the War of 1812. This initial period of protection ended abruptly in 1815
with the conclusion of the war and the resumption of British imports, but the political climate had
been irreversibly changed by the temporary expansion of the industry. After 1815 nascent
manufacturers sought to protect the investments they had made by lobbying Congress. Their efforts
had an important impact on the provisions concerning cotton textiles in the tariff bill of 1816, and
during the 1820s manufacturers won increasingly strong protection, culminating in the passage of
the "Tariff of Abominations" in 1828.

       At the beginning of the nineteenth century, the United States was a minor

contributor to world production of cotton textiles. Yet by mid-century the United States

was the world’s second largest producer of textiles.1 The rapid take-off in American

textile production is summarized in Table 1, which shows numbers of spindles in the

United States and Britain in the century after 1790. With the growth of textile

production, the United States also developed an active community of textile machinery

producers who became a source of important innovations in both factory spinning and

weaving technologies. In particular, Americans were the leading innovators in the

development of ring spinning techniques, while British machinery producers

concentrated on advancing mule spinning. During the second half of the nineteenth

century American advances in ring spinning made their way back across the Atlantic, as

British machinery producers began to borrow from Americans.2

       The rapid growth of the American textile industry during the nineteenth century

was an important component of the broader process of American industrialization. Cotton

textile factories were the single largest employer of manufacturing labor and textile

machinery producers made important contributions to the production of steam engines,

locomotives, and other industrial machinery. The concentration of textile producers in

the New England region for most of the nineteenth century magnified their impact on the

regional economy. Because of the geographic concentration of textile production, New

England industrialized much more rapidly than did the rest of the country. By 1880,

close to 40 percent of New England workers were employed in manufacturing, and of

these 37 percent were employed in the production of textiles. In other words,
                                                                                           2


approximately one of every six workers in New England was engaged in textile

production.

       Viewed from the perspective of the early nineteenth century it was not at all

obvious that the United States would emerge as an important producer of cotton textiles.

Population and markets were small and widely scattered, capital was expensive, and

skilled textile workers were in scarce supply.3 That the industry would become localized

in New England would also have been difficult to predict at this time. Although some

accounts have emphasized water power as a potential source of locational advantage, this

explanation does not stand up to careful examination. There were in fact many

comparable water power sites in the Mid Atlantic region, and in the Piedmont areas

further South.4 Moreover, according to Albert Bolles, writing toward the end of the

nineteenth century, the region’s natural endowment was if anything unconducive to

textile manufacturing.

       The climate was dry and cold, entailing a large expense in warming and steaming

       the air of the mills…The factories were situated many hundreds of miles away

       from the cotton growing regions, entailing another large expense…[And] the

       waterpower of the South was as abundant and cheap too, as that of the North.5

While purely locational factors do not help to explain New England’s leadership in textile

production, a more persuasive case can be made for the role of labor supply conditions.6

Nonetheless, labor supply appears to have been more important in allowing the industry

to expand after its initial establishment than in influencing entrepreneurial decisions

about where to locate factories.7
                                                                                             3


       In light of the importance of cotton textiles in both national and regional

economic development it is important to understand how and why the U.S. industry

developed when and where it did. As befits a topic of this importance the history of New

England textile production has been documented in considerable detail.8 My purpose

here is to offer a new interpretation of these facts. In this chapter I argue that the

development of the American cotton textile industry, and its localization in New England

can best be understood as a path-dependent process in which transitory historical

“accidents” altered the course of development producing effects long after the conditions

to which they gave rise had disappeared.9

       Specifically, I argue that the protection provided by the Embargo Act of 1807 and

the War of 1812 led to the initial expansion of textile manufacturing in the United States.

This transitory period of protection ended abruptly in 1815 with the conclusion of the war

and the resumption of British imports. But the political climate had been irreversibly

changed by the temporary expansion of textile manufacturing. Nascent manufacturers for

the first time sought to influence tariff policy. Their lobbying had an important impact on

the provisions concerning cotton textiles in the tariff bill of 1816, and during the 1820s

manufacturers won increasingly strong protection, culminating in the passage of the

“Tariff of Abominations” in 1828. In particular, the 1816 bill incorporated a provision

specifying a minimum valuation for textiles that created substantially greater protection

for the less expensive and coarser fabric produced by the newly established Boston

Manufacturing Company. This protection was important in providing the company the

time it needed to perfect the novel system of production—relying on the power loom and

vertically integrated production—that it had introduced, and initiating the process of
                                                                                                4


technological innovation that led to rapidly falling costs. Although the focus of my

account is on the relationship between the temporary episode of protection after 1807 and

the development of the power loom, this was not the only channel through which path

dependence operated. The impact of the early industry’s development on the formation

of an industrial labor force, and the creation of a community of engineers and mechanics

familiar with the construction and maintenance of textile machinery provided additional

sources of irreversibility that helped to promote the growth of the industry once it had

been established.

        There is, of course, a large literature devoted to the question of whether protective

tariffs were important in the development of the American textile industry.10 But most of

this literature has focused its attention on the question of whether the higher rates enacted

in the 1820s were essential. Given the limitations of the data, this question is unlikely

ever to be resolved to the full satisfaction of all participants, but it is my contention that it

was the earlier period of protection that preceded the tariff that was crucial in setting the

stage for subsequent growth, and indeed in influencing legislative actions that resulted in

protection, whether necessary or not. In the absence of these events, the course of

American economic development could well have been substantially different.



The Early Development of the American Textile Industry

        Before 1807 the scarcity of skilled labor and capital in conjunction with small and

diffuse markets for yarn and cloth discouraged the growth of textile production in

America. Americans were well informed about British innovations in textile technology

and there had been a number of successful efforts to recruit British artisans with the
                                                                                           5


knowledge to build and operate machinery based on these innovations. Yet, the

American industry remained small in size and limited in scope. In 1807, there were still

just 8,000 spindles in operation in America, a miniscule figure when set against the

millions of spindles in Britain at this time.

       The small size of the American industry reflects its competitive disadvantages in

this era, not a lack of information about British technology. Knowledge of British

innovations in spinning crossed the Atlantic quite rapidly. Within 5 years of Hargreave’s

1770 patent on the spinning jenny, for example, two 24-spindle jennies were in operation

in Philadelphia, one having been built for a immigrant weaver, and the other constructed

by a local craftsman.11 Although the jenny multiplied yarn output, it still relied on skilled

labor for its operation, and the shortage of such skilled labor was apparently a significant

obstacle to its widespread adoption in the United States. Despite the efforts of various

groups throughout the Northeast to promote domestic textile manufacturing, capacity

expanded only slowly. By 1790 there were still fewer than 10 textile manufactories in

the United States operating less than 2,000 jenny spindles.

       Typical of these efforts was the Beverly Cotton Manufactory, which was formed

by a group of Massachusetts merchants in 1787. The founders hired an English emigrant

weaver, Thomas Somers, to supervise operations, and equipped the company with an

Arkwright roller card, four jennies, a twisting mill, a warping mill, and fly shuttle looms.

Despite attracting the attention of many visitors, the company was unable to turn a profit

even though it was exempted from taxation, and subsidized by the state legislature.

Confronted with continuing losses it shut its doors within a few years.12
                                                                                             6


       While hand powered jennies offered little advantage to American producers, other

British spinning technologies appeared more promising for American circumstances. In

particular, Arkwright’s waterframe provided a route to powered spinning of strong but

coarse cotton yarn that largely dispensed with the need for skilled operatives to tend the

machinery. Construction of the machines required specialized knowledge, and mill

management similarly required a degree of skill and experience, but the machinery itself

could be operated almost entirely by young children.13

       Because of British prohibitions on the export of textile machinery, and the

absence of written documentation describing the design and operation of Arkwright’s

invention, however, the only way to for prospective American producers to obtain this

new technology was to recruit British artisans with the requisite knowledge to reproduce

the machines.14 By the late 1780s there were a number of Americans seeking to recruit

such skilled British workers. Among them was a pair of Providence, Rhode Island

merchants, William Almy and Moses Brown, who were at this time experimenting with a

diverse array of manufacturing activities, including operating a stocking frame, spinning

wool, and using a fly-shuttle equipped loom to weave cloth. Almy and Brown were also

spinning cotton on hand jennies and having it woven on linen warp, and they had

purchased several machines based on Arkwright’s designs, but had been largely

unsuccessful in getting them to work.15 In 1789, however, they obtained the services of

Samuel Slater, a British immigrant with direct knowledge of Arkwright’s technology. In

partnership with Almy and Brown, Slater set about construction of the first water

powered spinning mill in the United States.
                                                                                            7


       In contrast to other textile ventures at this time Almy and Brown’s partnership

with Slater proved successful enough to warrant a gradual expansion. While continuing

his partnership with Almy and Brown, Slater soon established his own spinning factory,

and over the next decade and a half small spinning mills proliferated in southern New

England, many of them operated by Slater’s relatives and associates and closely

following the initial model he had laid out. These mills remained small operations and

confined their activities to spinning yarn. The initial operations of picking and beating

the cotton yarn remained a hand activity performed outside the factory, as did the

weaving of yarn into cloth.

       Despite the limited success of Almy, Brown and Slater, it is clear that domestic

producers faced stiff competition from Britain. Indeed, with the outbreak of war in

Europe in 1793, British producers sought to expand their export markets in North

America to compensate for the loss of continental outlets for their production. Reflecting

these efforts, between 1793 and 1807, British exports to North America grew from £1.6

million to £10.2 million, accounting for more than 30 percent of total exports in most

years during this period.16 While figures for both domestic production and imports are

somewhat problematic, Douglas A. Irwin and Peter Temin estimated that total value of

cloth produced in New England in 1807 was only about 8 percent of the value of cloth

imported from Britain.17

       The modest growth of American factory production of textiles relied largely on

the waterframe.18 In contrast, mule spinning, which was much more prominent in

Britain, made limited progress in the United States. Like the spinning wheel and jenny

(and unlike the waterframe) the mule relied on intermittent spinning in which yarn was
                                                                                               8


first drawn out and twisted, and was then spun onto the spindle. Unlike the waterframe,

the mule required adult operatives with considerable skill and hand-eye coordination, but

it allowed for the production of finer yarns, and made it possible to utilize shorter-staple

cottons than were possible with the waterframe.19 By 1790, British factories had nearly

700,000 mule spindles in operation compared to just 310,000 waterframe spindles.

While both numbers continued to grow, the number of mule spindles grew more quickly,

reflecting the advantages in the British context of the mule’s greater versatility in

producing a range of different yarns along with the more abundant supply of skilled mule

spinners.20

       The passage of the Embargo Act, which took effect in December 1807, effectively

blocking trade with Europe caused a dramatic shift in the fortunes of domestic

manufacturing in the United States. The Embargo created in effect nearly complete

protection for domestic producers while substantially contracting export markets for raw

cotton and thus lowering the price of this crucial input. Although the longer-run effect of

the embargo was to stimulate production, the immediate effect was a sharp reduction in

demand for American yarn. Almy and Brown’s chief markets were in New England, and

the merchants upon whom they relied to distribute yarn were hit hard by the collapse of

trade caused by the embargo. Nonetheless, the embargo created new opportunities that

soon buoyed production.21

       The growing population in the trans-Allegheny west had until now been supplied

largely with fabrics imported by Philadelphia and Baltimore merchants. Faced with the

cessation of these imports, merchants in these Mid-Atlantic cities turned to the New

England mills. Prior to the embargo, more than half of Almy and Brown’s sales had been
                                                                                                9


to merchants in Boston and other northern New England cities. In 1808, however, this

share fell to just 17 percent, while Philadelphia and Baltimore together accounted for 44

percent of their sales, up from 24 percent in 1806.22

       The cessation of trade caused by the Embargo Act, and the subsequent disruptions

due to the Non-intercourse Act and the open hostilities with Britain that began in 1812

made domestic production much more profitable than it had previously been. As Figure

1 illustrates, while the prices of cloth rose, the cost of raw cotton was falling after 1808.

The partial resumption of trade after the repeal of the Embargo Act caused cloth prices to

fall in 1810 and 1811, but the outbreak of war with Britain in 1812 caused the gap

between input and output prices to widen further. In this period, falling raw materials

costs in combination with rising product prices suddenly made textile manufacturing a

much more attractive opportunity, especially for merchants whose capital was now

released from international trade. Figure 2 makes clear just how abrupt the response to

the shift in business opportunities was. From 1800 through 1807, just 5 textile

manufacturing firms were incorporated in New England and the Mid Atlantic states. In

1809, 18 new companies were incorporated. Another 17 were formed in 1810, and the

number of incorporations continued to increase thereafter, reaching a peak of 105 in

1814. The resulting growth in domestic manufactures is also apparent in the industry’s

consumption of cotton. Between 1800 and 1805, the growth of domestic cloth

production had doubled consumption of cotton from 500 to 1,000 bales. In the next five

years cotton consumption increased ten-fold, and by 1815 it had grown to 90,000 bales.23

Peace and the resumption of British imports brought this period of expansion to an abrupt

end, a fact clearly reflected in the sharp drop in factory incorporations after 1814.
                                                                                         10




The Origins of the Massachusetts System

       The growth of domestic textile production in the United States after 1807 was

based almost entirely on supplying the growing demand for cloth, not yarn. To meet this

demand the Slater-style mills of southern New England were obliged to find weavers to

convert their factory spun yarn into fabric. They did this through a proliferation of

arrangements with individual weavers. But this situation proved highly unsatisfactory for

a number of reasons. The supply of weavers in proximity to the spinning mills was

quickly exhausted, making it necessary to contract over increasingly long distances.

Many of the weavers Slater dealt with, for example, were more than 20 miles away.

Moreover, individual weavers proved unreliable, and the quality of their work varied

substantially. Almy and Brown expressed their frustration in securing regular deliveries

from outworkers in an 1809 letter, observing that “we have several hundred pieces now

out weaving…but a hundred looms in families will not weave as much cloth as ten at

least constant workmen.” The next year they abandoned outwork entirely, setting up a

group of hand weavers in their workshop and instructing their superintendent to spin only

as much yarn as these weavers could convert into cloth.24

       The scarcity of hand weavers was thus a significant bottleneck to the growth of

the American textile industry. Seeking to overcome this obstacle a number of

manufacturers and mechanics sought to develop a power loom. British innovators had

been working on developing power looms as well, but the much more abundant supply of

skilled hand weavers must have made the need for such an innovation far less pressing.25

Among the Americans interested in power weaving was Francis Lowell, a Boston
                                                                                           11


merchant. Lowell had spent several years in Scotland, and had made careful observations

of British textile technologies during his time abroad. Now he drew on this knowledge to

develop plans for a power loom. In 1813, during the wartime boom in domestic textile

production, Lowell in combination with a small group of Boston businessmen established

the Boston Manufacturing Company, with the goal of spinning and weaving cotton cloth

in a single integrated factory.26 Working with a skilled mechanic, Paul Moody, he was

able to construct a satisfactory loom, and the Boston Manufacturing Company produced

its first cloth in 1815.

        In contrast to American borrowing of spinning technology, the development of

power weaving proceeded more or less in parallel in the United States and Britain, and

Lowell’s solution to the problem of power weaving was rather different from British

efforts. From the outset, Lowell’s goal was to weave a single, uniform product. As

Nathan Appleton, one of Lowell’s associates in the formation of the Boston

Manufacturing Company recalled: “The article first made at Waltham, was precisely the

article of which a large portion of the manufacture of this country has continued to

consist; a heavy sheeting of No. 14 yarn, 37 inches wide, 44 picks to the inch, and

weighing something less than three yards to the pound.” This was a plain, coarsely

woven, but durable fabric that Lowell intended to compete primarily with the “yard wide

goods of India” that had heretofore supplied the country. 27

        By dispensing with the need for flexibility, and concentrating on weaving coarse

yarn, Lowell was able to substantially simplify the mechanical problem of building his

loom. In particular, because the coarser yarn that Lowell planned to use would be able to

withstand relatively greater stresses than finer yarns, he was able to dispense with the
                                                                                           12


need for a variable speed batten and the complex gearing that that implied. There is little

evidence to document the evolution of Lowell’s thinking at this time, so it is difficult to

say if he was remarkably prescient in adapting the Boston Manufacturing Company’s

production process to America conditions, or if he was simply lucky. But in either event

the system that emerged was remarkably well suited to the factor proportions and product

markets that confronted American producers at this time. Using coarse yarn spun on

waterframes to weave a coarse but durable fabric, Lowell was able to substitute higher

quality raw materials and special purpose machinery for relatively scarce skilled labor,

while meeting a growing domestic market.28

       Developing a power loom was essential to overcoming the shortage of hand

weavers in the United States, but the decision of Lowell and his associates to embed the

use of the loom in an integrated textile factory was arguably as important in terms of its

influence on the industry’s subsequent development. From the outset, Lowell envisioned

the Boston Manufacturing Company as encompassing the entire range of production

activities involved in converting raw cotton into cloth. In particular this meant that

spinning and weaving operations could be closely matched to each other, ensuring that

yarn suitable for the power looms was produced in the appropriate quantity, and that

there would be a use for all of the yarn that was spun by the factory. This close

integration, in conjunction with the decision to produce a single uniform type of fabric

also reduced the need for flexibility in production.

       Although the technologies adopted by the Boston Manufacturing Company did

not require craft skills, they nonetheless placed substantial demands on existing sources

of labor supply. The scale of the company’s operations required a much larger labor
                                                                                              13


force than existing spinning mills had needed, and the physical demands of operating the

equipment meant that the bulk of this labor had to be performed by adults. An adequate

supply of labor was not to be found at the factory site. To meet its labor needs the

company was obliged to innovate by recruiting young women from rural areas of New

England and providing suitable housing for them near the factory.29 That there was a

large pool of potential labor in the countryside to be recruited facilitated the industry’s

subsequent expansion, but there is little indication that this realization had much impact

on the company’s initial choice of location.30

       While Lowell and his associates focused on mechanizing and speeding up the

production of a small range of fabrics by substituting special purpose machinery for

skilled labor, British inventors devoted considerable attention to the development of

machinery that could be adapted to produce a broad range of different yarns and fabrics.

In doing so, the machinery they devised continued to rely much more heavily on the more

abundant supplies of skilled mule spinners available in Britain. Such a strategy was

essential in the vertically disintegrated British industry, where spinning mills had to be

able to adapt to the shifting demands of weavers. It also reflected the larger market for

high quality products that British manufacturers supplied.31 Britain’s continued reliance

on mule spinning reinforced the divergence of the two national systems because the

primary route into the ranks of skilled mule spinners was through informal apprenticeship

as a piecer.32 Thus an important by-product of reliance on mules was the production of

the next generation of mule spinners.

        Beyond reducing demand for skilled mule spinners and hand weavers, the Boston

Manufacturing Company’s decision to integrate production served to focus innovation on
                                                                                          14


bottlenecks in the production process. Realizing the benefits of the new power looms, for

example, required improvements in the process of warping and dressing. After the

introduction of the power loom, Moody turned his attention to improving existing

techniques for winding and dressing the warp yarns for power looms. By altering the

position of the warping beams and adding drying fans he was able to speed the process of

dressing the yarn, while the introduction of stop action devices that would detect breaks

in the yarn allowed warping to be carried out more rapidly. Because of the stresses it

placed on the yarn the Waltham loom also required yarns with a relatively high twist.

Imparting this twist meant that spindles had to turn more slowly, and increased the

number of spindles necessary to supply each loom. This trade-off encouraged American

innovators to search for ways to increase the speed at which yarn could be spun. At the

same time that integration focused attention on bottlenecks slowing production, it also

created opportunities for cost savings. A good example of this is provided by Moody’s

development of a filling frame that used bobbins that could be used in powered looms,

thus avoiding a separate step to wind the yarn onto the bobbins.33

       The Boston Manufacturing Company commenced production in January 1815,

and by 1816 the initial plant, equipped with 2,000 spindles, was in full operation. By

early 1818 a second mill was under construction. During these early years Moody

continued to refine existing machinery, and develop new equipment. By about 1820

Moody had completed the basic set of machinery on which the Waltham system rested,

but the rapid pace of advance in total factor productivity throughout the 1820s and 1830s

suggests that learning-by-doing continued to create substantial opportunities for

incremental improvement in the production process.34 By 1820 the company had
                                                                                          15


exhausted the available water power sources in Waltham, and many of the original

investors along with a few new ones began to explore new sites for future expansion,

settling eventually on what would become the town of Lowell. In December 1821 this

group established the Merrimack Company to construct a factory at this site. Over the

next decade the same close knit group of investors founded additional companies as

demand for their product continued to grow rapidly.35

       While the textile industry in Massachusetts grew through the multiplication of

factories based on the underlying technology developed by Lowell and Moody at the

Boston Manufacturing Company, textile firms in Rhode Island followed a different path

of development. For a number of years, these firms continued to rely on hand weaving to

produce finer and more complex fabrics, such as checks and plaids, which could not be

produced on power looms. But competition from imported cloth imposed significant

pressures on these companies, and most went out of business. The resulting decline in

demand for hand weavers helped to reduce hand weaving rates, however, making it

possible for the survivors to hold out for quite a while. Slater, for example, did not

abandon hand weaving until 1827. Thus, there was a gradual convergence toward

integrated production and power looms throughout New England, but the route followed

by the Rhode Island producers was rather different from their neighbors to the North.36

       In contrast to the technological convergence of the industry in New England,

producers in Philadelphia continued to rely more on hand weaving, producing finer and

more varied goods, and seeking to adjust production to changes in market demand.37 The

Philadelphia producers struggled, however, in the face of import competition, and they

remained a relatively small part of the American industry. In 1831, Pennsylvania
                                                                                           16


produced just 10 percent of the nation’s cloth, while New England accounted for 71

percent.38



Tariff Protection and Path Dependence

       The protection from foreign competition afforded the American textile industry

after 1807 was instrumental in the rapid expansion of capacity, and encouraged the

emergence of a uniquely American set of production technologies promoted by Francis

Lowell and embodied in the Boston Manufacturing Company. The argument for path

dependence hinges, however, on making the case that this initial “historical accident”

altered the course of the industry’s subsequent development. One important and

irreversible consequence of the industry’s growth in this period was a change in the

political environment in which subsequent discussions of tariff policy took place. In this

context Congress adopted in 1816 a tariff bill that provided an important degree of

protection for the industry, preventing a return to the pre-war status quo and providing

Lowell and Moody with the opportunity to work out the details of the Boston

Manufacturing Company’s production process.

       Following the ratification of the Treaty of Ghent in February 1815 the country

was flooded with imports. During the year ending September 30, 1814 total imports were

valued at just $12.97 million. In the following year this figure increased almost nine-

fold, to $113 million. In 1816 the value of imports increased again, reaching $147

million.39 Among these imports were large quantities of yarn and cloth offered at low

prices. Confronted with this competition, America producers substantially scaled back

production. Douglass A. Irwin and Peter Temin estimate that the value of imported
                                                                                          17


British cloth rose from zero in 1814 to $21 million in 1815. Because of the long voyages

involved, Indian and Chinese imports did not increase until 1816, but then their value

shot up as well. Under pressure from these imports, the value of cloth production in New

England fell from $47,160 in 1815 to just $16,355 in 1816.40

       The effect of renewed competition was devastating for American textile

producers. In June 1816, Nathan Appleton accompanied Lowell on a tour of a number of

Rhode Island mills, finding production at a standstill:

       We proceeded to Pawtucket. We called on Mr. Wilkinson, the maker of

       machinery. He took us into his establishment—a large one; all was silent, not a

       wheel in motion, not a man to be seen. He informed us that there was not a

       spindle running in Pawtucket, except a few in Slater’s old mill, making yarns. All

       was dead and still…We saw several manufacturers; they were all sad and

       despairing.41

Without additional protection it appears that conditions would have returned to

something like the situation that prevailed before 1807. Recognizing this, many of the

new manufacturers turned to Congress in hopes of rescuing their investments.

       The temporary increase in duties passed at the outset of the War of 1812 was

slated to end one year after conclusion of the peace treaty. Consequently early in 1816

Congress took up the question of establishing new duties. Reporting on the subject, the

Committee on Commerce and Manufactures explicitly noted the difficulties of cotton

manufacturers, and the numerous petitions that had been received from them advocating

greater tariff protection. Citing the perilous condition of these manufacturers, the

committee went on to note that passage of a protective tariff would put the manufacturers
                                                                                             18


“…again into operation with increased powers; but should it be withheld they will be

prostrated….A capital of near sixty millions of dollars will become inactive, the greater

part of which will be a dead loss to the manufacturers.”42

       Textile manufacturers efforts to influence tariff legislation extended beyond

petitioning Congress for support. It is apparent from the records of the subsequent debate

in Congress that for the first time a number of manufacturers were present in Washington

during discussion of the tariff bill, and that members of Congress consulted with them to

ascertain the effects of potential legislation.43 Prominent among those manufacturers

seeking to influence the tariff was Francis Lowell, who was instrumental in shaping an

important piece of the resulting legislation: the provision in the bill that established a

minimum valuation for cotton cloth imports of 25 cents per square yard. As a result of

this provision cloth valued at its place of export at less than 25 cents per yard was taxed

as if its value was 25 cents. Such a provision fell heavily on the Indian textiles that

Lowell envisioned as the primary competition for the Boston Manufacturing Company’s

product. Since these fabrics cost only about 8 or 9 cents per yard in India, the minimum

effectively increased their price by over 80 percent.44

       Lowell’s position was at odds with most of the other producers, and the more

moderate position that he adopted on the tariff rate won the support of a number of key

southern representatives. Describing the situation, Appleton wrote: “The Rhode Island

manufacturers were clamorous for a very high specific duty,” but Mr. Lowell’s “views on

the tariff were much more moderate, and he finally brought Mr. Lowndes and Mr.

Calhoun [both of South Carolina], to support the minimum…”45 By focusing on the

minimum clause rather than a high overall rate, Lowell had found a way to circumvent
                                                                                            19


important sectional conflicts on trade, and win the backing necessary to gain protection

that he believed his company needed. Because Indian textiles did not use American

cotton, it was possible for at least some influential southern Congressmen to support the

minimum clause, which effectively excluded Asian cloth, while continuing their

opposition to high overall tariff rates, which would threaten the British manufacturers

who were the main consumers of America cotton.46

       The importance of Lowell’s strategy, and the effect of his effort to win southern

support for the minimum is apparent in the two key votes on the tariff bill, which are

compared in Table 2. In the first vote, the House by a large majority voted to reduce the

proposed tariff on textiles from 30 percent in the first 2 years to 25 percent for two years,

followed by a 20 percent rate in subsequent years. As Table 2 makes clear, the majority

of support for the higher rate came from the Mid Atlantic and Midwest. Votes from the

New England delegates—reflecting the region’s strong mercantile interests—were nearly

2-to-1 for the lower rate, Rhode Island’s representatives did vote in favor of the higher

rate. As expected, the South was strongly against higher tariffs, voting nearly 5-to-1 to

lower the rate. A few days later the House turned to the question of the minimum,

rejecting a proposal to eliminate this provision. Once again, the Mid Atlantic and

Midwestern representatives voted strongly in favor of protection. Although

representatives from the southern states still voted against the tariff bill, the margin

narrowed considerably, with delegates from South Carolina—one of the major cotton

growing states—now voting 6-to-3 in favor of the minimum. In New England, as well,

the pattern of voting shifted notably. In contrast to the earlier vote, New England

legislators voted strongly in favor of the minimum. Interestingly, a large number of the
                                                                                          20


representatives from Massachusetts ducked this vote and were not recorded, possibly

reflecting an effort on their part to avoid offending either the state’s mercantile and

nascent manufacturing interests.

       By advocating the minimum provision Lowell had succeeded in finding a

workable political compromise that provided the Boston Manufacturing Company with

considerable protection from its chief competition: low-priced Indian textiles. The

minimum was in effect essentially a prohibitory rate. As the Boston merchant Henry Lee

wrote after passage of the minimum: “We have given up the Calcutta trade, except for

raw cotton, Manufactures will not do—The Duty on coarse Cloths under new Tariff is

from 60 to 70 % …”47 In the wake of its adoption the value of imports from India fell by

nearly two-thirds between 1816 and 1817.48

       The tariff of 1816 provided some protection for other producers as well, reducing

the flow of British imports. But the postwar slump, foreign competition and the collapse

of western currencies greatly strained many of the more traditional textile firms in Rhode

Island and around Philadelphia, whose products competed more directly with those of

British manufacturers. Many went out of business, and others substantially scaled back

production. One of the clearest signs of contraction is the declining demand for hand

weavers, who saw piece rates fall from a third to a half between 1816 and 1820 as they

were squeezed between the lower cost of machine woven plain cloth and the low prices

of imported fancy goods from Britain.49

       The continued depression of traditional textile manufacturers in Philadelphia was

clearly captured in data collected for the census of 1820. At the firm of Craige, Holmes

& Co., which had begun production in 1809, the number of outwork weavers fell from a
                                                                                              21


peak of 300 during the war to only 150 by 1820. Other manufacturers had also

contracted production substantially. Table 3 documents the dramatic decline in

employment. Overall textile employment in Philadelphia fell by almost 85 percent from

its peak in 1816 to its trough in 1819, with yarn production and cotton weaving being hit

much harder than wool or other products such as hosiery and rugs. Even by 1820, as

employment had begun to bounce back, employment was still only about 30 percent of its

1816 level.50

       In contrast to the depressed conditions of Rhode Island and Philadelphia textile

firms, the Boston Manufacturing Company was expanding rapidly at this time. Sales

increased from $412 in 1815 to $23,628 in 1816, and had reached $260,658 by 1820

despite declining cloth prices.51

       Was the protection provided by the tariff of 1816 essential to the Boston

Manufacturing Company’s success in this period? The evidence on this point is

circumstantial, but suggestive. First, it is evident that in 1816 Lowell believed that this

protection was vital. His presence in Washington during the Congressional discussion of

the tariff, and the efforts he devoted to insuring the passage of the minimum clause

provide some indication of the importance he placed on this measure. But it is also

important to keep the chronology of events in mind. The Boston Manufacturing

Company had only begun production in early 1815, just as the Peace Treaty was

concluded, and the volume of its production and sales in that year was miniscule. Paul

Moody had worked out solutions to a number of the technological challenges of

integrated production by 1816, but it was not until 1820 that he had developed versions of

all of the machinery that would comprise the Waltham system. And the sustained
                                                                                           22


improvements in productivity over the next two decades point to the considerable room

for additional improvement that remained at this point. As a result it is easy to imagine

that there must have been considerable uncertainty about the company’s prospects at this

time. Supporting this view Figure 3 compares the prices of Waltham cloth, with that of

Russian Brown sheeting. In 1815, Waltham produced cloth was nearly 20 percent higher

in price than its competitor. But by 1819, this gap in prices had been eliminated and

thereafter prices of the two fabrics followed a comparable downward trend. In view of

these facts, there is good reason to believe that without the minimum the Boston

Manufacturing Company’s investors would have been reluctant to make the additional

investments in perfecting the company’s technology and expanding its capacity. And

without these investments the American industry would have developed much more

slowly, if at all.52

        During the 1820s the effective level of tariff protection for the American industry

increased substantially. Even without additional Congressional action, falling textile

prices driven by sustained technological improvements in efficiency would have

increased the range of fabrics to which the minimum valuation applied. But in 1824

Congress raised the minimum valuation to 30 cents per yard, and in 1828 increased it

again to 35 cents. By 1830, Douglas Irwin and Peter Temin have calculated that the

average ad valorem tariff on British textile imports amounted to over 40 percent. With

falling prices, the effective tariff continued to increase, reaching a peak of nearly 50

percent in the early 1840s before being dramatically scaled back in the tariff bill of

1846.53 There is, however, little evidence that the Massachusetts textile firms viewed this

additional protection as necessary for their survival, and they did not lobby for these
                                                                                          23


increases. Increased protection, however, may have been more important in sustaining

the smaller and less mechanized branches of the industry in Philadelphia and Rhode

Island.

          While the additional protections enacted after 1816 may have been unnecessary

from the perspective of the Boston Manufacturing Company, some level of tariff

protection appears to have been important for an extended period of time. Determining

when the American industry could have competed without protection is controversial and

unlikely to be completely resolved given the limitations of the data. F.W. Taussig

contended that by 1833 the period of the American industry’s infancy had come to an

end, and that tariff protection was no longer necessary.54 More recently, however, Mark

Bils and C. Knick Harley have argued that had tariffs been eliminated at this time a large

part of the American industry would have been driven from the market by competition

from British imports.55 Drawing on comparisons of the prices of similar British and

American products, which are available from the early 1840s, Harley concluded that

throughout the 1840s and 1850s American prices would have been above the prices of

British cloth plus the costs of trans-Atlantic shipping. While the pre-1846 tariffs were so

high as to be redundant, Harley showed that even after 1846, the more limited tariffs still

in effect were enough to offset British cost advantages. This conclusion is supported by

the fact that American cloth was largely uncompetitive with British cloth in third

markets, such as Canada, where the two products competed on an equal footing.

Recently, Douglas A. Irwin and Peter Temin have challenged Harley’s interpretation.

based on econometric analysis of the relationship between the relative price of imported

cloth and domestic cloth production.56 Irwin and Temin found that domestic production
                                                                                             24


was insensitive to variation in the price of imported British cloth (incorporating the

effects of the tariff), which they interpreted as evidence that the two products were

sufficiently differentiated that they did not compete directly. The difficulty with this

interpretation is that given the apparent redundancy of the rates that prevailed from the

early 1830s through 1846 there is no reason to expect that marginal variations in tariff

rates would have any impact on the volume of domestic production. Although this

objection does not apply to the post-1846 period, there was no variation in tariff rates

after this date, and British export prices changed little in this period, so it is hardly

surprising and not terribly informative that their regression fails to find a relationship

between import price movements and domestic cloth production. That American

production did not fall after 1846, does suggests that American producers could by this

date hold their own against international competition with a minimum of protection. But

dating the transition more precisely is nearly impossible given the types of evidence

available.

        Regardless of how early the Boston Manufacturing Company could have survived

in the absence of tariff protection, the disproportionate protection that the minimum

valuation clause provided for the coarse machine-made cloth that it produced

undoubtedly accelerated the American industry’s transition to vertical integration and

power weaving based on the Waltham model. This in turn created a pronounced

divergence between the British and American industries that is clearly apparent by the

1830s. Fabrics differ in a variety of dimensions, the most important of which are the

count—or fineness of the yarn—and the complexity of the weave. While complexity

cannot be measured, data allow us to get a sense of the count produced in each country.
                                                                                           25


As Peter Temin has documented, by the early 1830s American and British manufacturers

were producing almost entirely different products.57 An 1833 survey of Lancashire firms,

for example, found that counts varied from 8 to 180, with the average being around 51.

In contrast, the Massachusetts textile firms concentrated in coarser fabrics with counts in

the low 20s. In New York, the only state for which a distribution of counts is available

80% of the cloth produced had counts of under 21 (in comparison just 9% of Lancashire

fabric in 1833 was below 21). Indirect evidence for other states based on the average

weight per yard suggests an average count in most states of around 20. Only

Pennsylvania appears to have diverged from this pattern.

       Associated with these different products were very different technological

paradigms. British technological innovation focused on increasing the versatility of

machinery to allow shifts in count and fineness in response to shifting market

opportunities. Thus considerable effort was devoted to developing a fully automated

mule, perfecting looms that could be adapted to producing different weaves of cloth, and

roving machines that could produce a wide range of rovings. In contrast, American

innovations focused primarily on reducing capital and labor costs by increasing the speed

with which standard counts of yarn and standardized fabrics could be produced. By mid-

century American advances in continuous spinning had proceeded far enough that they

began to be re-imported by British textile machine makers.



Conclusion

       By the mid-nineteenth century, America had emerged as the second largest

producer of textiles in the world, and while American manufacturers were not
                                                                                           26


competitive in export markets with British manufacturers, they dominated their own large

domestic market and had developed a distinctive and eventually highly influential mass

production technology that was substantially different from the more vertically

disintegrated and craft-based production system in Britain. At the beginning of the

eighteenth century, this situation would have been viewed as highly improbable.

Explaining how the American textile industry overcame its initial disadvantages is central

to our understanding of the larger course of American economic development.

        It has been my contention that the development of the American textile industry

hinged on a series of historical “accidents.” The growth of the American industry was

initiated in 1808 by the high level of protection afforded in the years between 1808 and

1815 by the Embargo and Non-intercourse Acts, and the War of 1812. With the return of

peace in 1815, the situation could easily have reverted to something close to the pre-war

status quo. Cheap imported cloth flooded domestic markets and caused many

manufacturers to abandon production. But the substantial investments made in

manufacturing plant, and the large number of manufacturers shifted the political debate

and led to the passage of tariff laws that provided protection to at least one branch of the

domestic industry, that based on factory production of cloth. This protection, in turn,

provided the inducements necessary to develop and perfect this technology.

       Tariff protection was, of course, inefficient in terms of static resource allocation.

Had tariff rates been set at a lower level in 1816, American consumers would have been

able to purchase more cotton cloth at lower prices. But this static inefficiency was

important in encouraging dynamic gains in efficiency through technological innovations

pursued by American producers. The essence of the infant industry argument is that the
                                                                                          27


long-run gains from these advances outweighed the initial costs of the tariff. How one

judges the trade-off between costs and benefits hinges on the question of how quickly

American producers became able to compete in world markets without tariff protection.

       Beyond the effects of tariff protection in creating the circumstances in which

American textile producers could develop and perfect their own distinctive technology

there are other, perhaps even more significant spillovers, though their effects are hard to

quantify within the framework of efficiency. One of these spillovers operated through

the development of the American machine tool industry and the development of an

indigenous community of engineers. Along with small arms producers, textile machine

shops were the major source of skilled mechanics who contributed to the emergence of a

distinctive American machine building industry in the nineteenth century. A second set

of spillovers operated through labor markets. During the 1840s New England textile

mills emerged as important magnets for Irish immigrants. In their absence, Irish

immigration to the United States might have been slower, with important implications for

sectional politics in the 1840s and 1850s. Constructing a full blown counterfactual

account of American economic development in the absence of the tariff is beyond the

scope of this essay, but Australia—a rich, growing economy, reliant primarily on

agricultural production and dependent on trade to meet its needs for manufactured

goods—offers a vision of one potential alternative path.

     Major contributions to this literature begin with F. W. Taussig, The Tariff History of

the United States (New York and London: G. P. Putnam’s Sons, 1931), who argued that

tariff protection was unnecessary by the early 1830s. Mark Bils, “Tariff Protection and

no. 4 (December 1984), and C. Knick Harley, “International Competitiveness of the

international competitiveness. C. Knick Harley, “The Antebellum Tariff: Different

Products or Competing Sources? A Comment on Irwin and Temin,” Journal of Economic

     Jeremy, Transatlantic, 90, concludes based on the high proportion of women and

children reported in the textile labor force in the 1810 census that the bulk of the 31,000

spindles recorded in that year must have relied on the Arkwright technology, rather than

mules, which required comparatively more adult male operatives

     It is perhaps worth recalling that one impetus to the initial British innovations in

spinning was the scarcity of yarn confronting hand weavers in mid-eighteenth century

the quality of local cotton supplies. Ring spinning would work only with long-staple

cottons, while mules were capable of spinning a greater variety of cotton.

in providing housing for its workers represented another stage of vertical integration,

extending the company’s operations into the management of the supply of labor inputs.

Similarly, the company’s reliance on its own machine shop to produce and maintain its

equipment was another manifestation of this vertical integration.

     Because of cultural conventions and agricultural technology, there was a substantial

pool of surplus labor on New England farms in the early nineteenth century. The opening

of the Erie Canal and the effects of competition from Midwestern farms further increased

this supply in the 1820s as textile labor demand expanded rapidly. Field, “Sectoral

potential source of labor. It took the institutional innovations introduced by the Boston

Manufacturing Company to realize this potential.

     Because the duty was not applied to the shipping costs, the effect on prices in

American markets was more muted, but it is in comparison with the production costs that

the tariff’s impact should be assessed. In the absence of the minimum clause, the

effective tariff would have been substantially smaller.

     Zevin, “Growth”, 10:9-10, argued that import substitution can account for only a small

fraction of the expansion of domestic production after 1816, a view that would appear to

discount the importance of tariff protection. But in fact, Zevin’s views are not at odds

with the interpretation offered here. As Zevin goes on to observe “In the market for plain

cloths which New England mills supplied in significant quantities, New England already

supplied nearly 100 per cent of market requirements in 1816.” Logically, then, import

substitution relative to this initial position cannot have been important. But had tariffs

been lower, much of the growth in demand supplied by the domestic industry might

instead have been supplied by imports. It is to this counterfactual situation that we must

important in stimulating the domestic industry’s growth.
