                Economic Rents Derived from Hospital Privileges
                      in the Market for Podiatric Services



                                    ABSTRACT



    This, study examines the relative impacts of human capital and market

conditions on the economic rents associated with hospital privileges in the

market for footcare. An empirical model of hospital privileges for podiatrists

is formulated based on the Pauly-Redisch model of hospital behavior. The

privilege model is then incorporated into a model of podiatrists' earnings via a

selection adjustment as proposed by Heckman and Lee. The results indicate the

persistance of economic rents even after controlling for unobserved "quality"

factors.

 Introduction

      Hospitals are centrally concerned with the competence of the practitioners

who have access to their facility. One of the main mechanisms for controlling

the quality of medical practice within a hospital is policy related to the

granting of hospital privileges to practitioners. This is particularly true

since the 1966 Darling v. Charleston Community Hospital Case1 which extended the

scope of malpractice liability beyond the individual practitioner to the hospi-.

tal. Hospitals were found, in the Darling case as well as others, to bear legal

responsibility for the quality of care delivered by their medical staffs. This

created an incentive for hospitals to be very selective in the granting of staff

privileges.

     The medical profession is a key influence in developing national guidelines

for the granting of hospital staff priveleges. Moreover, since hospital staffs

are comprised largely of physicians, that profession exerts substantial

influence on policy towards staff privileges, especially at the level of the

individual hospital. While on one hand physicians are in an excellent position

to judge professional competence, they are also in a position to use their

influence to advance their economic interests by excluding competitors.

     Obtaining hospital staff privileges may be critical to an individual prac-

titioner's economic viability. Hospital privileges determine whether providers

have any access to a hospitalts surgical facilities, thereby defining the scope

of procedures that they may perform and whether they are permitted to admit

patients. For non—physician health professionals, the importance of privileges

depends on the inpatient potential of their practices. The absence of access to

a hospital may also have concommitant effects on the outpatient portion of a

provider's practice. If a non-physician provider without privileges competes with

a physician with privileges the non—physician provider may be viewed as less
                                     —2-

desirable because he/she does not offer a "full product line." This is par-

ticularly important in health care where there is uncertainty on the part of a

patient as to:   1) the nature of their medical problem, and 2) the most

appropriate treatment for their condition.

     In the research reported here we analyze the economic consequences of

obtaining various levels of hospital staff privileges for podiatrists. We spe-

cifically address the determinants of staff privileges focusing on the relative

influence of quality and competitive factors. We then trace the impact of those

privileges on the earnings of podiatrists. We provide estimates of the "rents"

arising from full access to hospital facilities controlling for quality dif-

ferences between providers. The paper is organized as follows: In the next

section we provide background information on the market. The third section

describes the empirical model of podiatric earnings. The fourth section

describes the econometric technique used to assess the effect of privileges on

earnings. The fifth and final sections report results and conclusions.


Background

     In 1982 there were roughly 9500 actively practicing Doctors of Podiatric
Medicine (DPMs) in the United States. Approximately 70 percent of podiatrists have

some access to hospital facilities. Fifty-four percent have staff privileges

that are equivalent to those granted to physicians. Podiatrists are con-

centrated in metropolitan areas on the east and west coasts. The average annual

earnings of podiatrists are about $57,000. In contrast general practitioners

earn roughly $68,000 and general surgeons $145,000. Podiatrists are in a rather

unique position with respect to their scope of practice. While they have not

enjoyed the unrestricted scope of practice of physicians, they have progressed

considerably further than other non—physician health care professionals. For

example, unlike psychologists, podiatrist services are paid for by third party

payors in the same fashion as their medical counterparts.
                                       —3—


     Podiatrists are overwhelmingly located in urban areas, 95% are located in

cornniunities with populations over 10,000. They provide an average of roughly 79

visits per week to 69 patients. Most podiatrists spend the majority of their

time in private office based practice. Eighty nine percent spend over fifty

percent of their time in such practice. Only about 14 percent devote at

least 10 percent of their time to hospital inpatient practice. The vase

majority of podiatrists report that the majority of their time is spent in the

general practice of podiatry as opposed to surgery, foot orthopedics, or sports

medicine. Podiatrists spend an average of 15 percent of their time performing

surgery2•

    It has been estimated that approximately 20 percent of an orthopedist's patient

visits involve treatment of foot and ankle problems3• Orthopedists provide the

majority of foot surgery undertaken by physicians. Overall orthopedic surgeons are

estimated to perform roughly 13 percent of all elective foot surgery as opposed

to 64 percent provided by podiatrists4•

     The 1979, Joint Commission on Accrediation of Hospitals (JCAH) standards stated

that medical staff membership is limited to "individuals who are currently fully

licensed to practice medicine and, in addition to licensed dentists"5• However,

podiatrists may also become members of the "medical staff" under the JCAH rules. To

include podiatrists, the hospitals must make bylaws with specific references to

podiatric services. The scope and extent of surgical privileges granted must be

defined for each podiatrist as is done for all medical staff surgical privileges. A

second level of a hospital's staff membership, is the "professional" or "clinical"

privilege. In the case of podiatrists, such membership may offer a range of limited

privileges such as the ability to consult on patients who are hospitalized for

non podiatric problems, or the ability to perform podiatric surgery in hospital
                                 -4-


operating rooms as long as a physician admits the patient. Also, a con-

sultation with a physician is generally required prior to surgery.

    The level and intensity of training obtained by podiatrists has changed

dramatically since as late as 1962 (when the last major revisions in DPM educa-

tion were made). Podiatric training occurs in one of 7 podiatric colleges.

Ninety percent of the students admitted to podiatry schools have at least a bac-

calureate degree. Once admitted to podiatry school the course of training

requires four years. The first two years involve classroom and laboratory study

in the basic sciences such as biology, physiology, pathology, etc. The last two

years are oriented largely towards clinical subjects and supervised patient

care. The clinical subjects include areas such as dermatology, neurology, and

general surgery among others. After successful completion of the four year

program students are awarded the Doctor of Podiatric Medicine degree.   In

recent years it has become increasingly popular to follow receipt of the DPM

degree with additional training in the form of a hospital residency (usually

lasting one year). As the rigor of the podiatric training has increased, so has

the perceived competence and acceptance of podiatrists.

     Today, 37 of the states have laws that specifically allow or mandate full
                                       Organized medicine has been identified with
medical privileges for podiatrists5
activities designed to restrict podiatrists' access to hospitals.6 Anecdotal

evidence on efforts to exclude podiatrists range from actions by associations of

orthopedic surgeons to less formal efforts of such physicians on the staffs of

individual hospitals.7 Thus, interprofessional rivalry may play some part in

making access to hospital privileges vary substantially across the nation.
                                        —5—


However, since the level of training has changed rapidly in the podiatry pro-

fession, there is also likely to be considerable variation in the technical

skills of licensed podiatrists. For these reasons we are interested in empiri-

cally assessing the importance of factors related to both technical proficiency

and market conditions in explaining access to hospital staff privileges among

podiatrists.

 An_Empirical Model of E am ig1_Differentials

     In   this section we describe our empirical model of podiatrists' earnings.

We view analysis of wage differentials among podiatrists as being potentially

clouded by selectivity issues. Observed outcomes in earnings are based on prior

decisions concerning the granting of hospital staff privileges.    That is, earn-

ings of podiatrists are only observed after they have either been granted or

denied some type of hospital privilege. The earnings that occur under other

scenarios (types of privileges) are not observed for an individual podiatrist.

In addition, the granting of privileges is likely to depend on observed factors,

such as educational attainment and certification, as well as unobserved factors

such as specific clinical and interpersonal skills.    For these reasons we adopt

the approach of Heckman and Lee to the analysis of earnings under conditions of

selectivity.8 Following that approach we propose a two stage approach to esti-

mation of earnings differences associated with varying types of staff privi-

leges. In the first stage we estimate a model of the determinants of staff

privileges, while in the second stage we estimate a model of earnings

controlling for selectivity effects.

     We begin our analysis of the determinants of type of privileges with the

assumption that all podiatrists would prefer to have access to full medical

staff privileges at a hospital. Thus, variation in the possession of privileges

depends on decisions made by individual hospitals' medical staffs. As described

above there are three levels of staff privileges: 1) no privileges;
                                    -6-


2) professional or clinical; and 3) medical staff. We posit the existence of

two principal reasons for a hospital not to grant medical staff privileges to a

podiatrist: a) concern about quality of care; and b) interprofessional com-

petition.

     Our model of the economics of interprofessional relations in hospitals draws on

the work of Pauly and Redisch9. We assume that decisions regarding the granting of

privileges and the size of the medical staff are dominated by the medical staff of

each individual hospital (this has become less true since 1984). Factors outside the

direct control of the medical staff, such as hospital beds, the stock of podiatrists and

the stock of physicians in the market are assumed to be taken as fixed by the medical

staff in its decisions to grant privileges to individual providers. The medical

staff of the hospital is assumed to make decisions on the basis of majority rule

thereby reflecting the preferences of the median voter. Following Pauly and Redisch

we view the interests of the medical staff to be the maximization of the average

income of staff members. We posit that the medical staff chooses the income maxi-

mizing levels of each type of provider (eg. pediatricians, cardiologists and foot

specialists). The equilibrium level of the medical staff in this model was shown by

Pauly and Redisch to occur where the marginal revenue product (MRPo) and average

revenue product (ARP0) of medical staff members are equal. This is shown in Figure

1. Given the equilibrium foot specialist staff size of M*, medical staffs are

hypothesized to try to select M* qualified orthopedists and then fill in any

shortfall with podiatrists. Thus, in contrast to the Pauly-Redisch model we assume

that in the short run the size of the medical staff is variable but the bed size of the

hospital -is not. These assumptions allow us to present the following hypotheses:

     1) The greater the supply of orthopedists in a market area the lower the proba-

bility that a podiatrist will obtain staff privileges. This occurs because orthope—

dists, being licensed physicians, are more complementary inputs to the rest of the
                                     —7-




medical staff than are podiatrists whose scope of activities are limited by

training and medical practice acts. This means that orthopedists have higher

marginal products than podiatrists. For these reasons medical staffs will try

to reach M* with physician providers of foot care. The more plentiful the supply,

the more likely they can reach M*.

     2) Markets with greater numbers of beds, ceterus paribus, will be more

likely to grant privileges to podiatrists. This hypothesis derives from tracing

the change in the equilibrium medical staff, in our shortrun model, resulting

from an increase in the number of hospital beds. While the Pauly-Redisch

formulation does not lead to unambiguous comparative statics results, our

hypothesis can be obtained by imposing several plausible restrictions on the

production and demand constraints in the model. They are that the second partial

derivative of quantity demanded with respect to price be non—negative, and that

the production function for hospital services display positive cross partial

derivatives of output with respect to medical staff and beds (this result

appears in the appendix). The result of these restrictions can be seen on

Figure 1. An increase in the number of beds would shift both the MRP and ARP

curves to the right. This results in a larger equilibrium size of the medical

staff (M**), which increases a podiatrist's chances of being offered staff

privileges.

     Given this theoretical frame work we specify our empirical model of

podiatrist privileges (L) in the following manner:


     (1) L = L(D, HC, Market, Regulation)
                                      -8-




Demographic characteristics of podiatrists (D) are included as control

variables. These are age, sex, and race.1' Because the nature of podiatric

training has changed dramatically over time as have the prerequisites for

admission to podiatry school, age is included in the model. The rela-

tionship is specified as quadratic because we expect that younger podiatrists

are not yet established in the community while old podiatrists are less

well trained.

     In order to measure the level of technical preparation of a podiatrist

(HC) we measure two types of credentials. First, is whether the podiatrist

has completed a formal residency program, usually comprised of post-

graduate hospital based surgical training. The second credential measured

is whether a podiatrist has qualified for board certification. Both of

these variables indicate advanced training in surgical techniques, often

key issues in a hospital's appraisal of the quality of an applicant for

privileges. (It should be noted that residency training is not a necessary

prerequisite for obtaining board certification.)
                                      —9-




     The theoretical model described above characterizes the medical staff as

viewing the stock of podiatrists and physicians and the number of beds as fixed.

Our specification of market conditions therefore consists of four variables. They

are the orthopedist to population ratio, the podiatrist to population ratio, the bed

to population ratio and the ratio of other physicians to the population in the

market. The stock of other physicians is included because a number of them provide

some footcare.

     Finally, we include several indicators of the overall environment for the

practice of podiatry. The presence of a podiatry school or residency training

program is included as an indicator of the costs to medical staffs of obtaining

information about podiatrists. The presence of a school or training program is

hypothesized to lower such costs because staff physicians interact with faculty and

students in the training program. This variable also serves as a proxy for the

existance of a podiatry service in hospitals (a condition for podiatrists to receive

privileges in JCAH standards). A variable which indicates whether podiatrists are

restricted by state law to performing procedures on the foot only is also entered

into the model (Regulation). A number of states define the scope of podiatric practice

to include the foot and ankle or all areas below the knee. More restrictive regula-

tions on the scope of practice are likely to be associated with a reluctance to grant

full medical privileges to podiatrists.'2
                                            This variable captures the regulatory cli-

mate in a state. We also include regional durrny variables to control for a variety

of unmeasured factors that have been shown to vary across geographic areas.
                                      -10-


    The second stage of our analysis involves estimation of an earnings model.

At the core of our model is the human capital formulation of earnings.'3   That

is, the earnings of a podiatrist are hypothesized to depend on investments in

education, on-the-job training and the development of other attributes which

enhance productivity. Besides attributes that result from individual choices,

a variety of structural features in the market for foot care that may affect the

earnings of podiatrists are also taken into account. For example, because the

quality of a provider is difficult to judge and because information is costly

there may be returns to obtaining a "quality related" certification. Thus, in

addition to describing education, residency training and years of experience we

include a variable which indicates whether a podiatrist has been board certi-

fied. We also describe market conditions in the market for footcare. The

intensity of both inter and intraprofessional competition is measured by the

podiatrist to population ratio and the orthopedist to population ratio.

Since the scope of practice may be limited by state law, we include the

variable indicating if podiatrists are limited to performing procedures on the

foot only. We also control for several demand characteristics of the market

place. These include: the population over the age of 65 years, and the per

capita income of the population in the market area. The presence of foot

problems is particularly prevalent among the elderly.'4   It is therefore impor-

tant to control for this population attribute.

    Finally, podiatrists' earnings are hypothesized to depend on access to

hospital facilities. Our view of this mechanism is rather straight forward. A

key element in the economics of podiatric practice is the development and main-

tenance of a professional relationship with a patient. The podiatrist who can-

not offer a full line of service because he or she does not have access to a
                                       —11—


hospital loses income due to restrictions on his or her ability to offer inpatient

care. A podiatrist with access to the hospital but not full medical privileges

must in part surrender professional control of patients who need to be hospita-

lized for their foot care. The loss of patients may extend beyond the hospital

if providers offering inpatient services are viewed as more attractive to

patients in need of outpatient services. We would therefore expect that,

other factors equal, podiatrists with full medical privileges will have the highest

earnings, followed by those with some staff privileges and lastly those with no

privil eges 15

Thtta_Tec h n i q ue

     The econometric problem is to compare the earnings of individual podiatrists

with a particular set of attributes when they have various levels of hospital

privileges. The main difficulty in making this comparison is that individual

podiatrists with differing levels of hospital privileges may differ along lines

we do not observe. For example, there are a variety of attributes concerning a

podiatrist's reputation, interpersonal skills, and technical skill level that we

cannot measure. In addition, we observe the conduct of competition in the market

in rather crude ways. Thus, it is likely that a standard earnings equation such

as that of Griliches'3 would leave certain characteristics of individuals and the

markets within which they operate uncontrolled. This raises the possibility of

omitted variables bias. It is to address this problem that the techniques of

Heckman'6 and Lee17 were developed. Our description of the estimation approach

draws on the expositions of Lee18, Dornenrich and McFadden'9 and Maddala.2°

     We can describe the analysis of podiatrist earnings (W) within the context

of an ordered polychotomous choice situation where there are three categories for
                                             —12—

                                                                and no privileges)

                                                                 =   0;
podiatrist as described in (1) above. E(uc Xc ,            Z)             Wc is observed only

if the c th category is selected. I is a polychotomous response variable which

in our study may take the value of 0, 1 and 2.21 In our case since we consider

a hiearchical choice, it may be particularly reasonable to assume that a single

distribution underlies the choice response IC. This enables us to use an ordered

polychotomouS logit model to obtain estimates for the distribution function

underlying Il9. Using these first stage estimates we apply the two stage

approach of Heckman and Lee. The first stage estimates are used to calculate the

inverse of the Mills ratio (x).22

     In    the second stage we add         to the three earnings equations implied by

equation (2) as regressors.23 The second stage can be expressed as follows:

                  (4a) WNPI =     X1   BNP + bNp ANPi + VNpj

                  (4b)
                              =
                                  Xj Bp +   bp   XSPi +

                  (4c)   WMpj = X1 8MP + bMP     XMPi + VMPI

where MP, SP and NP are medical privileges, staff privileges and no privileges

respectively. Use of ordinary least squares results in consistent estimates of

the B's. The variance estimates are biased in an unknown direction as pointed

out by Greene24 and Maddala25. Two sets of problems have been associated with
                                                        collinearity between the X's and
the use of two stage estimators. They are 1)

   if the variables in Z are the same as in X; and 2) non-robust estimates of

 B's.24 The first problem is avoided since our two models contain different

 variables. The dummy for presence of podiatry schools or residency programs
                                                    it was viewed as to related to the

                                        —13—

costs of assessing quality of podiatrists rather than determinants of earnings

 (see note 12). The Beds variable was excluded on empirical grounds. We experimented

with beds in the earnings equations arid found the coefficients to be close to zero

and not significant (see note 15). To examine the second problem we made a number of

specification changes in the privilege selection equation and examined the resulting

estimates. Few visible differences were noted and no statistically significant dif-

ferences were found.

       The key comparison for the purposes of this paper is to compare WNP, W5p,

and WMP holding constant both observed and unobserved characteristics of the

podiatrist and the market within which he or she operates. We use the tradi-

tional single log specification of the earnings model given by equations (4a)

through (4c). This means that predictions of Wc must be transformed into

natural units. Assuming normality of the error term, the predicted earnings

for individual i with privilege class c is

       (5) Wci =   exptX'   +
                                (S2)3
where Sc is the standard error of the estimate andA indicates an estimator.

The arithmetic mean is therefore a function of the geometric mean texp(XiBc)]

and its variance. The coefficient estimators are consistent. This is riot

necessarily the case for estimates of the arithmetic mean. The estimator will

be inconsistent if the Vcj distribution is not normal. Assuming departures from

normality, however, would be inconsistent with the assumptions underlying the

Heckman—Lee approach. We therefore rely on the transformation given in equation

(5) 26

Data

       The data used for analysis of the earnings of podiatrists were drawn from a

survey conducted between November of 1983 and September of 1984. The survey was
                                      -14-


conducted by researchers at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute (VPI) under

contract to the American Podiatric Medical Association (APMA).   A questionnaire

aimed at collecting a variety of information on the practices of podiatrists,

their attitudes towards work and their backgrounds was distributed to 9,746

podiatrists with mailing addresses. Four thousand eight hundred seventy three

questionnaires were returned for a response rate of 50.3 percent. The response rate

varied somewhat by region of the country.

     In order to trace consequences of the variation in response rate by state we

probed the existing data for evidence of systematic bias. We weighted the VP! data

to reflect the national distribution of podiatrists and compared the demographic

characteristics of the weighted to the unweighted sample. The only difference

observed was in the portion of podiatrists in the 35 to 44 and 45 to 65 year old age

groups. These differences were small and not statistically significant. The lack of

other information precluded further analysis of non-response influences.

     For the purposes of analyzing the economics of podiatric practice we

augmented the VPI data with data from two other principal sources: the area

resouce file (ARF) and a compilation of state regulations that govern the prac-

tice of podiatry. The ARF contains information on the availability of various

health care resources at the county and metropolitan statistical area (MSA)

level. Included among these health care resources are the number of physicians

by specialty, the number of hospital beds, various demographic characteristics

of the population in a geographical region. The data on regulations were com-

piled by the APMA. The regulations included specific statutes that restrict the

scope of podiatric practice and limit the types of technologies that can be used

by podiatrists.27 Table 1 reports definitions, means, standard deviations and

sources for key variables included in the analysis.
                                       -15—


      It should be noted that the analysis file was constructed so that market areas

 were associated with individual podiatrists. The market areas were defined as MSAs.

 This resulted in the exclusion of 801 podiatrists practicing outside of MSAs. The

 analysis data set was thereby reduced to 4,072 podiatrists. The VPI survey asked

podiatrists their net income from podiatric practice. This response was

coded in $20,000 categories. The earnings variable was constructed by taking

the mean of each category and dividing that number by the number of weekly hours

spent in podiatric practice times forty—eight (the average number of weeks worked per

year).28 Clearly there is measurement error in this variable, however since it is

used only as a left hand side variable the consequence is to add "noise0 to the data.

     The remainder of the variables described in Table 1 are measured in a rather

straight forward fashion as described in the table. (Copies of the questionnaire are

available from the authors).

Results

     Table 2 presents the first stage polychotoinous logit estimates for the type

of hospital privileges held by a podiatrist. These results are interesting in

their own right. Our measures of training are the most important variables for

explaining type of hospital privilege held by a podiatrist. Both the Residency

and Board certification variables have estimated coefficients which are positive

and significantly different from zero at conventional levels.
                                                                The possession

of board certification appears to dominate residency training. This indicates

the importance of obtaining a "brand name" in order to signal quality to con-

sumers with poor information.

     The indicators of market conditions were, by and large, estimated to have

impacts consistent with our hypotheses.29 The orthopedist to population ratio was

estimated to have a negative and significant effect on the likelihood of a podiatrist
                                      -16-

obtaining privileges. This is consistent with our view of the decision

making model of medical staffs. The beds variable was positive and significant

which is also in keeping with the Pauly-Redisch model presented above. The coef-

ficient estimate for the DPM variable is positive and significant. This finding is

difficult to interpret.30 In order to test the sensitivity of the model to this

variable   we omitted it and reestimated the model. The coefficient estimates

were not significantly altered by the change (results are available from the

authors).31 The results for the podiatry school and training program coefficient

suggest that podiatrists in areas with training programs have a higher probabi-

lity of obtaining privileges than do those in other areas. This result is con-

sistent with the notion that the costs of assessing quality are lower where

training programs exist.

     Finally, our variable which indicates regulatory restrictions on scope of

podiatric practice (limiting providers to procedures on the foot only) had

essentially no impact on the likelihood of a podiatrist holding hospital

privileges. This suggests that hospitals in states with policies that restrict

the practice of podiatry do not exert significant influence on individual hospital

decisions to grant privileges.

     Table 3 presents results of the two stage earnings model estimates by type

of hospital privileges. The coefficient estimates generally display similar

patterns across equations. The R2 statistics range from 0.13 to 0.22.

     Several specific results are worth noting prior to assessing the earnings

differentials associated with hospital privileges. The impact of board cer-

tification is large and significant. For podiatrists with no hospital privi-

leges obtaining board certification increases earnings approximately 28 percent.32

Similar results occur for those podiatrists with partial privileges, while the effect
                                   -17—


 is considerably smaller for podiatrists with full medical privileges (17 per cent).

 Completion of a residency seems to have little effect on earnings for podiatrists

with less than full medical privileges. The negative and significant estimate for

the Residency variable in the full privileges equation is anomalous. One possible

explanation for this finding is that a number of board certified podiatrists were

"grand fathered" into board certification and earn more without having been residency

trained. We probed this possibility by creating interaction terms with age,

residency status and board certification. The results did not change

significantly with the inclusion of interaction terms. The regulation of scope

of practice variable, which is equal to one when podiatric practice is limited

to the foot only, had a negative and significant impact on earnings for cases on

no privileges or full privileges. The coefficients suggest a 9 to 14 percent

decrease in earnings attributable to these statutes. The scope of practice

regulation coefficient for the partial privileges equation was negative but not

significant at conventional levels.

     In assessing the 't' tests reported on Tables 2 and 3 it is important

to recognize that if there are "permanent market effects" in the observed

geographic areas the regression disturbance terms for individual podiatrists

from the same geographic areas will be correlated. This autocorrelation results

in downwardly biased estimates of standard errors. The variables describing the

market areas (e.g. orthopedists per capita) are especially likely to be affected

by autocorrelation. In order to take this possibility into account we estimated

aggregate privilege and wage equation models for the 287 geographic areas in

the sample.

     The results for the privileges model indicates that two coefficients had

considerable bias in their estimated t statistics. They were the orthopedist to
                                       -18-


population ratio and the presence of a podiatry school or training program.

Their t statistics fell from 4.85 to 2.02 and 5.15 to 2.48 respectively. In

both cases while there was considerable bias we could still reject the null

hypothesis at the 0.05 level.

     For the wage equations there were no significant changes in the estimate t

statistics. For example in the estimates of full privileges the t for the orthope-

dist to population ratio is 2.07 on Table 3 and was 2.27 for the aggregate wage

equation. Similarly the standard errors for per capita income and the podiatrist to

population ratio were unaffected.

     Table 4 reports comparisons between simple mean hourly earnings, predicted

hourly earnings based on OLS estimates and predictions using the Heckman-Lee

estimates. Predicted earnings were calculated for the entire sample (all 4,072

podiatrists). Thus the two sets of predicted earnings are expected to differ from

the simple means for the three privilege types because we use the full sample to pre-

dict earnings for each type of privilege status. The characteristics of podiatrists

in the full sample differ significantly from those of podiatrists in the subsets that

have been selected into each privilege class. The results suggest that when selec-

tion effects are taken into account the earnings differentials attributable to

hospital privileges increase for full privileges and are the same for professional

privileges.

              The rents from obtaining full medical hospital staff privileges

amount to approximately $10.34 per hour over not having any access to the hospital

using the Heckman-Lee model. The predictions based on the OLS model indicate

a $5.16 per hour difference in earnings due to the possession of full medical

privileges over no privileges. The impact of unobserved factors correlated with
                                      -19-.




selection is therefore considerable. For the Heckman-Lee model the difference

between full and no privileges earnings was significant at the 0.05 level (using

a two tailed test). The difference for the OLS predictions was not significant.

The difference between medical and professional privileges was not significantly

different from zero at conventional levels in either model. The results suggest

that controlling for both observed and unobserved market and provider attributes

there is a substantial economic rent to be collected from the possession of full

medical staff privileges. If only observed attributes are taken into account the

rents associated with privileges are quite small. Moreover, as the first stage

estimates indicate, factors related to the training and skill of a podiatrist as

well as the market forces are important in assignment of hospital privileges.
                                      -20-

Conclusions

     This study was undertaken to address several issues. First, was a

determination of the extent to which after controlling for both characteristics

of the individual podiatrist and the market within which he or she operates rents are

collected from acquiring hospital privileges. A second objective was to assess the

relative contribution of market conditions versus the training and cre-

dentials of a podiatrist to variation in podiatrist earnings.

     Our results indicate that there are significant differences in the earnings

of podiatrists according to the hospital privileges they hold. These differences

occur only when one controls for observed and unobserved characteristics of the

podiatrist and his or her market environment. When we controlled for only

observed factors, estimated earnings differences between those podiatrists having no

privileges and those with full privileges were small ($5.16 per hour). There are

however, substantial rents ($10.34 per hour) associated with hospital privileges

when one uses the selection bias model to measure them.

     This result appears to be counter intuitive. That is, one might expect earnings

differentials to close when "unmeasured quality" is controlled. We interpret the

result as suggesting that the unmeasured quality attributes are most useful in hospi-

tal based practice. Examples of such attributes might include skill in specialized

surgical procedures and use of specialized technologies (e.g.; lasers) for performing

foot surgery. Thus, podiatrists with these specialized skills and interests need

full privileges to realize their earnings potential.

     Market conditions play a substantial role in indirectly determining

earnings by their role in explaining which podiatrists are most likely to obtain

hospital privileges. They also directly influence the demand for podiatrist

services and thereby put downward pressure on earnings. Indicators of training
                                           —21-.




and technical proficiency also exert important influence on earnings differen-

tials for podiatrists. In both the privileges and earnings equations the indi-

vidual human capital attributes of podiatrists had substantial explanatory power.

The importance of competitive factor appears to decrease as access to the hospital

becomes more complete.

     Finally, our results lend support to the Pauly-Redisch characterization of

hospital staffing decisions. Further probing of staffing behavior using other models

would constitute a worthwhile next step.

  12. 37 States have passed laws in support of privileges for podiatrists. Very
       few podiatrists practice in state without such laws because they are smaller
       rural states (Mississippi , North Dakota). Thus as well as having a direct
       measure of regulatory restrictiveness (limitations to the foot only) we
       view the poridatry school variable as an exogenous in this shortrun model.
       Moreover it serves as an identifying variable with use of the two stop
      estimator.

       it had a t statistic of 0.25. Thus we excluded it from that model.

 15. Beds could be considered for inclusion in the earning model. The rationale
      for this seems weak because for those DPMs with no privileges beds are
      dearly irrelevant. For those with full privileges they may matter. In
      order to test this proposition we entered the beds variable into the
      earning equations. The t statistics ranged from 0.21 to 0.50. We there-
      fore exclude this questionable variable from the final specifications.

       rather than relying solely on 7 categories of income. The categories used
       were as follows: <$30,000; $30-50,000; $50,-70,000; $70-90,000;
       $90-110,000; $110,000-130,000; $130,000+. The open ended category mean
       was estimated in three ways that yielded similar results. First was to obtain
       the maximum podiatrist income from APMA and use the midpoint of the con-
       strained category. The second was to use a Pareto distribution to obtain
       an estimate of the category. The third used a log normal distribution to
       obtain an estimate of the open ended category's mean.
