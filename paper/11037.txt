This paper provides an empirical analysis of the risk of trading revenues of U.S. commercial banks.

We collect quarterly data on trading revenues, broken down by business line, as well as the Value

at Risk-based market risk charge. The overall picture from these preliminary results is that there is

a fair amount of diversification across banks and within banks across business lines. These low

correlations do not corroborate systemic risk concerns. Neither is there evidence that the post-1998

period has witnessed an increase in volatility of trading revenues.

                                            I. INTRODUCTION



        The last decade has witnessed a revolution in financial risk management. Quantitative

techniques such as option pricing, portfolio insurance, and Value at Risk (VAR) have become

essential tools of portfolio management. The generalized use of these techniques, however, has

raised concerns that they could induce similar trading patterns, or “herding,” across banks using

VAR systems to limit their risks. As the argument goes, some exogenous shock to volatility

could push VAR above the limit, forcing banks to liquidate their positions, further depressing

falling prices.

        If so, the generalized use of risk management systems could cause higher volatility in

times of stress, perversely making financial markets less safe than before. This could raise the

prospect of systemic risk, which arises when a shock threatens to create multiple simultaneous

failures in financial institutions.

        Various theories have been advanced to explain herding behavior. A necessary

precondition for herding is that investors within a group tend to buy (or sell) when similar

participants buy (or sell). This could reflect the belief that other investors have superior

information, as in informational cascade theories.1 Alternatively, another class of contagion

theories emphasizes the effect of liquidity shocks, which force some market participants to

liquidate their holdings to obtain cash, perhaps due to a call for additional collateral.2 This

applies to participants with high leverage, such as bank proprietary trading desks or hedge funds.

The herding effect due to VAR is closest to this latter explanation. We can classify these herding

theories into “information-based” and “constraint-based” theories.

        In practice, the VAR-induced herding effect depends on commonalities in the positions in

financial institutions. As Morris and Shin (1999) have stated, “One theme which has emerged in

the subsequent debate on the performance of the risk management systems has been the criticism

that many financial entities entered the period of turbulence with very similar trading positions.”

        Thus, VAR herding requires similar positions across VAR-constrained institutions. This

study tests this hypothesis by investigating the ex-ante and ex-post trading risk profile of U.S.

commercial banks based on quarterly banking reports over the period 1995 to 2003. These

reports contain information on quarterly trading revenues broken down by risk factor category as

well as the overall VAR-based market risk charge. Using segment information, broken down

into fixed-income, currencies, equities, commodities categories, should prove useful to detect

commonalities in positions. To my knowledge, this is the first paper to do so.

        Similar positions should be revealed by high correlations between banks’ trading

revenues, as well as between banks’ VAR measures. We also examine correlation patterns

across risk categories to assess diversification effects. Finally, we examine the variance of

aggregate trading returns from banks in the sample and break it down into different components

to examine diversification effects across the industry. As a by-product of the analysis, this paper

also evaluates the profitability of bank trading revenues, thus contributing to the literature on

diversification in banking.3

        This paper is structured as follows. Section II provides a review of VAR and herding

theories. Section III presents the empirical analysis and Section IV concludes.

 Stiroh (2004) provides a review of this literature. He shows that non-interest income has increased in importance
for U.S. banks and is much more volatile than traditional interest income, based on accounting data.

                               II. VAR AND SYSTEMIC RISK

       In recent year, VAR has become a universally-accepted benchmark for measuring market

risk. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS), for example, provides annual

descriptions of market risk disclosures by banks and securities houses. In 1993, only 5 percent

of the sample reported VAR information. By 2001, this proportion had gone up to 98 percent.

In addition to its role as a ubiquitous passive risk measure, VAR has become a tool for the active

management of risk, including setting risk limits and capital charges. Much of this development

was spurred by regulatory standards for capital requirements.



The VAR Capital Charge

       The use of internal VAR models was officially sanctioned by the Basel Committee on

Banking Supervision (BCBS), which amended the 1988 Basel Accord to include a charge for

market risk (BCBS 1995, 1996a). Since January 1998, banks have had a choice between using a

“standardized” method, using predefined rules, or their own internal VAR measure as the basis

for their capital charge for market risk. Because in practice, the internal model approach leads to

lower capital charges than the standardized model, this has led to the generalized use of VAR

methods.

       To use the internal model approach, a bank must satisfy various qualitative requirements

first. The bank must demonstrate that it has a sound risk management system, which must be

integrated into management decisions. Notably, the bank has to use the regulatory VAR forecast

directly for management decisions. This point is important, as it forces commercial banks to use

the same parameters as dictated by the Basel rules.




                                                 5
                                                                     P. Jorion-Bank Trading Risk and Systemic Risk


        When the qualitative requirements are satisfied, the market risk charge is based on the

following quantitative parameters for VAR: (i) a horizon of 10 trading days, or two calendar

weeks, (ii) a 99 percent confidence interval, (iii) an observation period based on at least a year of

historical data and updated at least once a quarter.4 In practice, banks are allowed to compute

their 10-day VAR by scaling up their 1-day VAR by the square root of 10.

        The Market Risk Charge (MRC) is then computed as the sum of a general market risk

charge and a specific risk charge. The later represents the risk of individual issues that is not

reflected in the general market risk measure. The general market risk charge is taken as the

higher of the previous day's VAR, or the average VAR over the last 60 business days, times a

“multiplicative” factor k:

                                      1
                                        ∑
                                          60
                  MRCt = Max(k                VAR t −i , VAR t −1 ) + SRCt                                       (1)
                                      60 t =1

where k is to be determined by local regulators, subject to an absolute floor of three.5 In practice,

the first term in the parentheses is binding because it is multiplied by a factor of at least three.

Banks are also subject to a backtest that compares the daily VAR to the subsequent P&L. Banks

that fail the backtest can be subject to an increase in k from three to four.6

        In this application, VAR is used to determine a minimum amount of equity capital that

the bank must carry as protection against market risk. It can be viewed as a measure of

“economic capital” to support the trading activities.




4
  More precisely, the average “duration” of historical observations must be at least six months.
5
  The specific risk charge is explained in more detail in the Basel Amendment (1996).
6
  The backtesting procedure consists of matching daily VAR with the subsequent P&L. If a loss exceeds the VAR,
an exception is said to have occurred. Banks can have up to four exceptions over the previous year. Beyond four
exceptions, k is increased progressively, subject to the regulator’s evaluation of the cause for the exception, and
reaches four for 10 or more exceptions.

The VAR Vicious Circle Hypothesis

        Some recent literature has emphasized the limitations of VAR. VAR is a single summary

measure of downside loss. Because VAR only represents one quantile of the P&L distribution,

it gives no indication about the tail loss, beyond the quantile. In theory, traders could willfully

attempt to “game” their VAR limit by altering the distribution of P&L to satisfy a fixed VAR at

the expense of a small probability of large losses.7

        Other authors argue that wide-spread use of VAR could actually increase systemic risk.

The novel aspect of the Basel market risk charge is that, for the first time, it creates capital

requirements that are risk-sensitive. The internal model approach was put into operation in

January 1998. It so happened that 1998 was a tumultuous year.

        The Russian default triggered turbulences in financial markets that eventually led to the

collapse of the hedge fund LTCM. In the search for culprits, fingers have been pointed to the

generalized use of risk measures, such as VAR. Some observers claimed that the application of

strict VAR limits led to position-cutting by traders, which put additional downward pressures on

prices. These claims have been advanced by Dunbar (2000) in his book on LTCM, by Persaud

(2000), and have also been echoed in the press. Likewise, Scholes (2000) states that “banks and

financial entities… add to the volatility in financial crises.”

        The argument is that some shock in volatility, say due to the Russian default, increases

the VAR of outstanding positions. In 1999, the Economist has argued that, as VAR goes up, a

“bank is then faced with two choices: put in extra capital or reduce its positions, whatever and


7
  See for instance Ju and Pearson (1999) for an analysis at the trader’s level. Basak and Shapiro (2001) examine the
effect of this gaming at the level of the institution on financial markets. They show that strict VAR limits could
induce banks to take on more risk in bad states of the world, i.e. after VAR limits have been breached, which could
cause higher volatility in financial markets. On the other hand, Cuoco and Liu (2002) argue that the VAR limit
should be implemented on a dynamic basis. They find that capital requirements advocated by the Basel Committee
can be very effective in curbing the risk of trading portfolio and inducing truthful revelation of this risk.

wherever they may be. This is what happened last autumn.” As the argument goes, several

banks could sell the same asset at the same time, creating higher volatility and correlations,

which exacerbates the initial effect, forcing additional sales. This VAR “vicious circle”

hypothesis is described in Figure 1. The troubling conclusion is that VAR tools increase

volatility and are inherently dangerous.8

         This line of argument should be a serious source of concern given the generalized trend

toward risk-sensitive capital adequacy requirements. The current revision of the Basel credit risk

charges, dubbed “Basel II”, also go in the direction of more sensitive risk charges. The worry is

that the design of such capital adequacy requirements might destabilize the financial system, by

inducing banks to tighten credit as credit risk increases, precisely at the wrong time in a

  Even so, many other reasons can also contribute to a practice of selling in a falling market. Typical examples are
positive feedback technical trading rules or stop-loss rules. Margin calls can also lead to liquidation sales after
prices have fallen. Schinasi and Smith (2000) also argue that the practice of rebalancing to fixed weights with
leverage creates similar trading patterns.

recession. This prospect of “procyclicality” is an important issue facing bank regulation today.

While it is beyond the scope of this paper to discuss procyclicality of credit risk rules, the

question is whether this “vicious circle” argument does apply to the market risk charges.

        This argument requires most VAR-constrained traders to start from similar positions.

Otherwise, they could simply cross their trades with little effect on prices. Ultimately, positions

cannot be directly compared as these data are proprietary and jealously guarded. Instead, we can

examine correlations in trading revenues.



Correlations in Positions and Returns

        This section reviews empirical approaches to theories of herding. Realized returns

reflect positions and innovations in risk factors. Consider a daily horizon indexed by t. Call x(i,t-

1) the dollar position on asset i at the end of day t-1. This is the number of units n(i,t-1) times

the unit value S(i,t-1). The position is assumed unchanged until the next day. Define R(i,t-

1)=[S(i,t)-S(i,t-1)]/S(i,t-1) as the rate of return on the asset, which is unitless. The dollar return

on the position is then

                                x(i,t-1) R(i,t) = n(i,t-1) S(i,t-1) R(i,t)

Contemporaneous correlations across portfolios can arise for a number of reasons. With fixed

positions, correlations in dollar returns can arise because of correlations in the risk factors, (R).

Or, correlations could occur because positions change together (n). This could reflect herding.

        It is axiomatic that every trade has a buyer and seller. Herding therefore must refer to a

subset of participants, e.g. financial institutions. It is often thought that institutions are more

likely to herd because their information set may be more homogeneous. “Information-based”

herding implies that movements in the positions depend on actions of other investors k




                                                     9

                                   ∆n(i,t) = f[∆nk(i,t) …]                                            (2)

which should be reflected in positive correlations. Herding implies buying or selling an asset

when others are doing the same. One class of herding models emphasizes information

asymmetries as the source of herding. Investors may imitate the transactions of others whom

they think have a special information advantage.

       Tests of herding usually focus on portfolio positions for a subgroup of investors.

Unfortunately, these tests are contaminated by other effects. Portfolio positions could change

together because of common new information I:

                                           ∆n(i,t) = f[ I(i,t-1) …]                                  (3a)

For instance, a positive shock to interest rates may make stocks less attractive, leading to

simultaneous sales by many investors. Alternatively, correlations in portfolio adjustments could

be due to similar trading patterns. Technical trading rules, for instance, are defined as

movements in the positions that depend on previous movements in the risk factor

                                          ∆n(i,t) = f[ R(i,t-1) …]                                   (3b)

As an example, momentum investors will tend to buy an asset that just went up in value. This

creates positive correlations across momentum investors that has nothing to do with herding.

Alternatively, arbitrage trading can take place if the current basis, or difference between the cash

and forward prices S and F, is out of line with the cash-and-carry relationship. Arbitrageurs will

buy at the same time the cheap asset, creating positive correlations across their positions that

have nothing to do with herding:



                                          ∆n(i,t) = f[ S(i,t-1), F(i,t-1) …]                         (3c)

       Empirical tests are bedeviled by this contamination effect. Among others, Kodres and

Pritsker (1996) examine the behavior of institutional investors with large positions on major U.S.

futures contracts. They compute correlations between changes in daily positions within each

group (broker-dealers, pension funds, commercial banks, foreign banks, and hedge funds). For a

fixed contract i and two investors k and l within the same group, this is measured as

                                           ρ[∆nk(i,t), ∆nl(i,t)]                                     (4)

       They report that average correlations within each group are close to zero, with a range of

–0.30 to +0.34. This provides no evidence of herding. Even with positive correlations, however,

these results would have been difficult to interpret because common movements could be due to

similar trading strategies, e.g. momentum strategies or stock-index arbitrage for broker-dealers,

as explained previously.

       Alternatively, “constraint-based” herding theories can be tested by examining

correlations among trading returns directly (or xR). The VAR vicious circle hypothesis

postulates that banks start from similar positions, because they are forced to sell similar positions

after the VAR limits are hit. If so, correlations among ex-post trading revenues and ex-ante risk

measures based on VAR forecasts should be high. But first, the issue is whether large-scale

VAR models successfully predict the risk of trading portfolios.

Empirical Evidence on VAR and Trading Revenues

         Berkowitz and O'Brien (2002) provide the first empirical study of the accuracy of banks’

internal VAR models. Their paper uses daily VAR and trading revenue data for six U.S.

commercial banks over the period January 1998 to March 2000, or approximately 500 trading

days. The data are confidential because they are provided in the course of the bank’s regulatory

examinations. To preserve the confidential nature of the data, the numbers are scaled, which

makes it impossible to conduct cross-sectional tests.

         Instead, the authors perform time-series tests of unconditional and conditional coverage.

Their main result is that, relative to their actual P&L, banks report VAR measures that are

conservative, or too large. For four out of six banks, the average VAR is 1.6 to 3 times the actual

99th percentile of the P&L distribution. Put differently, the number of exceptions is too low.

Only one bank had more than three exceptions over this period, when the expected number was

five. Furthermore, most of these exceptions occurred during a short period, August to October

1998. These results are surprising because they imply that the banks’ VAR, and hence their

market risk charge is too high. Banks therefore allocate too much regulatory capital to their

trading activities.

         Berkowitz and O’Brien give two explanations for this observation. First, P&L include

not only changes in mark-to-market positions, but also income from market-making activities,

such as fees and spread, as well as net interest income. This increases the P&L, reducing the

number of violations.9 In theory, VAR should be measured against hypothetical income, taken

as the change in the market value of a frozen portfolio, ignoring other effects. This is in fact the

procedure in place in Germany. Jaschke, Stahl, and Stehle (2003) also compare the VARs for 13


9
 On the other hand, intra-day trading will typically increase the portfolio risk relative to close-to-close positions
because trading positions are typically cut down toward the close of the day.

German banks to the 99th percentile. They find that VAR measures are, on average, less

conservative than with U.S. data.10

        Second, they report that some VAR models are obtained by aggregating different sectors

without taking correlations into account. By neglecting diversification effects, this practice

overestimates VAR. These drawbacks, however, are straightforward to correct by the internal

risk measurement system. By doing so, the banks would be releasing additional risk capital, or

alternatively could be taking on more trading risk with the same amount of capital.11 We would

also expect VAR models to improve over time.

        Yet another explanation is that capital requirements are currently not binding. The

amount of economic capital U.S. banks currently hold is in excess of their regulatory capital. As

a result, banks prefer to report high VAR numbers to avoid the possibility of regulatory

intrusion. This is possible because the market risk capital represents a small fraction, about 2

percent only, of total regulatory capital.12 Still, these practices impoverish the informational

content of VAR numbers.

        Berkowitz and O’Brien also find that a simple GARCH model appears to capture risk

much better than the banks’ structural models. This is not astonishing, however, because the 1-




10
   Berkowitz and O’Brien (2002) find that 83% of their banks reported higher values of VARs, which exceeded the
99th percentile by an average of 70%. In contrast, Jaschke et al. (2003) find that 67% of their banks had higher
values of VARs, which were on average actually less than the 99th percentile by 4%. So, VAR measures are less
biased when using hypothetical P&L measures.
11
   Ewerhart (2002) advances another explanation attributed to adverse selection. Assuming all banks are well
capitalized, banks can be separated into prudent and less prudent ones. Because the regulator cannot differentiate
among banks, more prudent ones have an incentive to report conservative capital requirements.
12
   Hirtle (2003) reports a median ratio of MRC to total capital requirement of approximately 1.9 percent for large
U.S. banks.

year observation period requirement imposed by the Basel rules disallows fast-moving GARCH

models and leads to slowly-changing capital requirements.13

        This analysis, however, is limited in time and ignores cross-sectional information. Using

daily data also has drawbacks. GARCH processes decay relatively fast. Christoffersen and

Diebold (2000) show that there is scant evidence of volatility predictability at horizons longer

than ten days. Thus, there is little point in forecasting time-variation in volatility over longer

horizons. In addition, daily marking-to-market introduces pricing errors for illiquid positions

and positions across time zones that tend to disappear over longer horizons. Finally, daily data

are provided for total trading revenues and are not disaggregated at the level of business lines.

        Instead, Jorion (2002a) analyzes the informativeness of quarterly VAR numbers

disclosed in financial reports. These are the only numbers available to the public. VAR

measures appear to be useful forecasts of trading risks, especially in cross-sections. Time-series

results for individual banks are less strong. VAR forecasts are significant only for four out of the

eight banks in the sample.

        Yet another approach is to focus on directly on the market risk charge, as described in

Equation (1). Hirtle (2003) finds that market risk charges provide useful information about

future trading risks. The MRC, however, differs from end-of-period VAR because of the

averaging process, changes in the multiplier, and in the specific risk charge.

        The current paper also focuses on movements in market risk charges. Commonalities in

positions should be reflected in high correlations in changes in MRCs across banks. The paper

will also examine correlations across trading revenues. Apparently, the only other paper that

deals with this issue is that by Berkowitz and O’Brien, who report an average correlation of 0.17

13
  See Jorion (2002b) for a description of the movements in the market risk charge. The standard RiskMetrics
model, for instance, based on exponentially weighted moving average volatility forecast, is not Basel-compliant
because it has too much weight on recent data.

only over the period January 1998 to March 2000. They also indicate that these correlations

double over a 5-day horizon. This is why it is useful to examine a quarterly horizon, a longer

sample period, and different types of trading activities.




                                      III. EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE

Data Sample

         This study uses trading income and risk data reported by large U.S. bank holding

companies (BHC) to the Federal Reserve. All BHCs file quarterly balance sheet and income

statement reports on forms Y-9C. Trading income is reported on Schedule HI, consolidated

income statement, and the market risk charge (MRC) is reported on Schedule HC-R, regulatory

capital. These are large, internationally-active banks that are most likely to raise systemic risk

concerns.

         An advantage of this dataset is that the MRC data are measured consistently across

institutions, using the same parameters, and are reported as quarter-end figures. Banks also

report VAR data in their quarterly and annual reports filed with the SEC. These financial reports

often have more detail by risk categories, but are less consistent across banks and across time.

Banks differ in their choice of the confidence level and in the reporting of quarter-average or

quarter-end figures. In addition, the BHC database is more comprehensive as it covers

institutions that do not file SEC reports.

         The database reports quarterly MRC data starting in March 1998 and ending in

September 2003.14 In addition, we collect total assets, equity, trading assets and liabilities,


14
  In practice, the MRC is reported as a “market risk equivalent asset” figure, which is the MRC divided by 8
percent. This figure is then added to the credit risk-weighted assets. The total capital requirement is a minimum of

derivatives notional, and total trading revenues. Trading revenues are broken down into fixed-

income, currency, equity, and commodity categories. The detailed trading revenue series start in

March 1995.

         There is a total of 40 BHCs that have non-zero entries in the MRC data field over the

1998-2003 sample period. For the correlation analysis, this study requires a continuous sample

over the same period. Hence, the sample is restricted to the 11 BHCs with complete histories

over the 1998-2003 period. This is the most important group anyway. It accounts for 95% of the

value of the aggregate market risk charge in March 1998 and 92% at the end of the period.

         Mergers and acquisitions, however, are frequent occurrences that require special

treatment. We reconstructed the time series of the merged entity by adding up the series for the

separate institutions. For instance, total assets for JP Morgan Chase before September 2000 are

taken as the sum of assets for the two banks before the merger. This is only an approximation

because it ignores transactions between the two banks. This procedure also overestimates the

VAR of the merged entity, which is likely to be less than the sum of the separate VARs due to

diversification effects.15 This procedure is conservative, however, for the purpose of measuring

the information content of VAR.




8 percent of the total. Therefore, the numbers we report are the reported market risk equivalent assets (item 1651)
multiplied by 8 percent and translated into millions of dollars.
15
   Strictly speaking, the VAR of a portfolio can only be less than the sum of the individual VARs for elliptical
distributions. Atrzner et al. (2001) show pathological cases where this so-called “coherence” property is not
satisfied.

Summary Statistics

        Table I displays the 11 BHCs with a complete time-series history over the 23 quarters.16

Over this five-year period, nearly all banks have increased in size. Total assets have grown by

34%, equity by 56%, and derivatives notional amounts by 118%. The major exception is

Deutsche Bankers Trust (DBT), whose operations were wound down after its acquisition by

Deutsche Bank.

        Table II displays trading position data for the bank sample. It shows the size of trading

assets, trading liabilities, and of the Market Risk Charge. Comparing the two tables, we see that

trading assets account for approximately 14% of total assets as of 2002. Three banks, JPM

Morgan Chase, Bank of America, and DBT, have large trading operations in terms of relative

size of trading assets. Overall, trading liabilities amount to approximately half of trading assets.

These numbers, however, like derivatives notional amounts, are not very informative because

they fail to capture the risk and correlations of positions, which is better measured by the MRC.




The Market Risk Charge

        We now turn to the description of the market risk charge. This amounted to $6.7 billion

in total for these 11 banks as of 2002. In relation to total assets or equity, however, this is a

small number. The MRC averages about 1.4% of total trading assets, or 2.4% of total book

equity. This masks differences across banks, however. As of December 2002, JP Morgan Chase

and Bank of America had the biggest trading operations, with an MRC/equity ratio of 6.3% and

4.6%, respectively. At the other extreme, Keycorp’s MRC is only 0.2% of equity.



16
  This sample includes all 8 banks analyzed by Jorion (2002a), of which 2 disappeared due to mergers (JP Morgan
and NationsBank).

        The aggregate MRC has hardly changed over this 5-year period, increasing from $6.5 to

$6.7 billion only. This number, however, is mainly driven by large banks and is partly offset by

a large drop in the MRC for DBT. Figure 2 displays the MRC for all 11 banks. Apart from

DBT, MRCs steadily increase over time. Some banks with low initial MRC, such as Mellon

Bank, State Street, and Wells Fargo, do increase their market risk substantially in relative terms.

To abstract from size, we compound the average of the quarterly rate of growth for various series

across banks. Figure 3 compares the growth of the MRC, trading assets, bank equity, and bank

assets. For the average bank, trading has become more important over the last five years.17

         We now examine the time-series behavior of the MRC, an ex ante measure of risk. Table

III displays the quarterly relative change in the MRC, along with the value-weighted and

equally-weighted averages across banks. The bottom of the first panel displays the mean and

standard deviation of each time series. Note that the mean is systematically smaller than the

standard deviation. For JPM Chase, for instance, the mean is 7.0%, and the standard deviation

23.9%. As a result, tests have little statistical power. The t-statistics do not allow us to reject the

hypothesis of zero mean change in the MRC.18

         Since some observers have blamed VAR for the volatility experienced in the third

quarter of 1998, we would expect to see a sharp increase in the aggregate VAR from June to

September 1998. Instead, the relative change in total VAR is only 4.5%, which is within the

range of typical fluctuations in VAR. There is no evidence that the market risk charge went up

sharply during this period. Perhaps market volatility went up and positions were cut, however.



17
   This could be explained by an increase in general market risk, as measured by VAR, or in specific risk. Casual
observation from annual reports, however, indicates that these banks have increased their VAR over this period. See
the Financial Times (March 25, 2004), “The balancing act that is Value at Risk.”
18
   The only exception is Mellon Bank, for which the t-statistic is 2.1.

         Finally, the bottom of Table III displays the correlation matrix between changes in VAR.

The average correlation is -0.033, which is close to zero.19 Only one correlation among is the 55

entries is significantly different from zero. The correlation between the two biggest trading

operations, JP Morgan Chase and BofA, is 0.302, which is still small.

         To assess the economic implication of diversification effects, we can compare volatility

measures under different assumptions. Define xi as the variable of interest, say the relative

change in the MRC. The volatility of the average (equally-weighted) is derived from:


              σ2[(1/N)Σ xi] = (1/Ν)2 [ Σ i σ2i + 2 Σi Σi ≠ j σi σj ρij]                                              (5)

The volatility of the average, which is shown in the last column, is 7.8% only.

         We can then compare this volatility with what we would obtain under different

correlation scenarios. With perfect correlations, Equation (5) simplifies to a volatility measured

as (1/N) [Σ i σi], which is the average of volatilities across banks. This is 29.9% in our sample,

which is much greater that what we observe. On the other hand, with zero correlations, the

volatility of the average should be (1/Ν) [Σ i σ2i ] 1/2 , which is 10.2% in our sample. The fact

that the actual volatility of 7.8% is even lower than this last number reflects the many negative

correlations across series. In other words, there seems to be substantial idiosyncratic movement

in the market risk charge. Thus, there is no support for the hypothesis that VAR measures move

strongly together.




19
  The pairwise correlation coefficients are not independent because the correlation matrix must obey positive-
definiteness conditions. We also report the average of positive entries and the average of negative entries. These
must obviously be greater than the grand average, and reflect the average correlation between banks that have
positive, or negative correlations.

Trading Revenues

          Next, Table IV reports measures of trading revenues. The first column reports the

average annual trading revenue in dollars. This is annualized by multiplying the quarterly

average by four. The numbers are all positive but are hard to compare to each other because the

scale of the operations are so different. Instead, the second column reports the average of the

quarterly trading revenue deflated by beginning-of-quarter trading assets, which is similar to a

“return-on-assets” measure (rather, revenue-on-assets since expenses are not taken into account).

The range of values is striking. Many banks return less than 5%. Two banks, however, return

more than 10%. These banks, Mellon and State Street, have relatively small values for trading

assets.

          The next column deflates trading revenues by book equity instead, giving a metric

similar to “return-on-equity”. This is also an incomplete measure because equity supports not

only market risk but also other risks. Here also, there is a wide dispersion in ratios. The

ordering of banks is generally similar to that in the previous column, except for JP Morgan

Chase which now ranks with the highest ratio, because the bank has a large trading operation

relative to its other activities.

          We verify whether these results still hold when using the market risk charge as the

denominator instead of trading assets. The next column reports the average of trading revenue

deflated by the beginning-of-quarter MRC, which can be interpreted as economic risk capital

required to support the trading activity. The ratios are all very high, reaching 1,069% per annum

for State Street. The ratio for the total is 184%. Even after deduction of expenses, these ratios

seem high.

                                                                    P. Jorion-Bank Trading Risk and Systemic Risk


         Assume for instance that costs account for 80% of revenues, which is a high but

conservative number.20 This gives a net return before taxes to the MRC of 184%×(1−80%) =

37%, which is still very high. For Citicorp, for instance, the table implies a net return on MRC

of 852%×(1−80%)=170%. This is much higher than its total return to equity of about 30% over

recent years. For this sample, 7 banks out of 11 show a ratio of trading revenue to MRC above

184%. Either proprietary trading has been very profitable over these years, or the MRC is too

low as a measure of economic capital.

         The right side of Table IV then decomposes trading revenues into its four categories.

Based on total dollar revenues, fixed-income trading accounts for 35% of the total; currency

trading for 45%, equity trading for 16% and commodity trading for 4%. Smaller banks tend to

specialize in currency and fixed-income trading and are thus less diversified.

         Next, we turn to a correlation analysis of trading revenues. To increase the sample size,

the analysis starts in March 1995, for a total of 35 quarters instead of 23 in the previous sample.

Trading revenues are deflated by trading assets at the beginning of each quarter to produce a rate

of return. Table V presents the volatility of scaled trading revenues and their correlations. The

next-to-last column is the total, aggregate number. This is a value-weighted aggregate obtained

by scaling the total dollar trading revenues by total dollar trading assets. The last column

represents the arithmetic, or equally-weighted average for the 11 banks.

         The table shows that correlations are generally low. The average correlation is 0.163

only. Note that there is substantial imprecision in these numbers. Under the null of zero

correlation, for example, the standard error is 0.177. Thus, there is no evidence that trading


20
  Goldman Sachs, for example, reports segment information for proprietary trading. Over the last three years,
operating expenses for this segment ranged from 66% to 76% of net revenues.



                                                        21

activities for these banks are highly correlated, on average. Even the average of positive values

is still relatively low, at 0.275; the average of negative entries is -0.167, which is also low. The

main exception is for the two largest trading operations, JP Morgan Chase and BofA, which have

a high correlation coefficient of 0.709. These banks account for 52% and 17% of total trading

assets for this sample, respectively. So, the two largest banks in the sample have commonalities

in trading revenues.

           Figure 4 plots the quarterly scaled trading revenue for the industry as a whole. The top

line represents the equal-weighted average, the bottom line the value-weighted average. The

equal-weighted average is higher, reflecting the higher profitability of smaller banks when

scaling by trading assets. The value-weighted index drops to a slightly negative value only once,

during the third quarter of 1998. This reflects the losses suffered by the larger banks during the

LTCM crisis. The equal-weighted index, however, only registers a small drop during this

quarter.

           As before, we can measure the diversification effect by comparing the average volatility

and the volatility of the equally-weighted average. The average volatility, which assumes no

diversification effects, is 1.13%. If the series were totally uncorrelated, the volatility of an

equally-weighted portfolio should be 0.46%. Instead, the volatility of the average, which is

shown in the last column, is 0.64% only. This number is slightly higher than the uncorrelated

volatility but still much lower than the undiversified volatility of 1.13%, confirming that the

trading risk of the commercial banking system is rather well-diversified, on average.

           Perhaps these results mask high correlations for some categories of trading. To check

this, Table VI provides a more detailed analysis by trading category. The bottom of the table

describes the distribution of correlation coefficients for fixed-income, currency, equity, and



                                                   22
                                                                      P. Jorion-Bank Trading Risk and Systemic Risk


commodity trading.21 The averages are all low, ranging from -0.039 to 0.149, indicating little

commonality in trading positions within each category. Even the fixed-income positions, often

thought to be similar to those assumed by LTCM, have low correlations.22 Equity trading

portfolios have the highest correlation, which averages 0.149, still a low number.

         The table also shows diversification effects across categories for each bank. The risk

decomposition panel lists volatilities scaled as a percentage of each bank’s total trading risk. The

first four categories correspond to the individual risk of each trading line. For JP Morgan Chase,

for instance, the trading risk is 62.6% of the total for fixed-income, 29.6% for currencies, 34.5%

for equities, and 30.0% for commodities. These numbers are representative of the industry as a

whole, with more trading risk coming from fixed-income products. These numbers sum to an

“undiversified” risk of 156.7% of the actual risk. The difference, or 56.7%, is a diversification

effect. The table shows substantial diversification effects across trading categories. The average

diversification effect across banks is 74%. This effect is visually confirmed by Figure 5, which

shows that the four components of the equally-weighted bank index behave relatively

independently of each other. Thus, these banks are fairly diversified across risk categories.

         Next, we provide a direct test of the hypothesis that the risk of trading portfolio has

increased since the internal models approach, based on VAR, was put in place in 1998. Table

VII compares the volatility of scaled trading revenues before and after 1998. The evidence is

inconclusive. Six banks had increased risk, five had lower risk, a few significantly so in either

direction. Based on the value-weighted data, trading risk seems to have increased. Based on an


21
   Not all banks engage in trading activities across all categories. All banks were active in fixed-income and
currencies, but only 8 banks report equity trading, and 9 banks report commodity trading.
22
   Notably, JP Morgan Chase and BofA have a correlation of 0.512, 0.157, 0.680, and 0.322, for fixed-income,
currency, equity, and commodity risk, respectively. So, the high correlation of 0.709 for their total trading is not
driven by fixed-income positions alone. Note that, because correlations are not linear operators, the correlation for
the sum may be greater than the correlations for the four business lines.

equal-weighted portfolio, however, volatility went down post-1998. Similarly, the average of

individual volatilities dropped from 0.0128 to 0.0084 in the post-1998 period. This does not

suggest the average volatility of trading bank portfolios has increased over time.

         Finally, Table VIII revisits the trading performance of this bank sample, now adjusting

for risk. The cross-sectional average of mean scaled trading revenues was 7.68%, and the

average volatility was 2.27%. The last columns show that these correspond to very high Sharpe

ratios. The average Sharpe ratio based on dollars trading revenues is 3.54 for this sample (from

the cross-sectional average of the average trading revenue divided by its volatility). Using

trading revenues scaled by trading assets gives a similar ratio of 3.42. These numbers are much

higher than the Sharpe ratio of 1.30 for an aggregate hedge fund index reported by Asness et al.

(2001), although they do not take costs into account.23

         Perhaps these results are due to the shape of distribution of trading revenues. Table VIII

also reports skewness and excess kurtosis. The average skewness is close to zero; none is

significant. Excess kurtosis is generally positive, with four significant entries. These numbers

are similar to those for hedge funds. Even so, risk adjustments based on volatility alone should

be viewed with caution, as they ignore tail risks.

         These results are in line with those of Kwan (1997). He finds that trading is more

profitable, but riskier, than banking activities.24 Interestingly, he also reports that trading by

primary dealer subsidiaries, which overlap with the large banks in our sample, has negative

correlation with banking activities, providing diversification benefits to bank holding companies.

No doubt this explains the increased focus on proprietary trading.

23
   The data are over a similar period, January 1994 to September 2000. The Sharpe ratio for the S&P index is 1.39,
also expressed in raw rather than excess returns.
24
   Over the period 1990.II to 1997.II. Kwan (1997) reports average trading revenues over trading assets for primary
dealers of 6.0%, with a volatility of 2.3%, using annual data.

                                     IV.     CONCLUSIONS

        VAR systems and the discipline of risk-sensitive capital charges have focused the

attention of financial institutions on improving risk management practices. No doubt this helps

explain the resilience of the banking system in the fact of the recent recession and ever-bigger

corporate and sovereign defaults. A nagging concern, however, is whether the generalized use of

these techniques could increase volatility in financial markets.

        This study provides a first attempt at addressing this issue. In the absence of position

data, it relies on the time-series behavior of market risk charges and trading revenues broken

down by line of activity. This analysis must be qualified, however, by the use of quarterly

returns that could mask the risk of proprietary trading portfolios, which follow dynamic trading

strategies with even higher turnover than hedge funds. In addition, the relatively short sample

periods do not allow investigating correlations in the tails, which may be different from the

average correlations used here.

        Nevertheless, the overall picture from these preliminary results is that there is a fair

amount of diversification across banks, and within banks across business lines. There is also no

evidence that the post-1998 period has witnessed an increase in volatility. Thus, arguments that

bank trading and VAR systems contribute to volatility due to similar positions has no empirical

support. As Fed Vice-Chairman Ferguson (2002) said in a recent speech, these concerns seem

“overestimated.”

Notes: The table reports trading assets (TrA), trading liabilities (TrL), and the market risk charge (MRC) at two points in time.
The MRC is obtained by multiplying the reported market risk equivalent assets by 8%.
The ratios are for trading assets over total assets, trading assets over trading liabilities, MRC to TrA, and MRC over equity.
For the ratios, "Total" refers to the ratio of the dollar sum of trading assets over the sum of assets, for example.
"Average" refers to the arithmetic average of entries (ratios) for all 11 banks.
