How Financial Aid Affects Persistence

                                           ABSTRACT

The Pell Grant program is the largest means-tested financial assistance available to postsecondary

students across the United States, yet researchers have only limited evidence on the causal effects

of these grants. This paper examines the effect of Pell grants on student persistence after the first

year. The paper uses unique, student-level data from all public colleges in Ohio. The data include

detailed financial data which allow me to identify small discontinuities in the Pell grant formula.

I exploit these discontinuities to identify the causal effects of the voucher. The results based on

discontinuity approaches suggest that Pell grants reduce college drop-out behavior. The results in

this paper support other evidence that find a relationship between need-based aid and college

completion (e.g. Dynarski 2002, Turner and Bound 2002).

        The Pell Grant program is the largest means-tested financial assistance available

to postsecondary students across the United States. Students from all types of degree

granting post-secondary institutions can apply for Pell grants. In 2000-01, the federal

government awarded almost $8 billion in Pell grants among more than 3.8 million

students, roughly one-third of all college students (College Board 2001). President

Bush’s 2003 budget allocates over $10.9 billion dollars for an estimated 4.5 million Pell

grant recipients (DOE 2002) potentially representing a 32.4 percent increase in the

number of students receiving Pell grants since the 1990-91 school year. Yet despite this

continued expansion of Pell, researchers have only limited evidence on the causal effects

of these grants.

        Most Pell-related research focuses on the effects of Pell Grants on enrollment

decisions, specifically focusing on initial enrollment and choice amongst colleges (see

Kane 1999, Ehrenberg and Sherman 1984, Leslie and Brinkman 1987, Seftor and Turner

2002). However, there is surprisingly little research measuring the causal effect of Pell

grants on student outcomes in college (e.g. persistence, graduation).                     Regardless of

whether Pell grants affect initial enrollment patterns, Pell grants may independently affect

student outcomes.

        Moreover, studying the effects of need-based aid on student outcomes may also

be important since Pell-eligible students are more likely to be on the margin of “stopping-

out.”1 At Ohio 4- year colleges in 1999-2000, 18 percent of full- time freshmen who were

not eligible for Pell Grants withdrew from college by the next year while 28 percent of

students who were eligible for a Pell grant did not enroll the following year. It is an open

 “Stopping-out” refers to students who withdraw from school after their first year. These students are not
“drop-outs” since many of these students do not leave school permanently and their undergraduate credit
hours do not “expire.” I use these terms interchangeably throughout the paper.


                                                     1
question whether Pell grants and other need-based aid programs affect these margins.

This paper attempts to resolve these questions. Using unique student data from Ohio, this

paper measures the causal relationship between need-based aid and student retention.

        A study of the effects of need-based aid on student retention may be of interest to

both policymakers and educational researchers. As Sarah Turner argues elsewhere in this

volume, policymakers have often paid more attention to improving student access to

college rather than improving student retention once in college. However, as college

enrollment rates continue to increase while completion rates do not, both policymakers

and researchers have begun focusing more heavily on indicators of student retention (e.g.

DesJardins, Ahlburg, McCall 1999, St. John, Hu, Tuttle 2000, St. John, Hu, Weber 2000),

and the relationship between financial need and persistence is central to many of these

studies (e.g. DesJardins, Ahlburg, MccCall 2002, St. John, Musoba, Simmons 2003).

        There are a number of reasons why more research has not investigated the effects

of Pell grants on student collegiate outcomes.      One reason is that researchers have

difficulty distinguishing between the effects of family characteristics and the effects of

Pell grants.       Pell grants are a means-tested program.    Comparisons between Pell

recipients and non-Pell recipients (e.g. Wei and Carroll 2002) may be difficult to interpret

since Pell recipients are poorer and may be more likely to drop-out even in the absence of

need-based aid. To correct for such bias, researchers must sufficiently control for family

characteristics.

        Additionally, identifying the effects of Pell grants is difficult since much of the

variation in the size of students’ Pell grants is correlated with students’ college

enrollment decisions. For example, college choice and the size of a students’ Pell grant




                                             2
are directly connected. Students who attend more expensive (and often higher quality)

schools are eligible for larger Pell grants than students at other colleges or universities.

Pell grants are also more generous for full-time rather than part-time students.     Even in

the absence of Pell grants, students who benefit most from college are more likely than

other students to attend more expensive schools and to attend full- time. However, since

Pell grant awards are systematically higher for these same students, it may be difficult to

identify the effects of the Pell grant separate from college enrollment effects. To avoid

this bias, researchers must exploit variation in Pell grants that is independent of college

choice (e.g. discontinuities in the Pell formula).

       A final reason that researchers have been unable to identify the effects of Pell

grants on outcomes is the absence of accurate data, in particular, the absence of accurate

persistence and detailed financial data. Some researchers have measured persistence at a

particular university; however, in these data, researchers cannot distinguish between a

student who transferred to another school and one who withdraws from college. Other

survey-based data rely on students’ self-reports of their college experience. These data

may not be as reliable as administrative data since students may not recall or do not wish

to report small periods of time when they withdrew from college.

       Financial data is equally as difficult to obtain. Most of the students who receive

Pell grants do not attend elite, expensive institutions, nor do they have substantial family

support. Pell recipients (and much of the variation in their awards) typically come from

less expensive colleges and their family contributions are much smaller. Moreover, the

variation in Pell grants is typically small. Exact financial data are necessary both to

identify the small variations in Pell grants and to employ creative identification strategies.




                                              3
Survey data (e.g. High School and Beyond, National Educational Longitudinal Survey)

do not offer the level of detail necessary to identify accurately the level of students’ Pell

grants.

          To examine the effects of Pell, this paper presents evidence from data gathered by

the Ohio Board of Regents (OBR). These data do not have the shortcomings of other

datasets and offer a level of detail on both persistence and financial variables that is not

available in other data. Since 1998, OBR has collected comprehensive data on college

enrollment in Ohio’s public 2- and 4-year colleges. As a result, the OBR data tracks

students within and across schools. With the data, researchers can distinguish between

students who withdraw from school and students who transfer to other Ohio schools.

Moreover, through collaborative agreements, OBR has expanded the data to include

students’ ACT scores and data from the Free Application for Federal Student Aid

(FAFSA). The FAFSA data are the exact data used by institutions to determine the

amount of students’ Pell grant eligibility.

          The level of detail in the financial data also facilitates the use of statistical tools

that are impractical using other data. In particular, the level of detail allows researchers

to identify small discontinuities in the Pell grant formula. These discontinuities may be

exploited to identify the causal effects of the voucher.                   While this paper may not

completely resolve biases from college choice/enrollment or family background, the

discontinuity analysis may be the best available method for dealing with such biases.

          The paper presents evidence on the effects of Pell grants using both panel and

cross-sectional variation. 2 The panel specifications suggest that need-based financial aid

 It is important to distinguish between the effects of Pell grants in general and the effects of Pell grants
conditional on init ial enrollment. This paper focuses on estimating the effect of persistence conditional on


                                                      4
reduces students’ stop-out behavior. In identifying this effect, the paper shows that

students who receive Pell grants after their first year are a unique subset of students who

applied for financial aid in their first year. Failure to control for this selection may

confound causal estimates of the Pell grant program.

         The paper also presents evidence relying on cross-sectional variation. The paper

estimates the effects of Pell grants close to existing discontinuities in family size. The

results based on discontinuity approaches suggest that Pell grants reduce college drop-out

rates; however, the results are not robust to alternative specifications.

         Section 1 of this paper presents a simple economic model of student persistence

under uncertainty.       Section 2 of the paper explains the OBR data in greater detail.

Section 3 of the paper presents the empirical strategies and results. Section 4 discusses

policy implications of the results and concludes.



I.       Economic Model

         Economists often model educational attainment as investment in human capital.

Even basic economics classes teach that students will choose an education level that

maximizes the expected present discounted value (PDV) of future wage payments less

the expected PDV of educational costs. There have been a number of permutations to

this model – factoring in scholarship aid, allowing the returns to education to vary, and

showing how predicted education levels vary with expectations (Manski 1993). This

paper investigates the relationship between financial aid and outcomes. Rather than use a




a student having enrolled. I discuss below the relationship between the conditional effects of Pell and the
unconditional effects.


                                                      5
traditional human capital model, the paper models students’ dropout behavior using a

multi-stage investment model.

       Multi-stage investment models are particularly useful in cases where the agent

must reevaluate the project after an initial period of time. For example, Myers and Majd

(1990) investigate optimal abandonment rules for firms.        Dixit and Pindyck (1994)

review other examples of multi- stage investments.

       The phenomenon of interest – students’ stop-out behavior – is similar to these

multi-stage investments. In the initial period, students must decide whether or not to

attend the first year of college. After completion of the first year, students must then

reevaluate whether or not to complete the next year. About 20 percent of first-time

freshmen withdraw from 4-year colleges after the first year.

       To formalize the model, let person i's wage at time t (wit) be modeled as a

function of years of college (st) and ability (ai) which is not perfectly known to the

student. Let the cost of education at time t (ct) be the difference between announced

tuition (Tt) and financial aid. Financial aid contains two components: the need-based

component is a function of initial wealth (I0 ) and the number of children attending college

at time t (nt ); the merit-based component is a function of perceived ability at time t. Let

Et[] denote the expectation operator conditional on information at time t.

             wit=f(sit,,ai)                                                         (1)

             ct= Tt - g(I0 ,nt) - h(ai)                                             (2)

       A student will attend a 1st year of college if the expected value of increased

lifetime earnings for tha t year exceeds the cost of attending college (including foregone

earnings).

          E0 (∑Rt−1[ f (sit =1, ai ) − f (sit = 0, ai )]) > E0 ( f (si1 = 0, ai ) + T1 − g(I 0 , n1 ) − h(ai ))    (3)
              t=2


         At the start of the first year, a student will indicate an intention to attend a second

year as well so long as

               T
          E0 (∑Rt −2[ f (sit = 2, ai ) − f (sit =1, ai )]) > E0 ( f (si 2 = 1, ai ) +T2 − g(I 0 , n2 ) − h(ai ))   (4)
              t=3


         We could solve the decision rules for the maximum tuition level that a student

would be willing to pay. For simplicity, let’s assume that tuition is fully known one year

in advance.

                                                                          T
          E0 (T1*) = T1* = E0 (g(I 0 ,n1 ) +h(ai ) − f (si1 = 0, ai ) + ∑Rt−1[ f (sit =1, ai ) − f (sit = 0, ai )]) (5)
                                                                         t =2


and

                                                                     T
          E0 (T2* ) =   E0 (g(I 0 , n2 ) + h(ai ) − f (si2 =1, ai ) + ∑Rt−2[ f (sit = 2, ai ) − f (sit = 1, ai )]) (6)
                                                                    t=3


         These tuition levels are likely the formulae that students use to make any

decisions about the second year of school that must be made during the first year. For

example, a student wanting to transfer to another university must file that application

during the first year. Also, students who want financial aid in their second year must file

applications during their first year. With these types of decisions in mind, there are a few

insights that come from comparing these two tuition values:

      1. For a given level of ability, if the returns to schooling are linear (or even concave)

         in schooling and scholarship aid does not change, then the maximum tuition that a

         student will pay falls over time. Hence, many students may rationally choose to

         get only one year of school.



                                                              7
     2. Even if the returns to schooling are convex and scholarship aid does not change,

          then the maximum tuition a student is willing to pay may still decrease over time

          leading to more planned attrition. 3

     3. Even expected changes in financial aid can alter the maximum that students

          would be willing to pay leading to students to plan on withdrawing or

          transferring.

     4. Since students must apply for 2nd year financial aid during their first year, they

          will do so only if they perceive that their benefits exceed costs in both periods. 4

          There are also a number of decisions about the second year that can be made after

the first year – for example, the decision to withdraw from college altogether. Students

make these decisions after gaining another year of information by which to base their

decisions. The student will choose to attend another year if the expected value of the

increase in lifetime earnings for the 2nd year exceeds the cost of attending college that

year (including foregone earnings).

               T
          E1 (∑Rt −2[ f (sit = 2, ai ) − f (sit = 1, ai )]) > E1 ( f (si 2 = 1, ai ) +T2 − g(I 0 , n2 ) − h(ai ))   (7)
              t =3


We could rewrite this decision rule solving for the maximum tuition levels that the

student would be willing to pay in order to actually attend a given year of college:




3
  Holding scholarship aid constant and as T? 8, the maximum tuition rises only if the following inequality
is satisfied:
                   (1− r ) E 0 [ f ( s it = 2, ai ) − f ( s it = 1, ai )] > E 0 [ f ( sit = 1, ai ) − f ( s it = 0, ai )] .
If in the extreme case, there is a “sheepskin” effect of a degree (i.e. returns only to a 2- or 4-year degree),
then the inequality is always satisfied. Typical models of sequential investment show that the willingness
to pay increases over time. The key difference is the usability of capital. Students may be able to drop out
of colleges and use a year of college in the labor market.
4
  There may be a small group who apply for financial aid even though they expect not to attend the second
year. There is an option value to applying for financial aid since ability is not known perfectly (see
discussion by Sarah Turner elsewhere in this volume).


                                                               8
                                                               T
        T2* = E1 (g( I 0 , n2 ) + h(ai ) − f (si2 = 1, ai ) + ∑Rt−2[ f ( sit = 2, ai ) − f (sit = 1, ai )])   (8)
                                                               t=3


Notice that the difference between equation (8) and (6) is the information set. Students

have a chance to update their expectations with information from their first year of

school. As the model stands, the updating comes in terms of ability. Similar to the

model in Manski (1993), students discover their ability by attending college. Knowing

the ability then changes the willingness to pay.

        We could have also changed this model by introducing uncertainty in the financial

aid formula. Unexpected changes in financial aid might lower the maximum tuition price

that students might be willing to pay. For example, if a students’ expected financial aid

offer falls, the maximum that a student would be willing to pay declines. The student

may wish to transfer to a cheaper school or drop-out altogether.

        A simple insight of the model is tha t changes in financial aid matter. Previous

work on the effects of financial aid has looked at relationships between student outcomes

and both changes and levels of aid. Recent work by Wetzel, O’Toole, and Peterson

(1999) look at changes in financial aid for students at Virginia Commonwealth

University. They find that increases in need-based financial aid likely improved student

retention. Other work by Singell (2001) looks at the effects of the level of financial aid in

the first year.     He finds that the higher students’ levels of need-based financial aid, the

more likely the student is to graduate.

        While the model in this paper suggests that decisions about enrollment in the

second year rely on financial aid changes rather than levels, there may be reasons that the

level of financial aid in the first year matters. If the level of financial aid in the first year

creates some inertia or helps to shape expectations about the financial aid offer in the


                                                           9
second period, the level may affect the student in the next year. One example of this type

of effect is the application for 2nd year financial aid. The higher a students’ Pell grant in

the first year, the more likely the student will apply for a 2nd year award. If students

expect to get a low 2nd year award, they may never even apply for financial aid.

         The level of financial aid may even have deleterious consequences on the student.

The model implicitly assumes that financial aid does not change students’ behavior in

other ways. But for example, if a student receives financial aid, he or she may be more

“detached” from college. The student may not fully engage and take college seriously

since his/her money is not “on the line.” In this way, Pell grants eliminate the “sunk cost

fallacy” for the student. 5 Since Pell grant recipients did not make this initial investment

(the Federal government did instead), they may not have as strong of an incentive to work

hard in school as students who made this initial investment themselves. As a result, Pell

recipients may perform worse.             The model may capture some of this through the

“updates” on students’ abilities. Controlling for students performance in school gives a

clear indicator of whether they are exerting effort or not. The empirical results will

investigate this hypothesis more fully.

         Although they are outside of the scope of this paper, there are other outcomes in

which we might be interested that are related to either the level or change in financial aid.

For example, we might be interested in how financial aid affects the number of credits

that a student successfully attempts. Students without financial aid may be reluctant to

take loans and may spend more time working on the side. On the other hand, students

without financial aid may want to “cram” in more credits per semester to try to reduce the


5
  The “sunk cost fallacy” suggests that people often devote greater resources and more effort in areas where
they have already made an investment.


                                                    10
number of semesters they have to attend (and as a result the total cost of college). We

might also be interested in knowing how GPA’s vary with financial aid. In particular, if

the level of financial aid affects hours attempted, completed or grade point averages, it

might also affect students’ perception of their abilities and, in the context of the model

above, affect their likelihood of completing college.



II.    Data

       The data for this project come from the Ohio Board of Regents (OBR). Through

a collaborative agreement with the OBR, the OBR has allowed me to access anonymous

student data from Ohio’s public institutions. The data are provided by the respective

institutions to the OBR and include information on student demographics, enrollment,

credit hours completed, and grade point averages.

       OBR has collaborative arrangements with other agencies that allow them to

expand the data. For example, OBR links the student records to ACT and SAT records.

Most Ohio students take the ACT exam, and the ACT records include the highest test

score of the student and the most recent responses to the ACT survey (which includes

student-reported data on high school performance). OBR also links students to their

respective FAFSA. The FAFSA data include detailed information about the finances of

both students and their families. From the FAFSA, the variable of most interest is the

“estimated family contribution” that colleges use to award grants based on financial need.

       One important limitation of the data is that they only include information about

need-based financial aid. From FAFSA data, we know students’ eligibility for federal

grants and loans. We also know students’ eligibility for Ohio’s Instructional Grant




                                            11
program, a state-run need-based financial aid award. The data do not include information

about merit-based financial aid. Ohio institutions are reluctant to divulge merit-based

awards since these rewards are central to their recruitment strategies. While I do not

observe merit aid, I observe students’ GPA’s once in college, their ACT scores, and their

(self-reported) high school GPA’s.            If these variables adequately control for student

ability and if colleges determine need- and merit-based awards separately, the n not

knowing students’ merit-based awards should not affect the estimated results.

        Another limitation of the data is that they only include students attending Ohio

public universities. Students from Ohio that attend universities in other states, including

the nation’s elite schools, and students that attend private schools in Ohio are excluded

from the sample. 6 These exclusions are both a weakness and a strength of these data.

Excluding elite students makes it so the results may not be generalizeable to all college

students; however, excluding elite students gives us the opportunity to describe how

financial aid affects students at non-elite schools. These non-elite schools educate the

majority of college students and may be places where financial constraints are more

binding.

        Another concern related to the inclusion of Ohio public institutions alone is the

measurement of drop-out behavior. Students who transfer from Ohio public institutions

to institutions located in other states are indistinguishable in the data from students who

withdraw from Ohio public universities.             This potential bias, however, should be very




6
 Ohio State University and Miami University are the top ranked public universities in Ohio. In the 2004
version of US News and World Reports’ college rankings, they rank 60th and 64th respectively among
national universities with doctoral programs. Other high ranking institutions in Ohio (e.g. Oberlin) are
private colleges.


                                                    12
small since the percentage of students who likely transferred makes up a small fraction of

the total number of observed dropouts. 7

         I focus entirely on the incoming freshman class in 1999-2000 school year. These

are the first students for whom FAFSA data are available through the OBR. I include

students who enrolled in any college, including community colleges, for the first time in

1999, and I track these students through the 2000-2001 school year.

         Table 1 provides summary statistics for the sample. At 4-year institutions, about

10 percent of incoming full-time freshman are from other states, and students are much

less likely to be commuter students than at 2-year colleges. At 2-year colleges, which

include local and state-run community colleges and technical colleges, about 2 percent of

all students live on campus. Similar to other national surveys, the average age of first

time freshman at 2-year colleges is considerably higher than at 4-year colleges, and

students complete fewer semester hours in their first year (13 at 4-year colleges as

compared to 11 at 2-year colleges.

         Seventy-five percent of incoming freshman at Ohio’s 4-year colleges took the

ACT exam while only 45 percent of students at 2-year colleges took the exam. The 4-

year college students performed better than the 2-year college students. Throughout the

paper, I will at times restrict the sample to students who took the ACT exam. Not only

do I know these students test scores, but I also have additional (self-reported) data on

these students’ high school experiences.

  The Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) tracks the number of transfers at each
institution but does not record the state of residence of transfer students although it does track the states of
residence for incoming freshman. Assuming that transfer students are geographically representative of the
incoming freshman class, then one would expect around 650 Ohio students to transfer to the non-Ohio
schools with substantial Ohio enrollments. If we further assume that all 650 transfer students just finished
their first year of school, then about 4.3 percent of observed dropouts are actually transfer students.


                                                       13
        Throughout the paper, I will also restrict the sample at times to those students

who filed a FAFSA in both Fall 1999 and Fall 2000. About 65 percent of 4-year students

and 63 percent of 2-year students submitted FAFSA’s in 1999; however, only 49 percent

and 40 percent respectively filed FAFSA’s in 2000. As explained below, not observing

FAFSA data for many applicants leads to substantial biases in the results using panel

identification. The average, uncovered financial need is small across all students, but

conditional on it being positive, the uncovered financial need is slightly greater than

$1400 for students at 4-year schools.

        Table 2 shows some basic least-squares regressions of student stop-out behavior

on the level of students’ financial aid. These regressions are not meant to show the

causal effect of Pell grants, but rather to demonstrate associations between the stop-out

behavior, financial aid awards and other covariates. These regressions are also useful in

understanding the types of biases present in the data.                    Comparing the various

specifications will help identify important biases.

        Column 1 sho ws a regression of whether a student drops out or not regressed on

the student’s financial aid award. The regression includes fixed effects that control for

the school that the student attends. The estimated coefficient is positive and significant

suggesting that larger awards are positively associated with drop-out behavior. As

mentioned before, however, these coefficients are significantly biased for a number of

reasons. For example, when we include controls for an individual’s socio-economic

background and personal characteristics in Columns 2, the estimated relationship drops

significantly. 8 The estimated relationship drops dramatically (from .033 to .006) and is

 The sample sizes fall across columns in Table 2. The first column includes all students in the sample.
The second column includes only those students for whom demographic data are available. Columns 3 and


                                                  14
still significant. Column 5 is similar to Column 2 except that I focus only on students

who took the ACT exam, including controls for a student’s high school performance and

entrance exam scores. The estimated coefficient is similar to Column 2 but is no longer

significant. The other rows in Columns 2 and 5 suggest that wealthier students are less

likely to stop-out; out-of-state students are more likely to drop-out; older students and

men are more likely to withdraw; and students living on campus and students who took

the ACT (and performed well on it) are less likely to stop-out.

        In Column 3, I add controls for students’ grades during their freshman years of

school. As previously mentioned, Pell may have had a negative effect since students with

Pell may have had less of a financial commitment to schooling and may not have worked

as hard. Including grade point average should control for these students and may further

weaken the estimated relationship between financial aid and stop-out behavior. As

shown in Table 2, the estimated relationship is smaller than in Columns 1, 2, and 5. The

result is also not statistically different than zero. In Column 6, I estimate a similar

regression for students who took the ACT exam. Again, the estimated relationship is

indistinguishable from zero.

        In Column 4, I estimate the relationship controlling for personal and family

characteristics and grades during a student’s first year. I exclude the fixed effects for

students’ campuses of attendance. These fixed effects also control for differences in

quality, price, and other unobservable campus characteristics (e.g. the strength of a

campuses freshman intervention programs). These fixed effects control for the fact that

students attending lower quality schools (who also receive smaller financial aid awards

Columns 5 and 6 are based on the subsample of students who took the ACT exam.


                                                   15
since tuition is smaller) are more likely to withdraw than students attending better schools

(who receive higher financial aid awards for similar reasons).          Without these fixed

effects, we would expect the estimated relationship between financial aid and student

stop-out behavior to be even smaller and maybe even negative. This is exactly what

Column 4 of Table 2 shows. The estimated relationship suggests that higher financial aid

awards are negatively associated with student stop-out behavior.



III.     Estimating the Causal Effects

         There are three sources of variation that economists can use to identify the effects

of Pell grants: time series, panel, and cross-sectional. In this section, I discuss the

feasibility of each of these identification strategies using the Ohio Board of Regents data.

I also present the basic empirical results for each identification strategy.

         Each strategy aims at identifying the effects of Pell grants conditional on initial

enrollment. However, Pell grants may affect enrollment, and as a consequence, some

students who would no t be enrolled without Pell grants would be included in the analysis

making the parameter estimated in this paper more difficult to interpret. If Pell affects

enrollments, then the parameter estimated in this paper would be a combination of two

different effects – 1) the effect of Pell grants on the persistence behavior of students who

would have attended college in the absence of the Pell and 2) the effect of Pell grants on

the persistence behavior of students who would not have attended school without the Pell

grant.

         Under some circumstances, the latter effect does not matter. For example, any

potential bias depends on the degree to which Pell grants affect enrollment. If the Pell




                                              16
grant has no effect, then the parameter estimated in this paper represents only the effect

of the Pell grant on all students eligible for Pell grants. If the Pell grant has a small

effect, than any bias in the estimated parameter is likely to be small. Most of the research

on Pell grants and enrollment suggest that the Pell has had either no effect or a very small

positive effect on enrollment (see Kane 1999, Leslie and Brinkman 1987).

       Additionally, if the unobservable factors that can potentially bias any estimate of

the effect of Pell grants on persistence are similar for those people for whom Pell

influenced enrollment decisions and those people for whom they did not, then the effect

of Pell grants estimated in this paper should be the same for both groups. For example,

suppose that unobservable family characteristics affect both the size of students’ Pell

grants and their likelihood of dropping out. We typically think that these unobserved

characteristics likely bias our estimate of the effects of Pell grants downward. If the bias

is the same for students for whom Pell did and did not affect initial enrollments, then the

bias should be symmetric across both groups, and while the overall parameter may be

biased by these unobservables, the overall parameter is not made up of two components.

If we can control for these unobservables in our empirical design, we can estimate a

single parameter that is easily interpreted. However, if the determinants of persistence

are not constant across groups, then the parameter will remain a combination of the two

aforementioned effects.


A. Time Series Identification

       One way to identify the effects of Pell grants is to compare changes in students’

outcomes after systematic changes in Pell grants occur. For example, the Pell grant

program began in 1973. Previous work by Kane (1996) compares low- income student



                                            17
enrollment rates before and after the Pell program was established. Kane finds that

college rates grew about 2.6 percentage points slower for low-income students than other

groups, suggesting that the Pell grant had little effect. Other systematic changes in Pell

grant formulae are described in Mortenson (1988).           For the study at hand, I am

presenting evidence for a single cohort, so time-series variation will not be useful in

identifying the effects of Pell.



B. Panel Identification

        Another way to identify the effects of Pell grants is to look at changes in students’

Pell grants over time. While this seems like a promising strategy since the OBR data

contain two years of data for a single cohort, there are a number of reasons that this

strategy might be limited.

        To see the limitations and possibilities of this identification strategy, we need to

understand how variations over time are generated for a single individual. There are

really three basic reasons that a students’ Pell grant would change from one year to the

next. First, the generosity of the Pell grant may change. This could be the result of

systematic changes in the Pell formula or by a change in college tuition. Such changes

are likely to be exogenous, and if they generate enough variation, they may help

researchers to accurately identify the effects of Pell grants. Unfortunately, there is little

variation over time in the period of time that the OBR data are available. From the 1999-

2000 school year to the 2000-2001 school year, the maximum Pell grant increased from

$3125 to $3300, a 5.6% increase. Over the same time, tuition at Ohio schools increased

by 5% across the board (OBR 2001).




                                             18
        Another source of variation comes from changes in students’ college choices.

Students may transfer to another school after the first year. The corresponding change in

tuition will generate variation in students’ Pell grants. Unfortunately, this source of

variation does not help identify the effects of Pell grants. Students who transfer may

have different abilities than those students who do not transfer. For example, a student

with high ability may transfer from a two- to a four-year college to gain access to more

opportunities. This students Pell grant would automatically increase. However, this

increase is correlated with the student’s ability and may confound causal estimates of the

Pell grant. Another reason why using variation from transfer behavior may be misleading

is that the size of students Pell grants may affect transfer behavior making it even more

difficult to interpret and identify the effects of Pell grants using variation caused by

student transfer behavior. Thus, changes in Pell grants resulting from transfer decisions

will not generate variation in Pell grants that can be legitimately used to identify the

effect of Pell grants alone.

        A final reason that students’ Pell grants may change is due to changes in students’

circumstances. Some changes may be legitimate sources of variation. For example, a

family of four with one child in college may have a second child come of college age

causing the existing college student’s Pell grant to increase. Similarly, a change in family

size (e.g. birth of another child or separation) may increase a student’s Pell grant. Even

the natural aging of parents should increase students’ Pell grants although only slightly.

However, there are other changes in family circumstances which may not be legitimate

sources of variation. For example, changes in income due to unemployment or health

shocks may reduce family income and consequently increase students’ Pell grants from




                                            19
year to year. These sources of variation may also affect the likelihood that a student

persists in college.

        For panel identification strategies to be successful, variation in the Pell grants

must come from sources that are exogenous from changes in students’ stop-out behavior.

As mentioned above, the most legitimate changes come from changes in the Pell formula,

changes in tuition, and changes in family size or sibling attendance. I can use changes

from these “legitimate” sources as instruments for actual changes in financial aid.

        Constructing the instrument from changes in the Pell formula and tuition is

straightforward. I simply impute what students' Pell grants would have been during the

2000-2001 school year assuming that their financial and family information is unchanged

from the 1999-2000 school year. The imputed 2000-01 Pell grant does not include

variation from changes in students’ (or their families’) circumstances. It only includes

variation arising from changes in the Pell grant formula and tuition.

        Imputing student data not only allows me to isolate exogenous variation, but it

also allows me to estimate data for many students for whom financial data are missing.

In the 1999-2000 school year, 35,233 students filed FAFSA’s. However, 12,143 of these

students did not file FAFSA’s in the 2000-2001 school year (hereafter referred to as the

“non- filers”). These non-filers are not a random subset of all students. These non- filers

include 2/3 of all students who withdrew from college after the 1999-2000 school year.

For these individuals, I am missing financial data and information about changes in their

siblings’ college attendance for the 2000-2001 school year.             Since the imputation

assumes that students’ financial information is unchanged from their first to second year

of college, I can estimate data for these non-filers.




                                              20
          If I had data for all non- filers, I could estimate out the causal effect of Pell grants

by using the imputed grant as an instrument for the actual grant.              The instrumental

variable estimate would be an unbiased estimate of the effect. Unfortunately, since the

actual data are not available for non- filers, I can only estimate reduced-form regressions

of stop-out behavior on the imputed Pell grant. Since there is a significant, positive

relationship between students’ imputed Pell grants and their actual Pell grants, the

reduced-form estimates of the relationship between imputed Pell and stop-out behavior

should give us a sense of the sign and significance of the effect of actual Pell grants, but

the reduced- form estimates will not give a precise estimate of the magnitude of such an

effect.

          Table 3 contains the reduced-form regressions regressing student stop-out

behavior against the imputed increase in a student’s Pell grant from one year to the next

measured in thousands of dollars. For students who withdrew or transfer, I impute the

Pell grant students would have received if they remained at the same institution as their

initial enrollment. Column 1 shows the results with fixed effects for school of attendance

but no covariates.      Column 2 shows the results without fixed effects for college of

enrollment but with covariates for gender, age, campus living conditions, whether the

student took the ACT exam, and grade point average in the students’ first years. Column

3 includes both fixed effects and covariates.

          As Column 1 shows, students whose Pell grants increase are less likely to

dropout. Without covariates, the coefficient suggests that a $1,000 increase in a student’s

Pell grants leads to an 8.6 percentage point decrease in the likelihood that the student

withdraws. With covariates, the estimated coefficient implies that a $1,000 increase in a




                                                21
student’s Pell grant corresponds to a 9.2 percentage point decrease in the likelihood that

students withdraw. These estimates suggest strongly and consistently that increases in

financial aid decrease the likelihood that students withdraw from school.

            Column 4 repeats the analysis focusing only on the students whose initial college

enrollment was at a 4-year campus. As before, the estimated coefficient is negative and

significant. A $1,000 increase in students’ imputed Pell grants corresponds to a 6.4

percent reduction in the likelihood that students withdraw from college.

            Column 5 reports estimates when non- filers are excluded from the analysis. As

mentioned before, the students who filed FAFSA’s in both years are a non-random subset

of all students. Now the estimate is positive and significant. A $1000 increase in a

student’s financial aid corresponds to a 2 percentage point increase in the likelihood that

a student withdraws. I include the estimate of Column 5 to provide some hint of what the

bias may be from excluding the “non-filers” in the previous columns. When we include

the “non- filers,” we get significant, negative relationships between increases in students’

Pell grants and the likelihood that students drop out; however, when these students are

omitted, the estimates are positive and significant.

            One might be able to further refine the estimates of students’ Pell grants in the

cases where data are missing by using information about students’ siblings. If ages or

graduation dates were known or could be approximated, I could include this information

in the estimation of what students’ Pell grants would have been in the 2000-2001 school

year. Unfortunately, little information is available about students’ siblings for the non-

filers. 9

  Some information about the family (parental age, family size in 1999-2000, number of children in college
in 1999-2000, parental marital status) may help predict changes in the number of children attending


                                                    22
        What conclusion should be drawn from the panel identification specifications?

First, panel identification has only limited power to actually identify the effects of Pell

grants. Much of the variation created over time in a student’s Pell grant comes from

sources which may also affect the probability that the student withdraws from school. It

would be inappropriate to use this type of variation to identify the effects of Pell.

Second, the fact that many students, especially those who plan to withdraw from school,

do not file FAFSA’s in both years makes it difficult to estimate the effect of financial aid.

When we impute data for these people, we find estimates suggesting that increases in

financial aid reduce the likelihood that students withdraw from college.



C. Cross Sectional Identification

        One might also identify the effects of need-based financial aid by comparing the

need-based awards of different students at a single moment in time. There are a number

of reasons that students may have different need-based awards. Students may differ from

each other in terms of personal income and assets, family income and assets, family size,

parental age, college of attendance, and enrollment status (full versus part time). All of

these differences will lead to differences in students’ need-based financial aid. Much of

this variation will not be helpful in identifying the effects of Pell grants. These sources of

variation will also likely affect students’ drop-out behavior independent of need-based

awards.




college; however, their predictive power is limited. When I model changes in sibling attendance on these
variables, I get a very low R-squared. After rounding the predicted values to the nearest integer, the
specification predicts that 0.05% of students who filed FAFSA’s in both periods would have had a change
in the number of siblings attending college. In reality, 20.5% of students had a change in the number of
siblings attending college.


                                                   23
        However, there is some variation across individuals that might be useful. In

particular, differences in family size and the number of children in college may facilitate

identification in a cross-section.           The Pell grant formula contains a number of

discontinuities, the largest of which is based on family size and the number of students

attending college. Even these sources of variation may not be exogenous. For example,

if a family can only afford to send one child to school, they may choose the student who

has the most potential to benefit from college. This student’s Pell grant would likely be

smaller than it would be for a comparable family that sent multiple children to school.

However, in this example, comparing this solitary student to other families with multiple

children attending would lead to a bias since the family with fewer children in college

sent a child to college with a greater chance of succeeding. As a result of this potential

bias, I will primarily focus on results that take advantage of discontinuities in family size.

I will also briefly show estimates based on discontinuities in both family size and the

number of children in college.

        Table 4 shows the changes in Pell Grants that accompany changes in family size.

The table shows three different schedules linking family size and the number of children

attending college. 10 Each schedule corresponds to a different income level ($40,000,

$50,000, or $60,000). For example, among the families with $50,000 in income, a family

of 2 with one in college would receive a Pell grant of $975. If the family was actually a

3-person family with one in college, then the Pell grant would be $1575 per person.

Figure 1 shows similar comparisons for different family sizes. There are three lines

corresponding to family sizes of three, four, and five. The Pell grants shown in the figure


10
  The computations assume that the family has no assets and that the students do not contribute to the
family’s estimated family contribution.


                                                    24
assume that only one child is attending college. As seen, the differences in family size

can lead to systematic differences in students’ Pell grants. These systematic differences

create discontinuities that can be exploited to estimate the effect of Pell grants on

students.

       Assuming that the differences between family size are unrelated to a student’s

success in college, comparisons can be made between families of different sizes who

have the same number of children in college. However, as Table 4 shows, there is

heterogeneity in income (and thus Pell grant) within a given family size.              For

discontinuity analysis to work, the families on either side of the discontinuity should be

similar except for the discontinuity. As a result, when making comparisons across family

sizes, we need to stratify the groups so that comparisons are made across relatively

homogeneous groups (e.g. people with similar income and assets).

       Intuitively, the easiest way to estimate the effect of the Pell grant while taking

advantage of this discontinuity is to use a Wald estimator (Wald 1940). To find the Wald

estimator, one must first isolate two groups that are fairly ho mogeneous. Across the

groups, the Wald estimator is found by taking the ratio of the differences across groups of

the dependent variable (stop-out behavior) and the independent variable (size of the Pell

grant). For example, suppose we could identify all people who have low income and few

assets and have one child in college.   Some of these families are 2-person families and

some are 3-person families.       Assuming that family size is uncorrelated with an

individual’s success in college, we could estimate a Wald estimator across these groups.

Let yi be the average withdrawal rate for group i. Group i takes on a value of 1 for the

group of students in 2-person families with one in college and 2 for the group of students




                                            25
in 3-person families with one in college. Let x i be the average Pell grant for group i. The

Wald estimator between these groups would then be

                   y 2 − y1
        β Wald =            .
                   x2 − x1

       The denominator should be the expected change in the Pell grant as a result of this

discontinuity within this income-asset group. The numerator would be the difference in

stop-out rates between these groups.

       After computing the first Wald statistic, we could then create a Wald estimator

between each income-asset grouping within the sets of 2- and 3-person families. If we

had 10 income-asset groupings, we would have 10 Wald estimators.              These Wald

estimators can be combined by taking a weighted-average of the estimators (weighted by

the number of observations in each group 2). We could similarly create Wald estimators

across adjacent groupings of family size. For example, we could compare 3- and 4-

person families. Of course, in the estimation of each Wald statistic we would actually

have multiple Wald statistics comparing income-asset groupings across each

discontinuity.

       While this approach seems straightforward, other discontinuities in the Pell

formula complicate the estimation of Wald statistics. For example, there are some

income ranges where students would receive the maximum Pell grant regardless of their

family size or the number of children attending college. The Wald statistic would not be

defined (or would be greatly inflated) over these ranges. Similarly, the Wald statistic will

not be defined for families that would have received no Pell grant regardless of their

family size or the number of children in college. Since these groups will likely create

additional noise in the estimation, we may want to exclude these groups at times.


                                            26
       Before estimating the Wald statistics, we need to create the income-asset

groupings needed to create comparisons between homogeneous groups.              To create

groupings, I re-estimate each student’s Pell grant assuming that he or she belonged to a 2-

person family with only 1 person attending college. I then divide this group into 6 parts

based on the revised Pell grant:

       1. People whose Pell grant in a 2-person family with 1-in college would have

           been at the maximum of $3125.

       2. People with revised Pell grants between $3124 and $2001.

       3. People with revised Pell grants between $2000 and $1001.

       4. People with revised Pell grants between $1000 and $401.

       5. People with revised Pell grants at the Pell grant minimum of $400.

       6. People with revised Pell grants equal to zero.


       Having uniform groupings across cells makes it much easier to estimate the Wald

statistics and their standard errors. Creating groupings around Pell grant values also

avoids the problem that wealthier families are more likely to apply if they have more

children. These families are identified in group 6. Also, I separate people who would

have had the Pell grant minimum ($400) since in the Pell grant formula there is a

discontinuity that allows families across a wider range of income to have this value of

Pell grant. I use these revised Pell grants only for the purpose of creating homogeneous

groups (i.e. identifying families with similar assets and incomes).        When actually

computing the Wald statistics, I use the actual Pell grants.

       Figure 2 shows an example of how the discontinuity works.           The sample of

students is from group 3 above. These students would have had similar Pell grants had



                                             27
their family size not been different. The left axis of Figure 2 plots these students' actual

Pell grants across family size. The Pell grant increases with the number of children. The

right-side axis of Figure 2 plots the stop-out rates for these students. The stop-out rate

declines for students with larger families. Assuming that family size affects stop-out

rates only through its effect on Pell grant size, then stop-out rates are negatively related to

Pell grant size for these students.             We could produce similar figures for each

homogeneous group of students.

           Table 5 shows the regression-based Wald estimates for the whole sample.

Following Angrist (1991), the efficient combination of Wald estimators is just the

instrumental variables estimate of y (stop-out behavior) on x (size of Pell grant) where

dummy variables for each homogeneous group and family size combination are used as

instruments for x. For example, if all families were 2, 3, or 4 people in size, then I would

include 18 dummy variables as instruments (i.e. for each of the 6 homogenous

income/asset groupings defined above, I would include 3 dummy variables for the

possible family sizes).

           Column 1 of Table 5 shows the instrumental variable estimate when I estimate the

regression excluding those for whom there is no variation in Pell grants. 11 The estimated

effect is negative and significant.          A $1000 increase in Pell grants stemming from

differences in family size corresponds to a 4 percentage point decrease in likelihood that

a student drops out. The result suggests that systematic differences in Pell grants lead to

differences in stop-out rates for students.              Larger Pell grants reduce students’

probabilities of withdrawing.

     The maximum income in this group is $25,000.


                                                    28
         In Column 2 of Table 5, I include only the students who took the ACT exam. The

estimated effect suggests that a $1000 increase in students’ Pell grants leads to a 1.2

percentage point reduction in the probability that a student withdraws although the result

is not statistically significant. In Column 3, I provide a small specification test. Rather

than use stop-out behavior as the dependent variable, I use the ACT score.                             If the

specification is correctly identified, there should be no significant differences between

ACT scores between groups. Indeed, the estimated relationship is indistinguishable from

zero.

         Another way to estimate the effects of Pell is to use an instrumental variable

approach where the “delinearized” Pell grant is used as an instrument for the actual Pell

grant. To do this, I run a regression of the actual Pell grant on a quartic in the key

variables that determine the Pell grant (family income, family assets, family size, and

number of children in the family attending college). The residuals from this regression

should be primarily made up of discontinuities in the Pell formula along these

dimensions. I then use the residual as an instrument for the actual Pell grant in a simple

regression of stop-out behavior on students’ Pell grants. 12 I restrict the samp le to students

whose families have less than $150,000 in assets or less than $115,000 in annual income.

The results appear in Columns 4 and 5 of Table 5. Similar to Column 3, I find that a

$1000 increase in Pell grants is associated with a 3 percentage point reduction in the

likelihood that a student drops out.




12
   This is identical to running a regression of stop-out behavior on the Pell grant value and a quartic in the
variables that determine the Pell grant. These strategies estimate the same estimator with only a negligible
change in standard errors. I report the standard errors from the "instrument" approach since it may be
intuitively easier to identify what source of variation is behind the estimated effect.


                                                      29
       In Column 5, I use a similar procedure except that I put campus fixed effects in

the regression that predicts students’ Pell grants. This is important since different campus

costs can lead to differences in the size of students’ Pell grants. Again, I use the residuals

from this 1st stage as an instrument in the next. The results drop in magnitude and are

statistically indistinguishable from zero.

       The final column of Table 5 estimates the effects of Pell grants using both the

discontinuities from family size and the number of children in college. I use the same

methodology except now I compare differences in Pell grants resulting from differences

in the number of children going to college as well. The results are similar to those in

Column 1. I find that a $1,000 increase in Pell corresponds to a 4 percent reduction in the

likelihood that students withdraw.

       What conclusions should be drawn?           First, while the estimates reinforce a

negative relationship between the size of one’s Pell grant and stop-out behavior, they are

not completely robust to specification. When I focus on the sample taking the ACT

(Column 2) and when I include additional campus level controls (Column 5), the results

are indistinguishable from zero. Additionally, there is substantial heterogeneity around

the discontinuity and efforts to create comparisons among homogeneous groups may not

fully account for the heterogeneity. Overall the results seem supportive of those in the

panel identification although the results are not robust to different subsamples.



IV.    Conclusion and Policy Implications

       This paper set out to estimate the effects of Pell grants on student retention.

Using panel and cross-sectional variation as sources of identification, this paper attempts




                                             30
to estimate the relationship. The panel identification results suggest strongly that Pell

reduces drop-out rates. The regression-discontinuity results show similar results although

they are more fragile. The regressio n-discontinuity results, however, are less likely to be

biased by other factors than the specifications which use cross-sectional variation.

        The finding that Pell grants affect student persistence has several policy

implications. Most importantly, it implies that federal and state needs-based policies and

aid matter and that they influence the likelihood that students continue from year to year

in college. Even if these aid programs have no effect on enrollment (as Kane 1999 and

Leslie and Brinkman 1987 show), need-based programs may impact educational

attainment. The finding that aid increases persistence may suggest that front- loaded

financial aid programs may improve student retention in the first years of college. 13

        The results in this paper may also support conclusions in Dynarski (2002) and

Turner and Bound (2002). These papers focused on beneficiaries of the Social Security

Student Benefit Program and the G. I. Bill respectively. The papers found that need-

based aid affected both enrollment and completion.

        While many policymakers may view this finding that need-based aid improves

retention as being "good" for society, it is not clear that this is so. As Jonathan Guryan

points out in the comments that follow this chapter, more education may not be optimal

for all students in society. There may be a number of students who do not have the skills

and for whom a college degree may not improve earnings. If these students are the

marginal students for whom the Pell grant program influences college persistence, then

the measured effect in this paper may reflect an inefficient use of societal resources.


13
   DesJardins, Ahlburg, and McCall (2002) finds that frontloaded aid programs have a "modest impact" on
student retention.


                                                  31
        In order to fully resolve the question of whether increased persistence is "good"

for society, we would need to know how an additional year of education affects the

earnings for these marginal students. In estimates of the returns of education for the

entire population, Jaeger and Page (1996) argue that the returns to a second year of

college have significant effects on earnings, particularly if students finish an Associate's

Degree. These estimates suggest that persistence into the second year of college is a

positive outcome; however, the estimated return in Jaeger and Page (1996) is for the

whole population. It is not clear that this estimated return would be the same for the

marginal students affected by Pell grants. Evidence from Tobias (2000) suggests that the

returns to education are concentrated at the highest ability students and remain small for

lower ability students. Moreover, as Sarah Turner points out elsewhere in this volume,

the marginal students are likely less prepared for college and more likely to hold a GED

than a high school diploma. 14 There is little empirical evidence on the returns to an

additional year of college for these students.

        Finally, there are two empirical points that should be considered in interpreting

the results in this paper. First, the paper focuses solely on student persistence between

the first and second year of college in adjacent years. Researchers have documented the

growing trend of students to take breaks at various times during college (e.g. Turner's

chapter in this volume). DesJardins, Ahlburg, and McCall (2002) examine enrollment

probabilities over a longer stretch of time. They find that need-based aid has no long-run

effect on enrollment probabilities. They are using a sample in which students repeatedly

enter and exit higher education. While the sample they use focuses on students who


14
  Many of these students enroll in college remediation. Ongoing research by Bettinger and Long (2003)
examines the effect college remediation on college outcomes and student earnings.


                                                  32
initially enrolled at a four-year campus, their finding suggests that examining the effect of

financial aid on retention over a longer stretch of time may be important.

       Second, as states continue to gather more complete and expansive data on their

students, economists and others researchers will be able to employ methods that exploit

variation in Pell grant formulae. However, even if better data are available, researchers

should take care in how they deal with changes in Pell grant eligibility and missing data.

Students who leave school after their first year are less likely to file additional FAFSA's

making it difficult for researchers to measure their financial status. Research that fails to

control for these missing data may be biased.

Notes: White standard errors are reported in parentheses. Columns 1-3 and 6 include only students with
positive Pell grants less than the maximum. In Columns 4-5, the instrument for “Level of Pell Grant” is the
residual from a regression of Pell grant on a quartic of the key variables determining Pell grants (family
income, assets, family size, number of children in college). The IV columns exclude families with income
greater than $115,000 or assets greater than $150,000. Campus fixed effects are included in the 1st stage of
the specification in Column 5 to control for the fact that different school costs will lead to different size Pell
grants.
