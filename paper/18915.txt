                                            ABSTRACT

This paper estimates the effect of early lead exposure on academic achievement and adult earnings.
We analyze longitudinal information from individuals attending primary and secondary schools in
the city of Arica (in northern Chile). Between 1984 and 1989, Arica received more than 20,000 tons
of toxic chemicals containing high concentrations of lead. Initially, the chemical waste was located
several kilometers from the city. However, Arica's rapid expansion, which included the construction
of housing projects just meters away from the waste deposit, put a large number of families at risk.
Our data include information on residential proximity to the polluted area, levels of lead exposure,
comprehensive demographic information, nationally representative academic test scores and administrative
data on adult earnings.

We document a strong relationship between blood lead levels and student academic performance.
We find that an increase of one microgram of lead per deciliter of blood reduces math and language
scores by 0.15 and 0.21 standard deviations, respectively. For earnings, we estimate that for each
extra microgram of lead, monthly earnings decrease by CLP 11,458 (or USD 22.92). This translates
into a reduction of USD 6,000 in lifetime earnings per microgram of lead per deciliter of blood.

1        Introduction

In recent decades, lead pollution has received increasing attention, especially in developing coun-

tries. This emphasis has led to the development of programs to prevent and communicate the

harmful eﬀects of lead on human health, the implementation of public policies aimed at reduc-

ing emissions from major pollution sources (fuel, paints, light industries, and mineral processing

manipulation, etc.), and more accurate measurement of lead concentration thresholds in soil, air,

water, and blood. In 1991 for example, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)

deﬁned a threshold of 10 micrograms per deciliter of blood (10μg/dL), above which negative eﬀects

of lead on IQ, impaired hearing, behavioral problems (aggression) and delayed bone growth have

been documented.1 At higher levels, lead is associated with deterioration in the nervous system,

severe liver damage, anemia and even death (PTF, 2000; ATDSR, 2007). Furthermore, because

brain functions develop in early childhood, young children are especially vulnerable to the eﬀects

of lead. Early lead exposure might cause severe and irreversible eﬀects on intellectual development

(ATDSR, 2007; Tchernitchin et al., 2005).

    In this paper we analyze the eﬀects of blood lead concentration on the academic performance

of students in the city of Arica (in northern Chile). As we describe in detail below, this provides

a unique opportunity to study the eﬀects of early lead exposure on humans. The presence of lead

in Arica is attributed to the importation of 20,000 tons of mineral residues/waste from Sweden,

between 1984 and 1989. The waste was imported by the Chilean company PROMEL, initially to

be reprocessed to extract gold and silver. However, PROMEL quickly reported this would not be

economically proﬁtable and decided not to continue. As a result, the waste was left on the outskirts

of the city at a location known as site F. According to the company, the toxic waste was removed

in 1998, but as documented below, this area still presents high levels of lead today.

    In the late 1980s and early 1990s Arica experienced rapid economic growth leading to an increas-

ing demand for social housing projects. Unfortunately, and probably explained by the ignorance

surrounding the situation, the regional government decided to construct social housing projects

very close to site F. In 1995, two housing projects, Cerro Chuño and Los Industriales, were built

only meters away from the site and hundreds of families moved to the area.

                                                 1
    We follow these precipitating events and evaluate the eﬀect of lead exposure on academic

achievement. We exploit the relationship between household distance to the contaminated area

(site F ), and lead blood concentration to estimate the consequences on academic achievement.

First, we estimate a reduced-form eﬀect of household proximity to contaminated areas on student

academic performance. Then, using an empirical strategy in the spirit of the Two Sample Instru-

mental Variables (TSIV) (Angrist and Krueger, 1992), we estimate the eﬀect of lead blood levels

on academic achievement.

    Our empirical strategy utilizes multiple sources of information. From the Chilean College

Admission System (Prueba de Selección Universitaria or PSU) data set, we gather information

on proximity to the polluted area (from home address to site F ), multiple test scores (math and

language) and a comprehensive set of individual and household socioeconomic variables for a large

population of individuals living in Arica in 2008. We complement this data with individual’s city

of residence in 2004, also obtained from administrative records. By combining these sources of

information, we identify more than one thousand individuals who lived in Arica between 2004 and

2008, and potentially for many more years. We restrict our analysis to this sample. We also utilize

information from a large sample of intravenous tests collected from local residences in 2000. This

provides us with individual-level measures of lead blood levels.

    Anticipating our main results, we ﬁnd that moving one kilometer (0.6 miles) away from the

polluted site increases math scores by 0.10 standard deviations (controlling for age, gender, parental

educational levels, and school characteristics). For language, the estimated eﬀect is 0.13 standard

deviations.2 In terms of lead blood levels, our ﬁndings suggest that an increase of one microgram of

lead per deciliter of blood reduces math PSU scores by 0.15 standard deviations (after controlling

for age, gender, parental educational levels, and school characteristics). The corresponding eﬀect

for language scores is a reduction of 0.21 standard deviations.

    Finally, we translate our estimated eﬀects into monetary losses. We do this by exploiting the

empirical relationship between PSU scores and annual earnings (during adulthood). Our estimates

indicate that appropriate compensation would be approximately six thousand dollars per microgram

of lead per deciliter of blood. This ignores any non-pecuniary costs associated with blood lead levels
    2
      In both cases, the thought experiment involves increasing the distance from the place of residence to site F from
0.5 kilometers to 1.5 kilometers.




                                                          2
and is therefore likely a lower bound of the true cost. To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst

estimate of this kind in the literature.

    The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we explain the origin of the lead pollution in the

city of Arica. Section 3 reviews the literature on the eﬀects of lead on health and the association

between lead levels in blood and decreased cognitive function and academic performance. In section

4 we describe our data. Section 5 presents our identiﬁcation strategy and empirical ﬁndings.

Robustness checks are presented in Section 6. Section 7 concludes.



2       Exposure to Toxic Waste in Arica: A Brief History

The Arrival and Abandonment of Waste Material. PROMEL is a Chilean private company

founded in the 1970s. The company operated in the north of Chile and oﬀered secure transportation

and processing services for mineral and chemical waste. On March 21st of 1984, PROMEL requested

authorization from the Chilean National Border Agency to import mineral waste from Sweden.

The request was based on the company’s intention to reprocess these minerals to extract gold.3

The chemical description of the minerals included in the oﬃcial request indicated the presence of

copper, gold, silver, iron, lead, mercury, and a number of other substances. With respect to the

level of toxicity, PROMEL described the waste as being “non-toxic metallic mud unless eaten or

handled without proper protection.” After few months of deliberation, the Chilean government

granted permission to import the minerals. As a result, between August 29th, 1984 and July 17th,

1985, Arica received three shipments of 8,096, 6,997 and 4,041 tons of minerals, respectively. The

importation of these products continued until January 21st, 1989 (CONGRESS, 2009). By that

time, approximately 21,091 tons of toxic waste had entered Chile. The collection point of the waste

became known as site F (sitio F ). The area was located northeast of downtown Arica, which at that

point, was outside the city limits. PROMEL rented this site from the Bureau of Land Management

(Ministerio de Bienes Nacionales). The area was initially secured by a concrete perimeter and was

marked with warning signs indicating the presence of hazardous waste.

    In December 1993, PROMEL requested permission to abandon the mineral waste.4 The com-
    3
      The complete process would have been involved cleaning the mineral wastes from arsenic, then converting the
resulting material into trioxide and, ﬁnally, extracting gold.
    4
      The request was directed to the National Border Agency. This agency owned the wastes after PROMEL decided
not to pay the taxes on the importation.



                                                       3
pany argued that the high costs of inputs, the constant ﬂuctuation of metal prices in international

markets (particularly of cooper and silver), and the exchange rate policy made the originally prof-

itable project nonviable.

    The Housing Projects. During the 1980s the city of Arica faced an increasing demand for

government subsidized housing. In 1985 the central government launched the construction of the

ﬁrst social housing project, which later became the neighborhood of Los Industriales I. It was

located only meters away from site F. It is unknown why Chilean authorities decided to build at

that location, but there was likely a lack of information about the characteristics of the materials

contaminating the area.5 Moreover, even if the local authority (Municipalidad de Arica) had

wanted to stop or prevent the construction, this would have not been possible since the land was

originally outside the city limits (in a non-residential area), and consequently, it was not under its

jurisdiction. The neighborhood’s location outside of the cities jurisdiction had another consequence

on future residents. According to the Chilean legislation, house titles can only be granted by local

governments. Therefore, since the housing projects were originally outside the city limits, the new

home-owners did not receive oﬃcial titles for several years. Only after 1996, once the city limits

were extended, were house titles granted. As we discuss below, this prevented houses from being

sold.

    The construction of Los Industriales I (1985) was followed by Los Industriales II and III (1990),

Los Industriales IV (1991) and Cerro Chuño I-VII (between 1993 and 1996). Table 1 presents the

exact date of completion for each project. Figures 1 and 2 present satellite photographs of the area

before and after the construction of the housing projects. They clearly illustrate the proximity

of the neighborhoods to site F. Thus, hundreds of families were exposed, many for more than a

decade, to the toxic waste.

    Government Responses, Evaluation of Consequences and Compensations. In Decem-

ber of 1996, after multiple complains from the local residents, the Health Service of Arica began a

series of actions aimed at removing the toxic waste from site F. In 1997 the department of chemistry

at the University of Tarapaca (a local university) carried out the ﬁrst scientiﬁc study of the levels

of pollution in Arica. The results documented the presence of high concentrations of toxic minerals
   5
     It is worth noting that the original decision was made by the central government, speciﬁcally by the Chilean
Department of Housing (Ministerio de Vivienda y Urbanismo).




                                                       4
in the city.6 These were conﬁrmed by a second study conducted in the same year, prepared by

the National Service of Geology and Mining (Servicio Nacional de Minerı́a y Geologı́a, SERNA-

GEOMIN). The second study included a detailed analysis of the concentration of material in site

F ’s stockpiles. The analysis concluded that the material was approximately 10% of arsenic, 4.4%

lead, 2.1% zinc, 1.5% copper, and also contained other heavy metals such as mercury, antimony,

bismuth, and tin.

    Given this evidence, the Chilean government declared the situation to be an “environmental

health emergency.” The re-location of the waste began in January of 1998, under the supervision of

the Arica Department of Environmental Protection, and with the approval of the local government.7

    Between July 14th and September 8th of 2000, the Chilean Ministry of Health carried out a

third study, “Lead in Cerro Chuño and Los Industriales” (CONAMA, 2009). In this study, blood

samples were taken from about 5000 residents. The tests showed high concentrations for 579 of

the residents. As a result of these studies, residents of Cerro Chuño and Los Industriales initiated

legal actions against PROMEL and the Arica Health Service, demanding ﬁnancial compensation.

In 2007, the Supreme Court upheld the claims, and decided on a compensation of 8 million pesos

(approximately USD 16,000) per claim (Suprema, 2007).

    Between August of 2008 and October of 2009, the National Environmental Commission (Comisión

Nacional de Medio Ambiente, CONAMA) carried out a new environmental study speciﬁcally de-

signed to identify sources of pollution in the city.8 The results demonstrate the presence of three

diﬀerent sources of pollution: site F, the Arica-La Paz Line Railroad and a set of 26 points whose

lead levels exceeded the international standard of 400 milligrams of lead per kilogram of soil anal-

ysis (400mg/Kg).9 Site F was identiﬁed as the oldest source of lead contamination in Arica. The

study also showed that both the rail line and the 26 points were associated with contemporary
    6
      The study was motivated by the increasing complains of the residents of Cerro Chuño and Los Industriales, and
it had the support of the Peace and Justice Service of Chile (Servicio de Paz y Justicia de Chile, SERPAJ).
    7
      Some of the actions outlined in this plan were materialized through the re-location of the toxic wastes to Quebrada
Encantada, an area located northeast, almost straight ahead, to site F. Figures 1 and 2 show the location site F,
Cerro Chuño, Los Industriales, and Quebrada Encantada. Notice that the distance between houses located at the
eastern edge of Cerro Chuño and the new point of collection of toxic waste is approximately 600 meters (or 0.375
miles).
    8
      In order to establish the chemical composition of soil and subsoil of the city of Arica, the study followed a
sampling scheme that considered the division of the city in 40 quadrants. For each quadrant, an average of 11
random samples were taken in 3 levels (surface, 15 cm and 30 cm below surface).
    9
      The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) established a risk value of 400mg/Kg lead to sites where children
are active (Soil Hazard Standard for Children Play’s Area, SHSCPA).

sources of contamination (Agriquem, 2009). Below we examine the relative importance of each of

these sources of pollution in our sample.

     Finally, and using as an input the report by CONAMA, the Department of Health established

a multidisciplinary committee to investigate the eﬀects of metal residue contamination in Arica

and to develop policies leading to the relocation of the aﬀected families. This committee focused

on three highly contaminated areas: the harbor area (one of the 26 locations originally identiﬁed

by CONAMA), Maestranza (site associated with the Arica-La Paz railroad system) and site F.

They also considered two airstreams contributing to the dispersion of pollutants: south-southwest

(predominant) and northeast. They found lead (and arsenic) not only in the air, but also Arica’s

drinking water. Among the main policy initiatives resulting from this analysis was the relocation

of approximately 1,880 housing sites adjacent to site F and the development of special educational

programs for the students attending schools in the aﬀected areas.10



3        Literature Review

The toxicological eﬀects of lead on human health have been widely documented in the literature.

Depending on the dose and length of exposure, lead is associated with neurological, cardiovascular,

kidney and liver damage, and can even cause death in very high concentrations (ATDSR, 2007).

Although these eﬀects date back to ancient times,11 only in the last few decades has chronic

exposure to lead raised greater concerns worldwide. These concerns are reﬂected in recent decision

to amend the international standards of concentrations of lead in gasoline, paints, soil and air of

urban areas, all of which are considered major sources of lead exposure (Mielke and Reagan, 1998;

Mielke, 2002).

     Notwithstanding the sustained reduction of lead levels in the population worldwide, the eﬀects

of lead on the deterioration of cognitive and behavioral functions, especially in children, is the main

focus of research in a number of developed countries (Koller et al., 2004). Relative to adults, children

are more susceptible to the toxicological eﬀects of lead for (at least) three reasons. First, small

children are more likely to put contaminated items (or any items) in their mouths. This increases the
    10
      For details see The Intervention in Areas with presence of polymetallic in Arica: A Master Plan (CONAMA,
2009). During 2010 and 2011, the Ministry of Housing granted 898 housing subsidies and approved the construction
of two housing projects to relocate 230 families of Cerro Chuño and Los Industriales (GORE, 2011).

      Possibly explaining even the fall of the Roman Empire (Lewis, 1985)

likelihood of ingesting lead from the environment via powder or through wall drawings (Lanphear

et al., 2002; Tchernitchin et al., 2005; ATDSR, 2007). Second, children’s digestive systems also have

a higher degree of lead absorption (Ziegler et al., 1978; Tchernitchin et al., 2005; ATDSR, 2007).

Thus, for a given amount of exposure young children are more likely to absorb harmful quantities.

Finally, children’s developing nervous systems increase their vulnerability to lead exposure because

some functions of hormonal receptors, hormones, and neurotransmitters are altered, preventing

the generation of beneﬁcial substances for the organism (Lidsky and Schneider, 2003; Tchernitchin

et al., 2005).

   The eﬀects of prolonged exposure to lead, especially when occurring at a young age, are irre-

versible. They can cause delay in bone growth, decreased intelligence and memory, and behavioral

changes. Needleman et al. (1979) and Banks et al. (1997) document a negative relationship between

blood lead levels and child IQ. Canﬁeld et al. (2003) supports this relationship and also states that

the deterioration of cognitive function of children could be manifested even under minimal exposure

(below the threshold of 10μg/dL set by CDC). Using longitudinal data, Bellinger et al. (1992) ﬁnd

that low-level lead exposure at age 24 months is associated with a decrease of 5.8 points in the

WISC-R Full Scale IQ test12 , 8.9 points in K-TEA Battery Composite13 and signiﬁcant reductions

in intellectual performance at age 10 (considering an increase of 10μg/dL). Wasserman et al. (2000)

show that, depending on whether the exposure to lead occurs in the pre- or post-natal period, the

decline in IQ can vary within the range of 1.07 to 2.82 points. Lanphear et al. (2000) document that

even after controlling for gender, parental education and children’s health status, there is strong

evidence supporting the inverse relationship between levels of lead in blood and four scores associ-

ated with cognitive functioning tests. They estimate that for every extra micrograms per deciliter

of blood of lead concentration, math and language scores decrease by 0.7 and 1 points, respectively.

intelligence test for children (Wechsler, 1974).

Table A.1 in the appendix presents the eﬀects of lead on IQ documented in the literature.                       14,15,16


    The literature also examines the eﬀects of lead exposure on violent behavior and mortality.

Wolpaw (2007), using a reduction of the lead content in gasoline introduced by the United States

Clean Air Act of 1970, studies the relationship between lead exposure and crime. Her results indi-

cate a signiﬁcant relationship between lead exposure during childhood and violent crime behavior

later in life. The estimates show that the elasticity of violent crime and childhood lead exposure is

approximately 0.8. This suggests that the reduction in lead exposure between 1970 and 1980 ac-

counts for more than the 50% of the decrease in crime during 1990s (1992-2002). Clay et al. (2006)

analyze the eﬀect of lead water pipes on child mortality. Their results suggest that approximately

13 infants per 1,000 children died in 1900 as a consequence of lead pipes. This is staggering when

compared to the 5.7 deaths per 1,000 children from all causes in 2000. Using variations in water

composition of diﬀerent types of water delivery system across cities, Clay et al. (2010) extend their

previous analysis to study the eﬀect of water-born lead exposure on child mortality and worker pro-

ductivity between 1900 and 1920. Exploiting the chemical relationship between water lead content

in pipes and its level of acidity (measured by the water’s pH), the authors ﬁnd that an increase in

pH from 6.7 to 7.5 was responsible for a decrease of 12.43% in infant mortality between 1900 and

1920 in cities with lead pipes. They also ﬁnd that manufacturing workers living in cities with lead

pipes have a lower salary and suggest this was caused by the lower productivity resulting from lead

exposure.

    Tchernitchin et al. (2005) review the main sources of human exposure to lead in Chile. The

study identiﬁes gasoline and lead-based paint as the most common sources of lead exposure. It also

identiﬁes the cities of Arica and Antofagasta as examples of cities with high levels of lead contam-

ination. The study also reviews two previous small-scale studies examining the concentrations of

lead in the blood of children exposed to pollution in Arica. The ﬁrst study analyzes the results of 32
   14
      In adults, the eﬀects of exposure to lead may be partially reversible after removal of the source of contamination,
decreasing levels of blood lead and after application of chelation treatments (Tchernitchin et al., 2005).
   15
      There is broad consensus on the eﬀects of lead at high concentrations. However, the eﬀects at low exposures
are still subject of debate (Bellinger et al., 1992; Lanphear et al., 2000). Kaufman (2001) review a series of articles
studying the relationship between low levels of blood lead and decreased IQ. The main criticisms are that there is
no adequate control for variables that could inﬂuence a child’s IQ (household socioeconomic status, parenting skills,
childhood diseases, parental IQ, among others), and that the evidence usually examines only the most extreme cases
omitting intermediate cases. According to Kaufman (2001), due to these considerations, the link between low-level
lead concentrations and IQ must be assessed with caution.

blood samples collected in 1998 from children with residences in Cerro Chuño and Los Industriales

(located within 200 meters of site F ). Nine samples from children living in Villa Santa Marı́a were

initially used as control group (this village is located approximately 1.7 kilometers from site F ).

However, the results showed high levels of lead in all three neighborhoods, potentially as a result

of the small sample size in the control areas. A second study extended the original sample. In this

second study, children living in Pampa Nueva (a village located 4 kilometers from site F ) were

chosen as a control group. In addition to the blood sample tests, the study included hair samples

and data on tests of motor responses to visual stimulus. The results conﬁrmed the high levels

of lead found in 1998 and also documented poor motor responses to visual stimulus even among

children with levels of lead below 10μg/dL.17



4        The data

In order to estimate the eﬀect of early lead exposure on academic achievement we use several

sources of information.

     Blood samples. We use data from the study “Lead in Cerro Chuño and Los Industriales”

(LCCI), carried out by the Chilean Ministry of Health in 2000 to get blood lead level concentrations.

This study included the collection of 4,990 intravenous blood tests from local residents: 3,240

children (aged 0 to 15 years) and 1,750 adults (aged 16 or older). The results show that 4,411

people had concentrations of lead of 10 micrograms per deciliter of blood or less, the maximum

level of lead allowed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).18 For the

remaining 579 cases the study found levels exceeding the maximum standards. Of these, 538 were

re-examined by the Institute of Public Health through the leadcare system.19 This new examination

found that a total of 407 samples had concentrations of lead below the CDC standard, while 131
    17
      Coria et al. (2009) study the long-term consequences of lead poisoning on children from another unfortunate
experience of lead exposure that occurred in 1996 in the city of Ñuble (south of Chile). The authors combined
historical records of lead concentration for 77 people 10-25 years old, scores from intelligence tests, and the results
from physical examinations taken place ten years after exposure. The ﬁndings showed that 21% of the sample had
subnormal levels of IQ, and the lowest among individuals whose lead exposure occurred prior to the age of six. In
particular, the psychometric results show lower performance on tests of arithmetic reasoning, which revealed that the
lead was compromising frontal lobe functions.
   18
      In the absence of substantial changes in lead exposure blood lead levels in adults are stable and for their
environmental monitoring a single blood lead concentration is an excellent biological indicator (Delves et al., 1984).
   19
      The ﬁnal report indicated that the remaining 41 individuals were contacted multiple times (including attempts
via home visits), but they did not attended the examination.




                                                          9
had levels at or above the standard (120 were children between ages 0 to 15 years). Importantly,

the data contains information on each individual’s street address. This allows us to link lead

levels to distance to site F. Figure 3 presents the distributions of lead levels in blood for the two

examinations.20

    Test scores. We use data from two national standardized tests: the SIMCE (Sistema de

Medición de la Calidad de la Educación) and the Chilean college admission tests or PSU (Prueba

de Selección Universitaria).

    The SIMCE (language and math) tests are aimed at measuring the quality of teaching and

the degree of student learning at various educational levels in Chile. The tests are taken annually

by students enrolled in 4th, 8th, and 10th grade.21 The system started in 1988 so we are able

to identify schools near site F at the time the chemical waste was brought to the country. As

discussed below, this allows us to analyze test scores before and after students were exposed to lead

pollution from site F (fourth graders in 1988 were born in 1978 or 1979). Unfortunately, from 1988

to 1997 the SIMCE data is available at the school level only. This is not the case for the data from

the college admission test system (PSU). Therefore, we perform our main analysis using individual

level data from the 2008 college admission system.

    The 2008 PSU data contain information on individual characteristics (age, gender), individual-

level math and language test scores, family background variables (mother’s and father’s education,

family income, mother or father absence), high school-level information (private, voucher or public),

and residential address. A large proportion of the sample has just graduated from high school (18

year old on average). For this group we gather information from the 2004 SIMCE test scores

when they were enrolled in 8th grade. This allows us to observe multiple measures of academic

achievement, and also to identify each individual’s place of residence (municipality) in 2004 and

2008.22 We restrict our main analysis to the sample of individuals who reported living in Arica in

both years.

    Descriptive statistics for this sample are presented in Table 2. We use the data from those not
   20
      Table A.2 in appendix presents the descriptive statistics of this sample.
   21
      Since 2006, SIMCE tests 4th graders and alternates between 8th and 10th graders every other year.
   22
      From the 2004 SIMCE data we extract the exact location of individual’s high school. We use this information to
analyze the impact of pollution on test scores as a function of the distance from site F to high schools. Unfortunately,
the information on individual’s place of residence is only available in 2008 PSU.

living in Arica in either 2004 or 2008 to perform robustness checks.23

    Labor market outcomes. Lastly, we use administrative records from the Chilean Unemploy-

ment Insurance (UI) system to analyze the impact of pollution on adult earnings. The UI data

contain information on labor income and individual labor market histories in the formal sector

(approximately 80% of the employment in the country) on a monthly basis since November 2002.

We merge individual-level data on earnings with PSU test scores. As described below, we use

the estimated relationship between earnings and PSU scores to compute the appropriate monetary

compensation for the irreversible health damage and loss of productivity associated with early lead

exposure. Given that a sizable fraction of individuals who took the PSU in 2008 do not show up in

the UI system - many are still enrolled in tertiary institutions- we use information from the 2004

PSU and the 2010-2011 UI data. Hence, most individuals enrolled at a higher education institutions

in 2004 were working in 2011, and the information about their wages is reported in the UI data.

We choose the 2004 PSU because the 2004 version is the ﬁrst year of the PSU. This ensures the

comparability of our results.

    Table 3 presents summary statistics for the sample of individuals who took the PSU in 2004

and for whom we have data on monthly earnings between 2010 and 2011.



5     Empirical Analysis

5.1    Identifying Sources of Pollution

Over the last 20 years the population of Arica has been exposed to multiple sources of pollution.

In order to identify the main source of pollution in the city, we ﬁrst evaluate the importance of all

of the sources of pollution originally identiﬁed by CONAMA: site F, Arica-La Paz line railroad and

a set of 26 points whose lead levels exceeded the international standard of 400 milligrams of lead

per kilogram of soil (400mg/Kg) (see CONAMA, 2009, for further details). Since current levels

of lead at each location are not available, we establish their relative importance by analyzing the

relationship between the lead levels in blood from the sample of residents of Cerro Chuño and Los
   23
      The sample of students in both 2004 SIMCE and 2008 PSU datasets are not exactly the same. We do not
observe PSU scores for those who took the SIMCE in 2004 and did not take the PSU in 2008. Therefore, we do not
observe the PSU scores nor the place of residence in 2008 for those who retained a course during high school, dropped
out of high school or for those high school graduates who opted to not take the PSU in 2008. The 2004 SIMCE data
contains 272,198 observations whereas the 2008 PSU contains information for 240,682 high school graduates.



                                                         11
Industriales and the distance between their places of residence and the diﬀerent locations.24 As

previously explained, the original sample of blood tests was collected in 2000 from 4,990 residents

of Cerro Chuño and Los Industriales (Servicio de Salud de Arica, 2001). We focus our analysis

on the 579 individuals whose blood lead levels exceeded the risk threshold deﬁned by the CDC

(10μg/dL). As previously explained, for them we have data from two diﬀerent independent blood

lead level measures.

    Using this data, we evaluate which of the three sources of lead exposure is most highly correlated

with the blood lead levels observed among individuals living in Cerro Chuño and Los Industriales

by 2000. We estimate linear regression models of individual’s blood lead levels on (ln) distance

from home to each of the three sources of contamination.25 We include as additional controls in

these regressions gender and age (at time of testing). Finally, in order to reduce the measurement

error we use the average blood lead level of the two samples.26

    Thus, for each of the sources of pollution we estimate a regression model of the form:


                         P bi = α0 + α1 ln Dhome,i + α2 Genderi + α3 Agei + ηi ,                                  (1)


where P bi is the blood lead level associated with individual i (measured in micrograms per deciliter

of blood, μg/dL), Dhome,i is the distance between individual’s i place of residence and the location

of the respective contaminated area in Arica.

    Table 4 presents the estimated coeﬃcients for our measures of exposure to lead and the three
   24
      We follow (Sinnott, 1984) and generate the distance between two locations A and B as follows. Let A and B
be two diﬀerent locations, with associated latitudes and longitudes (lat(A),lon(A)) and (lat(B),lon(B)), respectively.
We compute the distance between A and B (d(A, B)) from:
                                               2                                                     2
                           sin(lat(B) − lat(A))                                       (lon(B) − lon(A))
           τ (A, B) =                              + cos(lat(A)) × cos(lat(B)) × sin
                                    2                                                         2
                                                       
           d(A, B) = 6367 × (2 × arctan( τ (A, B), 1 − τ (A, B)))

where d(A, B) is expressed in kilometers, arctan(x, y) is the arctangent of x/y, and 6,367 is the radius of the earth
expressed in kilometers.
   25
      Distances were obtained as follows. We ﬁrst deﬁne 33 centroids of pollution covering the full extent of the
railway. Similarly, we deﬁne 26 points of contamination in soil. The distance from household to railway is deﬁned as
the minimum distance between household and the 33 centroids. Likewise, distance from household to leaded soil is
calculated as the minimum distance of each household to any of the 26 centroids. In the case of site F, we consider
Chapiquiña 3066 as reference address. This corresponds to the place rented by PROMEL to carry out the tasks of
extracting gold and silver from the chemical wastes. GoogleEarth did not recognize some of the addresses in the data
(mostly rural), and the sample size was reduced to 390 tests.
   26
      Our results are robust to the use of either sample (ISP or SERMUS). Results are available from the authors
upon request.




                                                         12
measures of distances.27 The results presented in column (1) indicate a signiﬁcant correlation be-

tween concentration of lead in blood and distance to site F. Speciﬁcally, we estimate that increasing

the distance in one kilometer (0.6 miles), from 0.16 to 1.16 kilometers to site F, would imply a

reduction of 1.26 micrograms of lead per deciliter of blood (or 0.413 standard deviation).28 Thus,

the evidence conﬁrms the association between distance to site F and blood lead levels. As columns

(2) and (3) show, the coeﬃcients associated with distances to the railway and leaded soil sites have

the opposite sign from expected and they are not signiﬁcant.

    The results are conclusive in pointing to site F as the main source of lead pollution in the city

of Arica. Consequently, we focus our analysis on this source.


5.2    Distance to Site F and Academic Achievement

We ﬁrst analyze school-level data for diﬀerent years from SIMCE data sets. Figure 4 presents

the (standardized) school-level average test scores from 4th graders enrolled in schools located less

than 1.5 kilometers from site F, in schools located between 1.5 and 3 kilometers from site F, and in

schools located 3 or more kilometers away from site F. We present the evolution of the test scores

from 1988 to 2010.

    The results show a clear pattern. At the time the chemical waste arrived to the area (1988),

schools near site F had a better performance than those located between 1.5 and 3 kilometers from

the site. Just four years after the arrival of the material, average test scores for those schools start

reducing dramatically, potentially because of the prolonged exposure to lead. Table 5 conﬁrms

these ﬁndings. Here we show raw school-level averages on math and language PSU tests as a

function of each school’s distance to site F for the period 1988-2010. As in the previous ﬁgure, the

evidence does not suggest any relationship between distance from the school to site F and scores

between 1988 and 1992. However, we ﬁnd that after 1992 schools located closer to site F (i.e at

less than 1 kilometer) have lower math and language test scores than schools located further away
   27
      To avoid inﬂuential observations, we restrict our sample to those individuals whose blood lead levels were lower
than the 99th percentile using Cook’s distance (Cook, 1979).
   28
      The non-linear association between P bi and Dhome,i implies that the magnitudes of the eﬀects depend on the
original distance to site F. For example, increasing the distance from 0.66 to 1.66 kilometers to site F would imply a
reduction of 0.587 micrograms of lead per deciliter of blood (or 0.193 standard deviation). Likewise, increasing the
distance from 1.3 to 2.3 kilometers would imply a reduction of 0.363 micrograms of lead per deciliter of blood (or
0.119 standard deviation).




                                                         13
from the site.29,30 However, these strong patterns are obtained using aggregate data and without

controlling for confounding factors. We utilize individual level data from PSU to deal with these

potential concerns.31

    Let P SUi denote individual’s i PSU test score and Dhome,i the distance between student’s place

of residence and site F. We estimate the following model:


              P SUi = γ0 + γ1 ln Dhome,i + γ2 Age + γ3 Gender + γXi + γ5 Zschool,i + ηi ,                            (2)


where Xi represents a set of individual-speciﬁc exogenous controls (family background, and variables

controlling for the direction of wind), Zschool,i is a vector of variables describing the characteristics of

the high school from which the individual graduated from, and ηi is an idiosyncratic component.32

Table 6 presents the results from estimating equation (2) for math and reading PSU test scores under

diﬀerent speciﬁcations.33 The evidence shows that, even after controlling for family background,

high school characteristics, and geographic factors, there is a strong relationship between PSU scores

and distance from student’s place of residence to site F. Our preferred speciﬁcations (columns (5)

and (6), imply that increasing the distance one kilometer (starting at 100 meters from the site)

would increase language and math test scores in approximately 29.55 (0.31 standard deviations) and

21.06 (0.22 standard deviations) points, respectively. The nonlinear model implies decreasing eﬀects

as we move away from the pollution site. These magnitudes are robust to diﬀerent speciﬁcations.34

The larger eﬀects for language when compared to math suggest that lead exposure might have a

higher negative impact on brain functions associated with language skills than arithmetic and math

skills.35
   29
      We use the school-level data on test scores (Tj (t)) and distance from school to site F (Distj ), to estimate the
model Tj (t) = α(t) + β ln Distj + νj (t), where t denotes year. We obtain β̂=0.19 (t=2.21). The results from the
alternative model Tj (t) = α(t) + β0 ln Distj + β1 ln Distj × Dt>1996 + νj (t), where Dt>1996 is a dummy variable that
                                                           ˆ 0 =-0.008 (t=-0.06) and beta
takes a value of one if t is larger than 1996, delivers beta                            ˆ 1 =0.36 (t=2.04). These results
conﬁrm the patterns observed in Figure 4 and Table 5.
   30
      Since 1999 SIMCE test scores changed their scales. This explain the diﬀerence in levels between 1988-1996 and
1999-2010.
   31
      Furthermore, since the LCCI data does not contain information on the school attended, we could not implement
our empirical strategy using only school-level data.
   32
      Currie and Walker (2011) use a similar reduced form speciﬁcation to study the link between health outcomes
and distance to a source of pollution.
   33
      In order to restrict our analysis to individuals living in Arica, we restrict the PSU sample to those individuals
reporting a home street address at most four kilometers away from the site F. This is consistent with the maximum
distance from site F to the edge of the city.
   34
      These results are available upon request from the authors.
   35
      An obvious concern regarding the previous regression model is that our measure of distance Dhome,i might



                                                           14
5.3    Blood levels and academic achievement

We now assess the impact of blood lead levels on individual test scores. Our identiﬁcation strategy

is similar to the Two Sample Instrumental Variables (TSIV) approach developed by Angrist and

Krueger (1992). Speciﬁcally, consider the following system of equations:


                        P SUi = β0 + β1 P bi + β2 Xi + β3 Zschool,i + εi ,                                          (3)

                           P bi = α0 + α1 ln Dhome,i + α2 Agei + α3 Genderi + ηi .                                  (4)


We interpret equation (3) as the structural equation describing the eﬀect of blood lead levels, P bi ,

on individual’s test scores, P SUi , whereas equation (4) represents our model for blood lead levels

as a function of distance to the source of pollution. As discussed above, we can use the LCCI data

to estimate equation (4). These results were reported in Table 4. However, we do not have blood

lead levels (P bi ) and test scores (P SUi ) for the same sample of individuals, so equation (3) cannot

be estimated directly. This is where TSIV strategy is useful. By substituting expression (4) into

(3) we can derive the reduce form equation (2), linking PSU scores to distance to site F. In this

context, it is straightforward to show that γ1 in equation (2) is equal to (β1 × α1 ). Thus, and given

that the model is exactly identiﬁed, we can estimate β1 from equations (2) and (4) as:

                                                                  γ̂1
                                                 β̂1,T SIV    =       .
                                                                  α̂1

    By combining the results from equations (2) (reduced form model) and (4) (ﬁrst stage), we can

obtain the (structural) eﬀect of lead exposure on academic achievement.36 We obtain standard

errors using the Delta Method.37
be endogenously determined. In principle, families could have decided to live far from the site F depending on
their characteristics, leading to biased estimates for the eﬀect of distance on test scores. In order to investigate
the endogeneity of Dhome,i , we empirically investigate the association between our distance variable and family
background variables. Table A.3 presents the results. We ﬁnd that parental education is positively correlated with
distance from home to site F, so our results suggest that more educated parents have avoided living close to site F.
In the estimation of equation 2 we account for this by including parental education in the set of controls.
   36
      Our non-linear speciﬁcations are motivated by the estimation of non- and semi-parametric models of the rela-
tionship between PSU test scores and distance from place of residence to site F. Figures A.1 and A.2 in the appendix
present the results for math and language scores, respectively. The results suggest that the natural logarithm of the
distance variable provides a good description of the data. Fortunately, this speciﬁcation also allows us to directly
implement the TSIV strategy.
   37
      Assuming that cov(γ̂1 , α̂1 ) = 0, the variance of β̂T SIV is giving by the following expression: V ar(β̂T SIV ) =
V ar(γ̂1 )/α̂12 + (γ̂12 /α̂14 ) × V ar(α̂1 ).



                                                             15
    Table 7 presents the estimated eﬀect of lead blood level on math and language test scores.

The estimated β̂1,T SIV implies a reduction of 13.81 (or 0.15 standard deviations) points for one

microgram of lead per deciliter of blood for math and 19.37 (or 0.21 standard deviations) points

for one microgram of lead per deciliter of blood for language. Overall our results suggest negative

and large eﬀects of proximity to the pollution site on test scores.

    Although we ﬁnd signiﬁcant results for γ̂1 and α̂1 , as expected, we lose power when computing

the ratio. Nevertheless, we obtain signiﬁcant results (at the 10% percent level) in the case of

language test scores. This ﬁnding is in line with the results for the eﬀect of lead on verbal IQ as

reported in Needleman et al. (1979).38

    Caveats. A natural threat to our identiﬁcation strategy is the possibility of endogenous mi-

gration. Once alerted to the presence of the chemical waste, families could have decided to move

away from the vicinity of site F and even to out-migrate from the city. Other related threat is

endogenous sorting of educated parents that may decide to change their kids from schools near

site F to others away from it. In what follows, we demonstrate that these might not be serious

concerns.

    Table 8 presents the proportion of parents with college education with children enrolled in

schools in Arica. The numbers are obtained from the SIMCE records. We present these numbers

by school distance to site F for 1989, 1999 and 2008. The proportion of parents with college

education for schools located 1.5 kilometer or less from site F is very stable in almost 20 years,

suggesting that endogenous migration as a function of parental education did not occur during the

period. On the other hand, we observe a sharp increase in the fraction of college educated parents

with kids enrolled in schools located between 1.5 and 3 kilometers from the site. However, most
                                                               39   For schools located more than 3 kilometers
of the increase can be explained by a single school.

away from site F there is a less pronounced increase which agrees with the national trend during
   38
      Also, we perform linear regression models to study the eﬀect of the school’s proximity to site F on the academic
achievement of the students of Arica using SIMCE scores between 2003 and 2006. As we previously described, in
SIMCE we only have the distance from schools to site F. Tables A.4 and A.5 in the appendix present descriptive
statistics of SIMCE 2003-2006 scores and the results from the linear regression models, respectively. The ﬁnding
conﬁrm our main results. Even after controlling for gender, parental education, school characteristics, we obtain
positive eﬀects from (natural logarithm) distance between the school and site F on school-level math and language
test scores.
   39
      Colegio Arica College explains most of the increase in parental education between 1999 and 2008. If we exclude
this school from this calculation, the distribution of parents with college education with children enrolled in schools
between 1.5 and 3 kilometers from site F increases by 1.3 percentage point (instead of 10) during the period.




                                                          16
the period. These results suggest endogenous migrations might not be a serious threat to our

identiﬁcation strategy.

    Figure 5 presents further evidence along these lines. It shows the trends of the distributions of

enrollment by school distance to site F for fourth graders between 1988 y 2008 in Arica. Again, we

observe that the proportions are stable over time. Figure A.3 in the appendix presents similar trends

but for the distributions of elementary schools. The results conﬁrm the stability of enrollment.

    These results are consistent with the literature documenting little regional migration in Chile.

Soto and Torche (2004) show that on average the regional migration rate for the 1965-2000 period

was 0.6% per year, which is especially low considering the existence of factors that could promote

greater regional movements (homogenous population across regions and high rates of urbanization).

Also, data from the CASEN 2006 survey40 shows that 86.17% of respondents aged 17 or younger

who lived in Arica reported that they were born in Arica. Likewise, among the same individuals,

96% reported they were living in Arica in 2002. On the other hand, the literature shows that resi-

dential mobility is largely explained by schooling and employment decisions (Leslie and Richardson,

1961). For Chile, Ruiz-Tagle and Sehnbruch (2009) estimate that the average job spell for a formal

worker is about 5 years. Therefore, if we believe that residential mobility is related to employment

opportunities, on average, families should live in the same place for at least 5 years, providing extra

support for our approach.

    Institutional features of the social housing system also support our empirical strategy. Specif-

ically, the 18th article of the Supreme Decree on “The Regulation on Social Housings” (MINVU,

1990), establishes that houses in Cerro Chuño and Los Industriales could not be sold before 5 years

after the inscription date of the house in the registry of deeds (Conservador de Bienes Raı́ces). As

mentioned in Section 2, since the housing projects were originally outside the city limits, the new

home-owners did not receive oﬃcial titles for several years. In fact, only after 1996, once the city

limits were extended, were house titles granted.41 Therefore, we can assume that the families and

their children were exposed to lead for a long period of time, although the possibility remains that

they could have rented their houses and moved to other places in order to avoid lead contamination.
  40
      CASEN (Socioeconomic Characterization Survey) 2006 corresponds to a cross-sectional household survey repre-
sentative of the population in 2006.
   41
      The law establishes that if the owners want to sell the house before the mandatory deadline, they have to
request authorization from the Housing Service (Servicio de Vivienda y Urbanismo, SERVIU). This rule increases
the probability that those families lived for at least 5 years near the toxic waste.

    Therefore, even though we cannot rule it out, endogenous migration does not seem to pose a

serious threat to our identiﬁcation strategy. Nevertheless, we control for it by analyzing residents

of Arica in 2004 and 2008. In this context, our analysis suggests that four years of lead exposure

is enough time to observe its long-term eﬀects on academic performance, and potentially, they can

be extrapolated to diﬀerent setups.


5.4     Blood lead levels and earnings: Estimating compensations

The literature documenting the monetary consequences of lead exposure at the individual level is

scarce. Landrigan et al. (2002) quantify the IQ loss in children exposed to lead and link this loss

to lower revenues for future generations.42 We extend this literature by documenting the eﬀects of

early lead exposure on future earnings at a more disaggregate level.

    After obtaining the eﬀect of blood lead level on PSU scores for students in Arica, we can

compute the eﬀect on earnings by linking labor market outcomes and PSU scores for a diﬀerent but

similar sample. This is a signiﬁcant contribution to the public policies associated with determining

compensation for the serious (and irreversible) damage to the health of residents of Cerro Chuño

and Los Industriales. It also provides a comparison to the actual monetary compensations paid to

a fraction of the population over the past few years. In 2007 the Supreme Court ruled that there

should be a compensation payment of CLP 8 million (USD 16,000) per claimant made by the Arica

Health Service to 365 residents of Cerro Chuño and Los Industriales (Suprema, 2007).

    We use information on monthly earnings from the Unemployment Insurance Database (UI) and

PSU scores to estimate the following Mincer-type regression model:


                          ln wi = β0 + β1 P SUi,math + β2 P SUi,lang + β3 Qi + i ,                                (5)


where wi corresponds to the average monthly wage obtained by individual i between 2010 and
   42
     Landrigan et al. (2002) estimate the annual costs of the incidence, prevalence, mortality and pediatric assistance
produced by environmental pollution on the health of American children. Their results show that the annual costs
because of children lead poisoning in the U.S. correspond to USD 43.4 billion, a ﬁgure higher than the estimated
annual cost of asthma (USD 2 billion), cancer (USD 0.3 billion) and mental disability (USD 9.2 billion). Muennig
and Bao (2009), extends the estimated costs of lead exposure in children in New Jersey, including special education
costs, direct medical costs associated with treatment and hospitalization, social costs for juvenile and adult crime
and dropout graduate rates. The results indicate that if blood lead levels in a single cohort of children between 0 and
6 years were reduced to less than 1 microgram per deciliter of blood, the contribution to the society of New Jersey
would be at least USD 27 billion.



                                                          18
2011 and P SUi,j denotes his 2004 PSU test scores (j={math, language}).43 We also include a

vector of observable characteristics, Qi , which include gender, age, age squared, parent education,

high-school characteristics and regional dummies. Table 9 presents our results. We ﬁnd positive

and signiﬁcant eﬀects of math and language scores on monthly earnings. Our estimates suggest

that each additional point in math test score increases earnings approximately by 0.17 percent. In

the case of language scores, the eﬀect is 0.01 percent.

    In order to provide a better understanding of the magnitudes of these eﬀects, we compute

the partial derivative of monthly earnings (in levels) with respect to PSU scores.44 Our results,

presented in Table 10, indicate that one extra point on the PSU increases monthly earnings by 745

and 60 Chilean pesos (or USD 1.49 and 0.12) for math and language PSU scores, respectively.

    In order to compute the individual-level monetary impact of lead exposure, we combine our

previous results with the marginal eﬀect of lead on PSU test scores. Formally, we compute:

                      ∂W              ∂W       ∂P SUlang      ∂W       ∂P SUmath
                              =              ×           +           ×           .                                   (6)
                      ∂P b         ∂P SUlang     ∂P b      ∂P SUmath      ∂P b

Table 11 presents these partial derivatives obtained using the results in Table 7 (∂P SU /∂P b) and

Table 10 (∂W/∂P SU ). We estimate that for each extra microgram of lead, monthly earnings

decrease by 11,458 Chilean pesos (or USD 22.92). This represents a 2.9% decrease in average

monthly wages (of the average monthly earnings for our sample: 395,447 pesos per month).45

    We extend this analysis to study the eﬀects of proximity to a source of pollution on individual

earnings. In particular, we analyze the eﬀect of the distance from home to site F on average

monthly earnings between 2009 and 2010 using the following expression:

                                                         ∂P SUlang                        ∂P SUmath
                       ∂W
                                           ∂W
                                        ∂P SUlang   ×   ∂ ln(Dhome)
                                                                             ∂W
                                                                          ∂P SUmath   ×   ∂ ln(Dhome)
                                   =                                  +                                 .            (7)
                      ∂Dhome                        D                                 D
   43
       As it was explained in Section 4, we use data for the ﬁrst version of the PSU (2004) linked with UI wage data
because a sizable fraction of students who took the PSU in 2008 are still enrolled in tertiary institutions in 2010-2011
and, thus, not participating in the labor market.
    44
       The marginal eﬀect of an increase on PSU score on the monthly earnings is given by β̂1 × exp(β̂0 + β̂1 P SU¯math +
β̂2 P SU¯lang + β̂3 Q̄ + σ̂ 2 /2), where we evaluate the regressors at the respective sample means.
    45
       We work with a nationwide sample to estimate the parameters for the Mincer equation. For consistency purposes,
we estimate the eﬀects of lead on earnings using the whole sample. We performed the analysis using a subsample
including only Arica ﬁnding very similar results. Indeed, the average monthly wage of the subsample of Arica is CLP
381,938, very close to the national wage.




                                                            19
Using the estimated coeﬃcients from equations (2) and (5) (presented in Tables 6 and 9, respec-

tively), we obtain the eﬀect of an increase of one kilometer in the distance from home to site F for

diﬀerent values of the initial distance. The estimated coeﬃcients of this relationship are presented

in Table 12. Speciﬁcally, the ﬁrst row shows that for each kilometer increase in distance from a

base of 0.1 km, individual monthly earnings increase by US$ 145.75. This corresponds to a 18.4%

increase in monthly earnings. The impact decreases for individuals located far away from site F.

     Finally, we use our results to estimate the losses in terms of lifetime earnings (present discounted

value) due to lead exposure. Using the results presented in Table 11 we simulate the stream of

earnings of an individual aﬀected by lead exposure and compare it with the simulated proﬁle of a

representative individual not exposed to the sources of pollution.46 We ﬁnd a diﬀerence of CLP$

3 million (or US$ 6,000 dollars) for each microgram of lead per deciliter of blood. At an average

of 10 μg/dL in the sample, the mean compensation should have been about 3.8 times the amount

dictated by the Supreme Court in 2005.



6        Robustness Checks

Although we are controlling for a comprehensive set of family background variables in the reduced

form equation, the potential correlation between the residential location decision and unobserved

variables could compromise the validity of distance as an instrument for blood lead levels.

     We attempt to tackle this issue by implementing the following strategy. First, we isolate the

impact of family background, individual and school characteristics on PSU scores using a large

sample of individuals living in areas not aﬀected by lead pollution. More precisely, from a sample

of individuals residing in three provinces not aﬀected by lead pollution (Parinacota, Iquique, and

Tamarugal ), we estimate the following version of our reduced form model:


                    P SUi = γ0 + γ2 Agei + γ3 Genderi + γ4 Xi + γ5 Zschool,i + ηi .                           (8)


The estimated parameters are consistent estimates of the association between the exogenous vari-

ables and PSU scores. Obviously, we do not include γ1 ln Dhome,i since the regression is estimated
    46
    The predicted lifetime proﬁle of annual earnings is generated from Mincer-type regressions estimated using the
UI data. We assumed a discount rate of 4%.



                                                       20
with data from provinces excluding Arica, and thus, far away from site F.

   Second, using the estimated parameters from equation (8) and the sample of individuals exposed
                                                                      ˆ −D , as follows:
to pollution in Arica, we construct a predicted value for the PSU, P SU


                       ˆ −D = γˆ0 + γˆ2 Age + γˆ3 Gender + γˆ4 Xi + γˆ5 Zschool,i .
                    P SU


         ˆ −D = P SU
Thus, P SU         ˆ −D (Age, Gender, X, Z) captures the eﬀect of family background, individual

and school characteristics on PSU. Since, it is constructed from estimated parameters obtained from

a large sample of individuals not exposed to pollution, we avoid the consequences of the potential

biases due to the endogeneity of distance to the site F.
                                                            ˆ −D and distance from home to site
   Finally, we estimate the reduced form model of PSU on P SU

F for the sample of students exposed to lead pollution:


                           P SU                               ˆ −D + ε.
                                   = γ0 + γ1 ln Dhome + γ2 P SU                                   (9)


   Note that if we follow a Constrained Least Squares (CLS) approach, by ﬁxing γ2 , we avoid any

residual correlation between the family background and unobservables determining the PSU test

scores. Additionally, note that by restricting γ2 = 1, under the null hypothesis of no correlation be-

tween family background and distance from home to site F, the coeﬃcient γ1 should be comparable

to the one obtained in Table 6.

   Table 13 presents the results of this exercise. Our ﬁndings are consistent with those of Table

Table 6. For math scores, we ﬁnd a point estimate that is very similar to the eﬀect of distance

on PSU score reported in Table 6 (but with lower statistical power). Similarly, for language test

scores we ﬁnd comparable results to those presented in Table 7 (signiﬁcant at 1% level).

   In Table 14 we perform a sensitivity analysis constraining γ2 at diﬀerent values. In practice,

we vary γ2 from 0.8 to 1.2. Thus, by ﬁxing γ2 and estimating by CLS, we avoid any residual

correlation between family background and unobservables determining PSU score. Interestingly,

even when the family background parameter is set to 1.2, i.e. when the role of family background

is “ampliﬁed”, the estimated eﬀects of distance to site F are consistent with the results presented

in Table 6.

   We also analyze the robustness of our results analyzing the association between distance to site

                                                  21
F and test scores for those individuals who took PSU 2008 in Arica but SIMCE 2004 in another

region and for those who took SIMCE 2004 in Arica but PSU 2008 in another place. In the ﬁrst case

we obtain positive but non-signiﬁcant eﬀects, whereas for the second group we obtain ambiguous

signs and non-signiﬁcant eﬀects. These results are presented in Tables A.7 and A.6 in the appendix.



7    Conclusions

In this paper we estimate the long term eﬀects of early lead exposure on academic performance

and labor market outcomes. We exploit a massive and unfortunate lead intoxication incident

that occurred in the city of Arica in northern Chile. Between 1984 and 1989 the Chilean company

PROMEL imported 20,000 tons of chemical waste to extract gold and silver. Years later, PROMEL

decided not to continue with the project and abandoned the waste in an area known as site F. In

the early 1990s, the neighborhoods of Cerro Chuño and Los Industriales were built a few meters

from site F. The residents of these neighborhoods became exposed to abnormally high levels of

chemical waste.

    We ﬁnd a strong empirical relationship between blood lead levels and student academic perfor-

mance. Speciﬁcally, we ﬁnd that an increase of one microgram of lead per deciliter of blood reduces

math and language scores by 0.15 and 0.21 standard deviations, respectively. These results per-

sist even after controlling for individual and school characteristics. We also show that endogenous

migration is not a serious threat to our identiﬁcation strategy.

    Using administrative data on labor market outcomes, we also investigate the impact of lead

exposure on future earnings. The results suggest that an increase of one microgram of lead per

deciliter of blood results in an average reduction of 2.9% in annual earnings during adulthood.

Comparing outcomes by residential proximity to site F, we ﬁnd that a one kilometer increase in

the distance between home and Site F increases individual monthly earnings by USD 145.75. This

corresponds to a 18.4% increase in monthly earnings.

    Finally, we calculate the eﬀect of lead exposure on the net present value of earnings. Our results

suggest a decrease of approximately USD 6,000 per microgram of lead per deciliter of blood. This

evidence should inform policy makers when determining appropriate compensation for individuals

exposed to events such as the one observed in Arica.

     Notes: The information provided in this table was obtained from documents of Chilean Congress and from a report elaborated by Peace and Justice Service
     (SERPAJ, 1996). Columns (2), (3), and (4) show the construction dates, number of houses built, and houses completion dates. Since the neighborhoods were
     built in areas destined for industrial activities, the Housing Ministry (Ministerio de Vivienda y Urbanismo) did not request the building authorization of the
     neighborhoods to the Municipality. In turn, the Municipality of Arica could not authorize the construction of housings projects due to the fact that areas were
     out of its jurisdiction. As soon as the areas were incorporated into the regulatory plane of the city, the Housing Ministry requested the building authorizations to
     the Municipality in the dates in column (5) and the property titles domain were delivered to the residents. The ﬁnal reception dates and the number of houses
     receptioned by the Municipality are presented in columns (6) and (7), respectively.

    Source: PSU 2008. Notes: Distances are expressed in kilometers. In order to consider the winds currents and the
dispersion of pollutants around the city, we include the variable home located to the east of site F. It is equal to 1 if
the student’s home is located to the east of the site F (main contaminated area) and 0 in otherwise. Parent’s absence
is equal to 1 if the biological or stepfather/stepmother parent does not live with the student. Parental education was
tabulated only if parents were present.

    Notes: All distances are expressed in kilometers. BLLs are measured in micrograms per deciliter of blood
(μg/dL). As we described in the text, we use the average of two independent blood tests taken to residents of Cerro
Chuño and Los Industriales during 2000. One of these samples was taken by Municipal Health Service (SERMUS)
and another, which is the conﬁrmation of these ﬁndings, were performed by the Public Health Institute (ISP). We
present the estimated coeﬃcients of regressions of home distance to the nearest centroid of pollution of each of the
three sources of lead contamination using the average of these two measures of blood lead levels. In this case we
control for inﬂuential observations using Cook’s distance (Cook, 1979). All the numbers in the table are robust to
this procedure. Standard errors in parentheses. *** p<0.01,** p<0.05, * p<0.1.

        Notes: Using the estimated coeﬃcients of the relationship between wages and PSU scores we can obtain the
marginal eﬀect of an increase in language and math PSU scores on the monthly wages of the students who took PSU
in 2004 and for whom we observe their wages in 2010 and 2011. Due the fact that the dependent variable in the
regression estimated in Table 9 is expressed as the natural logarithm of the monthly wages, under the assumption of
                                                                                                ¯ + β̂2 X̄ + σ̂ 2 /2). As we
normality, we can write the marginal eﬀect of an increase in PSU score as β̂1 × exp(β̂0 + β̂1 P SU
discussed in the text, P SU corresponds to the scores obtained in math or language tests, X corresponds to a vector
of observed characteristics (such as gender, age at the moment of which we observe the wages, parental education
and the region in which they took the test). Then, replacing the coeﬃcients presented in Table 9, we ﬁnd that on
average, for each extra point in math PSU scores, the monthly wage increases in 745 CLP (or 1.49 dollars), while in

of 1 microgram of lead per deciliter of bood (1μg/dL) on monthly wages. The ﬁrst row of the table shows these

decrease in CLP 11,458 pesos (or equivalently US 22.92 dollars). Finally, the row (2) shows the marginal eﬀect of

Instead of family background and characteristics, we include the predicted value of the PSU using the parameters
of three northern provinces not aﬀected by lead (Parinacota, Iquique, and Tamarugal), hence these parameters are
consistent and not aﬀected by correlation between unobservables and distance from site F.

    Notes: BLLs are expresed in micrograms per deciliter of blood (μg/dL). All distances are expressed in kilometers.
Male is equal to 1 for male, 0 for female. Blood lead levels correspond to 390 blood tests taken to Cerro Chuño and
Los Industriales residents during 2000. As described in the text, each sample reports two measures: one taken by
Municipal Health Service (SERMUS) and another, which is the conﬁrmation of these ﬁndings made by the Public
Health Institute (ISP). From this data we consider distances beetween his/her home and three sources of pollution:
the site F, Line Railroad Arica-La Paz and a set of 26 points whose lead levels exceeded the EPA’s international
standard for soil (400 miligrams of lead for kilo of soil in analysis). Speciﬁcally, we geo-reference residential addresses
and calculate the minimum distance between home and 33 centroids of pollution covering the full extent of the
railway line and the 26 points of contamination in soil. In the case of site F, we consider Chapiquiña 3066 as
reference direction.

     Source: SIMCE 2003-2006. Notes: Distances are expressed in kilometers. In order to consider the winds currents and the dispersion of pollutants around the city, we
     include the variable school located to the east of site F. It is equal to 1 if the school is located to the east of the site F (main contaminated area) and 0 in otherwise.
     Male is equal to 1 for male, 0 for female. Parent’s absence is equal to 1 if the biological or stepfather/stepmother parent does not live with the student. Parent educa-
     tion was tabulated only if parents were present.

     Source: SIMCE 2003-2006. Notes: Distances are expressed in kilometers. In order to consider the winds currents and the dispersion of pollutants
     around the city, we include the variable school located to the east of site F. It is equal to 1 if the school is located to the east of the site F (main
     contaminated area) and 0 in otherwise. Male is equal to 1 for male, 0 for female. Parent’s absence is equal to 1 if the biological or stepfather
     /stepmother parent does not live with the student. Parent education was tabulated only if parents were present. Standard errors in parentheses.
