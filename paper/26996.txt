Distributing Personal Income: Trends Over Time

JEL No. D31

                                          ABSTRACT

This paper constructs a distribution of Personal Income for the United States (2007-2016) to
investigate the relationship between inequality and macroeconomic growth. We extend a
perspective first presented in Fixler and Johnson (2014) and further developed in Fixler et al.
(2017) and Fixler, Gindelsky, and Johnson (2018, 2019) to develop a national account-based
measure using a decade of publicly available survey, tax, and administrative data. By using
(equivalized) households as the base unit of analysis and focusing on a more inclusive definition
of income than most inequality studies (i.e., including health, transfers, and financial assets), we
improve on existing economic measures of inequality in a meaningful way and bridge the gap
between micro data and macro statistics. We produce a wide set of inequality results over the
period, drawing a comparison with other studies (including Auten and Splinter (2019) and
Piketty, Saez, and Zucman (2018)).

                               BY Dennis Fixler, Marina Gindelsky, and David Johnson 1



      As GDP has continued to grow post-Great Recession, attention has turned to what is

"Beyond GDP" ­ a concept intended to focus on additional measures of economic and social

performance (Stiglitz et al. 2018). Much of the discussion has focused on income distribution.

The inferences one makes necessarily depend on the income measures used; there are a variety

of views about the proper measure. Some like Piketty, Saez and Zucman (PSZ, 2018) and Auten

and Splinter (2019) use Federal Income tax data and focus on individuals. The treatment of the

1986 tax law by the latter significantly affects the results, such that the authors obtain different

conclusions. The Census Bureau produces a household distribution of their money income

concept, based on data collected in the Current Population Survey (CPS).

      In this paper, we extend a perspective first presented in Fixler and Johnson (2014) and

further developed in in Fixler, Gindelsky and Johnson (2018, 2019), and Fixler et al. (2017) that

produces a distribution of Personal Income, a concept based on the National Income and

Product Accounts (NIPA).2 In our view, if there is to be an evaluation of the distribution of

economic growth, such as that measured by the growth in GDP, then it is necessary to have a

concept of income that is based on the same accounting principles as GDP.

      By constructing this measure from publicly available microdata for 2007-2016, we

investigate the relationship between the distribution of aggregate growth and trend in

inequality over a volatile period, which includes the Great Recession. PSZ (2018), Auten and

Splinter (2019) and Zwijneneburg (2019) focused on the top of the income distribution. Our

analysis examines the entire income distribution. We compare our inequality metrics for

equivalized personal income to comparable metrics produced by academics and statisticians.

      This paper uses publicly available survey data, tax records, and administrative data for

2007-2016 to distribute Personal Income. Section I describes the measurement and definition

of income while Section II presents the data and methodology for this exercise. Section III

presents the results and Section IV concludes.


                                                    I. Measuring Income


      As in previous exercises, we first evaluated the source of the gap between the micro and

macro data. Fixler and Johnson (2014) demonstrated that the aggregate level of income is

much lower than the comparable aggregate income in the NIPA. 3 However, there are a few

considerations when using the CPS. First, it is important to assess whether the difference

between CPS totals and NIPA totals is likely due to under-reporting in the CPS or "missing" high-

income individuals from the CPS. If the source of the gap were entirely due to under-reporting,

we could close the gap by substituting tax data for the income components of the CPS. Many

researchers have attempted to match household survey data to tax or earnings records (see

Burkhauser et al. (2017), Bollinger et al. (2019), Rothbaum (2015)).



  3   Rothbaum (2015) recently provides a detailed comparison for each income source.
      In Fixler, Gindelsky and Johnson (2018), we examined the usefulness of matching the CPS to

the tax data and compared the universe in each. Following the method of Fixler and Johnson

(2014) and Fixler et al. (2017), we showed that the substitution of income tax variables for the

CPS income variables is not a panacea for mis-reporting problems. Moreover, we showed that

there is little to gain in terms of differences between matched and unmatched files. 4

Accordingly, in this paper we use the public use file of the CPS and an alternative strategy for

adjusting the top tail of the distribution using tax data, described in the next section. 5

      Our goal, as described in earlier research, is to create a distribution for the US National

Account concept of Personal Income (PI), which is the income received by persons from

participation in production, from government and business transfers, and from holding

interest-bearing securities and corporate stocks.

      It is natural to look at the PI income concept for decision making, especially for

consumption, because PI is income accruing to households. Even though PI includes income

received by nonprofit institutions serving households, by private non-insured welfare funds,

and by private trust funds, household income comprises about 99% of PI. PSZ, however, use

National Income (NI) claiming: "[it is] in our view a more meaningful starting point, because it is

internationally comparable, it is the aggregate used to compute macroeconomic growth, and it




  4  More specifically we found that the difference between CPS and SOI variables was not unidirectional across income
categories; the differences were positive and negative across income categories.
   5 Note that this strategy differs from the strategy of Fixler, Gindelsky, and Johnson (2019) which involved estimating Pareto

coefficients on 1040 data. The results that we obtain using the current adjustment method for top shares closely match those we
obtained in our earlier analysis.


                                                                3
is comprehensive, including all forms of income that eventually accrue to individuals." (p. 561)

PI and NI are fairly close in aggregate and trend. 6


                                                     II. Data and Methods


     Our overall purpose is to move from Census money income in the CPS into the NIPA

concept of Personal Income.7 This entails two fundamental steps: adjusting the Census money

income concept to that of PI and then allocating national totals to households. More

specifically, the transformation involves 4 broad categories: Adjusted Money Income (AMI),

Financial (F), Health (H), and Other Transfers (net) (T). Overall, the strategy used in this exercise

was as follows: 1) Identify a NIPA total to be distributed, 2) Identify a CPS variable(s) which can

be used to allocate this total, 3) Sum all component NIPA totals to subtotals of interest and

Personal Income, and 4) Construct inequality statistics. 8 Consistent with previous analyses, our

exercise starts in 2007 due to the availability of our component data sources, particularly

Medicare data (per capita expenditures by state).


            1.      Outside data sources


     SOI: Before moving from money income to personal income, we enhance the upper tail of

the CPS by adjusting certain income sources. We utilize data from the IRS Statistics of Income

(SOI) program to adjust the top of the income distribution (or "tail") in order to more accurately



  6 PI=NI ­[corp. profits + taxes on production + contributions for gov. soc. ins. + net interest + bus. current transfer + current

surplus of gov. enterp.] + [personal income receipts on assets + personal current transfer receipts]. However, PSZ do not use
the components used in the NIPA measure of NI (in the formula above).
   7 It is important to note that the income data in the CPS is one year behind the year the CPS is collected ("survey year").
   8 For detail on the distribution of each of these categories, please see Gindelsky (2020) at https://www.bea.gov/data/special-

topics/distribution-of-personal-income
reflect true inequality (both in the top and overall), thought to be underestimated in the CPS.

There are several reasons we make an adjustment to CPS data. 1) As mentioned in Section I, the

CPS is believed to unsuccessfully survey those with very high incomes. 2) There is a perception

that there is underreporting by those with top incomes. 3) The CPS has top codes, which vary

by year, for those with top incomes so as not to risk identification of those individuals. For

example, if an individual reports he/she has $10m annually for example, he/she may be given a

value of $1m. For these reasons, it is prudent to adjust CPS incomes (Burkhauser et al. 2018,

Bollinger et al. 2019). The total difference between the NIPA aggregate and the CPS aggregate is

proportionally allocated for 6 components (Wages, Business Income, Ordinary Dividends,

Taxable & Non-taxable Interest Income, Farm Income, and Rents and Royalties) using

information available from the SOI regarding the portion of the income source for those whose

income is >=$500k and those whose incomes <500k. 9


      CBO: The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) uses an algorithm they developed to assign

probabilities of receipt of Supplemental Security Income (SSI), Medicaid, and Supplemental

Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) to each individual in the CPS for a given survey year. Once

the CBO assesses recipiency, they assign values to those households (Habib 2018) . We use

imputed CBO values available in a crosswalk rather than reported CPS values for these variables

in order to correct for underreporting in these important transfer categories.




  9  For example, in 2012, 53% of AGI for Ordinary Dividends in the SOI data is at least 500k. The NIPA total for dividend income
is $808b while total weighted CPS dividend income is $123b. That leaves $808b-$123b=$685 to be allocated to CPS households
as follows: 53% of $685b=$363b to households in Group 1 (Incomes >=$500k) and 47% of $685b = $322b to households in Group
2 (Incomes <500k). Each household then receives extra dividend income proportional to its share of dividend income in its group
such that aggregate weighted household dividend income (original + extra) will sum to $808b.


                                                                 5
     SCF: We use three asset variables from the Summary Extract Public Dataset of the Survey of

Consumer Finances (SCF) in order to distribute the three imputed components of personal

income.10 First, households are placed into before-tax income bins. The share of the total asset

variable held by all households in the given bin is calculated. The CPS households are placed

into the same income bins by adjusted money income. The NIPA totals are then allocated by

the distribution of each of these asset variables (e.g., share of asset variable by income bin) to

the CPS households in the respective bins.


   CE: We use the Consumer Expenditure Survey from the Bureau of Labor Statistics to impute

rental income for owner-occupied housing. Using this data source, we first rank "consumer units"

(roughly the same as households) by before-tax income, creating deciles. We next construct a

share of rental equivalence to before-tax family income. For example, if a household's income is

$100,000 and they report that the expected monthly rental value of their home is $4,000, their

rent-to-income share would be: 4,000 x 12 / 100,000 = 0.48. The median share is calculated for

each income decile. This share is then applied to income deciles in the CPS for households that

own their home to impute a value of rental income for owner-occupied housing based on

household income.


              2.      Computations of Subtotals


Adjusted Money Income: In order to move from Money Income (as defined by the Census) to

Personal Income, we first adjust Money Income in order to be consistent with the concepts



   10 Because the SCF is triennial, we interpolate the SCF variables for the years in which the SCF is not observed using the Fernandez procedure,
which extends the Denton and Chow-Lin approaches. The results of this method very closely match the results of the FRB's interpolation used in
their DFAs.
using in the NIPA estimates. Though Census money income in many ways is a narrower

definition of income, it does include variables that are not in personal income, such as

retirement disbursements. Accordingly, we add up the components of Census money income

that are in Personal Income, excluding variables that are not. We call this approximation

Adjusted Money Income.11 It is primarily comprised of income from Wages & Salaries (and

supplements), Self-Employment (Farm & Nonfarm), Interest, Dividends, and Social security

income, which together sum to 95% of Adjusted Money Income in 2016. The other 5% is

comprised of income from additional sources such as rents & royalties, unemployment

insurance, and disability income among others.


Financial Items: This category is the sum of allocations for pension and profit sharing, life

insurance, rental income from owner-occupied housing, and imputed interest.


Health Items: This category is the sum of allocations for employer contributions for health

insurance, Medicare, Medicaid, military medical insurance, and other medical care payment

assistance.


Other Transfers (net): This group imputes transfers in the NIPAs that are not contained in

Adjusted Money Income or Health to CPS households. These items include employer and




   11 Retirement disbursements are one of the main exclusions, constituting approximately 75% of money income excluded.

Adjusted Money Income also excludes potential sources of intrasectoral transfers, which would net out in the sector and are not
associated with current period production, such as other financial assistance ( fin-val), "other" income (oi-val), alimony (alm-val),
child support (csp-val) and "other" non-institutional educational assistance (ed-val). We do include incomes from these sources
tied to railroad retirement, "other" retirement, worker's compensation, black lung benefits, and state/local government
disability. For more details, see Gindelsky (2020).


                                                                   7
employee contributions for government social insurance (net): SNAP, WIC, Refundable tax

credits, energy assistance, educational assistance, and other transfers.


    We then calculate household income as the sum of Adjusted Money Income, Financial,

Health, and Other Transfers (net). Finally, to calculate Personal Income from Household

Income, Household Current Transfer Receipts from Nonprofits and Nonprofit Institution Transfer

Receipts from Households are deducted, and Nonprofit Institution Income is added. This

residual is distributed equally to all individuals in the CPS.


    After all components have been added together to compute personal income, equivalized

personal income is calculated by dividing personal income by the square root of the number of

household members.12 Equivalized personal income is used for all income inequality metrics.

There are four strategies which involve imputations derived from external datasets.


                                                          III. Results


    Our first objective is to create a distribution of NIPA Table 2.9 which decomposes Personal

Income into several income components. We will then analyze the levels and trends in

inequality which result from the calculation.




   12 There are other equivalence scales that are prevalent in the inequality literature which weight children less than adults

including the OECD scale, the similar Census Bureau method. Other methods include calculation of inequality based on
individuals. The choice of equivalence scale can significantly affect the subsequent inequality estimates.
              1.     Decomposing Personal Income

       Personal Income can be decomposed into: Compensation of Employees, Proprietors'

Income with Inventory Valuation and Capital Consumption Adjustment, Rental Income of

Households with Capital Consumption Adjustment, Household Income Receipts, and Household

Current Transfer Receipts, less Contributions to government social insurance. Households are

ranked by equivalized personal income and each income category is distributed, with results by

quintile in Table 1 below.13

  In Table 1, we can see that household income receipts on assets dominate the top quintile,

whereas government social benefits accrue mainly to the bottom quintiles. At least half the

group share of Compensation of Employees, Proprietors' income, Rental Income, Household

Income Receipts on Assets, and Contributions for Government Social Insurance is held by the top

quintile. However, for Household Current Transfer Receipts, the share among the quintiles is

more equally distributed. The results of that group are dominated by Government Social

Benefits, which mainly includes Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, Unemployment insurance,

and Veterans Benefits. Business transfer payments is primarily net insurance settlements.


  Table 2 shows the real growth for the major components by quintile from 2007-2016. Real

personal income grew for every quintile over the period (approx. 15% for the bottom four

quintiles and 20% for the top). However, while income in every category grew for the top

quintile, household income receipts on assets and proprietors' income fell for the bottom four

quintiles. Rental Income grew strongly across all quintiles.

  Figure 1 below presents an alternative way to examine these categories by quintile. Here we

can see that transfer receipts make up the majority of their income. In contrast, compensation

and income receipts on assets make up the majority of the income for the top quintiles.

  Note: Contributions for government social insurance are a subtraction such that all components sum to 1 for
  each quintile.

   Next, we can examine whether this relationship is stable over time in Table 3 by looking at

   There have been substantial changes in the contribution of the components of PI.

Compensation has decreased as a share of household income over time, while transfers have



                                                        11
increased proportionally over time. For example, while 44.1% of income for the first quintile is

derived from compensation in 2007, only 36.4% is derived from compensation in 2016 (thus a

difference of -7.7 percentage points). These trends are especially pronounced for the bottom

quintiles. The share of rental income (composed of (1) owner-occupied housing, and (2) rents &

royalties) has gone up for every quintile, while the share of income receipts on assets

(composed of monetary interest and dividends) has gone down for every quintile.

Compensation has declined and transfers have increased (relatively) for the bottom quintiles.

Another way of looking at the makeup of personal income is to analyze the transition from

Adjusted Money Income to Personal Income in Table 4 below.

* "Other Transfers (net)" includes the net of all transfers that are not already included above as part of Adjusted
Money Income and Health respectively. NPISH (net) represents a statistical aggregate used to move from
Household Income to Personal Income.

    Table 4 shows that though 65% of Personal Income is composed of Adjusted Money

Income, Financial items, Health items, and transfers also play a significant role in the aggregate.

Though transfers are smaller in the aggregate, they are significant in the average (19%) and
comprise about 66% of the Health items. These results are consistent with the heavy impact of

transfers evident in the previous tables and charts.


           2. Inequality

   Turning to the results for income inequality, we can examine trends over time, starting with

Table 5 below. We calculate numerous metrics including income levels (real mean and median),

quintiles, top shares, the 90/10 ratio and the Gini index. Note that we further decompose the

top quintile into 80-99% and top 1%. By looking at these measures together, we are able to gain

a better understanding of the distribution overall. In real terms, mean (and median) equivalized

personal income increased 9.2% over the 2007-2016 period, as compared to 8.2% for

equivalized money income (Census).


   However, most of that increase takes place over the second half of the period (recovery)

after the initial decrease during the Great Recession. Top shares fell slightly during the peak of

the recession (2008-2009). Indeed, overall inequality changed little from the beginning of the

period to the end, as measured by the Gini and top 1% share. In 2016, the distribution is similar

to 2007.

       Though there are small shifts year to year due to economic conditions and the impacts of

tax law change on income reporting (see 2012-2014 in particular). 14 For example, between

2010 and 2011, the share received by the top quintile increased from 49.4 to 50.5 percent. This

translates into a large share of the growth 2010-2011 for the top quintile (80% as shown in

Figure 4).

       Of the overall growth of Personal Income of 17.9% over the 2007-2016 period, 2% went to

the top 1% and 8% went to the 80-99% such that the share of the top quintile increased from

51.2 to 52.2. The net effect was a 1 percentage point increase in the share of the top quintile

(though not driven by the top 1%) accompanied by a slight decrease in the share of the middle

quintiles. In 2016, those in the top quintile have real ($2012) equivalized personal income of at

least $97k, while those in the bottom quintile have at most $33k.

       To put these metrics into context, we can compare the top 1% share of Equivalized Personal

Income to similarly calculated top shares from other studies in Table 6 below, including both

the Before-tax-and-transfer and After-tax-and-transfer measures from PSZ, the Auten and

Splinter (A&S) before-tax-and-after-transfer measure, and the After-tax-and-transfer measure

from CBO (which also included capital gains). Although we utilize some different data sources

and methodology (by construction) than A&S, the top 1% shares are similar.




  14 The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 changed how capital gains were taxed. This led to a change in reporting ­ some
high-income households shifted the realization of some capital gains into the prior tax year to avoid the higher rates, causing
income inequality to rise (particularly top shares) in 2012 and subsequently fall in 2013 (CBO 2018).




                                                                15

       In addition, Figure 2 shows that the overall trends in the PSZ measures are similar to the

BEA trends.15 We can also plot these trends over time (relative to 2007) in Figure 2 below. BEA

estimates generally follow the same trend.




       Figure 2: Relative Movements in Top 1% over Time: Comparing Across Measures (2007=1)




       In Figures 3 and 4 below we can see how each income category (quintiles and top 1%) of

BEA personal income grew over the period. A distinction must be made between the share of a



  15   For additional comparisons see Gindelsky, et al. (2020)
group as a whole (e.g., total income of those in the 3 rd quintile/total income) and total income

of the group. Although the lowest three quintiles grew very little over the period, all income

groups did grow from 2010 onwards as seen in Figure 3 below.


   In Figure 4, the height of each stacked bar shows the growth in real personal income over

one year. Each portion is the contribution of each quintile (or top 1%) from for a given year. For

example, the contribution of the top 1% to overall growth in Real PI ($2012) from 2009-2010 =

   1%                               -  1%                  . Of the 2.3% growth in PI from 2009-

2010, 0.5% accrues to the top 1%. This means that the top 1% receives 0.5/2.3 = 21.7% of the
growth.

       Figure 3: Real Personal Income (Trillions of Dollars) by Income Category (2012=100)




  As Figures 3 and 4 show, in addition to Table 5, there is minimal change in the distribution over

this period. As such, over the entire period, the distribution of growth is similar to the distribution

in 2007. The overall growth of 17.9 percent for the entire period yields 58 percent for the top



                                                   17
quintile; the top quintile share increases from 51.2 percent to 52.2 percent. Across the period,

there was some growth for the top quintile during the recovery (1-2% annually), for both the 80-

99% and the top 1%. Note that the growth in top 20% is not due to the growth in the top 1%.

                                            IV. Conclusion

   The aim of this paper is to describe BEA's new measure introduce a new measure, the

Distribution of Personal Income, and provide an analysis of inequality levels and trends for

2007-2016. In doing so, we have built on several previous works (Fixler, Gindelsky and Johnson

(2018, 2019); Fixler et al. (2017); Fixler and Johnson (2014)). The current methodology extends

the time series and allocates NIPA totals to households using publicly available microdata, with

the CPS as the base dataset for distribution to households. In doing so, we provide new insights

into inequality trends while facilitating transparency and replicability.
   Several key results emerge from our analysis. First, inequality has changed little over the

2007-2016 period; the slight increase derives from growth in the share of the top quintile.

Second, BEA's estimates are in line with other prominent inequality estimates both in level and

trend when the definition of "income" is close, even with different methodology and data used.

Third, there has been some substantial change in the composition of Personal Income across

the period. Over the period, compensation has decreased as a share of household income over

time, while transfers have increased proportionally. These trends are seen most strongly in the

bottom quintiles. Fourth, real mean and median income have increased over the period, with

gains made by every income quintile. Finally, the effects of the Great Recession and subsequent

gradual recovery can be seen very clearly to be affecting all income categories.

   We view this exercise as an important step in furthering the discussion not only on

inequality statistics, but also on working to close the often-cited "macro-micro" gap which

exists in estimates of income distributions. While this is an important first step, there remains

much more work that can be done in this area.
