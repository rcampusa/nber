                                         ABSTRACT

More than 100 natural disasters strike the United States every year, causing extensive fatalities
and damages. We construct the universe of US federally designated natural disasters from 1920 to
2010. We find that severe disasters increase out-migration rates at the county level by 1.5
percentage points and lower housing prices/rents by 2.5–5.0 percent. The migration response to
milder disasters is smaller but has been increasing over time. The economic response to disasters
is most consistent with falling local productivity and labor demand. Disasters that convey more
information about future disaster risk increase the pace of out-migration.

I. Introduction
       Natural disasters regularly strike major cities in the United States, leading to numerous
fatalities and billions of dollars of property and infrastructure damage each year. Recent examples
include Hurricane Sandy, which hit New York City and the surrounding area in 2012, and
Hurricane Harvey, which caused severe flooding in Houston in 2017, each resulting in more than
100 deaths. Climate science suggests that as global greenhouse gas emissions increase, so too will
the number and severity of natural disasters (IPCC 2012). Furthermore, as more economic activity
clusters along America’s coasts, a greater share of the population is now at risk of exposure to
natural disasters (Changnon et. al. 2000, Rappaport and Sachs 2003, Pielke et. al. 2008).
       This paper analyzes an original dataset for which we compiled the universe of federally
designated natural disasters in the United States from 1920 to 2010.1 Figure 1 displays annual
counts of disaster events at the county level using this new series, and Appendix Figure 1 breaks
down the series by disaster type. From 1920 to 1964, observations are based on historical archival
data from the American National Red Cross (ARC). We then combine this information with
disaster counts from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and its predecessors
starting in the 1950s. 2 Through most of the century, the US experienced around 500 county-level
disaster events each year (one disaster can contribute to numerous county-level disaster events –
for example, as a hurricane moves up the coast and strikes multiple counties). Since the early
1990s, there has been a clear acceleration in disaster counts, reaching around 1,500 county-level
events per year by the 2000s. Winter storms and hurricanes contribute the most to this increase in
frequency. 3 Our extensive new data set aggregates these annual disaster events to the decadal level
in order to investigate the effect of natural disasters on local economies.




1
  Our time series of disasters begins in 1920, but our analysis of the effect of disasters on migration
starts in 1930, when the series of net migration by county is first available.
2
  By this measure, a disaster that affects multiple counties would be tallied multiple times. For
example, the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927 affected 170 counties. Likewise, a county that
experiences more than one disaster event in a decade would be counted more than once.
3
  A rise in the frequency of disasters after 1990 is also evident in global series, suggesting that it
reflects a real uptick in weather events (see Munich Re 2012, Gaiha et al. 2015, Kousky 2014). In
addition, the federal government may have become more expansive in their declaration of disaster
events after Hurricane Andrew, which was especially salient, taking place during the 1992
presidential election campaign (Salkowe and Chakraborty 2009).


                                                  1
       A natural disaster event might affect the local economy in several ways: reducing firm
productivity by destroying productive capital or disrupting supply chains, creating unanticipated
disamenities for consumers, or demolishing part of the housing stock. Each of these channels
implies a different relationship between disaster events and local wages, housing prices/rents, and
net migration to an area. Furthermore, disasters could shock local areas out of an inefficient
equilibrium established through path dependence, allowing the economy to reset to a new
equilibrium (for example, by destroying outdated buildings and other durable capital such as in
Hornbeck and Keniston (2017)).
       We compare a series of economic outcomes within counties before and after a disaster
strikes, relative to comparison counties that do not experience a natural disaster in the decade. The
underlying assumption is that the presence of a disaster in a particular decade does not coincide
with other economic changes at the county level. We find no evidence that disasters that will occur
in the next decade (leads) have any effect on current out-migration. In some specifications, we
also include county-specific trends to account for the fact that, for example, disasters are more
common in coastal areas that might be otherwise attracting economic activity over time.
       We find that a severe disaster event leads to lower family income, heightened out-migration
rates and lower housing prices/rents in a county over the decade. Together, these results suggest
that natural disasters reduce firm productivity, thereby lowering wages in the area, which
encourages out-migration and falling housing prices. Local responses to disaster events increased
after 1980 as national disaster activity has become more frequent in recent years, perhaps because
residents infer that each event is associated with a higher risk of future disasters. The advent of
FEMA in 1978 did not dampen this trend. If natural disasters were able to shock local areas out of
inefficient equilibria regularly, we would expect a stronger out-migration response to disasters in
slow-growing areas compared to areas that were experiencing faster economic or population
growth. Yet, if anything, we find a stronger net out-migration response in growing areas, contrary
to the idea that disasters regularly shock local economies off an inefficient path.
       On average, net out-migration from a county increases by 1.5 percentage points during a
decade facing a severe natural disaster (8 percent of a standard deviation). The migration response
to one severe natural disaster is around half as large as the estimated migration effect of a one
standard-deviation reduction in local employment growth. Our preferred specification considers a
disaster to be “severe” if it leads to 25 or more deaths, the median value for disasters with known



                                                 2
fatality counts. Results are robust to alternative fatality thresholds (20 to 200 fatalities), but we
find stronger out-migration from the most severe disasters (500 fatalities of more). In the full
sample, there are small out-migration responses to milder disasters, especially hurricanes and wild
fires. However, after 1980, a period of rising natural disaster frequency and intensity, we find a
sizeable migration response to floods, hurricanes, and wild fires. The heightened response to
smaller disasters in the more recent period is consistent with the possibility that these events confer
more information about future disaster risk, given the growing frequency of disasters over time.
        We also find that median housing prices/rents fall by 2.5 to 5 percent after a severe natural
disaster, the same order of magnitude as the housing market response to a five percent decrease in
school quality as measured by test scores (Black 1999; Black and Machin 2011). Poverty rates
increase in areas hit by severe disasters, which is consistent with either an out-migration of
households above the poverty line or in-migration of the poor (perhaps in response to lower
housing prices), or a causal effect of natural disasters on the probability that the existing population
falls into poverty. Our estimates capture the net effect of disasters on local economies, after any
rebuilding, new investments, or disbursement of disaster relief funds. 4
        On the margin, FEMA disaster declarations and the extent of disaster relief payments are
affected by the political process (Downton and Pielke 2001, Garrett and Sobel 2003). 5 We provide
suggestive evidence that our results are not being driven by biases that would arise if disaster
events were declared more often in politically connected states (e.g., those controlled by the same
party as the president). First, any political connection that would lead states to receive an
unwarranted disaster designation and disaster relief should generate other flows of valuable
discretionary federal funds, thereby, if anything, leading to net in-migration. Thus, we would
expect the political component of disaster declarations to bias against finding that disasters lead
to out-migration or falling housing prices. Second, although the official designation of mild
weather events as “disasters” may be subject to political manipulation, the largest disasters have

  Gregory (2017) and Fu and Gregory (2019) document that rebuilding grants have externality
effects on the decision of neighboring households to remain in an area struck by a natural disaster.
5
  These papers show that states politically important to the president have a higher rate of disaster
declaration, and that disaster expenditures are higher in states having congressional representation
on FEMA oversight committees and during election years.


                                                   3
all received federal disaster designations. 6 We show that the estimated effect of “severe disasters”
is robust to various definitions, ranging from a threshold of 10 to 500 deaths, suggesting that
individuals respond similarly to any disaster that is sufficiently damaging. The association between
large disasters and out-migration also holds when instrumenting for disaster activity with
historically available climate variables (e.g., maximum and minimum temperatures) to account for
any association between disaster declarations and local politics, and is present regardless of
whether the political party of the state’s governor matches the party of the President.
       Our work contributes to two strands of the literature in urban and environmental
economics. First is a series of macroeconomic studies that use cross-country panel regressions to
study how changing temperature, rainfall, and increased exposure to natural disasters conditions
affect economic growth (Dell, Jones and Olken 2012, 2014; Cavallo, et al. 2013; Hsiang and Jina
2014; Burke, Hsiang and Miguel 2015; Cattaneo and Peri 2016; Kocornik-Mina et. al.
Forthcoming). These studies have not led to a consensus. Results range from long-lasting effects
of natural disasters on national income to near-immediate recovery. By analyzing the effect of
many natural disasters within a single country (the United States) over many decades, we are able
to hold constant many core institutional and geographic features of the economy that may be
otherwise correlated with disaster prevalence in a cross-country setting (e.g., democracy,
temperate climate). We add to a small body of work studying disasters within a country, including
Anttila-Hughes and Hsiang (2013), which analyzes more than 2,000 typhoons in the Philippines. 7
In our universe of US disasters, we document results more consistent with the finding of long-
lasting disaster effects on local economies.
       A second set of papers present case studies of specific major disasters on existing residents
(see, for example in the US, Smith and McCarty 1996 and Hallstrom and Smith 2005 on Hurricane
Andrew; Hornbeck 2012 and Long and Siu 2018 on the Dustbowl; Hornbeck and Naidu 2014 on
the 1927 Mississippi flood; and Vigdor 2008, Sastry and Gregory 2014, Bleemer and Van der
Klaauw 2017 and Deryugina, Kawano and Levitt 2018 on Hurricane Katrina; for disasters in other

  Even Hurricane Maria, the severity of which was downplayed by the Trump administration after
hitting Puerto Rico in 2017, did receive a disaster designation by FEMA and so would be included
in our definition of a disaster event.
7
  In work related to climate change (although not directly focused on natural disasters), Feng,
Oppenheimer and Schlenker (2012) studies the effect of temperature-induced changes in crop
yields on migration from rural US counties.


                                                 4
countries, see Nobles, Frankenberg, and Thomas 2015 and Groger and Zylberberg 2016). Most of
these case studies find large effects of a major disaster on out-migration or population loss. While
it is important to study these major cases, most disasters are not as severe as these notable outliers.
Our comprehensive dataset allows us to examine a much wider universe of disasters. In two related
papers, Strobl (2011) and Fussell, et al. (2017) use county-level panels of US counties and find
that hurricanes reduce local economic growth and affected population in recent decades. Strobl
leverages detailed data on wind speeds and a scientific model of hurricane intensity to generate a
proxy for local damage. The (complementary) advantage of our paper is that we examine all
disaster types – hurricanes represent less than 10 percent of disaster events – over a much longer
historical period.


II. Theoretical Predictions
       Natural disasters can have various effects on local economies, potentially reducing firm
productivity, destroying housing stock and/or diminishing consumer amenities. Furthermore, one
disaster event can change the expectations of residents or prospective residents about future
disaster risk. We discuss each of these aspects in turn, as well as the case of a disaster shocking an
area out of an inefficient equilibrium, and derive predictions that will guide our empirical exercise.
Kocornik-Mina et al. (Forthcoming) discusses a set of similar channels.
       We use the effect of disasters on local wages, housing prices/rents, and net migration to
distinguish the relative strength of the various channels by which disaster events can affect local
economies. Consider the case in which a natural disaster reduces firm productivity– for example,
by destroying productive capital or disrupting local supply chains (Carvalho, et al. 2016), thereby
reducing labor demand. All else equal, natural disasters would lower wages, encouraging existing
residents to leave the area and/or discouraging outsiders from moving in (Rosen 1974; Roback
1982; Topel 1986). In an economy with durable local housing, this out-migration would depress
local home prices in the medium run until the existing housing stock has a chance to depreciate
(Glaeser and Gyourko 2005). 8 Lower home prices encourage some residents to stay in an area and
others to move in; the price effect will be strongest for the poor who are more willing to trade off


8
  If instead disasters result in extensive rebuilding projects, thereby temporarily increasing labor
demand, population and housing prices will increase. We estimate the net effect of disasters
including any effect on reconstruction.


                                                  5
high real income for higher disaster risk. Thus, if disasters reduce firm productivity, we expect
they will be associated with lower wages, higher out-migration and lower housing prices. If instead
disasters weaken local amenities, residents will also leave the area and housing prices will fall as
a result, but, if anything, wages might rise as a result, as firms seek to attract workers back to the
region.
          Natural disasters may also destroy a substantial portion of the housing stock or reduce the
willingness of homeowners to invest in ongoing maintenance, thereby reducing the quality of the
existing stock (Bunten and Kahn, 2017). If the only effect of a disaster is to contract the housing
stock, then we would expect housing prices to rise in the short run. More generally, the short run
effect of a disaster on housing prices will depend on the relative strength of declining demand for
living in the area (which will reduce prices) and a reduction in housing supply (which will raise
prices). In the longer run, if prices rise above construction costs for some period of time, developers
may build new housing, thereby moderating any initial increase in housing prices. Given the
decadal frequency of data on housing prices taken from the Censuses of Population and Housing,
housing supply destruction may have no estimated effect even if prices did rise for a few years. If
a disaster event encourages local politicians to change land use regulations – for example, by
expanding the zone considered at high risk of flooding or wild fires –the long-run housing supply
in an area may end up lower than before. In that case, natural disasters could increase housing
prices even at the decadal level.
          The effect of a disaster on local amenities will depend on whether the event was anticipated
by local residents– for example, in areas that are known for having a high hurricane risk. An
anticipated disaster event would have no effect on the valuation of local amenities. The case of a
fully anticipated disaster is analogous to a one-time shock that is expected not to recur, in the sense
that both such events convey no new information about future risk. Davis and Weinstein (2002)
document that even a severe (but temporary and non-recurrent) shock like the firebombing of
Japanese cities during World War II did not lead to a long-term change in population levels across
cities. Likewise, we would not expect an effect of disaster events on migration if: (a) disaster
events are common and thus fully anticipated, or (b) a disaster is considered idiosyncratic and thus
contains no new information about future disaster risk.
          Although few disasters are entirely anticipated, the degree of new information about
disaster risk contained in each event can vary across locations and over time. All else equal, we



                                                   6
predict that disasters that convey more new information about the increased likelihood of a future
disaster in the area will lead to greater increases in out-migration. One corollary of this information
channel is that a disaster may convey more “new news” if it strikes an area that otherwise has faced
a low underlying disaster risk, as compared to an area that is regularly hit by disasters. Another
corollary is that a given disaster event may convey more information about the likelihood of future
reoccurrence in recent decades, when the severity and regularity of disasters has increased, as
compared to the early- to mid-twentieth century.
         In theory, local areas can persist for long periods in inefficient equilibria, due to historical
path dependence or development delays stemming from coordinated rebuilding decisions. In this
scenario, a natural disaster could be the catalyst shifting an area onto a new path, leading the effect
of a disaster shock to differ in productive and unproductive areas. Siodla (2015) and Hornbeck and
Keniston (2017) find that productive cities such as San Francisco and Boston respectively suffered
from an inefficiently low quality building stock as they began to grow. Both cities then experienced
large urban fires in the late nineteenth/early twentieth centuries that “reset” the area to a new
equilibrium. In growing areas, then, natural disasters could even (counterintuitively) encourage
population growth. In contrast, low productivity places can retain inefficiently high population
levels for decades because of the existence of a long-lived housing stock. In this case, a natural
disaster could “reset” the equilibrium to a permanently lower population if it destroyed a sufficient
share of the housing stock, as in the case of Hurricane Katrina (Fussell 2015). We thus expect more
out-migration from slow-growing areas if natural disasters regularly shock areas off of an
inefficient path.


III. Econometric Framework
         To study how natural disaster events affect local economies, we stack data from county i
in state j for decades ending in year t (t = 1940-2010) and estimate:


   𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = µ𝑖𝑖 + 𝜉𝜉𝑡𝑡 + 𝛽𝛽1 ∗ 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽2 ∗ 𝛥𝛥𝛥𝛥𝛥𝛥𝛥𝛥𝛥𝛥𝛥𝛥𝛥𝛥𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽3 ∗ (𝑿𝑿𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ∗ 𝑡𝑡) + 𝑈𝑈𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖   (1)


Our set of dependent variables 𝑌𝑌 include the net migration rate from year t-10 to year t, the
logarithm of median housing prices (or rents) in year t, and a series of other economic attributes
such as the logarithm of median family income and the poverty rate (available from 1970) in year


                                                                   7
t, all of which are measured at the decadal level from the Censuses of Population and Housing.9
Our main explanatory variable is a vector of the number and severity of disasters in a local area
(𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ) from year t-10 to year t, which we will discuss in depth in the next section. In
particular, we include an indicator for the presence of any severe disaster in the county and decade
and counts of all other disasters by type (e.g., hurricanes, fires).
        Our coefficient of interest 𝛽𝛽1 compares counties that experienced a severe disaster to those
that did not in a particular decade. We control for county (µ𝑖𝑖 ) and decade (𝜉𝜉𝑡𝑡 ) fixed effects, state-
specific linear time trends and an interaction between initial county population and a linear time
trend (included in the vector 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ). We allow for differential trends by initial population to account
for the fact that sparsely populated areas (e.g., in the Mountain West) were less likely to have
declared disasters, and include state-specific linear time trends because disaster events are more
common in coastal areas that were otherwise attracting population over time. Standard errors
account for spatial and temporal dependence as discussed in Conley (1999) and implemented by
Hsiang (2010) and Fetzer (2014). We assume that spatial dependence is linearly decreasing in
distance from the county centroid up to 1,000 km.
        Standard economic controls like the unemployment rate are not available at the county
level over such a long period of time and, in addition, are potentially endogenous outcomes of
natural disaster activity. Instead, we control for time-varying economic conditions by constructing
an estimate of county employment growth from t-10 to t using initial industrial composition at the
county level to weight national employment trends (𝛥𝛥𝛥𝛥𝛥𝛥𝛥𝛥𝛥𝛥𝛥𝛥𝛥𝛥𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ). This measure follows standard
proxies for local economic growth pioneered by Bartik (1991) and Blanchard and Katz (1992) and
is defined as:


                                 ∑𝐿𝐿𝑙𝑙=1�𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸{𝑖𝑖,1930,𝑙𝑙} ∗ 𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺{𝑡𝑡,𝑙𝑙} �
        𝛥𝛥𝛥𝛥𝛥𝛥𝛥𝛥𝛥𝛥𝛥𝛥𝛥𝛥𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 =                                                                  (2)
                                            𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸{𝑖𝑖,1930}




9
  Data on population, poverty rates, family income, housing stock and house values/rents by county
are taken from the National Historical Geographic Information System (NHGIS). For stock
variables like family income or population, we associate disasters over a given decade (t-10 to t)
to attributes of a county at the decade’s end (year t). So, for example, we imagine that housing
prices in a county in 1970 would be affected by disasters in that location from 1960-69, and so on.


                                                                                8
Equation (2) weights the national growth rate (GR) in employment in industry l for decade t by
the share of workers in county i who worked in industry l in the base year (usually: 1930). 10
       We also conduct several robustness checks, including county-specific fixed effects instead
of state fixed effects, controlling for county population by decade instead of initial population
interacted with a time trends, and including a lag and lead term of the dependent variable on the
right hand side to check for pre-trends before the disaster event. We also try excluding all controls
beyond state and county fixed effects; the only control that is central to our main result is the
inclusion of state-specific linear time trends.


IV. Data
A. Natural Disasters
       We combine data from several sources to create a consistent series of disaster counts at the
county level over the twentieth and the early twenty-first centuries. For each disaster, we record
the geographic location (county), month and year of occurrence, type of event (e.g., flood,
hurricane), and fatality count.
       Our most recent data are drawn from the list of “major disaster declarations” posted by
FEMA and its predecessors, which begins in 1964 (fema.gov/disasters). We supplement the FEMA
roster with information on disaster declarations published in the Federal Register back to 1958
and with archival records back to the early 1950s. 11 We extend our series to 1918 using data on
the disaster relief efforts of the American National Red Cross (ARC) documented in their Annual




10
   We calculate employment in 143 industries by county using the 1930 IPUMS data and rely on
the standardized 1950-based industry codes. Goldsmith-Pinkham and Sorkin (2018) emphasize the
identifying assumptions needed to use Bartik-style shift-share variables as instruments. In this
case, we are simply using the shift-share measure to create a proxy for employment growth.
11
   We use the archival records of the Office of Emergency Preparedness (Record Group 396) and

the Federal Civil Defense Administration (Record Group 397) held at National Archives II at
College Park, Maryland. The “State Disaster Files” in RG 396, Boxes 1-4 were especially useful.

Reports and in lists of disaster relief operations available in the National Archives. 12 We link these
lists with the ARC’s case files to document the date, type, and location of each disaster. 13
       Table 1 reports the number of disaster events in our dataset by type, as well as decadal
averages of disaster counts at the county level. 14 The most common disaster types in the data are
floods and tornados, representing around 70 percent of the 10,158 total events. The typical county
in our sample had 1.83 declared disasters in a decade, with the most common disasters being storms
(0.73 in the typical county-decade), floods (0.49 in the typical county-decade) and hurricanes (0.31
in the typical county-decade).
       Appendix Table 1 provides geographic and economic correlates of disaster incidence.
Places with more coastline are more likely to experience a severe disaster than not, while high
elevation, number of lakes, and being in the dustbowl area are comparatively protective. This is
mainly driven by the fact that the coasts are more disaster prone. For similar reasons, population
and median home value are positively correlated with severe disasters, and poverty is negatively
correlated. A good weather index, which accounts for winter lows and summer highs, is positively
related to disaster incidence. Because the US population has been moving toward the coasts over
time and coastal areas are more disaster prone, we try a specification with county-specific time
trends below.
       Information on fatalities are drawn from the EM-DAT dataset or from the ARC records
and are only available for disasters resulting in 10 or more deaths. 15,16 We create measures of

   We use various versions of the ARC’s “List of Disaster Relief Operations by Appropriation
Number,” held in Record Group 200 at National Archives II in College Park, MD (Records of the
American National Red Cross, 1947-1960, Boxes 1635-37).
13
   The case files are located in RG200 Records of the American National Red Cross, 1917-34, Box
690-820; 1935-46, Boxes 1230-1309; 1947-60, Boxes 1670-1750.
14
   All disasters that may be influenced by economic activity, such as mine collapses, explosions,
transportation accidents, arsons and droughts are excluded from the analysis. There is a debate
about the extent to which droughts are caused by environmental conditions versus decisions about
water use. We report results that include droughts in Appendix Table 19 and they are unchanged.
15
   We incorporate information on fatalities for each disaster by merging in fatality counts from the
American Red Cross by disaster type, state and start date of event, or from the EM-DAT dataset
by state and event month. We use the maximum of the two fatality counts for disasters that are
recorded in both data set. EM-DAT was created by the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology
of Disasters (see http://www.emdat.be/).
16
   Our measure of fatalities includes the number of people who lost their lives because the event
happened (dead) and the number of people whose whereabouts since the disaster are unknown,
and presumed dead based on official figures (missing). In the majority of cases, a disaster will only


                                                  10
disaster severity using fatality counts above various thresholds. Our preferred measure of a
“severe” disaster is one with 25 or more deaths, the median count for disasters with known fatality
numbers. Appendix Figure 2 presents a histogram of disasters by fatality count. There are 151
disasters with 25 or more deaths in our dataset which constitute 1.5 percent of all events. These
disasters tend to be geographically extensive, so that around 30 percent of counties experience a
severe disaster in a given decade.
       For a given disaster event, the number of fatalities is determined in part by the level of
economic development in the location and the period (Kahn 2005; Lim 2016). For this reason, we
avoid using actual fatality counts to measure the intensity of disaster severity in favor of a simple
fatality threshold. Results are nearly identical if we instead define disaster severity as any disaster
with fatalities above the 50th or above the 90th percentile of the decade average to allow for
endogenous declines in fatalities over time. The number of fatalities resulting from any given event
may also be mechanically correlated with the population at a given time (the population “at risk”
of death from a disaster). To address this mechanical effect, we also try including controls for
county population by decade. These results are reported in Appendix Tables below.
       Figure 2 presents maps of the spatial distribution of disaster prevalence. The first map
reports the cumulative count of disasters of any type during the century, and the second map reports
the number of decades in which the county experienced a severe disaster. Disasters are prevalent
throughout Florida and on the Gulf of Mexico, an area typically wracked by hurricanes; in New
England and along the Atlantic Seaboard, locations battered by winter storms; in the Midwest, a
tornado-prone region; and along the Mississippi River, an area subject to recurrent flooding. There
are comparatively few disasters in the West, with the exception of California, which is affected
primarily by fires and earthquakes. Severe disasters follow similar geographic patterns but are
more concentrated on the Atlantic Coast, in the Gulf of Mexico, and in large river valleys. It may
be noted in Figure 2 that disaster counts drop significantly when crossing certain borders, for
instance when crossing from the Dakotas into eastern Montana or crossing into Iowa. These can
be attributed to state-level variation in the disaster-declaration process. 17 Appendix Figure 3


be entered into EM-DAT if at least two independent sources confirm the fatality count. Note that
the final fatality figures in EM-DAT may be updated even long after the disaster has occurred.
17
   According to the FEMA disaster declaration process, all disaster declarations are made solely at
the discretion of the President of the United States. Before submitting a request for declaration,
the state government must determine that the damage exceeds their resources. Thus, differences in

displays the count of decades with a severe disaster event after including state fixed effects. We
can more readily see the vulnerability of counties along the path of hurricanes that originate in the
Gulf of Mexico or that suffer from winter storms in the Snow Belt.


B. Migration
       We obtain age-specific net migration estimates by decade for US counties from 1950 to
2010 from Winkler, et al. (2013a, b). Gardner and Cohen (1992) provide similar estimates for 1930
to 1950. These data include estimates of net migration for each decade from US counties by five-
year age group, sex, and race. The underlying migration numbers are estimated by comparing the
population in each age-sex-race cohort at the beginning and end of a Census period (say, 1990–
2000) and attributing the difference in population count to net migration, after adjusting for births
and mortality. Any net inflow of immigration from abroad would be captured in this measure as
an increase in the county’s rate of net in-migration. This method has become standard practice to
estimate internal migration in the United States, as originated by Kuznets and Thomas (1957). We
divide estimated net migration to or from the county from time t to t+10 by population at time t to
calculate a migration rate. To address any inaccuracies in the incorporation of birth and death rates,
we also estimate net-migration using the population between ages 15–64 per decade below. At the
lower end, these individuals are too old to have been affected by the disaster’s effect on birth rates,
and at the upper end, we drop the elderly, who are more vulnerable to disaster-induced mortality.
Summary statistics of our outcome variables at the county-by-decade level are reported in
Appendix Table 2.


V. Disasters and Out Migration
A. The effect of disasters on out-migration in the full sample
       We document in this section that severe natural disasters are associated with net out-
migration from a county. Table 2 reports our main specification, which defines “severe disaster”
as an event resulting in 25 or more deaths. The first column considers a county’s net migration rate



state resources may result in differences in the probability of requesting a federal disaster
declaration. These state-level differences are accounted for in our analysis with state and county
fixed effects, and in some cases with state time trends. (https://www.fema.gov/disaster-
declaration-process).


                                                  12
as an outcome. By this measure, experiencing a severe disaster leads to a 1.5 percentage point
increase in net out-migration (8 percent of a standard deviation). Severe disasters are around half
as disruptive to local population as a large negative employment shock. A one standard deviation
decline in local employment growth increases out-migration by 3 percentage points.
       Over the full century, we find that some categories of milder disasters affect net migration
to a county but these effects are small. Below, we show that the migration response to these milder
disasters has increased over time. In the full sample (Table 2), wildfires and hurricanes encourage
out-migration, while floods actually attract in-migrants to an area. Storms and tornados have no
effect on migration flows. The positive effect of floods on in-migration is consistent with earlier
work by part of our research team, which found that migrants moved toward flooded counties
before 1940 (Boustan, Kahn and Rhode 2012). We speculated that areas prone to flooding received
new infrastructure in this period, which may have encouraged new use of previously marginal
land. Here, we find that the positive effect of floods on migration in this series is present only in
the first part of the century. Appendix Table 3 excludes each of the control variables in turn:
controls for expected employment growth, linear time trends by initial population and linear time
trends by state. Migration responses to milder disasters are robust to dropping each control,
whereas migration responses to severe disasters are observed only when allowing for state-specific
time trends (but are robust to excluding other controls). Appendix Table 4 replaces the standard
errors that correct for spatial dependence with standard errors clustered by state and results look
similar.


B. Pre-trends before a disaster strikes
       Our specification compares migration rates within counties before and after a disaster
strikes, relative to comparison counties that do not experience a natural disaster in the decade. The
underlying assumption is that disasters do not coincide with other economic changes at the county
level. To provide support for this assumption, we include several specification checks. First, we
check for parallel trends by including county-specific trends as additional control variables (county
fixed effects interacted with a linear time trend). If disaster-prone counties became increasingly
undesirable for reasons other than disaster incidence, we would find that out-migration is
correlated with disaster incidence, even if this relationship is not causal. Appendix Table 5 finds
similar results after including county-specific time trends.



                                                 13
         Second, we directly investigate whether disasters that will occur in the next decade (leads)
appear to affect out-migration from the county in the current decade. Appendix Table 6 includes
both lags and leads of our disaster severity variable. We find that the disaster lead has a negative
association with net migration, but the estimated effect is only one-third the size of the
contemporaneous effect (0.6 percentage point increase in out-migration, compared to 1.6
percentage point increase) and is not statistically significant. Including lags and leads has no effect
on our estimate of interest.


C. New information about disasters and net out-migration
         A disaster that is fully anticipated – and thus already built into a resident’s decision to
locate in an area – should have no effect on migration decisions. Although climate and weather
models are not reliable enough for the frequency or exact location of any disaster to be entirely
known in advance, some disasters are more anticipated than others. Furthermore, some
unanticipated disasters are perceived to be idiosyncratic events, while others are perceived to
contain new information about the heightened risk of future disaster events. We test for the role of
“new news” in the out-migration response to disaster activity in two ways, first by examining the
changing response to disasters over time, and then by considering differences in response to
disasters that strike areas at high vs. low risk of disaster activity. Because we are only able to
measure net migration flows, we cannot allow for (or test) the possibility that existing residents
and prospective new residents to an area glean more or less information from a given disaster
event.
         The regularity of disasters increased dramatically after 1980 (Figure 1). As a result,
disasters that struck in recent years may contain more information about future disaster risk. Table
3 tests for differences in the migration response to disaster events that occur before and after 1980.
We find no difference in the migration response to severe disasters over this period. However, out-
migration in response to mild disasters increased for nearly every disaster category after 1980,
including floods, hurricanes, and wildfires. As disasters have become more frequent over time,
even milder disasters may become more salient or may actually convey more new information to
households now than in the past. 18


18
   Any changes in general migration costs would be absorbed into decade fixed effects. Yet
national trends suggest that, if anything, internal migration has been falling over time, especially


                                                  14
        An alternative explanation for changes in the responsiveness to disaster events over time
is the advent of coordinated federal disaster management. The Federal Disaster Assistance
Administration (FDAA) was founded in 1973 and became an independent agency, renamed the
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), in 1978. Before that time, the federal
government responded to disasters on a case-by-case basis. However, if emergency management
agencies increased the reliability or generosity of federal disaster relief, we might expect out-
migration in response to disasters to decline over time. 19 If anything, we see the opposite pattern,
with the out-migration response to disasters increasing after 1980. Appendix Table 7 investigates
the relationship between disaster events and FEMA relief payments at the county level. Counties
that faced storms or hurricanes received more FEMA transfers in a given decade, but there is no
association between a severe disaster event and the extent of FEMA funding. As a result,
controlling for FEMA payments does not affect the coefficient of interest in our migration
regression.
        A disaster may convey more “new news” if it strikes an area that otherwise has faced a low
underlying disaster risk. In areas that are regularly hit by disasters, local residents may come to
expect disaster events and may undertake public or private investments to protect themselves from
their consequences. Alternatively, disaster events may be perceived as idiosyncratic events –
flukes of nature – in areas with low disaster risk, and thus may not change expectations of future
events. Table 4 allows the response to a severe disaster to vary by county risk exposure. We
estimate a fixed risk exposure for the full century at the county level as a propensity score based
on geographic characteristics. Column 1 interacts disaster measures with a continuous measure of
risk exposure, while column 2 instead interacts each measure with an indicator for being in the top
quartile of risk exposure. We find no evidence of a heterogeneous out-migration response by risk
exposure for severe disasters. Instead, severe disasters appear to influence location decisions in-
and-of-themselves, rather than providing new information about future realizations of disaster risk
(we note that the main effect of severe disasters is not statistically significant in this specification,
although the magnitude is similar to the core result in Table 2).


in the 1990s, and so we are unlikely to just be picking up greater responsiveness to any decline in
local amenities (Molloy, Smith and Wozniak 2011).
19
   Deryugina (2017) documents that counties struck by hurricanes in the 1980s and 1990s received
around $1,000 (2008 dollars) of additional federal transfers per capita in the decade after a
hurricane event.


                                                   15
D. Local economic growth and net out-migration following a disaster
       The effect of a disaster shock may differ in productive and unproductive areas. Productive
areas may have an inefficiently low density of housing or an inefficient mix of commercial and
residential space due to path dependence. In this case, a natural disaster could allow the area to
“reset” and may thus attract new population. In contrast, otherwise unproductive areas may have
an inefficiently high level of population because of the existing and long-lived housing stock. If
the disaster destroys some housing, the area may instead “reset” to a lower level of population. If
these forms of historical path dependence or hysteresis are common across areas, we would expect
to find a stronger out-migration response from otherwise unproductive areas than from otherwise
productive areas. We define local productivity in two ways: first, by using local employment
growth in the past decade, as estimated by our Bartik estimate in equation (2), and secondly by
using local population growth in the past decade. We split the sample at the median in each decade
into high and low growth areas, and then interact this indicator with each disaster measure.
       Table 5 contains the main effects of each disaster type on the interactions between being a
high-growth area and responsive out-migration. If anything, we find stronger out-migration from
areas that were otherwise experiencing high rates of employment or population growth in the
previous decade. This pattern is contrary to the hypothesis that many local areas in the US are
stuck in inefficient local equilibria, despite the few cases of this phenomenon that have been
documented. We speculate that high growth areas have more scope to respond to local shocks via
net out-migration because they are experiencing both in- and out-migration at baseline, whereas
slower growing areas that are not attracting in-migrants can only respond to shocks if existing
residents choose to leave (see Long and Siu 2018 on this phenomenon after the Dust Bowl).
Another possibility is that residents in high growth areas have lived in the area for fewer years on
average, and so have more potential for learning new information about the local environment
(Kocornik-Mina, et al. Forthcoming).


VI. Home Prices, Family Income and Poverty Rates
       Thus far, we have assumed that out-migration following a disaster event is a proxy for
falling firm productivity without considering alternative channels for the out-migration responses,
including reductions in consumer amenities or direct effects of disasters on destruction of the



                                                16
housing stock. A disaster that destroys a significant amount of housing but has little impact on the
demand for a location should lead to an increase in housing prices, at least in the short run.
Conversely, a disaster that reduces demand for the location should cause a decline in housing
prices. 20 Moreover, a decline in demand driven by lower local amenity levels should be, if
anything, associated with rising wages, whereas a drop in firm productivity should be associated
with falling wages.
       We collect measures of median wages and housing prices and rents at the county level from
Census data, using measures of family income as a proxy for wages. These variables are compiled
at the county level by National Historical Geographic Information System (NHGIS) from 1970-
2010, and so we focus on the more recent decades here. Table 6 reports the relationship between
disaster activity and this broader set of economic outcomes. We start in column 1 by reproducing
the association between severe disaster events and out-migration. This relationship is mirrored in
column 2 by a negative relationship between severe disasters and local population, although this
coefficient is not statistically significant. The out-migration following natural disasters does not
appear to be a response to the rising housing prices that would follow destruction of the local
housing stock. At least at the decadal level, the occurrence of a severe disaster lowers housing
prices by 5.2 percent and rents by 2.5 percent (columns 3 and 4). 21 (We note that the housing stock
in areas hit by a natural disaster does contract, as seen in column 5, but, at the decadal level, there
is enough time for the number of housing units to adjust to track declines in population).
Furthermore, the falling demand for living in areas hit by natural disasters does not seem to be due
to declines in local amenities. If anything, wages in the area appear to decline, as proxied by falling
median family income (column 6).
       Out-migration after a natural disaster may be selective by income level. If rich households
have greater resources to leave an area struck by disaster, out-migration may lead to a higher




20
   Predictions about the effect of natural disasters on housing prices at the decadal level also depend
on whether disasters affect the local elasticity of housing supply (e.g., by encouraging stricter land
use regulations), a factor that we discuss in Section II but do not directly observe.
21
   The implied elasticity of housing prices with respect to population – a 2.5 percent decline in
rents for out-migration representing 1.7 percent of the population – is similar to standard estimates
in the literature (e.g., Saiz, 2007, which looks at the effect of foreign in-migration on rents).


                                                  17
poverty rate among those residents who remain in the area. 22 The poor may also be more willing
to trade off a lower housing price for a heightened risk of disaster activity. Alternatively, natural
disasters may have a causal effect on the probability of falling into poverty for the existing
population, if, for example, some local residents lose their jobs due to falling labor demand in the
area. Column 7 shows that the occurrence of a severe disaster increases the local poverty rate by
0.8 percentage points (10 percent of a standard deviation). We cannot differentiate here between
changes in poverty due to selective out-migration versus causal effects of disaster activity on
income and poverty.


VII. Addressing concerns
A. Robustness to geography and population
        We made a number of choices about variable definitions and specification for our core
results. In this section, we test the robustness of our findings to alternative choices. First, our core
results estimate unweighted regressions, allowing each county to contribute equally to the analysis.
In this way, we treat each county as a separate economy that may be subject to a location-specific
shock in a given period, corresponding to the cross-country regressions common to the climate
economics literature. Appendix Table 8 instead aggregates counties into State Economic Areas
and Appendix Table 9 weights the county-level results by county population in 1930. This
specification puts more weight on disasters that take place in heavily-populated urban areas. In
both cases, the effect of a severe disaster on net migration is similar, but the coefficient is no longer
statistically significant after weighting by county population. 23 We prefer the unweighted results
because weighted regressions put what we feel is excessive emphasis on large metropolitan areas.
Second, our measure of disaster severity is based on a threshold defined according to an absolute
number of fatalities. However, for a given disaster intensity, fatalities have declined over time as
infrastructure and construction have improved (Kahn, 2005). Appendix Table 10 uses a relative
measure of disaster severity, defining severe disasters as any in the top 50 percent (or top 10
percent) of fatalities in a given decade. Results are nearly identical to the preferred specification.


22
   In the climate change literature, there is a broad consensus that the wealthy can access a wide
range of adaptation strategies – of which migration may be one – to protect themselves from shocks
(Dasgupta 2001, Barreca, et. al. 2016, and Smith et. al. 2006).
23
   In Appendix Table 9, standard errors are clustered by state; our implementation of the Conley
standard errors does not support weights.


                                                   18
       Third, population dynamics after a disaster may bias our measurement of migration. Our
specification assumes that disasters do not have long-term effects on birth rates or death rates over
a decade, which is plausible but not certain. Therefore, we run an additional specification using
migration defined for the population between 15-64 (Appendix Table 11). This subset is too old
to be affected by changes in birth rate and excludes the oldest, who are most likely to be affected
by a change in mortality rates. We find similar results in terms of magnitude and significance.
Appendix Table 12 subdivides the population by 10-year age categories. We find that strong out-
migration responses to severe disasters up through middle age (age 35-44), and monotonically
declining responses thereafter, which is consistent with the low mobility rates of older individuals.
       Fourth, counties with larger populations may be more likely to suffer from a severe disaster
(defined as any disaster with 25 or more deaths) because any given disaster event will likely have
a higher death count in a more populated area. Appendix Table 13 reports estimates of the effect
of severe disasters on out-migration, controlling for county population at the start of each decade.
This will absorb the variation in death count due to differences in county levels of population.
Again, the results are qualitatively similar.
       Fifth, we note that our estimates are net effects of disaster on migration activity after all
private and government responses to the disaster event take place (e.g., infrastructure investment,
transfer payments). A disaster at the start of a given decade may trigger infrastructure investments
in flood control or early warning systems that mitigate future risk. New investments may attract
people to an area both because of declines in natural disaster risk and because of short run jobs
stimulus. Our results are unchanged by controlling for new dam construction in the decade, the
largest of such infrastructure projects (see Appendix Table 14). 24


B. Robustness to the political process
       Our dataset is based on disaster declarations by the American National Red Cross or
various federal agencies. There is a political process governing whether the government declares
an official disaster or state of emergency after a given weather event. Ideally, we would have
detailed climatological data to measure the intensity of wind speeds (for hurricanes), seismic


24
  Duflo and Pande (2007) study the productivity and distributional effects of large irrigation dams
in India. They find that rural poverty declines in downstream districts but increases in the district
where the dam is built.


                                                 19
activity (for earthquakes), and so on. However, it is not possible to gather such data for five major
disaster types over a full century. Instead, we present suggestive evidence that the coefficients are
not driven by political factors.
        First, we argue that any political connection that would lead states to receive an
unwarranted disaster designation should generate other sources of discretionary federal funds,
thereby, if anything, leading to net in-migration. Thus, we would expect the political component
of disaster declarations to bias against finding that disasters lead to out-migration or falling
housing prices.
        Second, although the official designation of a mild weather event may be subject to
political manipulation, it is hard to believe that the largest disasters (e.g., Hurricane Katrina) could
be left without a federal declaration. It is not clear a priori how large an event would need to be
before the disaster declaration was effectively depoliticized. Table 7 reports the coefficient on
“severe disaster” for various fatality thresholds, starting with a threshold of only 10 fatalities, and
increasing to an extreme threshold of 500 fatalities. We find a very consistent effect of facing a
severe disaster on net out-migration (coefficients range from -0.012 to -0.017) for all definitions
ranging from 20 deaths to 100 deaths. For larger thresholds, standard errors increase and the
estimates are no longer statistically significant. We find similar results when including county-
specific trends (see Appendix Table 15). 25 Appendix Table 16 demonstrates that the estimated
effect of severe disasters on housing prices and other economic outcomes are also robust to
thresholds between 20 and 100 deaths (ranging from 3.8-5.3 percent); the estimated effect on rents
is more sensitive but generally ranges between -1.0 and -2.6 percent. Above a certain severity
threshold, it appears that households are equally responsive to large disasters and additional
fatalities do not elevate the out-migration rate (except the very largest disasters that were associated
with 500 or more fatalities).
        Third, we split the sample into disasters occurring in a state-year in which the state
governor was of the same party as the President, and state-years in which he/she was not. If disaster
declarations are driven by political considerations, we would expect that state-years with a same
party governor would get more disaster declarations and the actual weather events underlying those
declarations should be weaker, and thus should be less associated with out-migration. We find no


25
  Appendix Table 15 reports standard errors that are clustered by state because of the
computational time required for spatially-dependent standard errors with county-specific trends.


                                                  20
relationship between having a same-party governor and the strength of the out-migration response
to a severe disaster. Results are presented in Appendix Table 17.
        Finally, we instrument for the presence of a severe disaster with the limited set of climatic
variables that are available for the whole century to account for any association between disaster
declarations and local politics. Our instruments are average maximum daily temperature, minimum
daily temperatures and total precipitation by county and decade. Although the instruments do not
rise to conventional levels of statistical power (F-statistics are around 5), we continue to find an
association between the presence of a severe disaster and net out-migration from a county.
Temperature and precipitation may have direct effects on migration decisions, beyond any effect
on disaster prevalence, and so we caution that the instruments may not meet the necessary
exclusion restriction. We include IV results for completeness in Appendix Table 18. 26


VIII. Conclusion
        During the past century, the United States has experienced more than 10,000 natural
disasters. Some have been major newsworthy events, while others have been comparatively mild.
We compile a near-century long series on natural disasters in US counties, distinguishing severe
events by death toll, and find that tAppehese shocks affect the underlying spatial distribution of
economic activity. Counties hit by severe disasters experienced greater out-migration, lower home
prices and higher poverty rates. Given the durability of housing capital, lower demand due to
persistent natural disasters leads to falling rents and acts as a poverty magnet. We find little effect
of milder disasters on population movements or housing prices in the full sample, but document a
growing migration response to mild disasters over time and a stronger response in areas at high-
risk of disaster activity.
        Contrary to recent cross-country studies like Cavallo et al. (2013) and Kocornik-Mina et
al. (Forthcoming) that find near-immediate recovery from large natural disasters (mostly in
developing countries), we find long-term effects of severe disaster events on economic activity at
the county level in the US. Yet, our estimates are much smaller than those arising from case studies
of the nation’s most extreme events, including Hurricane Katrina and the 1927 Great Mississippi
Flood, both of which led to 12 percentage point increases in out-migration (Deryugina et al. 2018;

Hornbeck and Naidu 2014). Instead, we find that the typical severe disaster in the US was
associated with a 1.5 percentage point increase in net out-migration from a county, and
corresponding declines in housing prices/rents. This comprehensive analysis, which is based on
the universe of disaster activity in the US over nearly a century, provides a valuable benchmark
against which future case studies of extreme disaster events can be compared.
       Our finding that severe natural disasters are associated with both out-migration and falling
housing prices suggests that, in the US context, disasters reduce productivity in local areas,
outweighing any destruction of the housing stock. We do not find evidence that disasters shift local
areas out of inefficient equilibria established through path dependence.
       Net out-migration responses have increased over time, which is consistent with larger
responses to disaster events that convey more information about the degree of future disaster risk.
Rapidly growing locations experience a stronger net out-migration response to disaster events,
perhaps because prospective residents choose not to move in. Studying the differential effect (if
any) of natural disasters on in- and out-migration to an area is possible in more recent data and
would be a fruitful area of future research.
       Disaster activity has been increasing over time due to climate change. The National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) tallies that the number of “billion dollar
disasters” (adjusted for inflation) held relatively steady in the 1990s and 2000s at around 55
disasters per decade, but then doubled to 115 disasters in the 2010s. If these 60 additional disasters
occurred in productive coastal places that otherwise would have been attracting in-migration, our
estimates suggest that they will be a drag on these local economies, reducing productive economic
activity and encouraging net out-migration.

Notes: The reported regressions of equation (1) are at the county-by-decade level. Net migration
rates are from Winkler, et al. (2013a, b) and Gardner and Cohen (1992). Population, family
income, poverty rates, housing stock, housing values, and housing rents are from NHGIS. Family
income, housing values, and housing rents are expressed in 1982-84 dollars. Counts of natural
disasters by type and severity are assembled from the ARC, FEMA and EM-DAT data. In this
specification, a disaster qualifies as “severe” if it was associated with 25 or more deaths. We
estimate the employment growth rate from IPUMS data using industrial composition and national
employment trends (see equation 2); weights are based on county employment by industry in 1970.

Notes: Each row corresponds to a separate regression that follows the format of Table 2. We report
coefficients on the indicator for “severe” disasters, varying the threshold required for a disaster to
qualify as severe. Disasters qualify as severe if they equaled or exceeded the number of fatalities
reported in column (1). All regressions include as controls counts of natural disasters by type,
county and decade fixed effects, state-specific time trends and a 1930 population time trend.

from IPUMS data using industrial composition and national employment trends (see equation 2);
weights are based on county employment by industry in 1930. Good weather index computed
with data available from NOAA as: county-specific average daily temperature in the winter of
year 2000 divided by its cross-county standard deviation, minus county-specific average daily
temperature in the summer of year 2000 divided by its cross-county standard deviation. Standard
errors from simple mean-tests are shown in parentheses.

Notes: This table follows the format of Table 3, after adding county-specific trends. Each row
corresponds to a separate regression. We report coefficients on the indicator for “severe” disasters,
varying the threshold required for a disaster to qualify as severe. Disasters qualify as severe if the
percent of the county population affected by the disaster equaled or exceeded the thresholds
reported in column (1). All regressions include as controls counts of natural disasters by type,
county and decade fixed effects, county-specific time trends and a 1930 population time trend.
Standard errors are clustered by state.

coefficients on the indicator for “severe” disasters, varying the threshold required for a disaster to
qualify as severe. Disasters qualify as severe if they exceeded the number of fatalities reported in
column (1). All regressions include counts of natural disasters by type, county and decade fixed
effects, state-specific time trends and a population time trend (using 1930's baseline values).

Note: The reported regression is at the county-by-decade level. Net migration rates are from
Winkler, et al. (2013a, b) and Gardner and Cohen (1992). Counts of natural disasters by type and
incidence of severe disasters are obtained from merging data from the ARC, FEMA and EM-DAT.
In this specification, a disaster qualifies as “severe” if it was associated with 25 or more deaths.
We interact each disaster variable with an indicator for whether the state’s governor belongs to the
same party as the President. The employment growth rate is estimated (see equation 2); weights
are based on county employment in 1930 by industry. Conley standard errors adjusted for spatial
and temporal correlation within 1,000 km and 10 decades (see Hsiang, 2010).

Notes: Each row corresponds to a separate regression. We report coefficients on the indicator for
“severe” disasters for an IV specification and the corresponding OLS that follows Table 2 but
omits the disaster counts by type. In each row we vary the threshold required for a disaster to
qualify as severe. Disasters qualify as severe if they equaled or exceeded the number of fatalities
reported in column (1). The instruments for “severe” disasters are the maximum and minimum
daily temperatures recorded in the year and total annual precipitation averaged out across the
decade. All regressions include counts of natural disasters by type, county and decade fixed effects,
state-specific time trends and a population time trend (using 1930's baseline values). Standard
errors are clustered by state.
