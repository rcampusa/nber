We show that self-fulfilling equilibria and indeterminacy can easily arise in a simple financial accelerator
model with reasonable parameter calibrations and without increasing returns in production. A key
feature for generating indeterminacy in our model is the countercyclical markup due to the procyclical
loan to output ratio. We illustrate, via simulations, that our financial accelerator model can generate
rich business cycle dynamics, including hump-shaped output in response to demand shocks as well
as serial autocorrelation in output growth rates.

1        Introduction

Since the seminal work of Bernanke and Gertler (1990)1 the …nancial accelerator model with
collateral constraints has been widely used to explain the ampli…cation of shocks to business
cycles. Since …rms and businesses face borrowing costs to …nance their working capital which
depends on the collateral value of their assets and output, any downturn or negative shock
that depresses the value of their collateral will curtail their ability to …nance investments and
increase their operating costs. This, in turn, will amplify the downturn. Conversely, any
positive shock that appreciates the value of a …rm’s collateral will decrease the cost of external
…nance, increase pro…tability, and amplify the e¤ect of the initial shock. This mechanism,
however, suggests the possibility of self-ful…lling multiple equilibria: Optimistic expectations
of higher output may well lead to increased lending to …nancially constrained …rms. Even
though our model has no increasing returns in production, the relaxation of the borrowing
constraint implies that unit marginal costs can increase with output as …rms compete for more
labor and capital. In such a case markups can become countercyclical and factor returns can
increase su¢ ciently so that the expectation of higher output can become self-ful…lling. The
purpose of this paper is to show that multiple equilibria and indeterminacy can easily arise in
a simple …nancial accelerator model with realistic parameter calibrations, and that the model
can reasonably match some of the quantitative features of economic data.
        Our paper is related to several other papers on …nancial constraints and business cycle
‡uctuations that ascribe a signi…cant part of such ‡uctuations to …nancial shocks. Examples
include the work of Jermman and Quadrini (2011), Liu, Wang and Zha (2011), Gertler and
Kiyotaki (2011), among many others. But where do …nancial shocks come from? A growing
literature links …nancial constraints to asset bubbles as a source of …nancial shocks. For exam-
ple, Farhi and Tirole (2011), Miao and Wang (2011), Wang and Wen (2012), Miao, Wang and
Xu (2012), and Ventura and Martin (2012) study asset bubbles in economies with borrowing
constraints. They show that the growth and burst of asset bubbles can generate endogenous
‡uctuations in borrowing limits which result in booms and busts in the real economy. A short-
coming of such asset bubble models is that the bubbleless steady state is a sink, and cannot
explain the recurrent ‡uctuations in the borrowing limits unless bubbles arrive exogenously.
        Our paper is also related to the recent paper of Liu and Wang (2010). They show that
…nancial constraints can generate indeterminacy through an endogenous TFP channel as a

result of resource reallocation across …rms. In their model, …rms di¤er in productivity and in
the absence of credit constraints, only the most productive …rms survive while the unproductive
…rms with high costs perish. Some unproductive …rms however continue to produce as the
more productive …rms are …nancially constrained by the value of their assets. An expected
increase in aggregate output increases the value of the assets of all …rms, and relaxes their
borrowing constraints. This relaxation in the borrowing constraints allows more productive
…rms to expand production. This in turn pushes up the factor prices and increases the cost of
production for the unproductive …rms. As some of the unproductive …rms stop producing the
resource reallocation towards more productive …rms generates endogenous increasing return
to scale. Liu and Wang (2010) show that their model is isomorphic to the Benhabib-Farmer
(1994) model after aggregation.
      This paper provides an alternative and complimentary mechanism for indeterminacy to
Liu and Wang (2010). While they emphasize reallocation e¤ects of …nancial constraints, we
focus on an endogenous markup channel. For this purpose, we introduce borrowing constraints
into an otherwise standard Dixit-Stiglitz monopoly competition model. Firms rent capital and
hire labor in the competitive markets to produce di¤erentiated intermediate goods. The …rms
however may default on their promise or contract to repay their debt. We assume therefore
that …rms face borrowing constraints when …nancing their working capital, determined by the
fraction of …rm revenues and assets that the creditors can recover, minus some …xed collection
costs. This constrains the output as well as the unit marginal costs of …rms. Given the …xed
collection costs however, if households expect a higher equilibrium output, they will be willing
to increase their lending to …rms, even if the marginal costs of …rms rise and their markups
decline as they compete for additional labor and capital.2 At the new equilibrium both output
and factor returns will be higher. Despite the income e¤ects on labor supply, the increase in
wages associated with lower markups will allow employment and output to increase, so the
optimistic expectations of higher output will be ful…lled.
      We describe the baseline model in the next section. In particular, section 2.6 provides the
main results characterizing the parameter ranges where equilibrium is indeterminate, as well
as examples and graphical illustrations. Section 3 o¤ers extensions that relaxes the …xed cost
component of the borrowing constraint, eliminates capacity utilization, and provides examples
of indeterminacy under these extensions. The section 4 introduces sunspots into the discrete-
time version of the model, calibrates it to match the moments of US data, and generates impulse

2     A baseline model
2.1     Firms

To illustrate the driving features of our model, we start with a simple benchmark model of
monopolistic competition and borrowing constraints for intermediate goods producers. The
production side is a standard Dixit and Stiglitz model of monopolistic competition. There is
a competitive …nal goods producer that combines a continuum of intermediate goods Yt (i) to
produce …nal goods Yt according to the technology
                                                        Z             1                     1
                                            Yt =            Yt            (i)di                 ;            (1)

where       1. The …nal goods producer solves

where A > 0, 0 <        < 1. We assume symmetry: the technology for producing intermediate
goods is the same for all i. The pro…t for i’th intermediate good producer is

                                   t (i)   = Pt (i)Yt (i)             wt Nt (i)                 rt Kt (i):   (6)

Denote by    t   =   A( )   ( 1wt )1        the unit cost for the intermediate goods …rms. Then their

                                                                  3
The Financial Constraint. Unlike the …nal goods producer, we assume that intermediate
goods producers face …nancial constraints due to limited enforcement. We assume that in the
beginning of each period, the ith intermediate goods …rm decides to rent capital Kt (i) from
the households and hire labor Nt (i). The …rm promises to pay wt Nt (i) + rt Kt (i)                                               bt (i) to
the households. However the …rm may default on its contract or promise. We assume that if
the …rm does not pay its debt bt (i), the households can recover a fraction                                              < 1 of the …rm’s
revenue Pt (i)Yt (i) by incurring a liquidation cost f . One possibility is that the …rm must pay
the labor wages as production takes place , and that creditors can always redeem the physical
capital, but that the interest on borrowing may not be fully recoverable. So if the household
can recover Pt (i)Yt (i)        f , they will lend to the …rm only if Pt (i)Yt (i)                                    f can at least cover
the wage bill plus principal and interest. Knowing that the household cannot recover more
than Pt (i)Yt (i)      f , the …rm will have no incentive to repay more than Pt (i)Yt (i)                                         f . The
incentive-compatiblity constraint for the …rm then is:

                Pt (i)Yt (i)       [wt Nt (i) + rt Kt (i)]                Pt (i)Yt (i)              [ Pt (i)Yt (i)     f] ;            (8)

or
                                      wt Nt (i) + rt Kt (i)                    Pt (i)Yt (i)          f:                                (9)

After substituting Pt (i) from equation (3) into equation (8), the pro…t maximization for the
i0 th …rm becomes

We now turn to the intertemporal optimization problem faced by a representative consumer.
To facilitate the stability analysis of a steady state, we set our model in continuous time. The
instantaneous utility of the representative consumer is given by

along the lines of Greenwood, Hercowitz and Hu¤man (1988). For simplicity we assume that
the households choose the capacity utilization rate et . A higher et implies that the capital is

(11), the intermediate goods producers maximizes its pro…t by choosing Kt (i) and Nt (i); and
all markets clear. Since …rms are symmetric, we have Kt (i) = Kt , Nt (i) = Nt , Pt (i) = 1;
Yt (i) = Yt and       t (i)   =    t   = Yt     wt Nt           rt Kt . The budget constraint becomes

                                                        K_ t = Yt         Ct                   Kt :                                           (22)

The wage wt and the interest rate rt are
                                                                                           Yt

                                                                                           Nt
and
                                                                                  Yt

                                                                                  Kt
Equation (14) becomes
                                                1                                          1
                                           (1       )       t   +    t(      (1                )      t)   = 0:                               (25)

We then have the following lemma regarding the …nancial constraint (11).

                              1                     1
Lemma 1 If (1                     )<   t   <1           , then the …nancial constraint binds; that is
                                                                                           1          1
                                                                                  1

Based on fact that Yt (i) = Yt , the constraint implies
                                                                                      f

                                                                         6
                                                                                                                                                                   1           1

      The intuition for Lemma 1 is as follows. The …rms’pro…t function is                                                                      t (i)   = Yt            (i)Yt
                                                                                                                                                       1
 t Yt (i)   and if the pro…t for the marginal unit evaluated at equilibrium is (1                                                                          )       t   > 0; the
…rms would have the incentive to increase their output. This pro…t on the marginal unit exceeds
                                                                                                                                        1

output level cannot be optimal because …rms would be able to borrow and produce more to
                                                                                        1                                       1

be able to increase their production since the borrowing constraint binds: an additional unit
                                                                                                                                    1
of output would allow the …rms to borrow only an additional (1                                                                          ), which is not enough to
cover the marginal unit production cost                       t   .3
      We will focus on the parameters that make …nancial constraint (11) always binding in
equilibrium. To summarize, the following system of equations fully characterize the equilibrium

2.4       Steady state


We …rst solve for the deterministic steady state. Denote by X the steady state value of Xt .
Unfortunately, the model does not have a full analytical solution for the steady state with the
…xed …nancial cost. In the following, we describe the major steps for solving for steady state
{Y; K; N; e; c; ; r; w}. We …rst express the other variables as a function of the steady state
recursively.

                                        Y                    +1 ,
   1. Using the …rst-order condition    K       =       0e              we have
                                                              1              Y
                                                (e) =
                                                             1+              K
      .

                                            Y
   2. Equation (28) then implies   1+       K   =        so we have

                                                K=                           Y

   3. Combining the above, we have (e) =                0 1+        =       1+        K       = , or

      We normalize   0   such that e = 1.

   4. To solve N we use

                                                                        1+
                                                = 1
                                                                1+
      so that                                       "                            #    1
                                                                                     1+

   5. We then obtain the output
                                                                                 "                        #1

  6. Finally from the de…nition of          =             Y   , we have

                                            f =(                  )Y ( )          ( );                                         (35)

      which determines the steady-state value of . In what follows we can treat the steady
      state value of marginal cost        as a parameter and allow f to adjust.

                                                                                                                1                 1
  7. For the existence of a steady state however we will need to assume (1                                          )<    <1          .
      De…ne    ( )=(           )Y ( ) and       = max0                      ( ): Notice also that

                                                     ( )=             (0) = 0                                                  (36)

      and de…ne       = max0         ( ):

Lemma 2 If 0 < f <         , then equation (35) has at least two solutions such that

                                                     ( )          f =0                                                         (37)

Lemma 3 For 0 < f <          ( (1        )), there is a steady state                       such that (1             )<     < .

                                                 1
Proof: Since    ( )     f < 0 and    ( (1            ))       f > 0, by the intermediate value theorem there
                                                     1
is a steady state     that lies between (1                ) and           such that             ( )    f = 0:

2.5   Log-linearization

After obtaining the steady state (Y; K; N; C; ), we log-linearize the system of equations around
the steady state value. We denote by X^ t the percentage deviation of variable Xt from its steady
                                                                              d(log Ct log C)                       d(log Kt log K)
                          ^ t = log Xt
state value Xt , that is, X                     log X. Let c_t =                     dt                and k_ t =          dt       .
Then the log-linearized system of equations is

Eliminating N^t from equation (40), ^ t from equation (43), and e^t from equation (42) allows us
to obtain the expression for Y^t in terms of capital and consumption. We …rst substitute e^t out
of the production function which gives

Capacity utilization plus the borrowing constraint can therefore induce an apparent "increasing

   Using the factor ^ t = Y^t from (43), the log-linearized Euler condition becomes:

                       "                                                                                             #
                           (1+ )                                  (1+ )
                                    1 (1 + )              1               (   2      1) + 1 (1 + )               2

2.6     Dynamics around the steady state

The local dynamics around the steady state is determined by the roots of J: The trace of the
J is
                                         (1 + )
                       Trace (J) =                            1     (1 + )          1   + (1 + )         2                   (50)

and the determinant of J is

                                                                          1+                                 2
                   det(J) =         [(1 + )   1          1+         2]                   1           2                       (51)

The roots of J, x1 and x2 satisfy the following constraints

                                          x1 + x2 = Trace (J) ;                                                              (52)

and
                                              x1 x2 = det(J):                                                                (53)

If det(J) > 0 and Trace(J) < 0, then the roots x1 and x2 will both be negative, and the model
will have local indeterminacy around the steady state. Since given other parameters the trace
and determinant are functions of        and , we will …rst examine the possibility of indeterminacy
in the parameter space of       and . We will then use the mapping between ( , ) and (f , ) to
establish the possibility of indeterminacy supported by the deep parameters of the model.


Proposition 1 Let       and      satisfy the following two constraints

                                                       (1 + ) (1 + )
                                (1 + ) >                                                                                     (54)
                                                   (1 + ) + (1 + )(1                         )




                                                              11
and
                                                              1+
                                        1+                          (1 + )
                       1+     < min(             ;                   ;                               (55)
                                               (1 + ) + (1 + )(1   )
                                            (1    )(1 + )
                                                                 + 1)
                                   (1 + )(1    ) 1+ 1   + (1 + )
Then
                                    T race (J) < 0; det(J) > 0                                       (56)

Proof: See Appendix A1.
   To gain intuition for self-ful…lling expectations of higher output and higher factor rewards,
we …rst focus on labor demand and supply curves incorporating the equilibrium e¤ects of the
borrowing constraint on marginal costs and markups. The labor demand curve is given by

                       ^t = (1 + )Y^t
                       w                     ^t = (1 + )(1 + )(1
                                             N
                                                                              )
                                                                                  1                  (57)
                                                     1+     (1 + )
and the labor supply curve in the economy is

                                         ^t = C^t + N
                                         w          ^t :                                             (58)

The slope of the labor market demand curve is positive and steeper than that of the labor
                                                    (1+ )(1+ )
supply curve under the condition (1 + ) >        (1+ )+(1+ )(1       )   of the Proposition above. The in-
determinacy result then parallels the results in Benhabib and Farmer (1994) and Wen (1998).
However unlike their works, our model has no increasing returns in the production technol-
ogy. Instead indeterminacy arises from the borrowing constraints and their indirect e¤ects on
marginal costs through wages and the rental rate on capital. If households expect a higher
equilibrium output, they will be willing to increase their lending to …rms: Given positive …xed
collection costs f; an expected increase in output levels relaxes the borrowing constraint so
                                                      f
that the unit marginal costs of …rms,    t   =        Yt ;   can rise and markups can fall. This implies
that as …rms compete for inputs, factor rewards will also increases with Yt . The labor demand
curve incorporating these general equilibrium e¤ects on marginal costs will then be positively
sloped and steeper than the labor supply curve. Normally, higher output levels increase the
demand for leisure, so barring inferiority in preferences, the higher demand for labor will be
contained by the income e¤ect on labor supply. However if the labor demand slopes up more
steeply than labor supply, employment will increase robustly as the labor supply curve shifts
to the left with income e¤ects. The rise in labor hours as well as the accumulation of capital
will raise output, so that the optimistic output expectations of households will be self-ful…lling.

                                                     12
    We can in fact show that indeterminacy results will hold even in the absence of variable
capacity utilization, but we include it in our model to improve calibration results in the next
section.

    Before turning to calibrations, we formally state the indeterminacy result of the paper. We
de…ne the set
                           = f( ; )jconstraint(54); constraint(55)are satisf iedg

.

                                                           1                              1                             1
Proposition 2 For ( ; )2                 ,        < 1          and          =         <       1    (that is      1           <     ),
construct the set          ={( ; f ) : j such that             =       ;     f = (        )Y ( ) and ( ; )2                 }. For
( ; f) 2    , the model is indeterminate.

Proof: For ( ; f ) 2        , by construction we can …nd a solution for                           and   such that

                                              =           ; f =(             )Y ( )                                              (59)

and since ( ; )2            , by Proposition 1, we have T race < 0; det(J) > 0. So the model is
indeterminate around the steady state.



Example 1 Suppose             = 0:3,        = 0,     = 10; = 0:01, and                = 31 . We set           = 0:11,       = 0:88,
and     = 10:In this case from ( ; f ) 2              we have

                                                  min (   )<       <   max (    )                                                (60)

where
                                        max (     ) = 0:2311;       min (   ) = 0:0833                                           (61)
             1                      1
and     <        1   and   <1           are satis…ed. This steady state is supported by                          = 0:9768 and
f = 0:1908. The implied markup is 12%:


    Figure 2 illustrates the combinations of f and                          that yield indeterminacy with the other
                                             1
parameters set to          = 0:3,       =    3,    = 0:01. The feasible parameter values for f and                               are
graphed in these two shaded areas. Consider the borrowing constraint f = (                                                  )Y ( ):
For a given          there exist a minimum f and a maximum f consistent with the steady state

                                                               13

equilibrium such that                <        <            . Notice that if f = 0 and                  = , as long as       <        1,
                   1                     1
the condition           <       <            is automatically satis…ed. This implies that for                           <       1   the
minimum f is zero. But if                         1   then f = 0 is no longer consistent with the equilibrium.
                                                                         1
If f is too small, then             will be larger than                      . Since f = (               )Y ( ) is decreasing in
 ; the lower bound for f is fmin ( ) = (                                1 )Y   (   1)   for              1.   We can write it as
fmin ( ) = max(             1       Y(       1 ); 0) for    0<           1. On the other hand if f is too large, then
                                                    1                                              1                1
the marginal cost will fall below                      . Now maximizing f over                            <     <       the upper
                                                       1
bound for f for a given         is fmax ( ) =               Y(     1    ). For these feasible parameters, if f is greater
than some cut-o¤ level, then the implied                           will be bigger than           min .    It turns out that the
condition   <     max   is automatically satis…ed. The cut-o¤ f can be determined by

                                                             min
                            fcut ( ) = maxf                             Y(               ); fmin ( )g:
                                                       1+        min         1+    min

For any f such that fmax ( )                    f < fmax ( ), we have                     >    min ,    so the model is locally
indeterminate around the steady state. In Figure 2, the indeterminacy region is shown in red.

3     Discussion and extensions of the model
3.1     The role of …xed costs

In this section we argue that it is not the …xed liquidation costs per se that generates indeter-
minacy. It is the procyclical leverage generated by …xed liquidity costs that is the source of
indeterminacy. Note that with …xed costs the debt to GDP ratio
                                                            bt           f
                                                               =                                                                (62)
                                                            Yt           Yt
is procyclical. In what follows, we construct an example in which the …rm’s borrowing constraint
is
                                                           Yt 1 1         1

                                               t Yt (i)      )Yt(    (i)Yt ;                                                    (63)
                                                           Y
                                                                                                                    0
where     t   = ( YYt ) <         1
                                      is an increasing function of YYt with (1) =                     <   1   and       (1) =      .
                                                                                          1               1
In this case, the marginal cost is              t   =     t.   The condition          t       <   t   <       is automatically
satis…ed, so the borrowing constraint is binding. The equilibrium can be characterized by a
system of nonlinear equations similar to equations (28) to (33), except that equation (33) is
now replaced by           t   =   t   = ( YYt ). The log-linearized system of equations, however, is exactly
the same as equations (38) to (43). So we can directly invoke Proposition 2 if

                                                    min (      )<    <    max (   )                                             (64)

for 0 <        <     1
                         . The more general function ( YYt ) which replaces the …xed liquidation cost
eliminates the constraint relating             and          in the benchmark model, and provides more ‡exibility
in generating a range of parameters such that indeterminacy holds.

3.2     The role of capacity utilization

With the more general function ( YYt ), we now show that endogenous capacity utilization is not
essential for indeterminacy even though it makes indeterminacy possible for a wider range of
parameters, as demonstrated by Wen (1998). The equilibrium is characterized by:

                        0
 (1) = 0:88 and             (1) = 0:88 . This implies                    = 0:88 in the steady state. The model is
indeterminate if 0:5 <          < 0:5582.

3.3      The relationship between our model and Wen’s (1998) model

In this section, we show that one variant of our benchmark model is isomorphic to the model
by proposed by Wen (1998), which is an extension of the work of Benhabib and Farmer (1994).
Suppose that the …rms are owned by entrepreneurs instead of households. To simplify the alge-
bra we assume that entrepreneurs do not save4 , and that they consume their pro…t period-by-
period. Denote the consumption of entrepreneurs by Cte = (1                                   t )Yt   and let Ct be households’
consumption. The equations that characterize the equilibrium are similar to equations (28) to
(33) except that equation (29) is replaced by

                                            K_ t =     t Yt        (et )Kt        Ct :                                    (73)

The linearized equations are similar to equations (38) to (43) except that equation (39) is now

                                              (1 + )
                                       k_ t =                       (Y^t + ^ t       C^t ):                               (74)
  4
      This can be justi…ed by the assumption that they are less patient.




                                                               16
And after substitution the dynamics can be characterized by:
                           "                                                                              #
                             (1+   )

                         =                                                                                                       (75)
                    c_t               1                  2                                                    C^t

where
                                       ! 1 (1 + ) + (1 + )                  !2                       !2
                            1    =                                               ;   2   =                  ;                    (76)
                                              ! 2 (1 + )                                     !2      (1 + )
                 (1+ )                        (1        )(1+ )(1+ )
and ! 1 =   1+      (1+ )   and ! 2 =              1+       (1+ ) .
    Indeterminacy in this model can be characterized by the following Proposition:

                       (1        )(1+ )(1+ )                                                 (1+ )(1+ )
Proposition 4 If            1+       (1+ )         > (1 + ) or 1 +                   >   (1+ ) +(1   )(1+ ) ,       then the model is
indeterminate.

Proof: See Appendix A3.
    Notice that the Jacobian matrix for the model of Wen (1998) with externality in production

                                              Yt = (et Kt Nt1          ) et Kt Nt1               ;                               (77)

is the the same as in equation (75). So our model is observationally equivalent to the model of
Wen (1998) in terms of the dynamics of consumption and capital.


4    Simulation exercises

In this section, we write the model in discrete time and solve it by log-linearizing the equations
that characterize the equilibrium around the steady state. We adopt a standard parameter-
                   1
ization:     =    1+   = 0:99;            = 1=3;            = 0:033;         = 10 and                 = 0:3. We set        = 0:9768,
f = 0:1908 and …x the productivity level to A = 1. These parameter values imply steady state
                                     f =Y
values     = 0:88 and        =         f =Y   = 0:11. We begin without fundamental shocks. In the case of
indeterminacy, the model’s solution takes the form

                                              K^ t+1                  K^t                    0

where M is a two-by-two matrix and "t+1 = C^t+1 Et C^t+1 is the sunspot shock. The remaining

where H is a four-by-two matrix. Figure 3 shows the impulse responses of output, investment,
consumption and hours to an unexpected one percentage increase in the initial consumption
level induced by the agent’s optimistic expectations about future income.

                       Figre 3. Impulse Responses to a consumption (sunspot) Shock.

   The impulse response functions resemble those obtained in the models with increasing
returns to scale. From Figure 3 we see that output, investment, consumption and hours comove.
The impulse responses also demonstrate that labor is slightly more volatile than output, an
important feature of the data that the standard RBC model has di¢ culty explaining with a
TFP shock. The impulse responses also show cycles in output, investment, consumption and
hours, so the model has the potential to explain the boom-bust patterns often observed in
data. However, as in the models with increasing returns to scale, the extremely large impact
of autonomous consumption on output and investment seems empirically unjusti…ed. In the
impact period, one percentage increase in consumption leads to a 27 percent increase in output
and a 116 percent increase in investment.


                                                     18
   These volatile responses of output and investment can be understood by studying the e¤ect
of consumption on labor. Equating the labor demand (57) and labor supply (58) we have

                                  ^t =                    1
                                  N      (1+ )(1+ )(1         )
                                                                        C^t :                              (80)
                                           1+ (1+ )               1

        (1+ )(1+ )(1    )
where     1+ (1+ )          1 is the slope of the labor demand curve and                  is the slope of the
labor supply curve. When these two slopes are close, a one percentage increase in autonomous
consumption increase can lead to huge increases in labor and hence output. Denote s as the
ratio of steady state investment to income. Then from the resource constraint,

                                         sI^t + (1    s)C^t = Y^t ;                                        (81)

so it is clear that the combination of smooth consumption and volatile income will make in-
vestment even more volatile as s << 1. In the current calibration s = 0:23. So the response of
investment upon impact will be about 4.4 times that of output.

the only driving force. All moments for the model are calculated analytically. The table
shows that all variables are positively correlated with output. The correlations between them
are also highly persistent. By our construction, the sunspots are i.i.d., so the persistence of
the variables is not due to the persistence of exogenous shocks, but comes from the internal
propagation mechanism of the model. Table 1 con…rms that labor is slightly more volatile than
output. The relative volatility of labor is 1.10 in the data and 1.08 in the model while the
relative volatility of labor is 0.53 in the real business cycle model (see table 2).

          Note: Variables (Y; N; C; I;     ) denote output, labor (in hours), consumption,
       investment and marginal cost respectively. The marginal cost in the data can be

       computed via       =        1       .   X= Y        is the standard deviation of variable X
       relative to output, corr(X; Y ) computes the correlation between X and output,
       and corr(Xt ; Xt   1)   computes the …rst-order autocorrelation of Xt .

   To better match the relative volatilities of consumption and output we now introduce a
TFP shock into the model. We assume that the technology level in the economy follows an
AR(1) process
                                          A^t+1 =     ^ +

Following Benhabib and Wen (2004), we assume the sunspots shocks and technology shocks are
correlated. Following King and Rebelo (1999) , we assume                       a   = 0:98. The technology shock
"at and sunspot shocks "t are assumed to be perfectly correlated and the relative volatility of
sunspot and technology shocks is set to             s= "    = 1:5. These bring the relative volatility of
consumption closer to data. The moments with correlated TFP shocks and sunspots shocks
are in Table 2.

          The RBC model refers to f = 0, so                = 0, and        =       is a constant. We select
       the parameter values such that the two models have the same steady state. For the
       RBC model, we use TFP shocks with             a   = 0:98 as the only driving force.

   Hump-Shaped output Dynamics The above simulation exercises show that our model
with indeterminacy has a similar ability to that of the RBC model to match some key moments
in the data. In the simulation exercise that follows, we illustrate how our indeterminacy model
can also predict some aspects of actual ‡uctuations that standard RBC models cannot explain,
such as the hump-shaped, trend-reverting impulse response of output to transitory demand
shocks, and the substantial serial correlation in output growth rates in the data (see Cogley


                                                      20
and Nason(1995)). Since there is signi…cant empirical evidence favoring demand shocks as a
main source of business cycles, (e.g., see Blanchard and Quah(1989), Waston (1993), Cogley
and Nason (1995) and Benhabib and Wen (2004) ), it is important to examine whether demand
shocks can generate persistent business cycles. We consider two types of demand shocks as in
Benhabib and Wen (2004): government spending shocks and preference shocks. With preference
                                                                                                        Nt1+
shocks the period-by-period utility function is now given by U = exp(              t ) log Ct           1+     . We
assume that the preference shocks      t   follow an AR(1) process, namely     t 1 + " t.
                                                                                       t   =
                                                                              _
With government spending in period t, Gt ; the resource constraint changes to Kt = Yt
 (et )Kt    Ct   Gt . We assume that log(Gt ) =       g   log(Gt   1)   + "gt . We choose       g   =      = 0:90
as in Benhabib and Wen (2004). To highlight the e¤ect of indeterminacy on the propagation
mechanism of RBC models, we graph the impulse responses to a persistent government spending
shock with and without indeterminacy in Figure 4. Figure 5 graphs the impulse response of
the model to a persistent preference shock. For the model without indeterminacy we set f = 0
and reset    = 0:88 so that the models with and without indeterminacy have the same steady
state.
   Several features of Figure 4 deserve particular mention. First, in the case of f = 0, the
marginal cost    t   =   is a constant. Hence the impulse responses of our model with …nancial
constraints resemble those of a standard RBC model. Figure 4 and Figure 5 show that the
standard RBC model has di¢ culty in generating business cycle ‡uctuations. Figure 4 shows
that consumption and investment move against each other after a positive government spending
shock. An increase in government spending generates a negative wealth e¤ect, which reduces
both consumption and leisure. The decrease in leisure leads to an increase in output, and
an increase in output together with a decrease in consumption imply that investment has to
increase. Second, even though the model generates comovement without indeterminacy under
persistent preference shocks, the responses of output to such demand shocks are monotonic.
Neither government spending shocks nor preference shocks can generate the hump-shaped out-
put dynamics observed in the data. And these monotonic and persistent output responses to
demand shocks mostly come from the persistence of shocks, not from an inner propagation
mechanism of the model. If the persistence of the shocks is reduced, the persistence of output
responses will be reduced accordingly. Third, when the model is indeterminate, the responses
of output to both the government spending shocks and the preference shocks are dramatically
changed. Figure 4 and Figure 5 clearly shows persistent and hump-shaped responses of output
to both shocks. In addition, these persistent responses of output are not due to the persis-


                                                 21
tence in shocks. As Figure 3 has already demonstrated, the model with indeterminacy can
generate persistent ‡uctuations even under i.i.d shocks. Figure 4 and Figure 5 again highlight
the similarity of our indeterminacy model with those based on increasing returns to scale, so
it has the ability to explain other puzzles. For example, Benhabib and Wen (2004) demon-
strate that their indeterminacy model based on increasing returns to scale can explain the
forcecastable-movement puzzle pointed out by Rotemberg and Woodford (1996). It is easy
to show that our indeterminacy model can also replicate the highly forecastable comovements
observed in changes in output, hours, investment and consumption highlighted by Rotemberg
and Woodford (1996). To avoid repetition, we skip such a simulation exercise and refer readers
to Benhabib and Wen (2004). In brief, these simulation exercises illustrate the ability of our
indeterminacy model to replicate rich business cycle dynamics observed in the data.

5    Conclusion

We conclude that borrowing or collateral constraints can be a source of self-ful…lling ‡uctu-
ations in economies that have no increasing returns to scale in production. Expectations of
higher output can relax borrowing constraints, and …rms can expand their output by bidding
up factor prices and eliciting a labor supply response that allows the initial expectations to be
ful…lled. The parameter ranges and markups that allow self-ful…lling expectations to occur are
within realistic ranges and compatible with US macroeconomic data. Simulating our data we
obtain moments and impulse responses that match the US macroeconomic data reasonably well.

It follows that
                                                                   1
                                                                             < 0;                                              (A.3)
                                                         +1        (1 + )! 1
and
                         1+
                                       1          ! 2 (1 + )         (1 + )! 1

                      (1 + )               (1 + )             (1 + )                           (1 + )(1   )
                =                                                                  (1 + )
                                                      1+        (1 + )                        1+     (1 + )
                                                     1+
                =                                f         (1 + )          (1 + )[ (1 + ) + (1 + )(1                     )]g
                  1+              (1 + )
                > 0:                                                                                                           (A.4)

So the trace is negative. Finally we have
                1+                (1 + )[! 2 (1 + ) 1] + ! 1                                 !1

                                        + 1 (1 + )! 1                              +1        (1 + )! 1
             1+
      =                                    f(1 + )(1           )     [(1       )(1 + )=(1 +                   ) + (1 + ) ] g
        (1 + )! 1                      1
      > 0

so the determinant is positive. Q.E.D.

A. 2     The Proofs of Proposition 3

In the case without capacity utilization, the trace is
                                 +
              T race =                     1   + ( + )(1 + )                  2         ;
                                                 +                            (1 + )
                       =                                                  (                      (1 + )(1               ))             :
                                 +1            (1 + )(1               )
                                         (1+ )                                         (1  )
The second line uses    1   =        +1 (1+ )(1      )   and              2   =    +1 (1+ )(1             ).   The determinant is

               det(J)                  +
                            =                  [(1 + )       1   +        2       1] + [1        (1 + )(            1   +       2 )]             (A.6)
               ( + )
                                       +
                            = [                    ][(1 + )               1   +    2        1]        2

                                                                                                                                            det(J)
The necessary and su¢ cient condition for indeterminacy is that Trace (J) < 0 and                                                           ( + )    > 0.
Under the condition     + 1 < (1 + )(1                       ) the trace is negative if
                                    1                        1+
                                                         (                    (1 + )(1                )) <                  :                    (A.7)
                       +1        (1 + )(1            )                                                              +
or
                   (1 + )
                                     (1 + )(1            )>[ +1                        (1 + )(1                )]           :                    (A.8)
                                                                                                                    +
If we rearrange terms we have
                                 1
                                                   (1 + ) > (1 + )(1                              )             :                                (A.9)
                                           +                                                          +
So the necessary and su¢ cient condition for the trace to be negative is:
                                                                                   1
                                                                                             +
                             (1 + ) < (1 + )(1                            )<                     (1 + ):                                        (A.10)
                                                                                   1         +

                                                                                                     (1+ )                                     (1  )
We now check the sign of the determinant. Substituting                                  1   =    +1 (1+ )(1             );       2   =     +1 (1+ )(1       )
, we obtain
                       det(J)                    +                   (1
                                                                )(1 + )   (1 +                                      )
                                       = [                       ]
                       ( + )                                (1 + )(1    ) 1
                                                         (1     )
                                                                                                                                                (A.11)
                                                 (1 + )(1     ) 1
Under the condition     +1            (1 + )(1               ) < 0, det(J) > 0 is equivalent to

                            (1         )(1 + ) > (1 +                         ) + (1             )    +
                                                                                                                                                (A.12)

which implies that     can not be too big. Q.E.D.

                                                                     25
A. 3     The Proof of Proposition 4

The determinant is

                                          (1 +                  )
                            det(J) =                                [      1   +    2]

                                          (1 +                  )   (1 ! 1 )(1 + )
                                      =                                                                        (A.13)
                                                                     ! 2 (1 + )

and the trace is

                             (1 +         )
              Trace (J) =                         (   1   + 1) +           2                                   (A.14)
                              (1 +            )           !2                                          1
                        =                         [                                ! 1 (1 + )]
                                                      (1 +             )                         !2   (1 + )

Trace(J) is negative if and only if

                                                                (1 +               )
                                     ! 2 < ! 1 (1 + )                                  :                       (A.15)

The above constraint is equivalent to

                              (1      ) (1 + ) < (1 + ) (1 +                               );                  (A.16)

Notice that
                      (1 + ) (1 +             )>1+                      >1+                       :            (A.17)
