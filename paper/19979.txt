                                           ABSTRACT

While much is now known about the effects of physical health shocks to pregnant women on the
outcomes of the in-utero child, we know little about the effects of psychological stresses. One clear
form of stress to the mother comes from the death of a parent. We examine the effects of the death of
the mother’s parent during pregnancy on both the short-run and the long-run outcomes of the infant.
Our primary specification involves using mother fixed effects—comparing the outcomes of two
children with the same mother but where a parent of the mother died during one of the pregnancies—
augmented with a control for whether there is a death around the time of the pregnancy in order to
isolate true causal effects of a bereavement during pregnancy. We find small negative effects on birth
outcomes, and these effects are bigger for boys than for girls. The effects on birth outcomes seems
to be driven by deaths due to cardiovascular causes suggesting that sudden deaths are more difficult
to deal with. However, we find no evidence of adverse effects on adult outcomes. The results are
robust to alternative specifications.

                                                           Much is now known about the effects of shocks to the physical health of pregnant women

on the outcomes of the in-utero children, with evidence that adverse health or nutrition shocks to

pregnant women have significant and often long-lasting effects on the outcomes of their

children.1 However, much less is known about the effects of psychological stresses. This is

despite the fact that, in developed countries, this type of stress is likely more prevalent than

nutritional deficits during pregnancy. In an article in the New York Times on July 21, 2011

entitled, “The Pregnant Superwoman,” the author discusses the role of stress during pregnancy

and how society should, or should not, respond.2 However, a key underlying assumption of this

and other popular discussion is that we have actually identified the effect of stress while pregnant

on the children’s outcomes, and it is not clear that that is true.

                                                           There are a number of mechanisms through which stress can affect a developing fetus.

One plausible biological mechanism is that stress triggers the production of a placental

corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH), which has been shown to lead to reduced gestational

age and low birth weight. (Hobel and Culhane, 2003). In addition, stress suppresses the immune

system, thereby making pregnant mothers more susceptible to sickness, and can cause high blood

pressure, which increases the chance of having pre-term labor or a low birth weight infant.

Finally, there may be adverse behavioral responses to stress, such as smoking cigarettes or

drinking alcohol, which can also have adverse effects on the health of the fetus.

                                                           In general, it is difficult to identify the causal effect of stress due to the difficulty of

separating out the stress effect from the direct effect of the event causing the stress (natural

disaster exposure, for example). In this paper, we use register data on the population of Norway

to examine the effect of stress caused by the death of a pregnant woman’s parent on both the

short-run and long-run outcomes of her children.3

                                                           While using parental death as a shock to the stress level of the mother eliminates a

number of the problems faced by earlier identification strategies, some issues do remain. First,

parental death can affect individuals in many ways other than through stress.4 In particular,

parents may be important sources of educational funding or parents and children may co-

reside—as a result, parental death might represent a shock to one’s lifestyle or income. To

reduce the potential impact of these issues, we restrict the sample to women who have children

between the ages of 25-45, when they are less likely to be dependent on parental resources. We

also conduct a number of specification checks to confirm that it is not the loss of help during the

pregnancy that is driving our results.

                                                           Second, individuals who have a parent die younger are not a random sample of the

population. Lower income families are likely to both have parents who die earlier and poorer

child outcomes, both in the short-run and in the longer-run. To deal with this, we integrate two

approaches in our estimation strategy. The first is the use of mother fixed effects, thereby

comparing two children born to the same mother, with the mother experiencing a parental death

during only one of the pregnancies.5

                                                           However, mother fixed effects may be inadequate if parental deaths are correlated with

time-varying characteristics of the mother. Therefore, our estimation strategy also includes a

control for whether a death occurs in a short window around the pregnancy. This allows us to

  The death of a parent of the father may also increase the stress levels of the mother during pregnancy. We have
investigated this issue and found no evidence for any adverse effect of such an event on child outcomes.
4
  The death of a parent is generally regarded as a very stressful event. For example, the Holmes-Rahe Stress
Inventory treats the death of a close family member as the fifth most stressful life event (the death of a spouse is
considered to be the most stressful life event).
5
  Much of the research in the literature on child outcomes has used mother fixed effects, for example Currie and
Rossin-Slater (2013).

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    4	  
	  
isolate the effect of a death during pregnancy from the effect of a death in the general time period

around pregnancy.

       Finally, there is also the mechanical relationship that a parental death is more likely to

occur during pregnancy if the gestation period is longer. To account for this, we instrument the

occurrence of a death during pregnancy with whether a death occurred during the 9 months

following conception.

       We find that a parental death experienced while pregnant leads to small negative effects

on birth outcomes, including birth weight and APGAR scores, and these effects appear to be

bigger for boys than for girls. When we look by cause of death, we find that the effects are

largest when cardiovascular disease is the cause of death, tentatively suggesting that more

unexpected deaths have bigger adverse effects. However, despite these negative effects at birth,

we find no evidence for adverse effects on the children’s outcomes later in life, suggesting no

persistent negative effects.

       The paper unfolds as follows. Section 2 discusses the related literature, while Section 3

describes our empirical strategy. Section 4 describes our data, and Section 5 presents our results

for short-run effects on birth outcomes. Section 6 describes the robustness checks and examines

heterogeneous effects. In Section 7, we show the longer-run effects on education and wages.

Section 8 then concludes.



2. Related Literature

       There is a large literature examining the effects of physical insults to the mother while

pregnant on the outcomes of the children. This includes studies on the effects of the 1918 flu

epidemic (Almond, 2006), the 1957 Asian flu pandemic (Kelly, 2011), the 1959 to 1961 Chinese



                                                                                                    5	  
	  
famine (Almond, Edlund, Li, and Zhang, 2010), the Dutch famine in 1945-46 (Scholte, van den

Berg, and Lindeboom 2012), exposure to radiation (Almond, Edlund and Palme, 2009 and Black,

Buetikofer, Devereux and Salvanes, 2013), temperature during gestation (Bruckner et al. 2014),

and the effects of maternal smoking and drinking (Currie, Neidell and Schmieder, 2009; Fertig

and Watson, 2009).6

                                                           There is a more limited amount of research examining the effects of stress while pregnant

on children’s outcomes. The majority of these studies focus on stress induced by large disasters,

such as earthquakes (Glynn et al., 2001; Torche 2011), extreme weather events, such as

hurricanes (Simeonova, 2011 and Currie and Rossin-Slater, 2013), the terrorist attacks of 9/11

(Berkowitz et al., 2003, and Lauderdale, 2006), and the prevalence of landmines in Columbia

(Camacho, 2008). These studies tend to find a negative effect of stress on children’s outcomes at

birth. However, a key limitation of this work is that these disasters may have direct effects on

the pregnant women, and hence the effects we observe are due to the combination of the direct

(physical) and indirect (through stress) effects on the mother.

                                                                There are a number of exceptions. Aizer, Stroud and Buka (2012) use a sample of

pregnancies from the early 1960s in Providence and Boston and estimate sibling fixed effects

models of the effects of cortisol levels (a marker for maternal stress) during pregnancy on

educational attainment. While this study has the advantage of having a direct measure of stress

(cortisol levels), it is somewhat limited by small sample sizes. Additionally, there remains the

concern that stress levels are correlated with unobserved events that have direct effects on the

mother.

                                                           There are also a few papers that examine the effect of stress resulting from the death of

someone close to the pregnant mother on the birth outcomes of the children.

Hartig (2001) examine the effect of the assassination of Olaf Palme in Sweden on pregnancy

outcomes just after but need to rely on time-series variation. Importantly, because we have

information on all Norwegian deaths, we can fully control for month and year of birth. Using

micro data from Denmark, Li et al. (2010) compare the Body Mass Index (BMI) of children of

mothers who experienced a death during pregnancy to children of those who did not. However,

a key limitation is that this study does not deal with the non-random timing of fertility or deaths.

Our paper attempts to isolate the causal effect of stress by taking into account the non-random

timing of fertility and deaths.



3. Empirical Approach

                                                           As previously noted, because family deaths are not randomly assigned, a simple

regression of birth weight on an indicator of whether the mother experienced the death of a

parent while pregnant may lead to inconsistent estimates of the effect of stress on birth outcomes.

Poorer families have lower life expectancy, suggesting parents are more likely to die relatively

young. Therefore, the existence of a parental death while pregnant is likely to be correlated with

the unobserved characteristics of the mother and child.7 In order to obtain consistent estimates,

we use an estimation method that includes both mother fixed effects and a comparison between

the effects of a death during a pregnancy and the effects of a birth immediately before or after.

                                                           By incorporating mother’s fixed effects, we are exploiting the fact that many mothers

have more than one birth during the sample period. If a mother has two births, by chance, one

pregnancy might coincide with the death of one of the mother’s parents. By comparing the

outcomes of the two births, we can evaluate the effect of the death, differencing out any time-

  Appendix Table 1 presents summary statistics of the characteristics of those mothers who experienced a parental
loss while pregnant compared to those who did not.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    7	  
	  
invariant characteristics of the mother or family background more generally that could bias the

results.8 In order to implement this design, we restrict the sample to mothers who have at least

two births and include mother fixed effects in the regression.9

                                                           While the mother fixed effect helps eliminate differences in the fixed family

characteristics of those who are more likely to lose a parent at a younger age, there may still be

time-varying factors correlated with the death of a parent (for example, caring for a sick parent).

To address this, we augment the fixed effects approach by including an indicator equal to one if

the mother experienced a parental death at any point in the period right before, during, or right

after pregnancy. For mothers who experience a parental death either during pregnancy or just

before or after pregnancy, it may be a matter of chance whether the death occurs specifically

before, during, or after pregnancy. Therefore, conditional on a death around the time of

pregnancy, whether or not the death occurs during pregnancy can be considered to be random.

With this control, the indicator for death during pregnancy now reflects the additional effect of

having a death during pregnancy.

                                                           We implement this approach by choosing a window based on the conception date (as

gestation is potentially endogenous). Our benchmark window includes all births in which a

grandparent death occurs in the year before the conception date, during the 9-month interval after

the conception date, or in the year immediately following this 9-month interval. Appendix Table

2 presents summary statistics by the timing of parental death to provide a basic sense of the

comparison we are making—we are essentially comparing the outcomes for those children

  To the extent that the investment behavior of mothers responds to the relative endowments of her children,
estimates using mother fixed effects may be biased. Compensating responses could reduce endowment effects while
re-enforcing behavior would increase them. Clearly, investment responses by parents are a much bigger issue for
later child outcomes than they are for birth outcomes that are realized before the child’s endowment is known.
9
  Table 1 provides a comparison of the summary statistics of the full sample of births and our reduced sample, where
the restriction we impose is that there must be at least two births for each mother. Based on observable
characteristics, the samples look quite similar.	  

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    8	  
	  
whose mother experienced a death while pregnant (in utero) relative to those who experienced it

just before or after—and, observably, these groups are quite similar. However, in the

regressions, we also include mother fixed effects to control for any unobserved mother

characteristics that might be related to the probability of experiencing a death during pregnancy.

       A final issue that arises in estimating the effect of a pregnant woman’s parental death on

children’s outcomes is the mechanical relationship between duration of pregnancy and

probability of experiencing a death. While gestation generally lasts about 9 months, it varies

across pregnancies. If a pregnancy lasts longer, it is more likely that a grandparent death occurs

during the gestation period. This leads to a mechanical positive relationship between a death in

utero and gestation length. Given that gestation is correlated with birth weight and other birth

outcomes, this relationship biases against finding a negative effect of family deaths on birth

outcomes.

       We deal with this issue by adopting an instrumental variable strategy used by Currie and

Rossin-Slater (2013). Since we observe gestation length in the data, we can figure out the

conception date counting backwards from the birth date. We create a predicted gestation period

as the period from the conception date until 9 months after the conception date and measure

family deaths that take place during this period. We then use family deaths in this predicted

gestation period as an instrument for family deaths during the actual gestation. In practice, the

first stage relationship is extremely strong so the instrumental variables estimates are very

similar to the reduced form.

       The equation we estimate is as follows:

                     𝐻!"# = 𝛼! + 𝛼! 𝐷𝑊!" + 𝛼! 𝐷!" + 𝛽𝑋!" + 𝛾! + 𝜆! + 𝜖!"# .




                                                                                                     9	  
	  
Here 𝐻!"# represents outcomes, such as birth weight, for child i from family f at time t. DW is an

indicator variable for whether there was a death (of a parent of the mother) in the window around

pregnancy (in the year before, during the pregnancy, or in the year afterwards) and 𝐷 is our

variable of interest--an indicator for whether there was a death while the child was in utero. X is

a vector of controls that includes age of mother at birth (in years), birth order of the child, years

of education of both father and mother, and the gender of the child. We also include controls for

year of birth by month of birth indicators (𝛾! ). Note that, in our main specification, we

additionally include 𝜆! , a mother fixed effect. In the fixed effects specifications, we exclude

mother’s education because it is time invariant and mother’s age at birth as it is subsumed by the

year of birth by month of birth dummies. We estimate this using OLS; in the case of binary

dependent variables, we are estimating linear probability models.10

                    Our approach requires two main assumptions: The first assumption is that the unobserved

characteristics of the pregnancy are uncorrelated with whether a death is going to occur during it

rather than just before or after it (conditional random assignment). Given we have mother fixed

effects, unobserved characteristics of the mother are not an issue. This assumption would be

violated if deaths just before the in-utero period influenced the pregnancy decision so as to make

the timing of pregnancy endogenous.

                    The second assumption required is that there is no direct effect of a death just outside the

in-utero window on child outcomes (exclusion condition). This is not testable and, if there is a

negative effect on the child of a death immediately post-utero, this would bias down our

estimated effect. This is a potential problem for studying later outcomes but not a problem for

            	  One complication that arises is that the father of the children could potentially be different across births.
Therefore, we include controls for paternal education. We also tested the robustness of our results when we restrict
the sample to siblings with the same father; results are insensitive to this constraint.


                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    10	  
	  
studying birth outcomes like birth weight. Another potential issue is that the grandparent may be

dying during the in-utero period but die afterwards and this would lead to downward bias. While

we do not have data on grandparent health, we do examine whether the effects differ by cause of

death and find that there are bigger adverse effects when the death is more likely to be

unexpected.



4. Data

Birth Records

                                                           Our primary data source is the Medical Birth Registry of Norway that includes the birth

records for all Norwegian births from 1967 to 2009. All births, including those born outside of a

hospital, are included as long as the gestation period was at least 12 weeks. The birth records

contain information on year and month of birth, birth weight, gestational length, age of mother,

and a range of variables describing infant health at birth.11 In these data, we are also able to

distinguish between singleton and multiple births, and we exclude multiple births from the

sample.

Death Records

                                                           The Norwegian Death Register has information on deaths that occur in Norway between

1961 and 2010. For each death, we know the exact date of death and the cause of death. Using

the individual identifiers, we can merge date of death to other information about the individual.

Other Register Data

                                                           Using unique personal identifiers, we match the birth and death files to the Norwegian

Registry Data, a linked administrative dataset that covers the population of Norwegians alive at

  We do not know the exact date of birth – in the empirical work we treat births as taking place on the 15th day of
each month.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    11	  
	  
any point between 1960 and 2010 and is a collection of different administrative registers such as

the education register, family register, and the tax and earnings register. These data are

maintained by Statistics Norway and provide information about educational attainment, labor

market status, earnings, and a set of demographic variables (such as age and gender) as well as

information on families.

Military Data

                                                           We are also able to match the birth records to the Norwegian military records from 1984

to 2010 that contain information on height, weight, and IQ scores. In Norway, military service is

compulsory for every able young man. Before entering the service, their medical and

psychological suitability is assessed; this occurs for the great majority between their eighteenth

and twentieth birthday.12 We match these data with our other data files and use the height, Body

Mass Index (BMI – defined as kilograms divided by meters squared), and test score data as

outcome variables for men.13

Outcomes

                                                           We study a variety of different outcomes, both at birth and later in life. One of the key

variables we examine is birth weight, available beginning in 1967. In the literature, different

variants of birth weight have been used as the primary variable of interest. These include birth

weight, log(birth weight), and fetal growth (defined as birth weight divided by weeks gestation).

Given that there is no obvious choice a priori, we report estimates for all of these variables in our

   Of the men in the 1967-1987 birth cohorts, 1.2 percent died before 1 year and 0.9 percent died between 1 year of
age and registering with the military at about age 18. About 1 percent of the sample of eligible men had emigrated
before age 18, and 1.4 percent of the men were exempted because they were permanently disabled. An additional
6.2 percent are missing for a variety of reasons including foreign citizenship and missing observations. See Eide et
al. (2005) for more details.
13
   There is an extensive literature suggesting that height is a useful indicator of health, both in developed as well as
developing nations. See Strauss and Thomas (1998) for references.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    12	  
	  
analysis.14 In our 2007 study of the effect of birth weight on adult outcomes (Black, Devereux,

and Salvanes, 2007), we found that, of these measures, log(birth weight) was the best predictor

of future educational attainment, cognitive scores, and earnings. Therefore, we emphasize

estimates for this outcome measure.15 In our main specifications, we also report effects of

parental death on weeks of gestation and the height of the baby at birth, all available beginning in

1967.

                                                           To augment these results, we also incorporate a number of other characteristics of the

birth or the first weeks of life that are reported in the Birth Register. A key indicator of health at

birth is the 5-minute APGAR score. APGAR scores are a composite index of a child’s health at

birth and take into account Activity (and muscle tone), Pulse (heart rate), Grimace (reflex

irritability), Appearance (skin coloration), and Respiration (breathing rate and effort). Each

component is worth up to 2 points for a maximum of 10.16 We also study whether the birth was

via Caesarian section, and whether the child was in the Neonatal intensive care (NICU) after

birth.17 We consider both of these as potentially reflecting the presence of problems at birth that

may be associated with poor infant health.

                                                           Among the long-run outcomes, for the cohorts of men born from 1967 up to 1991 we

have information from the military records on height and BMI, both of which were measured as

part of the medical examination. The military records also contain an IQ score. The IQ measure

is the mean score from three IQ tests -- arithmetic, word similarities, and figures (see Sundet et

al. [2004, 2005] and Thrane (1977) for details). The arithmetic test is quite similar to the

   The incidence of low birth weight (<2500 grams) is also frequently studied in the literature. Only 3% of our
sample is low birth weight and we have found tiny insignificant effects when we have looked at the effect of
parental deaths on this variable.
15
   We set birth weight to missing in cases where it is reported to be less than 500 grams.
16
   Apgar scores are available in the birth records beginning in 1977.
17
   We don’t report results for infant mortality as it is very rare in our sample (less than 1% of births). When we have
used it as an outcome we found tiny insignificant effects.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    13	  
	  
arithmetic test in the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) (Sundet et al. 2005; Cronbach

1964), the word test is similar to the vocabulary test in WAIS, and the figures test is similar to

the Raven Progressive Matrix test (Cronbach 1964). The IQ score is reported in stanine

(Standard Nine) units, a method of standardizing raw scores into a nine point standard scale that

has a discrete approximation to a normal distribution, a mean of 5, and a standard deviation of

2.18

                                                           For both men and women, we study years of education for the cohorts born between 1967

and 1985 (and who are therefore at least 25 in 2010). Our measures of educational attainment are

reported by the educational establishment directly to Statistics Norway, thereby minimizing any

measurement error due to misreporting.19 We also create a binary indicator for whether the

person has at least 12 years of education. For this variable, we include persons aged at least 21 in

2010 so we have cohorts up to 1989.

                                                           Finally, we are also able to look at labor market outcomes for both men and women. We

first consider attachment to the labor force by studying whether individuals who are at least 25

years old are full-time, full-year workers in 2010 (the last year of our panel). To identify this

group, we use the fact that our dataset identifies individuals who are employed and working full

time (30+ hours per week) at one particular point in the year (in the second quarter in the years

1986-1995, and in the fourth quarter thereafter).20 We label these individuals as full-time

workers; about 60% of persons in our sample work full time in 2010.

                                                           We also study the earnings of individuals who are at least 25 years old and full-time full-

year employees in 2010, measured as total pension-qualifying earnings reported in the tax

Sample Restrictions

                                                           We restrict our sample to include only births where the mother is between 25 and 45

years old at the time of birth, drop multiple births, and drop cases with missing information on

the control variables or with missing identifiers for the parents of the mother. We also include

only live births where gestation length is at least 26 weeks, although we later test the sensitivity

of our results to this restriction. Because we primarily use specifications with mother fixed

effects, we limit our analysis sample to mothers who have at least two births in the sample; Table

1 presents summary statistics for the full sample of births and for the mother fixed effect sample

(what we call the analysis sample). The means of most variables are similar in the two samples

but parents in the analysis sample have higher education and their children tend to have better

average outcomes.21 The analysis sample is used for all subsequent empirical work in this paper.

                                                                It is likely that there are systematic differences between the types of mothers who

experience a parental death during pregnancy and other mothers. Appendix Table 1 provides

some information on this for our analysis sample. Clearly there are some systematic differences

– pregnancies that have a death involve parents who are older and less educated than other

pregnancies. Also, pregnancies with a death are less likely to occur later in the sample period. In

addition to mother fixed effects, we control for all of these variables in estimation. Note that this

highlights the importance of comparing two pregnant women who both experienced deaths, one

of which happened while the baby was in utero and the other occurred just before or after the

pregnancy.

  As is shown in Appendix Table 6, OLS estimates without mother fixed effects are similar in the two samples so
there is little reason to believe that our results are not generalizable.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    15	  
	  
5. Results

                                                           The first 3 rows of Table 2 present “naïve” cross-sectional OLS estimates without mother

fixed effects for our analysis sample, demonstrating the importance of instrumenting for death

during pregnancy with death during the 9 months after conception. The first row presents the

“naïve” OLS results of the effect of a grandparent death while in utero for each outcome, the

second row presents the reduced form when an indicator of death of grandparent in utero is

replaced with an indicator for death of a grandparent up to 9 months after conception, and the

third row presents the results when death of a grandparent in utero is instrumented with an

indicator for death of a grandparent within 9 months after conception. In all specifications, we

control for maternal and paternal education, age of mother at birth, birth order of the child,

gender of the child, and year by month of birth indicators.

                                                           The upward bias of “naïve” OLS due to the spurious relationship between gestation

length and family deaths is obvious in the estimates. This is particularly apparent when weeks

pregnant is the dependent variable, as the sign flips from positive to negative when we go from

OLS to IV.22 While the first stage is not reported, the first stage coefficient is close to one,

leading the reduced form and IV estimates to be very similar. While these estimates generally

show adverse effects of a death on birth outcomes, we do not focus on these results because the

specification does not allow for unobserved factors that may be correlated with timing of fertility

and bereavement.

                                                           As mentioned earlier, to address issues of selection, we implement a mother fixed effects

strategy and also include a control variable for whether there is a death in the window around

  To reassure that the magnitude of the change is reasonable, we have implemented a small monte carlo using a
distribution of gestation lengths and a grandparent death rate that matches those in our sample. We found differences
between “naïve” OLS and IV estimates that mimic those we find in Table 2 for weeks gestation, suggesting that the
differences between OLS and IV results are driven by the mechanical relationship between gestation length and the
probability of a death during pregnancy.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    16	  
	  
pregnancy. We first present the results from specifications where we include mother fixed

effects (IV FE, Row 4 of Table 2), then the effect of death in utero controlling for whether there

is a death in the window around the pregnancy (IV Window, Rows 5 and 6 of Table 2) and,

finally, the specification that includes both (IV Window FE, Rows 7 and 8). Note that all

estimates instrument for death during pregnancy with death in the 9 months post-conception.

While the results are surprisingly robust to choice of specification, we focus on our preferred

specification, which includes both mother fixed effects and an indicator for whether there was a

death in the window surrounding the pregnancy.

                                                           The first finding is that there is a negative effect of a bereavement in utero on birth

weight. To get a sense of the magnitudes, the estimate of the birth weight effect is about 23

grams. This is relative to a mean of about 3500 grams and standard deviation of about 500

grams, so it is approximately 5% of a standard deviation. The coefficient in the log birth weight

regression is about -.007 (note that, for presentation purposes, this estimate is multiplied by 10 in

the tables), which implies that a death reduces birth weight by less than 1%.23 These small birth

weight effects occur both because of a small reduction in gestation length (by .09 weeks or less

than one day) and due to a fall in the rate of fetal growth. The reduction in birth weight is

mirrored by a negative effect on birth length (infant height). Once again this effect is very small

as the coefficient implies a magnitude of less than one 10th of a centimeter. Overall, our results

for birth weight and length imply adverse but very small effects of a grandparent death in utero.

                                                           Table 2 also presents results for other birth outcomes.24 Again focusing on the

   Based on the Black, Devereux, and Salvanes (2007) estimates of the effects of birth weight on adult outcomes,
this would imply that a family death reduced the probability of finishing high school and log earnings by only about
.0006 and .0008, respectively.
24
   Because data on APGAR scores begin in 1977, sample sizes are smaller for this outcome.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    17	  
	  
surrounding the pregnancy, we find that stress leads to a lower 5 minute APGAR score and

increased likelihood of having a caesarian section. The effect on the APGAR score is small at

about 4% of a standard deviation but the effect on caesarian section is larger – a death in utero

increases the probability of a C-section by about 1% (from a baseline of about 11%). Finally, we

find no evidence of any effect on the likelihood of the child being transferred to the Neonatal

Ward.

        In Table 2, we also report the coefficients on the variable that measures whether there is a

death in the window that envelops the pregnancy. It is difficult to interpret these coefficients

because they may reflect true causal effects of deaths just before or just after pregnancy, or they

could be picking up systematic differences between the unobserved characteristics of

pregnancies that occur during periods with a death and periods without a death. Without mother

fixed effects, the coefficients are small and statistically insignificant. With mother fixed effects,

this variable is statistically significant for most outcomes but the size of the coefficient is always

smaller (in absolute terms) than that of the main coefficient of interest. This suggests that,

conditional on the mother fixed effects, there is not a lot of selection in terms of which

pregnancies are accompanied by deaths. This is consistent with the fact that the estimates in

Table 2 are relatively robust, regardless of specification.

Magnitudes

        In terms of how these estimates compare to the existing literature, most credible studies

find small negative effects of stress in utero on birth outcomes. Using a family fixed effects

strategy, Currie and Rossin-Slater (2013) find no evidence of effects of hurricanes on birth

weight or gestation length but some evidence of effects on C-sections and abnormalities.

Simeonova (2011) finds a natural disaster reduces birth weight by 1 gram and weeks of gestation



                                                                                                    18	  
	  
by .01, and Camacho (2008) finds that living near a landmine explosion in Colombia reduces

birth weight by 9 grams. Our findings of small negative effects are in line with these other

estimates.

By Cause of Death

         While it is clearly stressful to lose a parent to any cause, there may be some types of

deaths that are more stressful than others. For example, more sudden, unexpected deaths, such

as those resulting from a heart attack, may lead to more concentrated stress at the time of the

passing. Appendix Table 3 presents the causes of grandparent deaths during pregnancy for the

analysis sample. As is well known, the two major distinct causes of death are cancers and

cardiovascular disease.

         To examine whether there are differential effects by cause of death, we include separate

dummy variables for each of three causes of death —cardiovascular disease, cancer, and other or

unknown. Table 3 presents these results. In this table, and in the remaining tables of the paper,

we report estimates from the instrumental variables estimator including both mother fixed effects

and the indicator for a death within the window surrounding the pregnancy.

         Importantly, we see that the results are clearly being driven by deaths from

cardiovascular disease, with larger and statistically significant negative birth outcomes resulting

from this cause of death of the mother’s parent. There is little evidence of negative birth

outcomes related to death by cancer or other causes.

Timing

         Given that stress does seem to matter, we then investigate when during the pregnancy the

fetus is most vulnerable. To do so, we divide the pregnancy into trimesters. Table 4 presents the

results when we estimate the effect of the death of a grandparent on birth outcomes by trimester



                                                                                                    19	  
	  
of exposure. Once again, we only report IV estimates with mother fixed effects and an indicator

for death within the window surrounding the pregnancy. The results suggest no clear pattern of

timing—while some specifications are statistically significant, the coefficient sizes are relatively

constant across the trimesters, leaving us reluctant to draw any strong conclusions about timing.

By Type of Grandparent

       One concern about our interpretation of a grandparent death as being a source of grief or

stress is that grandparents may provide support to the mother during pregnancy (helping with

housework, looking after other children etc). While we cannot examine this directly, we can

investigate whether the effects vary by grandparent characteristics in a manner that would be

consistent with this interpretation. We look at two different splits of the data. The first is

whether it is the grandmother or grandfather who dies, with our prior being that the grandmother

is likely to provide more direct help to the pregnant daughter and, as a result, her loss might

affect the daughter both because of stress and perhaps also a loss of help. We also examine

whether the grandparent dies in the same county as the birth occurs, again hypothesizing that

grandparents are more likely to provide help for the pregnant daughter if they live nearby.

       The estimates by grandparent gender are in Table 5. For most birth outcomes, the

grandfather estimate is bigger in absolute terms than the grandmother estimate. The only

exception is that the grandmother death coefficient is larger for C-sections. The coefficient

estimates are generally not statistically significant for grandmother deaths so there is much

stronger evidence for adverse effects of grandfather deaths. If grandmothers are more likely to

provide these services than grandfathers, our finding above of a significant effect for

grandfathers suggests stress is likely to be driving our results.




                                                                                                  20	  
	  
                                                           We also look at how the effects of a death differ depending on the proximity of the

grandparent to the mother. To do so, we look at differential effects by whether the death occurred

in the same county as the birth.25 These estimates are presented in Table 6. While the estimates

are sometimes bigger for deaths that occur in the same county, there is no clear pattern, and there

is still evidence of adverse effects on birth outcomes when the death occurs in a different county.

This re-enforces our view that stress/grief is the important component of the effects of

grandparent deaths. Note that these estimates also suggest that it is very unlikely that our results

are driven by some common shock like a local flu epidemic that both leads to the death of the

grandparent and to adverse consequences for the fetus.

By Child and Mother Characteristics

                                                           There is some evidence in the literature that boys are more vulnerable to insults in utero

than are girls (See for example Eriksson et al., 2010). To examine this directly, we interact the

death-in-utero variable with the gender of the child.26 Note that we also interact the death-in-

window variable with gender and include a control for whether the child is male.

                                                           Table 7 presents the estimates with the gender interaction. The results suggest bigger

effects for boys than girls. For the birth weight outcomes, fetal growth, and height, the

interaction with male is statistically significant and the effect is bigger for boys than girls. Indeed

while there is evidence that gestation length is reduced and the probability of C-section is

increased for both boys and girls, there is no other evidence that girls are adversely affected by a

death.




	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	   	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
25
   There are 19 counties in Norway. We treat Oslo and Akershus as one county as Akershus contains many suburbs
of Oslo.
26
   The alternative approach of splitting the sample by gender gives consistent results but is less efficient as it
requires restricting the sample to mothers who have at least two children of the same sex.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    21	  
	  
        We also can examine whether the effects we observe are changing over time—one might

expect changes for a number of reasons, including differences in medical technology or

differences in stress-management strategies over time. To examine whether this is the case, the

first panel in Table 8 interacts death in utero with whether the birth takes place in the second half

of the panel i.e. after 1988 (the analogous interaction of death in window with this variable is

also included but not reported). The estimates imply that the effects on gestation length are

smaller in the second half of the period but the interaction is statistically insignificant (and

generally small) for the birth weight and the other birth outcomes.

        Finally, there is always the issue of whether individuals with more resources are better

able to mitigate negative effects they experience. To examine this, the second panel of Table 8

interacts the death in utero and death in window indicators with whether the mother has

relatively high education (greater than 12 years of schooling). There is some evidence here that

the effects are, if anything, larger for more educated mothers, but, once again, the interactions are

generally statistically insignificant.



6. Robustness Checks

Balancing Tests

        Appendix Table 4 presents the results when we run balancing tests to verify that there are

no observable differences in the characteristics of parents who experience a death while

pregnant, conditional on mother fixed effects and having a death in the window enveloping the

pregnancy. As we can see from the results, there are no statistically significant differences,

suggesting that there are unlikely to be unobservable differences as well.

Before versus After



                                                                                                   22	  
	  
                                                           One might expect the effects to be different depending on whether the comparison group

includes deaths before conception or after birth, as one might expect spillover effects from

negative shocks before conception on outcomes later. To examine this more closely, in

Appendix Table 5 we separate the control group--in panel 2, it is a death in utero compared to a

death in the 12 months before (implemented by including a control variable for a death occurring

just before or during pregnancy), and in panel 3, it is a death in utero compared to a death in the

12 months after (implemented by instead including a control variable for a death occurring just

after or during pregnancy). The estimates are very similar in both cases, suggesting that our

findings are generally robust to the choice of control group.

Including All Pregnancies with at least 12 Weeks of Gestation

                                                           One concern is that we are using only live births with at least 26 weeks gestation when

creating our sample. To the extent that a bereavement early in a pregnancy may lead to a

miscarriage or a stillbirth, we will understate the effect of bereavement on birth outcomes. To

address this, we have tried a variety of tests. First, we examined whether or not bereavement

increases the probability of a stillbirth, conditional on gestation lasting at least 12 weeks, and

found no evidence of an effect. Second, we tried including all pregnancies with at least 12

weeks gestation, whether they are born live or not. 27 We have estimated specifications where

we use this less restrictive sample inclusion criterion and found very similar, if not slightly

larger, effects of stress during pregnancy on birth outcomes. This suggests that our results are

unlikely to be tainted by differential selection into our sample.

  Many miscarriages occur before the 12th week of pregnancy. However, the birth register does not have
information on pregnancies that last less than 12 weeks.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    23	  
	  
                                                           Given the negative (albeit small) effects of stress on birth outcomes, we next examine

whether there are any longer-run effects on children’s outcomes. Table 9 presents the results

when we estimate the relationship between grandparent death in utero and the long-run outcomes

of children. Because of sample size issues, we pool men and women to increase the precision of

the estimates and include a dummy variable for child gender.28

                                                           Perhaps not surprisingly, we find little evidence of any persistent effect of stress

experienced in utero on the long-run outcomes of children. If the effects were all coming

through birth weight, we can use estimates from our earlier work (Black, Devereux, and

Salvanes 2007) to calculate the predicted effect on longer-run outcomes (as described earlier in

the paper). When we do this, we find that we would expect incredibly small effects on longer-

run outcomes. For example, we would expect a decline in the probability of completing high

school of .0007, a decline in log earnings of full-time workers of .001, and a decline in IQ score

of approximately .006. These small effects could not be distinguished from zero with our sample

sizes. Of course, there could be multiple channels through which the stress affects outcomes, not

just birth weight. However, we are able to reject large effects with our estimates. For example,

when we use our preferred specification with mother fixed effects and a control for death in the

window, the confidence intervals imply that we can rule out negative effects on completing 12

years or more of schooling of more than 1.6%, negative effects on full-time earnings of more

than 4%, negative effects on IQ score (for men) of more than 7% of a standard deviation, and

negative effects on adult height (of men) of more than half a centimeter.

28
  We have tried interactions with a male dummy variable but they are never statistically significant. We do not
report any of the battery of heterogenous effects that we did for the birth outcomes because interaction terms are
almost always statistically insignificant.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    24	  
	  
all coefficients are small and are of varying sign provides strong evidence that there are not large

effects on later outcomes.29

                                                           This is an important finding in the context of the existing research in the area. The

literature on the effects of physical insults in utero has tended to find adverse effects on both

birth outcomes and on later measures of cognitive development, educational attainment, and

labor market success. However, the literature on the effects of stress during pregnancy on child

outcomes has generally focused on birth outcomes of children and found small adverse effects.

We have been left to wonder whether these imply that affected children will also have poorer

later outcomes. The death of a parent clearly causes acute stress to pregnant women, but we have

found no evidence of significant effects on later outcomes of children. This suggests that, even if

there are measurable effects on birth outcomes, we may be able to be more sanguine about the

effects of acute psychological stressors on child outcomes.



8. Conclusion

                                                           While we have substantial evidence that physical health shocks while pregnant have

deleterious effects on the outcomes of children, much less is known about the effects of mental

health shocks while pregnant on the well-being of the baby. Using unique data from Norway, we

are able to estimate the effect of stress induced by the death of a parent while pregnant on the

outcomes--both short- and long-run--of the children.

                                                           We find that maternal bereavement has small but statistically significant adverse effects

on birth outcomes, and these effects are larger for boys than for girls. The effects on birth

outcomes appear to be driven by deaths due to cardiovascular causes, suggesting that sudden

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	   	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
29
  We have also looked at whether there is an effect of cardiovascular deaths on later outcomes but found no
significant effects on educational outcomes, cognitive scores, or labor market variables.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    25	  
	  
deaths due to heart attacks may be more difficult to deal with than deaths due to more persistent

causes (such as cancer). However, there is no evidence of any adverse effects on any of our later

outcomes including cognitive test scores, educational attainment, and earnings. This suggests

that, even though there may be measurable effects on birth outcomes, acute psychological

stressors during pregnancy have limited adverse consequences on the child’s success in

education and the labor market.

       One remaining issue is the mechanism through which bereavement affects birth

outcomes. While the process may by purely physiological and be related to the body’s natural

responses to stress and grief, there may also be behavioral responses of the mother that affect the

fetus. One such possibility is that stress increases the likelihood or level of maternal smoking.

We have information on smoking behavior of mothers from 1998 onwards and we have used it to

see whether bereavement affects smoking. We found no evidence of any effect. This suggests

that behavioral responses may not be an important part of the story but more research with more

detailed data will be required to verify this conclusion.

The sample includes all women who have at least two births during the sample period.
“Naïve” OLS, Reduced Form, and IV specifications include controls for age of mother, maternal and paternal education, gender of child, birth order of child, and
year of birth by month of birth dummies.
IV FE and IV Window FE specifications include mother fixed effects and exclude maternal age and education.
IV Window and IV Window FE specifications include a control for whether there is a grandparent death in the window around pregnancy.
The window around birth includes the year prior to conception, the 9 months post-conception, and the year subsequent to that.
All the IV specifications instrument the indicator variable for a death during pregnancy with an indicator variable for a death within 9 months of the conception

    The sample includes all women who have at least two births during the sample period.
    All specifications include controls for age of mother, paternal education, gender of child, birth order of child, and year of birth by month of birth dummies.
    These IV estimates instrument the indicator variable for a death during pregnancy with an indicator variable for a death within 9 months of the conception date.
    Coefficients on log(birth weight) are multiplied by 10.
    Death in utero is 1 if a grandparent death occurs in the 9 months following conception. Death just before is 1 if a grandparent death occurs in the 12 months
    before conception. Death just after is 1 if a grandparent death occurs in the 12 months after the predicted due date.
