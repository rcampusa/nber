                                          ABSTRACT

In this paper, we examine what groups of children are served by core childhood social-safety net
programs—including Medicaid, EITC, CTC, SNAP, and AFDC/TANF—and how that’s changed
over time. We find that virtually all gains in spending on the social safety net for children since
1990 have gone to families with earnings, and to families with income above the poverty line.
This is the result of welfare reform and the expansion of in work tax credits. We review the
available research and find that access to safety net programs during childhood leads to benefits
for children and society over the long run. This evidence suggests that the changes to the social
safety net may have lasting negative impacts on the poorest children.

    I.       Introduction

A persistently large number of children in the U.S. live in poverty, despite sustained

economic growth. Recognizing the social and moral imperative to alleviate child

poverty, we have a patchwork of tax and transfer programs targeting low-income

families with children aimed at reducing child poverty. In 2016, the federal government

spent about $200 billion on such programs, and they had a substantial impact on

reducing childhood poverty.1 Including the value of government tax and transfers

reduces child poverty from 25 percent (no taxes or transfers) to 15 percent (current law)

(Shapiro and Trisi 2017)—lifting 7.4 million children out of poverty, yet 11.1 million

remain in poverty. Growing up poor not only harms children in the short run, but by

limiting investments in their human capital it also harms them in the long run.



Thus, considerable government tax and transfer spending on children is aimed at

reducing poverty—with a justification primarily on humanitarian grounds. In contrast,

another substantial public sum is spent on child human capital policies where an

investment (rather than humanitarian) criteria is employed. In a standard human capital

investment model, resources are spent upfront that generate returns over the longer

run across a variety of measures—potentially including better labor market outcomes,

improved health, and higher educational achievement. Early childhood education

programs are promoted within this framing, and more generally the provision of public

education is a primary mechanism for our investments in children. Many compelling

studies have found that there is also a substantial investment component to safety net

programs that alleviate childhood poverty, suggesting that it is also appropriate to

 This includes spending on to families with children through the EITC, the Child Tax Credit, SNAP, TANF, and public
housing and spending on children in Medicaid and SSI. Our data and these calculations are discussed below.

consider a portion of safety net spending through the investment framework. Yet to

date, the investment component of safety net spending has not been widely discussed.



Our paper is motivated by the interest in summarizing what is known about the long-

run benefits of childhood safety net benefits and in reevaluating current policies in light

of this evidence. There are three components to the paper. First, we review the

research evaluating the long-run effects of social safety net benefits, which shows that

investments in early life can have large impacts on later-life outcomes—perhaps strong

enough to suggest that reallocation of investments over the life course to earlier

periods can be efficiency-enhancing. Recent research has focused on quantifying the

benefits to health and productivity in adulthood of the social safety net. In particular we

review the available evidence about the three pillars to the U.S. social safety for

families with children: the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the

Earned Income Tax Credit, and Medicaid. These studies suggest that in addition to the

humanitarian and social insurance reasons to have a safety net, there is also a supply-

side case. That is, providing certain safety net programs ends up benefiting children

and society over the long run. Both private and public benefits result from these

investments. These findings imply that the benefits of the social safety net are broader

than is commonly assumed, and indeed that this spending yields impacts that have

downstream benefits to taxpayers (through increased tax revenues and potential

declines in spending on healthcare and the safety net), in addition to the affected

families.



A second part of the paper analyzes the data on government spending on children,

how it features in broader public spending, and how it has changed over time. Overall,

we find that government spending is not in line with our increasing understanding of


                                             2
the importance of resources during early life, and the positive spillovers from safety net

spending on children.2 The U.S. spends a relatively low level on children, and spending

has remained relatively flat over the last two decades at between 1.5 to 2 percent of

GDP (Isaacs et al. 2017). In contrast, per capita spending on the elderly in the U.S. has

grown substantially over the same timeframe and in 2015 amounts to 9.3 percent of

GDP.3 U.S. child spending is very low by international standards: the U.S. is near the

bottom of OECD countries in “family benefits public spending” as a share of GDP

(third from the bottom above only Mexico and Turkey) with a share less than half the

OECD average (OECD 2018a). Yet U.S. spending on the elderly, based on “pension

spending” as a share of GDP, is just below the OECD average (OECD 2018b).



We also analyze how the composition of spending on children has changed over time.

Fundamental changes have occurred in the social safety net for children in the past 25

years. The Earned Income Tax Credit expanded substantially creating subsidies to

work, welfare reform dramatically reduced the availability of cash assistance, and health

insurance for low income children expanded dramatically through Medicaid. We use a

unique approach, based on administrative data, to examine who is benefiting from

changes to the social safety net and who is being left behind. In particular, we estimate

the changes over time in how government spending is allocated across the income

distribution (e.g. those below poverty versus those above poverty) and how it is

allocated across working and nonworking families. This analysis shows that there have

been substantial shifts over the past 20 years in their composition. We find that an

increasing share is going to children near and above the poverty threshold, while a

  To be sure some of the elderly spending may have spillovers onto children. For example, providing Social Security
to grandparent frees up some family resources that may be spent on children.

decreasing share is directed to the poorest children living below the poverty threshold

despite a relatively stable share of children living in poverty. Additionally, there has

been a massive shift towards in-work transfers and health insurance, with a declining

share in unrestricted cash benefits. Our approach, which uses administrative data

wherever possible, makes an important contribution because it circumvents the well-

documented undercounting of safety net spending in survey data, the source of data

typically used to examine the composition of spending.



Pulling the two parts of the paper together, we evaluate the state of the social safety

net for families with children. The literature is not sufficiently developed to provide

strong guidance on precisely how to optimally allocate funds across eligible groups,

and across different programs. Nonetheless the broad patterns are clear: the research

shows there are important benefits to having access to the safety net during childhood

that should be considered by policymakers. Furthermore, there are strong returns

across the cash, tax based, near cash and health insurance programs that we examine,

with potentially larger impacts for the most disadvantaged children. These consistent

findings imply that there are substantial potential social and individual benefits from

spending on children and their families. Additionally, the decline in availability of

benefits for the most disadvantaged children, primarily due to welfare reform, is likely

to lead to worse outcomes for these children in adulthood. Any cuts to current

programs that will reduce resources going to children would have direct, negative

impacts on children in both the short- and long-term. It is also crucial to recognize that

the modal recipient family is combining safety net use with employment; the view that

all spending is welfare and going to out of work families is not the case. Instead the

social safety net is acting to top up earnings to help families make up for stagnating

and declining wages (Autor 2012). In light of this, it is important to make sure that


                                             4
policies can work with the labor market. Specifically, there are costs to adding work

disincentives to programs—such as eligibility notches that abruptly remove access to

benefits above an income threshold. Furthermore, policies that require labor market

participation do not provide rapid response in replacing income lost during recessions.




      II. An Overview of the Private and Public Safety Net for Children

We begin by describing the broader set of social safety net programs for children in

the U.S., how they compare to spending for other groups, and how this has changed

over time. Figure 1, reproduced from Isaacs et al. (2017), reports federal expenditures

on children in 2016. The spending takes the form of tax expenditures (e.g. Earned

Income Tax Credit, Child Tax Credit, dependent exemption, and tax exclusion of

employer-provided health insurance), direct transfers to families (e.g. SNAP, Social

Security, TANF, and SSI) and transfers from the federal to state and local governments

(e.g. Title 1, special education). Note that this graph focuses on Federal spending on

children, and omits the sizeable transfers made by states, including the state share of

Medicaid and child welfare services, state EITCs, and education spending.



There are a number of programs that provide benefits to low-income children ranging

from cash to insurance. Medicaid, which provides public health insurance to low-

income children, is the largest program, with $89 billion spent on children (after

removing the share spent on the elderly and disabled). The Children’s Health Insurance

Program or CHIP ($14 billion) is another public health insurance program; it supports

children in families with income above the Medicaid eligibility limits. The Earned

Income Tax Credit or EITC ($61 billion) is a refundable tax credit for working families




                                            5
with children.4 In 2017 the maximum EITC credit was $5,616 for families with two

children, and $3,400 for those with one child. More than 40 percent of tax filers with

children received the EITC. The Child Tax Credit or CTC ($50 billion) is a partially

refundable tax credit of $1,000 for each child in working families.5 The CTC provides

important benefits to low-income families with children, but a substantial share of the

CTC cost goes to families much higher up the income distribution.6 Supplemental

Assistance for Needy Families or SNAP ($31 billion) provides vouchers for food

assistance and eligibility is generally limited to those with income below 130 percent of

the federal poverty line. In 2017, the average monthly SNAP benefit is $125 per

person. In contrast to the tax credits, both working and nonworking families are eligible

for SNAP. The other child nutrition programs ($22 billion) include Special Supplemental

Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) as well as school feeding

programs.



Historically, a cornerstone of the safety net was Aid to Families with Dependent

Children (AFDC), a cash welfare program not tied to work. The program was

overhauled in 1996 into Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF), block

granting it to states who were allowed tremendous flexibility in terms of how to

administer the program, with funds frozen at their 1996 level in nominal terms, and

strict work requirements and lifetime time limits enacted (Bitler and Hoynes 2016).

Today only 2.4 percent of the child based safety-net spending goes to TANF (Figure

4
  There is also a small credit for low-income working families without children; those dollars are
excluded from the calculations presented here.
5
  The refundable portion of the CTC is known as the Additional Child Tax Credit (ACTC) and is limited
to 15% of earned income above $3,000. Throughout this paper we present the combined CTC and
ACTC and refer to it simply as the CTC.
6
  In 2017, the $1,000 credit is phased out starting at incomes of about $80,000 ($120,000) for single
parent (married couple) families. The credit is fully phased out at incomes of about $100,000 ($130,000)
for single parent (married couple) families. The recent tax bill expands the CTC to raise the credit
amount and expand the range of income over which families are eligible.

1), and the program’s reach is low—only 23 percent of children in poor families

received TANF cash assistance in 2016 compared to 76 percent in 1996 (Floyd et al.

2017).7 Supplemental Security Income (SSI) is another cash welfare program, providing

benefits to low-income disabled and elderly persons. Following a court decision in

1990, the definition of disability was expanded to allow more children to receive SSI

(Duggan et al. 2016). Notably, Figure 1 shows that cash welfare is a very small share of

U.S. social safety net spending on children. Instead, most spending on children consists

of public health insurance, tax credits that are linked to paid work (EITC, CTC), and

SNAP.



Figure 2, adapted from Isaacs et al. (2017), contrasts trends in federal spending on

children and the elderly for 1980-2015.8 To account for trends in population size, each

category is presented in terms of spending per capita (e.g. per child, per elderly), in

inflation-adjusted 2015 dollars. Per capita federal spending on the elderly is currently

$35,000 and has doubled over this time frame. To be sure, spending on the elderly is

not entirely analogous to spending on children—for example, part of spending on the

elderly is a pension linked to prior work and payroll taxes, and a higher share comes in

the form of health insurance. However, two points to recognize are that spending on

the elderly is relatively generous, and it also involves substantial redistribution to the

lower-income elderly. Per capita federal spending on children is only about $5000 per

year. When spending on public elementary and secondary schools is included—


7
  TANF is 2.4% of all spending items in Figure 1. If we limit the set of programs to cash and near cash
direct transfers to households (dropping Medicaid/CHIP, Title I, Special Ed) and omit the tax reductions
(e.g. dependent exemption, value of untaxed employer sponsored insurance, etc.) TANF still remains
below 5% of spending.
8
  A large share of the federal spending on the elderly is for Medicare and Social Security. Those
programs also serve some non-elderly (primarily disabled adults); the trends in Figure 2 omit the
spending on adults. Although much smaller, we also limit SSI to the spending on the elderly (dropping
spending on disabled children and adults). Child spending is the total of programs shown in Figure 1.

                                                   7
$11,222 per pupil in the most recent year spent at state and local levels—total

spending on children increases, but a large gap in per-capita spending remains (Figure

2). At the end of this period, in 2015, federal spending on children is only 2.1 percent

of GDP compared to more than 9 percent for the elderly. More striking is the

significant growth in per-capita spending for the elderly alongside the modest

spending levels and upward trends for children. This imbalance has implications for

future productivity given the fact that spending on children can be viewed as an

investment while spending on the elderly is not.



Trends in public spending should be analyzed alongside trends in private resources

available to children. By some measures, including parental time with children (proxied

by number of parents in the household) and income, children in lower income

households have stagnant or fewer private resources available. As shown in Figure 3,

over the past 40 years there has been a marked decline in the share of children living

with married parents among children whose mothers have less than a college

education; by 2016, only 60 percent of children with mothers without a college degree

lived with married parents, compared with 85 percent of children with college-

educated mothers. Over the same period, large numbers of both single and married

mothers have joined the workforce, as shown in Figure 4. Since 2000, single mothers’

labor force participation has been nearly identical to single childless women’s (Black et

al. 2017) and above the participation rate of married women with children (Figure 4).

However, real wages among workers with low education levels have been stagnant or

declining, as shown in Figure 5. As we show below in Section IV, an increasing share of

benefits is going to families that combine work with safety-net use, and the safety net is

supporting families that face stagnant economic opportunities. Finally, along some

other dimensions, there have been positive changes in private resources available to


                                            8
children, including a decline in the total number of children per family, and an increase

in parental education.9



As we proceed below, our analysis focuses on a subset of Federal safety net programs

with substantial spending on low-income children. We are particularly interested in

discussing those programs and policies for which we have evidence on their long-run

impacts on children. Therefore, in the rest of the paper we cover Medicaid, EITC, CTC,

SNAP, TANF and SSI.10 As shown in Figure 1, this captures four of the top five

programs (in terms of expenditures).



    III.    Findings from the recent literature

In recent years, researchers have made strong advances toward understanding the

long-run impacts of safety net spending and other early-life events. Reviewed recently

by Almond, Currie and Duque (forthcoming), this research shows that there are critical

times both during the prenatal period and in early childhood that deserve particular

policy focus. This line of inquiry was built off of a large literature spanning research in

public health, epidemiology, and more recently economics that documents important

later-life impacts on health and mortality of extreme negative shocks—such as famines,


9
  Over this period, parental educational attainment has increased. Whereas the median mother had a
high school education in the early 1990s, beginning in 1995, the median mother had some college
education. Due to these educational attainment changes, the trend for the low education group may
partially reflect compositional changes rather than structural trends. In fact, if we instead reexamine
Figure 3 for women with below median (versus above median) educational attainment, the trends in
child living arrangements are much more stable. Throughout the period, about 60 percent of children
with a low-educated mother (below median educational attainment) lived with married parents. The
increase in employment among low educated mothers (Figure 4) is similar over our period under both
measures but rises slightly less for high-educated mothers using the alternative definition (above
median).
10
   Below, when we present more detailed data on the CTC, we consider expenditures on the tax credit
that go to families with income below 200 percent of the federal poverty line. This allows us to
incorporate this relatively large program but to limit it to our population of interest.

                                                   9
wars, and the 1918 Pandemic Flu. Much of the early work focused on prenatal

exposure to shocks, and tested Barker’s “fetal origins” hypothesis. Barker argued that a

poor prenatal environment (in particular inadequate nutrition) “programs” the fetus to

be at higher risk of metabolic conditions and disease risk in adulthood (Barker 1990).

The economic literature subsequently documented that these extreme negative shocks

also impact economic well-being—including educational attainment, IQ, and

earnings.11 As the literature has continued to evolve, it has turned to testing more mild,

commonplace shocks, encompassing positive as well as negative shocks. These studies

have further documented the importance of the post-natal environment—particularly

early childhood—leveraging variation in access to nutrition, maternal stress, exposure

to alcohol and tobacco, and environmental toxins and public health interventions to

identify impacts. The literature clearly supports the conclusion that relatively mild early-

life shocks can have impacts on later-life health and labor market outcomes. It is more

recent that this literature has turned to evaluating the impacts of the social safety net

on long run outcomes.



To do this work, a number of factors must come together. First, adequate longitudinal

data are necessary, including information both about childhood circumstances and

adult outcomes. In some cases, year of birth and the location of birth or residence in

early life is sufficient to determine whether the individual had access to a program. In

other cases, information on measures or proxies for family income during childhood is

also necessary. Much of the path-breaking work on early-life influences and later-life

outcomes has come from countries with extensive population-level panel data like

Norway and Sweden, but such data are typically harder to come by in the United

States.


11
     For excellent reviews of the early literature, see Almond and Currie 2011a, 2011b.

                                                     10
Because safety net programs typically serve people who need the program when they

need it, it is empirically difficult to disentangle the (likely positive) impact of the safety

net from the (likely negative) impact of the circumstances that made a family eligible

for the program. To overcome this challenge, researchers need a credible research

design that allows them to isolate the impact of the program—and that can be

implemented with the available data.



Of course, long-term effects can only be measured after an appropriate amount of time

passes; this is true broadly across the literature evaluating the long-term impacts of

early life events. Prior to the availability of longer-term outcomes, many studies

examined short-term proxy measures such as birth weight—which has been shown to

be an important marker of long-run outcomes and which is often more readily

available. There is consistent evidence, for example, that links birth weight to cognitive

outcomes in childhood (Figlio et al. 2014; Bharadwaj et al. 2013) as well as a wide

range of adult outcomes such as wages, disability, adult chronic conditions, and human

capital accumulation (Almond et al. forthcoming). Other studies use educational

measures as short-term proxies, such as test scores. As longer-term data become

available, many studies have revealed larger long-term impacts across a wider variety

of measures than the short-run proxies would have implied (Krueger and Whitmore

2001; Ludwig and Miller 2007; Deming 2009; Chetty et al. 2011). In particular,

outcomes in adulthood need not operate solely though health at birth (Almond, Chay,

and Lee 2005; Almond and Currie 2011a). This suggests that a complete analysis of the

long-run effects of the social safety net for childhood requires observing outcomes for

affected children when they reach adulthood. Because of the time lag required for

measuring long-term outcomes, the evidence we report here is necessarily related to


                                              11
programs that were implemented or expanded two decades ago or longer. To the

extent that these policies have been similar over time, or that the impacts measure

basic economic channels through which policies flow, these evaluations of older

programs are still relevant today. On the other hand, if circumstances or policies have

changed dramatically, then the inference to today’s policies may be more limited.



Below we present evidence from the four primary types of safety net programs for low-

income families, covering in-kind food benefits, tax credits linked to paid work,

unconditional cash transfers, and public health insurance.12 We include studies that

produce causal estimates of the impact of the safety net on long-run outcomes, and

related work on short- and medium-run effects. As described below, each program

type has been evaluated using credible research designs that are capable of identifying

the causal impact of program access or participation on a range of outcomes.



     a. In-Kind Food Benefits: The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)

SNAP is a means-tested voucher program designed to supplement low-income

families’ food budgets. The vouchers are structured to fill the gap between the

resources a family has available to purchase food and the resources required to

purchase an inexpensive food plan. Eligible families typically have income below 130%

of the poverty line. A maximum benefit is extended to those with zero income and the

benefit is phased out at a 30 percent rate with increases in income (after deductions).

Vouchers are paid monthly and can be used to purchase most foods at grocery stores

and farmers’ markets that are intended to be taken home and prepared. In 2016, 13.6

percent of the population participated in SNAP, and average monthly benefits were



12
  See Almond et al. (forthcoming), Butcher (2017) and Sherman and Mitchell (2017) for other reviews of
these studies.

                                                 12
$255 per household, or $126 per person. After accounting for the underreporting of

benefits, SNAP is estimated to have lifted 3.8 million children out of poverty in 2015

(Wheaton and Tran 2018).



Economic theory predicts that inframarginal participants—that is, those who receive

SNAP benefits in an amount less than they would otherwise spend on food, who

comprise the vast majority of participants—will treat their benefits like cash. There is

some empirical debate about whether SNAP benefits are spent in the same manner as

an equivalent cash transfer would be, or if instead the marginal propensity to consume

food is higher out of SNAP than from regular income (Hoynes and Schanzenbach 2009;

Hastings and Shapiro 2017). In any case, SNAP represents a sizeable income transfer to

participants, and is expected to change the amount and/or quality of food purchased.

Like any means-tested income transfer that is not conditioned on work, there are

potential disincentive effects on work effort. Understanding the effect of a program on

work is relevant for quantifying the impact on total household financial resources and

also for parental time spent with children. Studies find that such effects for SNAP are

small in practice (Hoynes and Schanzenbach 2009; East forthcoming).



There have been relatively few expansions or other changes in SNAP that yield a

credible research design to study the impacts of the program. Benefit levels do not

vary by geography (except Alaska and Hawaii), and eligibility is universal, typically

conditioned only on income and assets. One source of variation leveraged by

researchers is the program’s gradual, cross-county introduction during the 1960s and

1970s. Another source was the temporary exclusion of legal immigrants from the

program that was adopted in 1996 as part of the welfare reform law and reversed in

2003.


                                            13
Using cross-county variation in the timing of the introduction of SNAP and Vital

Statistics data on the universe of births in the U.S., Almond, Hoynes, and Schanzenbach

(2011) find that SNAP reduced the incidence of low-birth weight by 7 percent for

whites and 5-11 percent for blacks. In addition, although results are not statistically

significant, point estimates suggest the introduction of Food Stamps reduced neonatal

mortality. Examining legal immigrants’ loss of benefits in the years after welfare reform,

East (2017) finds that parental access to SNAP during pregnancy improves the child’s

health at birth, as measured by birth weight. She also examines the impact on medium-

run health, finding that a child’s SNAP access before age five improves the child’s

parent-reported health in adolescence. She finds suggestive evidence that SNAP

reduces school absences, doctor visits and hospitalizations, all of which are suggestive

of long-term benefits.



Hoynes, Schanzenbach and Almond (2016) provide direct evidence, finding that

childhood access to SNAP improves adult health status and economic outcomes. In

particular, individuals with access to food stamps in childhood had better health in

adulthood—as measured by a “metabolic syndrome index” combining measures of

obesity, body mass index, and the presence of chronic conditions such as diabetes and

high blood pressure. There are similarly positive overall impacts on economic

outcomes, as measured by a “self-sufficiency” index measure that includes their

current earnings and family income, and indicator variables for whether the individual

graduated from high school, is currently employed, is currently not living in poverty,

and is not participating in the TANF and SNAP safety net programs.




                                            14
Impacts were largest among those who had access at the youngest ages, particularly

ages 0-5, underscoring the importance of providing protection in early childhood

(Barker 1990; Heckman 2006). While health improvements were similar across gender,

the economic self-sufficiency improvements were present only for women (with small

and statistically insignificant effects for men). The long-term impacts were largest in for

those who spent their childhoods in the most disadvantaged counties.



The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women Infants and Children (WIC) is

another food and nutrition program, providing vouchers for purchases of specific food

items (e.g. fortified cereal, eggs, cheese, milk, juice, dried legumes, etc.) to pregnant

and postpartum women, infants, and children under 5. Families with income below

185% of poverty are eligible for WIC. Despite the relatively low budget cost of WIC ($6

billion in 2016), the reach of the program is significant, especially to the youngest

children—about half of births are to WIC recipients (Hoynes and Schanzenbach 2015).

There is a large set of studies with robust evidence that WIC benefits for pregnant

women leads to improvements in birthweight and infant health. This is suggestive that

WIC may also lead to long-run improvements, though this has yet to be tackled in the

research.



   b. Tax Credits Tied to Paid Work: EITC

A large and increasing share of safety net programs are tied to employment. The most

important of these programs is the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). The EITC is

available to lower-income families with positive earned income. It is refundable, so

when a family’s income is too low to generate tax obligations, the family receives a

refund check from the Internal Revenue Service. In 2017, a single mother with two

children with earnings between $14,040 and $18,340 (a full time-full year minimum


                                            15
wage worker earns $15,080) would receive the maximum credit of $5,616, fully 40

percent of pre-tax earnings. In 2015 the average benefit for families with children was

$3,189 (IRS 2017). The Child Tax Credit (CTC) is similar in structure to the EITC but is

available to families earning substantially more than the EITC. The CTC is also not fully

refundable, which limits the reach of the program to lower income families (Hoynes

and Rothstein 2016). Together these tax credits represent the largest anti-poverty

program for children; the EITC (and the child tax credit) raised 4.8 million children out

of poverty in 2015 (Renwick and Fix 2016).13



Because the EITC is only available to families with positive earned income, the credit is

expected to lead to increases in employment, especially among less-skilled workers.14

The research finds consistent evidence that the EITC leads to increases in employment

(for recent reviews see Hoynes and Rothstein 2016; Nichols and Rothstein 2016). For

example, Meyer and Rosenbaum (2001) find that the EITC raised employment by more

than 7 percentage points for single women with children relative to those without

children between 1984 and 1996. As shown by Hoynes and Patel (forthcoming), the

household earnings gain as a result of the increase in employment is as large a

component to the increase in household (after tax) income as the government outlay

from the EITC. This is important as it establishes a strong “first stage” for the effect of

the EITC on family resources. More generally, changes in maternal employment may

have direct effects on children—potentially positive to the extent that employment

brings more income to the family, or potentially negative to the extent that the child

attends low-quality childcare or receives fewer time investments from his or her

13
   There is little research on the CTC, though one would expect similar impacts as the EITC where the
two programs overlap. All of the studies on the short- and long-term benefits of the tax credits come
from analysis of the EITC.
14
   One exception is secondary earners married to low income primary earners; hours of work are
predicted to fall for those secondary earners (Eissa and Hoynes 2004).

                                                  16
parents. In sum, because the EITC provides both a direct income transfer to families

and a boost to maternal employment, studies of the EITC are measuring a dual

“treatment”.



There is a recent and growing literature that uses the increase in after-tax income

generated by the EITC to examine impacts on downstream outcomes. These studies

use quasi-experimental approaches leveraging legislated expansions of the credit.

Many studies focus on the 1993 expansion of the federal credit, when the maximum

credit more than doubled for families with two children and increased by more than 40

percent for those with one child. This policy variation is leveraged using a difference-in-

difference approach with comparisons across time and family size. The EITC has been

expanded several other times (in 1986, 1990, and 2009), providing additional variation

for researchers. Other researchers use the schedule of the credit—which is phased in at

low earnings levels, level across some income range, and then is phased out above a

higher earnings level, providing variation that can be used for research—to estimate its

impacts. In addition, 29 states (plus Washington, D.C.) have adopted state add-on

EITC programs, providing another source of variation.



Several studies find that the EITC leads to increases in infant health, including an

increase in average birth weight (Baker 2008; Strully et al. 2010). Hoynes, Miller, and

Simon (2015) find that a $1,000 induced increase in after-tax income due to the EITC

leads to a 2-3 percent reduction in low birth weight births. Evans and Garthwaite (2014)

find that the EITC leads to improvements in maternal health, including reducing the

incidence of risky biomarkers such as measures of inflammation, high blood pressure

and elevated cholesterol and improving mental health, and suggesting an income

pathway for a reduction in stress.


                                            17
Additionally, there are several studies documenting a link between the EITC and

cognitive and human capital outcomes. Dahl and Lochner (2012, 2017) use an

instrumental variables approach leveraging the EITC expansions and find that a $1,000

increase in family income due to the EITC leads to an increase in combined math and

reading test scores by 0.04 standard deviations. Chetty, Friedman, and Rockoff (2011),

using the nonlinearity of the EITC schedule and administrative data from New York City

public schools, find that $1,000 in income due to the EITC leads to a 0.06-0.09

standard deviation increase in test scores.15 Bastian and Michelmore (2018) find that a

larger EITC during childhood leads to an increase in completing high school, college

attendance and employment in young adulthood. These effects are more important,

they find, for the EITC received in the teen years. Additionally, Manoli and Turner

(2014) and Maxfield (2013) look at the contemporaneous effects of a more generous

EITC on education and the transition to college. Both studies find that the impact is

larger for children affected at younger ages, while Maxfield additionally finds larger

effects for boys and minority children. Manoli and Turner (2014) use the universe of

federal tax records and the nonlinearity of the EITC schedule to examine the effect of

the EITC in the senior year of high school on college attendance. They find that an

additional $1000 in EITC leads to a 2-3 percentage point increase in college going.

Although direct evidence on longer-term outcomes beyond educational attainment is

limited, we would expect that the increase in human capital shown in the literature will

result in better adult economic and health outcomes, similar to those found for other

interventions.


15
  A related paper using variation across Canadian provinces in the generosity of child tax benefits over
time and finds quantitatively similar effects on children’s cognitive test scores (Milligan and Stabile
2011). They also find positive contemporaneous effects on mental health and some physical health
outcomes.

                                                   18
     c. Unconditional Cash Transfers

AFDC provided cash assistance to poor families (primarily single mother families) with

children beginning in 1935. There is little evidence on the long run effects of the AFDC

program, though Currie and Cole (1993) find that AFDC leads to improvements in birth

outcomes. Federal welfare reform took place in 1996 and, as discussed above,

replaced AFDC with TANF leading to a reduction in funding and a shrinking role of

cash assistance. A large literature examines the effects of welfare reform on short-term

outcomes such as maternal employment, family income, and health (see reviews by

Grogger and Karoly 2006; Moffitt 2003; Ziliak 2016). However, the evidence on the

long-run impacts of providing cash transfers to needy families or the long-term impact

of welfare reform is limited. The best evidence we currently have on the impacts of the

welfare policies on children are from research syntheses that combine the data in

several state welfare experiments in the years prior to federal welfare reform. For

example, the results in Duncan et al. (2011) imply that an additional $1,000 in family

income increases student achievement by 0.05-0.06 standard deviations—a similar

magnitude as the impacts of the EITC described above.16 This achievement gain would

be predicted to raise subsequent earnings by about 1 percent.



Prior to AFDC, some states operated cash welfare programs for families with children—

termed Mothers’ Pension programs. Aizer et al. (2016) use unique historical data to

evaluate the effect of child access to cash welfare on wide range of long term

outcomes. The researchers digitize records from social service agencies in many states


16
  These results come from pooling data across randomized experiments across U.S. states (and one
from Canada) where one group received the welfare reform program and the other the pre-existing
AFDC program. The impact of income on child outcomes is identified using variation across different
programs and an instrumental variables approach (the instrument is random assignment across states).

                                                 19
to determine who either applied for or received benefits and use a research design

that compares children in families that were accepted into the program to children in

families that were rejected from the program. Using data from the military, death

records and several state historical censuses, they find that receipt of cash assistance

has a host of positive impacts, including reducing the probability of being underweight

by half (data available only for men), increasing educational attainment by 0.4 years,

and living an additional 1.5 years of life. There is suggestive evidence that the impacts

may be larger for children exposed at younger ages. While this evidence, from more

than 100 years ago, may have limited applicability to the benefits from current

programs, it provides a unique and comprehensive set of findings measuring the

impact over the very long run of providing additional cash resources to disadvantaged

children.



An interesting set of studies sheds additional light on the impact of additional cash

income to disadvantaged populations. Akee et al. (2010) trace the effects of a casino

opening among the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians in North Carolina. Using the

casino revenues, the tribe initiated “per-capita payments”—a sort of universal basic

income provided to tribe members. Using variation across cohorts over time,

compared to a geographically proximate control group, the researchers found that an

additional $4000 per year in income to the poorest households led to sizeable

improvements in educational attainment and a reduction in criminal activities, with no

adverse impact on employment. Additionally, the cash transfer led to more parental

investment and positive interactions between the parent and child, and beneficial

effects on children’s emotional and behavioral health and personality traits during

adolescence (Akee et al. forthcoming).




                                            20
   d. Public Health Insurance: Medicaid

Medicaid provides public health insurance to children (and others) in low-income

families. Originally, only families receiving cash welfare were for eligible for Medicaid,

but federal law led to significant expansions in the 1980s and 1990s (Gruber 1997).

Though states were required to meet particular expansion targets (e.g. OBRA 1989

required states to cover pregnant women and children under 6 in families below 133%

of the federal poverty level), the states took very different expansion paths—leading to

variation in coverage across states, time, family income and child age. A large literature

takes advantage of these expansions estimating difference-in-difference models to

investigate the long-run effects of access to health insurance and medical care.

Another approach takes advantage of the fact that the Medicaid expansion legislation

stipulated that states had to expand coverage only to children born after September

30, 1983, creating a sharp increase in Medicaid eligibility that is used in a regression

discontinuity design. For example, poor children born in October 1983 experienced 5

more years in Medicaid eligibility compared to a poor child born in September 1983

(Card and Shore-Sheppard 2004; Wherry and Meyer 2015). A few studies discussed

below examine the introduction of Medicaid in 1965 which allows for investigation of

the impacts over a much longer period.



Using the significant policy expansion in the 1980s and 1990s, work on the short-term

impacts of Medicaid eligibility found sizeable impacts on infant health, including

reduced infant mortality and low birth weight (Currie and Gruber 1996). Infant health

impacts were stronger when expansions were restricted to low-income women,

compared with broader expansions. By expanding eligibility and breaking its link to

AFDC, the reforms also resulted in decreased AFDC participation and an increase in

employment among affected mothers (Yelowitz 1995).


                                            21
A large literature has recently emerged examining the effects of childhood exposure to

Medicaid on health and economics outcomes in the teen years through young

adulthood. Currie and Schwandt (2016) find that over this time period, mortality for

infants and children declined overall, and inequality in mortality fell as well (in contrast

to the trends among older adults). Currie et al. (2008) find that Medicaid coverage in

early childhood (ages 2-4) leads to an improvement in self-reported health in later

childhood. Wherry and Meyer (2015) find that additional Medicaid in late childhood

(ages 8-14) leads to a 19 percent reduction in mortality rates from internal causes

among blacks ages 15-18. They do not find any significant mortality change among

whites, or blacks at non-teen ages, although death rates for children older than age 1

and younger than 15 are quite low. Additionally, Wherry et al. (2015) find that Medicaid

eligibility during childhood is associated with fewer hospitalizations and emergency

department visits in early adulthood for blacks, with largest reductions for visits related

to chronic conditions and among individuals living in low-income neighborhoods.

Miller and Wherry (forthcoming) find that Medicaid eligibility between conception and

age 1 results in lower rates of chronic conditions and fewer hospitalizations related to

diabetes and obesity in young adulthood. East et al. (2017) find that Medicaid’s health

benefits extend to the next generation: children of mothers who had more exposure to

Medicaid in their childhood themselves go on to have healthier infants.



The positive effects of Medicaid are not limited to health outcomes. Brown et al. (2015)

use administrative tax data and find that increased exposure to Medicaid during

childhood increases education and earnings through age 28. Miller and Wherry

(forthcoming) find that expansions in Medicaid between conception and age 1 lead to

increases in high school graduation. These results are also supported by Cohodes et al.


                                             22
(2016) who find that increased Medicaid eligibility during childhood reduces high

school dropout rates and increases and college completion, and Levine and

Schanzenbach (2009) who find it increases standardized test scores in fourth and eighth

grade.



Since these policy expansions are relatively recent, the population of treated people

are still in young adulthood. Examining the mid-1960s introduction of Medicaid allows

for a longer-run evaluation of health insurance. Using the timing of the rollout of

Medicaid across states, Bourdreaux et al. (2016) find that increases in Medicaid

exposure between ages 0-5 leads to reductions in chronic conditions (particularly high

blood pressure) in adulthood. Using cross-state variation in AFDC rules and the

introduction of Medicaid, Goodman-Bacon (2016) finds that additional childhood

exposure reduces adult mortality and disability and increases adult employment.



Overall, this recent research on Medicaid, documents a strong link between greater

access to public health insurance during childhood and improved health and economic

well-being in adulthood. There is much more to learn, including the mechanisms for

these improved long-run impacts.



   e. Implications of Safety Net Research

Overall, the literature across programs finds positive long-run benefits of having access

to safety net programs in childhood, leading to improvements to both health and

economic productivity in adulthood. Prior to the emergence of this recent literature,

the discussion of the costs and benefits of the social safety net was focused on the

narrow lens of the short run. Many of the long-run benefits are private (improved own

earnings and own health), though public benefits are also present due to increased


                                            23
taxes and decreased in health-related government outlays. While the literature does

not suggest that the benefits “pay for themselves” in the long run, these programs

nonetheless have substantial positive external benefits that have been quantified.

Additionally, many additional aspects have not yet been quantified—for example,

impacts on criminal activity and longer-term impacts on health—which have large

public components to them and may further increase the benefits.



The literature points to some findings that could be helpful in considering the design

or redesign of the social safety net. First, in the limited number of cases that have

explored differential returns by child age of exposure, the evidence points to greater

long-run returns to exposure in early childhood than later childhood. Second, the

benefits are larger for more disadvantaged groups, especially African Americans. One

caveat on this finding, though, is that it can be difficult to disentangle whether the

larger effects for more disadvantaged groups are due to higher rates of exposure to

these programs or larger returns to exposure. Other dimensions—such as whether

long-run returns differ across cash transfers, in-kind benefits, or health insurance—are

important to ascertain but as yet the evidence is too incomplete to be able to make

such comparisons to inform better design of policy.



   IV.    The Recent Evolution of the Safety Net for Children

Having summarized the recent findings documenting long-run benefits of childhood

exposure to the social safety net, we now examine in more detail what population

these core programs are serving and how this has changed over time. In particular, we

use administrative data to examine aggregate trends in social safety net spending, how

the spending varies across working and non-working families, and how it varies across

the income distribution. We do this for seven programs (Medicaid, EITC, CTC, SNAP,

                                            24
AFDC/TANF, SSI and public housing) and our analysis covers the period 1990 through

2015. In light of the evidence presented in the previous section, not only may these

trends have implications for the welfare of children, families and the economy today,

but they may also impact individuals and the aggregate economy in the long run.



The analysis of trends in safety net spending for different subgroups is complicated by

the well-documented fact that social safety net income is increasingly under-reported

in household surveys (Meyer et al. 2009; Meyer et al. 2015). Since this underreporting

has increased over time, relying on household survey data may be particularly

unsuitable for examining trends in the social safety net. Therefore, our analysis relies as

much as possible on program-specific administrative data.17 In general, we begin with

administrative aggregates and identify the total spending on families with children. For

programs that serve populations beyond families with children, we use available

administrative data to identify the amount that goes to families with children.18 We then

apportion total child spending into four groups based on the share going to those

families with incomes less than 50% poverty, 50-99% poverty, 100-149% poverty, and

150-199% poverty.19 We also apportion total child spending into the amount going to

families with earned income and families without earned income. Unlike the data in


17
   Administrative data are not perfect. They are generated as part of program administration and as
such and often have limited demographic information and only capture family members and family
resources that are part of eligibility and benefit determination. The advantage of household survey data
is that it provides a more comprehensive picture of the household.
18
   To be more specific, the EITC, CTC, SNAP, TANF and housing provide benefits to “family units” – our
case families with children. Two programs, Medicaid and SSI, provide benefits targeted to particular
individuals. We count spending on the entire family (parents and children) for the family unit programs
and count spending for the children for Medicaid and SSI. For more detail, see the appendix.
19
   The CTC extends to families earning far above 200% of the poverty line – we estimate that almost 40%
of the $54 billion in CTC spending in 2015 goes to families above 200 percent of the poverty line.
Among the other social safety net programs little or no spending goes to families above 200% of the
federal poverty line. To maintain our focus on programs targeting the low-income population,
throughout our analysis in this section we limit CTC spending to families below 200% of poverty.

                                                  25
Figures 1 and 2 (which contain only federal data), our administrative aggregates for

state-federal programs (AFDC/TANF, Medicaid) consist of the combined federal and

state spending.



To construct the spending across the four income-to-poverty bins requires a definition

for family resources and the poverty threshold (a family is poor if resources<poverty

threshold). For the poverty threshold, we use SPM poverty thresholds, projected back

to 1990 using methods in Wimer et al. (2014). The SPM threshold bases needs on a

broader array of necessary expenditures and makes other technical improvements

relative to the official poverty measure (which is based on food costs alone). For

reference, the SPM threshold for a family with two adults and two children in 2016 is

$26,104, compared to $24,300 for the official poverty threshold. We define resources

to be earned income plus cash transfers plus in-kind transfers (excluding Medicaid)

minus taxes (including the EITC and CTC)—essentially after-tax and transfer income

following Bitler and Hoynes (2016) and Bitler, Hoynes and Kuka (2017). This definition

of resources is aligned with—though not identical to—the resource measure in the

Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) measured by the Census since 2011.20 However,

each administrative data source provides a different subset of these resources

elements. We come as close as we can to measure after tax and transfer income

consistently across the administrative data sources, imputing missing elements in some

cases. Note that poverty is typically defined based on annual resources. While the EITC

and CTC measures contain annual income data, the administrative data for SNAP and

20
   The SPM resource measure subtracts medical out-of-pocket expenditures and work-related expenses
(including child care and other expenses). These elements are not measured in the administrative data
and thus excluded from our resource measure. Additionally, each of our administrative data cover
different income and transfer measures. For example, the tax data which we use for the EITC and CTC,
does not include any nontaxable income sources (such as SNAP). The SNAP administrative data, does
not include measures of tax credits (EITC). We make an effort to calculate resources consistently across
sources; see the Appendix for details.

                                                   26
AFDC/TANF only measure monthly income, which we then use to approximate annual

income by multiplying it by 12. We are able to apportion spending into the four

poverty and two earnings groups relying solely on administrative data for SNAP, EITC,

CTC, and AFDC/TANF. For the remaining three programs (Medicaid, SSI, and public

housing) no suitable administrative data are available; we instead use the Current

Population Survey to apportion aggregate spending into the groups. For more detail

on our approach, see the data appendix.



Figure 6 plots the real aggregate spending on families with children between 1990 and

2015, by program.21 Overall total spending is increasing, from under $100 billion in

1990 to about $270 billion in 2015 (in real 2015 dollars). However, the overall trend

masks substantial differences across individual programs. Cash welfare (not tied to

work) for families with children declined substantially following 1996 federal welfare

reform; cash assistance through AFDC totaled $34 billion in 1990 compared to $8

billion (under TANF) in 2015.22 In contrast, the introduction of the CTC and expansion

of both tax credits (EITC and CTC) have led to large increases in spending – from $12

billion in 1990 (for the EITC) to about $100 billion in 2015 for the combined EITC and

CTC.23 SNAP spending had been fairly consistent over the first two decades of the time

series, before increasing sharply during the Great Recession. Medicaid spending has

also increased substantially over this twenty-five-year period, reflecting the policy

expansions that led to increases in health insurance coverage among children. Housing

assistance and SSI, by contrast, have remained fairly small contributors to overall


21
   Here, and throughout the rest of the paper, we limit CTC spending to that going to families with
income below 200% of poverty.
22
   This is labeled TANF but it spans the period in the transition from AFDC (1990-1996) to TANF (1997-
present).
23
   In 2015, the total CTC cost was $54 billion, the cost limited to those with income below 200% of
poverty was $33 billion.

                                                  27
federal child spending. In sum, the composition of the social safety net for children

have changed substantially over this time period. In 1990, the majority of spending was

received by families with children receiving cash welfare.24 Today there is minimal

unconditional cash welfare spending, instead the vast majority of public expenditures

are for tax credits tied to paid work and health insurance.



To further investigate these changes, we next examine how social safety net spending

has changed across the income distribution. To do this we apportion total spending in

each program into four bins of after-tax and transfer income relative to the SPM

poverty threshold (<50%, 50-99%, 100-149%, 150-199%) and sum up across the

programs. Figure 7 presents the tabulations based on spending on SNAP, EITC, CTC

and AFDC/TANF. We limit to these four programs because apportioning into poverty

(and earnings) groups is possible using only administrative data. Appendix Figure 1

presents a comparable figure that also includes public housing, SSI and Medicaid

(where apportioning into groups relies on the Current Population Survey). In the top

panel we plot aggregate spending (by poverty category) year by year, in real 2015

dollars, and in the bottom panel we plot the share of total spending each year going to

each of the four poverty categories. These figures show that overall spending has

increased most dramatically for families between 100 and 149 percent of the poverty

line, from less than $10 billion in 1990 to $54 billion in 2015. Spending directed to

families between 150 and 200 percent of poverty has also notably increased, from

essentially zero in 1990 to $14 billion in 2015. Spending on families between 50 and

100 percent of poverty dropped in real terms from 1995 to 2002, then increased

sharply during the Great Recession before coming down again in recent years. Panel

(b) shows that the share of the social safety net going to families with children in


24
     Prior to welfare reform, Medicaid was limited to families receiving cash assistance (AFDC or SSI).

                                                      28
poverty (particularly 50-99% poverty) has declined substantially over this period; the

share of spending on families with income below poverty has fallen from 87 percent in

1990 to 56 percent in 2015. This has been replaced by gains in the share going to

families with income in 100-149% of poverty and to a lesser extent 150-200% poverty.



The qualitative findings are similar for the results on the full set of seven programs

(Appendix Figure 1). While there are gains in the level of spending in each income-to-

poverty group, the share of spending for families below the poverty threshold has

fallen steeply.



Another lens to examine this change is to apportion spending to families with earned

income compared to families without earned income. We present those results

(excluding Medicaid, SSI and public housing) in Figure 8 (and with these programs in

Appendix Figure 2). These striking results show that virtually all of the gains in

spending on the social safety net for children since 1990 has gone to families with

earnings (Figure 8A). In real terms, spending on families without earnings has fallen

from $45 billion in 1990 to $33 billion in 2015. The share of total spending going to

families without earnings has fallen even more—from almost 70 percent of spending in

1990 to 20 percent in 2015 (Figure 8B). The same patterns are evident for the full set of

7 programs (Appendix Figure 2).



The results in Figures 7 and 8 show that the distribution of spending has changed

substantially over time—away from the lowest income levels and away from non-

workers. Part of this is the result of the contraction of some programs (e.g.

AFDC/TANF) and the expansion of others (EITC, CTC). Figure 9 provides a summary of

the policy changes between 1992 (Figure 9A) and 2015 (Figure 9B). Each figure shows


                                            29
the sources of support for a hypothetical family consisting of a single mother with two

children. We simulate the benefits (e.g. AFDC/TANF, SNAP, EITC, CTC, etc.) for a

range of annual earnings; all benefits and earnings are in 2015 dollars.25 In 1992,

welfare reform has not yet occurred, the EITC is quite small, there is no CTC, and the

benefits are targeted at the bottom of the earnings distribution. In 2015, in contrast,

TANF is no longer an entitlement (so is excluded here), the EITC has expanded, the

CTC has been introduced, and SNAP remained much the same. On net resources have

shifted away from the lowest earnings levels and moved up the income distribution.

These illustrative policy changes are born out in the empirical analysis in Figures 7 and

8.



A natural question to ask is to what extent are the trends in spending across poverty

and work categories (Figures 7 and 8) driven by changes in the number of children

across these groups? These changes may be a direct result of the changes in the

policies illustrated above as well as other factors. However, the administrative data do

not allow for this measurement, and so counting the number of children by poverty

group (or by parental work status) requires using the CPS data which are known to

contain substantial measurement error. Nonetheless, Figure 10 presents the percent of

children in each of the poverty groups, using CPS data from 1990 to 2015. The percent

of children below 50% of poverty has remained quite steady. The share in 50-99% of

poverty dropped sharply in the 1993-2000 period due to welfare reform, the EITC

expansion and the rise in employment (Meyer and Rosenbaum 2001; Grogger 2003)

and has slightly trended up before falling at the end of the period. We can use the

poverty counts underlying Figure 10 (and for earnings, Figure 4) and convert the

                                                30
spending in a poverty group (or earnings group) into spending per number of children

in that group. As shown in Figure 11A, per-child spending in all the income-to-poverty

groups exhibits a steady upward trajectory, particularly for the highest income-to-

poverty groups—for example from under $1000 in 1990 to more than $4000 in 2015

for those between 100-149% of poverty (real 2016 dollars). The trends for the lower

two groups are quite flat, by comparison, except for increases in the Great Recession

and its aftermath. This is particularly apparent when the trends by poverty group are

expressed relative to their 1990 levels. Figure 11B shows the relatively small changes

for the lower poverty groups in per capita spending compared to the six fold increase

for those with incomes between 100-149% (in fact we had to omit the relative trend for

the highest income group as it increases 45 times over this period, from a very low

baseline in 1990).



As we showed in Figure 4, children are much more likely to live in families with working

parents. This is important to take into account when viewing the trends over time in

spending by earnings group (Figure 8). Figure 12 presents per capita spending by

earnings group in levels (Figure 12A) and growth in per capita spending relative to

1990 (Figure 12B). These graphs clearly show that the spending per child has increased

dramatically for children in families with earnings (increasing fivefold over this period)

compared to a (small) decline in per capita spending for children without working

parents.



To gain more insight into how these changes in the social safety net break down along

the different programs, Figure 13 presents spending for those below poverty (pooling

<50% and 50-99%) and above poverty (pooling 100-149% and 150-199%) in 1990 and

2015, program by program. This figure reveals several important facts. Welfare reform


                                             31
and the decline in unconditional cash assistance is fully felt by those with the lowest

incomes. More than half of the increased spending for the EITC and more than three-

quarters of the increased spending for the CTC goes to those with income between

100-199% of poverty. Most of the increases in Medicaid spending are also going to

those above poverty. Additionally, Figure 14 shows that across each program, the

increases in spending are going to those with earned income.



Ours is not the first study to examine the evolution of the social safety net for children

and families. However, to our knowledge, we are the first to rely almost exclusively on

administrative data to analyze data by poverty status and work status. For example,

Moffitt (2015) in his Presidential Address to the Population Association of America,

presents similar calculations by poverty status where he uses the Survey of Income and

Program Participation to apportion spending into poverty bins. The Congressional

Budget Office (2013), in their analysis of the distribution of taxes and spending across

income quintiles, uses the IRS’s Statistics of Income Public Use Tax File (for taxable

transfers, EITC, CTC and other taxes—as we do) but uses the Current Population

Survey for nontaxable transfers. Meyer and Mittag (2015) show that relying on

household surveys such as the CPS have important misclassification of the level and

composition of families defined as poor. Isaacs et al. (2017) use the Urban Institute

TRIM3 model to adjust for underreporting of transfers, but their study focuses on

aggregate trends and does not show the results by poverty or work status. In Appendix

Figure 3, we compare the CPS and administrative estimates of the share of social

safety net spending by poverty group. The CPS shows much higher amounts of

spending on the above-poverty group than does the administrative data, consistent

with underreporting among lower-income survey recipients. The CPS underreporting




                                            32
is also becoming greater over time for the below-poverty group—the ratio of CPS to

administrative counts fell from almost 50 percent in 1990 to 27 percent in 2015.



In summary, the level and composition of the social safety net for families with children

has changed substantially over the past 25 years. One major finding is the decline of

cash assistance and the rise of Medicaid and tax credits that are linked to paid work.

Spending on Medicaid and tax credits have grown both absolutely and as a share of

total expenditures, and they now represent three quarters of all spending on low

income families with children. A second major finding is the shift in spending to work-

contingent programs away from traditional out-of-work assistance. A third finding,

related to the first two, is the shift in spending from the most disadvantaged to

somewhat higher up the income distribution. Finally, through this period of change,

SNAP has remained steady and significantly important for low-income families.



An implication of this shift is less protection to negative (labor market and other) shocks

among disadvantaged families. In fact, building a safety net around work leaves

families with little protection during times of high unemployment. Bitler, Hoynes and

Kuka (2017) show that spending on tax credits is (pro) cyclical and thus provides little

protection against economic downturns. Bitler and Hoynes (2015, 2016) show that an

implication of the massive shift in the social safety net is that deep poverty increased

by more in the Great Recession than we would have predicted from prior downturns.26

This shift would also be expected to increase income volatility for the most


26
  The Bitler and Hoynes work estimates regressions of the relationship between the state-level
unemployment rate and (poverty and) deep poverty rates, finding that in the Great Recession deep
poverty increased by more than would be predicted based on the relationship from prior recessions.
The Bitler and Hoynes data are not adjusted for underreporting. Sherman and Trisi (2015) find that the
overall rate of children's deep poverty, after adjusting for underreporting, did not rise between 2007
(2.7%) and 2010 (2.6%).

                                                  33
disadvantaged. Because unemployment rates are higher and more cyclical for African

Americans, this reorientation of the safety net is likely to have particularly harmful

consequences for black children (Hoynes, Miller and Schaller 2012). The mounting

evidence presented above on the long-term impacts of resources in childhood,

however, suggests that children’s additional vulnerability to economic downturns likely

will have downstream costs in terms of worse later-life health and economic outcomes.


   V.     Conclusions and Future Research

Increasing income and resources at bottom of the distribution may generate

substantial benefits, both private and public, in the longer run that have only recently

begun to be quantified. There may be particularly large returns to these investments

when children are young and to the most disadvantaged children. This implies that the

benefits of safety net are broader than previously thought and that there are positive

external benefits to taxpayers. With interest in more “evidence-based policy making,”

it is important to keep in mind that the costs are easily measured today but many of

the benefits are harder to measure and may not appear until the longer run.



Moving forward there is much more we would like to know. There are more outcomes

to be quantified, including outcomes that, if improved, would yield substantial public

cost savings such as disability, crime, and later-life health. There are programs with

demonstrated positive short-run impacts (WIC, SSI) where we have no research on

long-run impacts. In addition, it is important to determine whether there are

interactions between programs, and if so, are they substitutes or complements? What

is effective for remediation for early childhood deprivation? How do these investments

vary across children? When and for whom are the benefits the greatest? Are the returns

consistently greater in early life? Are there differences by gender, or gender-by-race?


                                             34
Finally, we need to fill in gaps in our understanding of the effects of programs between

early life and adulthood; this should help us learn about mechanisms.



Given the early stages of this research, we do not think it is possible at this point to

make conclusions about the rates of return, their magnitudes or how they vary across

different programs. Given the emerging evidence, we don’t think it is likely that these

long-run benefits will be sufficiently large for the programs to “pay for themselves.”

However, these long-run benefits currently are largely ignored in policy discussions,

and it may be important for gaining insight into the nature of material depravation and

the gains to a more generous and counter-cyclical social safety net.



The research is developed enough today, though, to provide some guidance to

policymakers. First, it documents the importance of a robust social safety net. Cuts to

programs that reduce resources going to children, which are currently being discussed,

will have direct, negative impacts on children in both the short- and long-term. Second,

employment and earnings have become an increasingly important source of income for

the poor, and as a result safety net programs are acting as a partial income supplement

during normal economic times (extremely important given the prevalence of wage

stagnation in the lower half of the wage distribution), and consumption insurance when

earnings are lost or fewer hours are available. As such, maintaining the strong work

incentives (Kosar and Moffitt 2017) will allow for support of a broader population and

also to ensure that programs can respond quickly to replace lost income during

recessions. This suggests that reforms such as block grants that are unchanged during

downturns—or require Congressional approval and the delays that come with it—are

less effective than programs that can automatically respond and quickly enroll families

once they become eligible for benefits. Third, devoting more effort to raising


                                             35
enrollment among eligible children will increase the the long-run benefits of these

programs. Fourth, building a safety net based largely on work contingent programs

means they provide incomplete insurance against earnings and employment losses.

The fact that we lack a significant out of work social safety net means higher rates of

deep poverty (less than 50% poverty) that harms children in the short and long run.

Putting this all together, since there is a substantial investment component to safety

net spending, and because there have been positive returns on expansions in

spending, the evidence suggests there could be further returns to additional safety net

spending for the young.

This paper documents how the social safety net for children has changed over time,
including (1) aggregate spending; (2) spending across different parts of the income
distribution and by work status; (3) spending across cash assistance versus in-kind
programs. One issue affecting much of the literature in this area is underreporting of
benefits in household surveys. Therefore, this analysis relies as much as possible on
administrative data.

The basic approach is as follows; program-specific details are provided below:

       1. Using administrative total spending for program i in year t for all persons,
          𝐸!"!"" , we limit the program to spending on children and their families,
          𝐸!"!"# = 𝐸!"!"" ∗ 𝑆!!"# . All annual expenditures are presented in 2015 dollars and
          adjusted for inflation using the CPI-U-RS.
       2. Apportion the aggregate spending going to families with children into five
          groups based on after-tax-and-transfer income (ATTI) and Supplemental
          Poverty Measure (SPM) status into five bins (<50% poverty, 50-99% poverty,
          100-149% poverty, 150-199% poverty, and 200+% poverty).

For all programs except Medicaid and SSI, 𝐸!"!"# is defined as expenditures going to
families with children. We limit Medicaid and SSI expenditures to payments to children.

ATTI is defined as earned income plus cash and near-cash assistance (AFDC/TANF and
SNAP, respectively), minus taxes paid (payroll taxes, as well as federal and local income
taxes, including tax credits such as the EITC and CTC; and the employee’s share of
payroll taxes). As information on all resources available to families are not available in
each administrative source, this income definition is less comprehensive than the
measure used to estimate SPM poverty. For example, our ATTI does not include child
care expenses, housing assistance, medical out-of-pocket expenditures, or work-
related expenses. In cases where the administrative data do not include information on
each income source, we impute this information based on statutory program eligibility
and take-up rates. Details on each program are provided below and in Appendix Table
A1.

We use an “anchored poverty threshold”, defined as the average SPM poverty
threshold in calendar year 2014 for renter families, adjusted for family size; for each


                                             45
year we adjust the threshold for changes in prices using the CPI-U-RS following the
approach of Wimer et al (2014).

Tax credits
EITC: The Internal Review Service Statistics of Income (IRS SOI) publishes data on total
federal EITC expenditures by number of children and family type for tax years 1996-
2015. For those years we have a direct measure of 𝐸!"!"# . For tax years 1994 and 1995,
we multiply the published total federal payments going to all families with children by
the estimated the share of total EITC payments going to families with children using
the IRS SOI Public Use microdata file (SOI PUF). Prior to tax year 1994, only families
with children were eligible for the EITC; all EITC expenditures for 1990-1993 are
allocated to families with children.

CTC: This analysis includes the refundable (ACTC) and non-refundable component
(CTC) of the Child Tax Credit, which we refer to throughout as the “Child Tax Credit.”
The IRS SOI publishes data on both the refundable and non-refundable component for
tax years 1998-2015.

We estimate the fraction of EITC and CTC payments going to families in each income-
to-poverty bin using SOI PUF files for 1990-2011. These data provide information on
earned income and taxes paid. We assume that families receiving refundable credits
do not have AFDC/TANF income. We estimate SNAP payments by calculating
potential benefits under the statutory benefit formula and assuming monthly income is
one-twelfth annual income. We randomly assign SNAP receipt to credit recipients so
that the share of SNAP-eligible credit recipients matches the overall SNAP take-up rate
each year.27 For years 2012-2015, we hold the share of benefits going to each income-
to-poverty bin at the 2011 shares (the most recent PUF year).28 As this analysis focuses
on safety net programs to families with children, our aggregate figures limit CTC
expenditures to the fraction of the credit going to families below 200 percent of
poverty.

Filers must have earned income to receive the EITC and CTC. Therefore, all EITC and
CTC expenditures are allocated to working families.


27
   During our period of analysis, overall SNAP take-up rates among the eligible population range from 53 percent in
2001 to 83 percent in 2012.
28
   Beginning in tax year 2009, the IRS public-use files top-code the number of dependents (and EITC children) at
three for all households (in previous years, the topcode only applied to high-income households). We estimate the
income-to-poverty ratio based on the number of reported dependents. As 97 percent of filers with children have
three or fewer children in 2008, this calculation affects relatively few filers.

                                                        46
Non-tax income assistance
AFDC/TANF: We limit AFDC/TANF payments to cash (basic) assistance payments paid
for with federal funds and state maintenance of effort (MOE) dollars. Prior to welfare
reform, program expenditures were almost entirely cash assistance. Under TANF, a
small share of the block grant is used on cash assistance; 26% nationwide in 2015
(Bitler and Hoynes 2016). State-level annual basic assistance information comes from
the Department of Health and Human Services, Administration for Children and
Families. We sum expenditures for the 50 states and DC to obtain national totals.

For years 1990-1994, we estimate the share of AFDC benefits going to each income-
to-poverty bin and employment status using the AFDC Quality Control (QC) files. The
AFDC QC files provide detailed administrative data necessary to establish eligibility
and benefits, such as family characteristics, income sources (those that count towards
benefits) and so on. For these years, we observe earned income and simulate taxes
using NBER TAXSIM. SNAP payments are not observed in this data as they are not
countable income towards AFDC benefits. We estimate Food Stamps benefits using
the statutory formula and reported earned income in each year, assuming that families
take the maximum shelter deduction and no dependent care exemption. We assume
full take-up among AFDC/TANF families.

For years 1995 through 2015, we estimate the share going to each income-to-poverty
bin using the maximum grant amounts by state-family size-year. We assume for
simplicity that earned income reduces a family’s TANF grant dollar-for-dollar; therefore,
the maximum grant determines a family’s income level.29 We add SNAP benefits to
cash assistance by taking the reported share of the maximum SNAP benefit accruing to
AFDC families in 1994 (the most recent year of the QC file estimates) and multiply this
fraction by the contemporaneous Food Stamps benefit in subsequent years. Finally, we
multiply these state-by-family-size bins by state total basic expenditures, and
aggregate state expenditures to the national level.

HHS's "Characteristics and Financial Circumstances of TANF Recipients" provides
employment rates for TANF families for 1995-1996 and 2000-2015. Over this period,
most welfare recipients do not have earned income and thus receive the full benefit:
the work participation rate is around 12 percent. To estimate the share of employed
households for the remaining years, we assume that all child-only cases do not work
and assign the adult recipient employment rate to the remaining households. For

29
  In practice many states lowered the implicit tax rate on TANF from the 100% rate that existed under AFDC.
Unfortunately, we don’t observe earnings for years post-welfare reform so cannot simulate the distribution of
benefits as we can in the years prior to TANF.

                                                       47
1995-2015, we assign equal benefits to working and non-working households, so that
the employment rate is the share of cash assistance received by working households.

These AFDC and TANF calculations are all based on monthly income (that is what is
used in program administration). We multiply all amounts by 12 to get annual income;
which is necessary for assigning poverty.

Food Stamps/SNAP: Annual SNAP expenditure information comes from the US
Department of Agriculture. We scale this total amount by the fraction of SNAP benefits
going to families with children, using an estimate of 𝐸!"!"# calculated using the SNAP
Quality Control (QC) files for 1990-2015.

We estimate the share of SNAP payments going to each income-to-poverty bin and
household work status using information on SNAP benefit amounts and household
income and cash assistance from the annual SNAP QC files. As with AFDC, the SNAP
QC files provide detailed administrative data necessary to establish eligibility and
benefits, such as family characteristics, income sources (those that count towards
benefits) and so on. Using the QC data, we calculate after tax and transfer income
using observed data on earnings and AFDC/TANF cash assistance. Estimated federal,
state, and payroll taxes (including tax credits EITC, CTC) are calculated using TAXSIM.
As with AFDC/TANF, the SNAP QC data contains monthly income and we multiply by
12 to get annual income.

Medicaid: We limit Medicaid expenditures to state and federal expenditures on
children (excluding pregnant women and parents) with annual expenditure data from
the Centers on Medicare and Medicaid Services (MSIS) from 1990 through 2011.
Publicly available Medicaid expenditures for children are not available from CMS for
later years.30

For years 2012 and 2013, we apply the percentage change in Medicaid expenditures
to children estimated by the Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission
(MACPAC) since 2011 to the level reported by CMS in 2011. For 2014, we estimate the
percent change between 2013 and 2014 using estimates from the Kaiser Family
Foundation (KFF) from 2014 and MACPAC for 2013, adjusted using the ratio of

30
  Unlike the benefits discussed above, Medicaid eligibility is individual based, rather than family based. Therefore
we measure expenditures directly for children. This is somewhat inconsistent with our measurement of the family
benefits. For example with SNAP we measure the total spending to families with children, rather than carving out
the benefit amount that is attributed to the child. Given the fungibility of spending within households, we think
this is the best approach. The published Medicaid expenditure data does not allow us to identify pregnant women
or adults in families with children. Therefore we limit the measurement to payments going to child coverage.

                                                        48
KFF/MACPAC estimated expenditures for 2011. For 2015, we apply the estimated
percentage change in expenditures on children between 2014 and 2015 using CBO’s
March 2015 baseline.

Administrative data on income levels and sources for child Medicaid recipients is not
available in the administrative data. In order to allocate Medicaid expenditures to each
poverty bin, we use information on self-reported Medicaid receipt and family after-tax
and transfer income from the Annual Social and Economic Supplement to the Current
Population Survey, estimating federal, state, and payroll taxes (including tax credits
EITC, CTC) using NBER TAXSIM.

Public Housing: Housing expenditures are defined as outlays to the public housing
operating and capital funds, as well as project-based and tenant-based rental
assistance vouchers. Historical outlays for each program are tabulated by the Office of
Management and Budget. For simplicity, we assume an equal dollar value for each unit
of housing. We then estimate the share of housing assistance for families with children
as the fraction of total units received by single- and two-parent families from HUD’s
Picture of Subsidized Households dataset. We calculate this fraction separately for
public housing and vouchers. Information on the share of units going to families with
children is available annually from 2004 through 2015 and intermittently between 1993
and 2004. For years where HUD data is unavailable, we linearly interpolate the share of
assistance units going to households with children.

Following an approach similar to allocating Medicaid dollars, we estimate the share of
families with children in each income-to-poverty category using information on housing
assistance receipt and family after-tax and transfer income from the Annual Social and
Economic Supplement to the Current Population Survey, estimating federal, state, and
payroll taxes (including tax credits EITC, CTC) using NBER TAXSIM.

SSI: Historical federal SSI payments to children are listed in the 2016 Annual Report of
the Supplemental Security Income Program. We define child SSI expenditures as
payments to blind or disabled individuals ages 0-17.

As with Medicaid expenditures, we estimate the share of child SSI payments going to
each income-to-poverty bin by using estimates of the number of children in each family
receiving SSI, as well as family after-tax and transfer income from the Annual Social and
Economic Supplement to the Current Population Survey. We estimate federal, state,
and payroll taxes (including tax credits EITC, CTC) using NBER TAXSIM.

Note: This table summarizes the source of each component of after-tax income by
program. For AFDC/TANF, for AFDC years we observe earned income and use
TAXSIM to assign taxes. For the TANF period we don’t observe earnings so assume
they are 0. See data appendix for details.
