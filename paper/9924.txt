                                             ABSTRACT

In this paper, I argue that intangible capital is not a distinct input to production like physical capital

or labor but rather it is the glue that creates value from other inputs. This perspective naturally leads

to an empirical model in which intangible capital is defined in terms of adjustment costs. Estimates

of these adjustment costs using firm-level panel data suggest that there are no appreciable

intangibles associated with R&D and advertising whereas information technology creates intangibles

with a 70% annual rate of return — a sizable figure that is nevertheless much smaller than reported

in previous studies. As a bridge to previous research, I show that much larger estimates can be

obtained by using ordinary least squares, which ignores the possibility that the value of the .rm and

its investment policy are simultaneously determined. Larger estimates can also be obtained by

ignoring the possibility that the stock market overstates the value of intangible-intensive companies.

1    Introduction

Almost without exception, there are no direct measures of the returns to intangible

capital. As a result, researchers have relied primarily on the equity market to infer the

value of intangibles. The basic idea is straightforward. If the equity market reveals the

intrinsic value of the ﬁrm, then subtracting the value of the ﬁrm’s tangible assets from

its market value reveals the value of the ﬁrm’s intangible assets. Using this method,

Hall (2001) argued that U.S. companies accumulated an enormous stock of intangible

capital in the 1990s.1

    Despite the appealing simplicity of the equity market measurement approach, con-

siderable caution is warranted. According to this approach, Yahoo!’s intangibles were

worth upwards of $100 billion in 2000. However, they are now worth less than a tenth

of that number. To be sure, this drop does not necessarily pose a problem for the equity

market measurement approach. Yahoo!’s market capitalization could reﬂect changes

in expected proﬁts or expected returns or both. But this example illustrates a potential

pitfall from relying on the equity market to reveal the value of intangible capital. The

value of intangible capital will be mismeasured to the extent that asset prices depart

from their intrinsic value.

    The basic drawback of the equity market measurement approach is that it presents

a catch-22: investors must have information about intangibles to value them; but in-

vestors do not have the information they need because intangibles, by their very nature,

are extraordinarily diﬃcult to value. This circularity calls into question the assump-

tion of strongly eﬃcient markets underlying the equity market measurement approach.

  1 The idea that the stock market reveals the quantity of capital in the absence of rents and adjustment

costs was stated clearly by Baily (1981), who interpreted the stock-market data in the 1970s as showing
that energy price shocks eﬀectively destroyed a great deal of capital.




                                                   1
How can the value of the ﬁrm as revealed by equity markets be equal to the intrinsic

value of the ﬁrm — deﬁned as the present value of expected cash ﬂows — when so little

is known by market participants about the value of intangibles?

   As an alternative proxy for the intrinsic value of the ﬁrm, I construct the discounted

value of expected proﬁts using analysts’ forecasts. I/B/E/S has collected data on proﬁt

forecasts for a large sample of companies since 1982. The analysts provide forecasts

of one-year-ahead and two-year-ahead proﬁts as well as the growth rate of proﬁts out

to a ﬁve-year horizon. In formulating their forecasts, analysts assess whether a new

supply chain management system, say, is expected to add to intangible capital and,

as a result, generate additional proﬁts. Thus, if intangibles are expected to contribute

materially to a company’s bottom line over the analysts’ ﬁve year horizon, then their

value should be reﬂected in analysts’ forecasts.

   Of course, analysts’ forecasts are not a silver bullet. After all, the majority of ana-

lysts appear to have overestimated the growth rates of intangible-intensive companies

in the late-1990s. And, there’s little guidance about how to discount these forecasts.

Just as the stock market may be a poor proxy for a ﬁrm’s intrinsic value, so too may

be the discounted value of expected proﬁts. However, these two proxies deviate from

a ﬁrm’s intrinsic value for diﬀerent reasons. The stock-market-based measure reﬂects

any market ineﬃciency, whereas the analyst-based measure reﬂects any bias on the

part of analysts’ and mistakes in how the forecasts are discounted.

   The econometric setup explicitly recognizes the fact that the two proxies measure

the ﬁrm’s intrinsic value with diﬀerent kinds of error. Ultimately, identiﬁcation of the

model parameters depends on whether there are informative instrumental variables

that are uncorrelated with the measurement errors inherent in the two proxies. Theory




                                            2
oﬀers little guidance about the nature of the measurement errors and, consequently,

identiﬁcation is an empirical issue that must be investigated with diagnostic tests, such

as the test of the model’s overidentifying restrictions.

    For my empirical work, I put together a dataset that distinguishes ﬁrms’ expendi-

tures on tangible capital, information technology (IT), and intellectual property (IP).

Using these data, I estimate the return on each type of capital using both the stock-

market- and analyst-based measures of the ﬁrm’s intrinsic value. Perhaps the most

interesting ﬁnding is that organizational capital created by IT generates a return of

70% at an annual rate. Despite the magnitude of this estimate, it is considerably smaller

than comparable estimates in previous studies. As a bridge to the previous research,

I show that much larger estimates can be obtained by using ordinary least squares,

which ignores the possibility that the value of the ﬁrm and its investment policy are

simultaneously determined. Larger estimates can also be obtained by using a stock-

market-based measure of the ﬁrm’s intrinsic value.




2     The Valuation of Intangible Capital

2.1   Intangible Capital: An Instrumental Deﬁnition

I distinguish between two types of intangibles, intellectual property and organizational

capital. Broadly deﬁned, IP includes patents, trademarks, copyrights, brand names, se-

cret formulas and so on. For my purposes, I deﬁne organizational capital as business

models, designs, and routines that create value from information technology. With-

out a doubt, organizational capital is a broader concept than suggested by this very




                                            3
narrow deﬁnition. For example, innovative compensation policies and eﬀective train-

ing programs are surely part of organizational capital. Indeed, the systematic focus

on creating organizational capital can be traced to industrial pioneer Fredrick Winslow

Taylor and his intellectual forbearers. I adopt a deﬁnition based on IT not because IT

is qualitatively diﬀerent from any other method or technology that aids organizational

eﬃciency, but because sizable, measurable outlays are devoted to it.

    This dichotomous taxonomy suits my empirical model and the data. In terms of the

data, companies report expenditures on R&D and advertising, which create what I have

deﬁned as intellectual property. These expenditures can be capitalized to create the

IP capital stock. It may seem like such a stock is essentially arbitrary — there is little

guidance, for example, about how R&D and advertising depreciate — but it should be

recognized that the stock of property, plant, and equipment is a similarly unpalatable

concept, even though researchers have become suﬃciently inured of it.2

    As a practical matter, it is also important to distinguish between intellectual prop-

erty and organizational capital because outlays on R&D, advertising, and IT have be-

haved diﬀerently over time. In particular, R&D and advertising appear to be declining

in relative importance. Outlays on IT have soared while advertising as a proportion of

nonﬁnancial corporate gross domestic proﬁt grew modestly from 3.9% in 1980-89 to

4.1% in 1990-97; The comparable ﬁgures for R&D are 2.3% and 2.9% (Nakamura 1999).

Hence, if intangibles create extraordinary gains in ﬁrm value, arguably the most plau-

sible driver is organizational capital, not intellectual property.

  2 Indeed, the accounting for physical assets in ﬁnancial statements may be about as deﬁcient as the

accounting for IP. Physical assets are capitalized at historical costs and are depreciated in ways that may
be poor approximations to their service ﬂow. Perpetual inventory capital stocks constructed from such
data may also be only loose approximations to the service ﬂow of capital.




                                                    4
   So what exactly is organizational capital? As a purely mechanical matter, I deﬁne

organizational capital as an adjustment cost from IT investment, deﬁned as the diﬀer-

ence between the value of installed and uninstalled IT.3 Suppose a company purchases

database software. By itself, database software does not generate any value. At a min-

imum, the software has to be combined with a database and, perhaps, a sales force.

Organizational capital deﬁnes how the database is used and, consequently, how soft-

ware investment creates value.

   A speciﬁc example helps illustrate the deﬁnition. Dell’s value depends on a unique

organizational design that sells build-to-order computers direct to customers. There’s

little diﬀerence between Dell’s and HP’s tangible capital stock since both companies

assemble computers. The reason any given piece of tangible capital is more valuable

when it is installed at Dell has to do with Dell’s unique business model and routines,

organizational capital that combines the usual factors of production in a special way.

HP cannot simply replicate Dell’s tangible capital stock and become as proﬁtable as

Dell. Hence, it doesn’t make sense to think about organizational capital, or intangibles

more generally, as separate factors of production that can be purchased in a market.

In most cases, intangibles are so closely connected with traditional factor inputs — like

a computer or a college graduate — that their valuation on a standalone basis is nearly

impossible (see, e.g., Lev 2001).

   This deﬁnition contrasts sharply with the tendency in the literature to think about

intangible capital as pretty much like any other quasi-ﬁxed factor of production. In

that mold, ﬁrms buy intangibles like they buy machinery. But intangibles, by and large,

are diﬀerent from other factors because companies cannot order or hire intangibles.

  3 This rather narrow deﬁnition based on IT adjustment costs is motivated by a broader interpretation of

organizational capital in terms of adjustment costs, as in, for example, Prescott and Visscher (1980).




                                                   5
That’s because intangible capital usually has to do with the distinctive way companies

combine the usual factors of production. Treating intangibles as an input itself misses

this point all together.

   The model in the next section formalizes this observation by deﬁning intangibles

as whatever makes installed inputs more valuable than uninstalled inputs — that is,

whatever makes a Dell out of the same computers and college graduates that HP can

buy. Realistically, this deﬁnition isn’t exhaustive since there are intangibles that aren’t

associated with speciﬁc expenditures. For example, a good idea — selling computers

using the Internet in Dell’s case — can be thought of as a type of intangible capital.

Nevertheless, most intangibles are closely associated with some sort of outlay; after

all, it usually takes at least some investment to make a good idea proﬁtable.

   My deﬁnition of organizational capital might seem similar to the more familiar con-

cept of multifactor productivity or IT-biased technical change. Indeed, organizational

capital is like IT-biased technical change in that both boost the marginal product of

IT capital. However, there is a critical diﬀerence: organizational capital is costly to

create; by contrast, MFP and IT-biased technical change require no speciﬁc outlays,

which is why they are called ‘manna from heaven.’ Organizational capital should be

distinguished from embodied technical change as well. Embodied technical change

characterizes the capabilities of a particular asset — disk drives are more eﬃcient and

reliable than they used to be — but organizational capital depends on how the ﬁrm

utilizes an asset. Returning to the example above, both Dell and HP can buy the same

technology embodied in a new disk drive but the drive is more valuable at Dell because

of its superior organizational capital.




                                            6
2.2    Theoretical Model

The model is a straightforward variant of Hayashi and Inoue (1991), who derived an

expression for the value of a ﬁrm with multiple capital goods, and follows the deriva-

tion in Bond and Cummins (2000). Similar to what I have in mind, Hall (1993a) used

Hayashi and Inoue’s model to estimate the rate of return to R&D. The novel twist in our

application is the idea that intangibles are like adjustment costs, which can, in turn, be

estimated econometrically.

    In each period, the ﬁrm chooses investment in each type of capital good: It =

(I1t , . . . , INt ), where j indexes the N diﬀerent types of capital goods and t indexes

time.4 This is equivalent to choosing a sequence of capital stocks Kt = (K1t , . . . , KNt ),

given Kt−1 , to maximize Vt , the cum-dividend value of the ﬁrm, deﬁned as:

                                               ∞
                                                                        
                                                
                                 Vt = E t           βts Π(Ks , Is , s )   ,                          (1)
                                            s=t



where Et is the expectations operator conditional on the set of information available

at the beginning of period t; βts discounts net revenue in period s back to time t; Π

is the revenue function net of factor payments, which includes the productivity shock

s as an argument. Π is linear homogeneous in (Ks , Is ) and the capital goods are the

only quasi-ﬁxed factors — or, equivalently, variable factors have been maximized out

of Π. For convenience in presenting the model, I assume that there are no taxes and

the ﬁrm issues no debt and has no current assets, although these considerations are

incorporated in the empirical work.

  4 The ﬁrm index i is suppressed to economize on notation except when it clariﬁes the variables that vary

by ﬁrm.

   The ﬁrm maximizes equation (1) subject to the series of constraints:



                          Kj,t+s = (1 − δj )Kj,t+s−1 + Ij,t+s                  s≥0                           (2)



where δj is the rate of physical depreciation for capital good j.                               In this formula-

tion, investment is subject to adjustment costs but becomes productive immediately.

Furthermore, current proﬁts are assumed to be known, so that both prices and the

productivity shock in period t are known to the ﬁrm when choosing Ijt . Other formu-

lations — such as one where there is a production and/or a decision lag — are possible

but this is a more parsimonious speciﬁcation.

   Let the multipliers associated with the constraints in equation (2) be λj,t+s . Then

the ﬁrst-order conditions for maximizing equation (1) subject to equation (2) are

Hence, the value of the ﬁrm can be expressed as the sum of the installed values of

the beginning-of-period capital stocks, which according to equation (2) are equal to the

diﬀerence between the current capital stock and current investment. Since there are

three types of capital in the empirical work, the speciﬁc equation considered is



             Vt = λK (Kt − It ) + λKIT (KITt − ITt ) + λKIP (KIPt − IPt ) + t                      (5)



where investment in tangible capital (excluding IT), information technology, and intel-

lectual property are I, IT , and IP ; the capital stock (excluding IT) is denoted by K, and

the IT and IP capital stocks are distinguish by appending IT and IP .

   According to equation (3), the multipliers on each capital stock are the gross marginal

cost of an additional unit of capital, which is equal to the price of capital including ad-

justment costs. To be more concrete, posit an adjustment cost function, C, that is

additively separable from the net revenue function:


                                                       ∂C
                                        λjt = pj +         .                                        (6)
                                                       ∂Ij


In this equation, it is possible to distinguish between the purchase price of capital and

marginal adjustment costs, which are additional outlays that are needed to make in-

vestment productive. This separation is attractive because adjustment costs — such

as training workers to use new equipment and integrating new and old equipment

— create intangible capital.5 Moreover, when it comes to empirical research, there’s

a well-developed literature on estimating adjustment costs econometrically, whereas

  5 For example, Hempell (2003) ﬁnds broad evidence that ﬁrms complement IT spending with training

programs for their employees (see also Bresnahan, Brynjolfsson, and Hitt 2002). According to Hempell’s
empirical results, ﬁrms that invest intensively in both training and IT perform signiﬁcantly better than
competitors that do not.



                                                   9
there is no practical way to directly measure the value of intangible capital using avail-

able data. In fact, the estimated marginal adjustment costs are equal to the return on

intangible capital in equilibrium. To see this, note that ﬁrms will invest until the gross

marginal cost of an additional unit of capital in equation (6) is equal to the marginal

product of capital, deﬁned by the Euler equation (4). Therefore, the equilibrium return

on intangible capital can be equated with adjustment costs.

   Let’s return to the Dell-HP example to ﬁx ideas. A quick and dirty way to characterize

the diﬀerence between Dell and HP would be to say that the level of MFP is higher at

Dell. But this isn’t very informative because it wouldn’t explain why Dell produces more

with less. By contrast, the valuation equation (5) shows that it’s possible to trace the

sources of Dell’s superior valuation to its intangible capital, speciﬁcally the intangible

capital associated with its previous investments in IT and IP. New software, say, is

more valuable at Dell because of the way its used. While this type of ﬁnding is more

informative than attributing any and all diﬀerences to MFP, admittedly it still leaves

something to be desired. In particular, this approach fails to explain how software

became more valuable at Dell; estimating (5) doesn’t provide a blueprint for creating

value. To gain further insight on this point considerably better data and detailed case

studies are necessary.

   Interpretation of the estimates of equation (5) is more complicated than it might

seem at ﬁrst glance. Notice that the multipliers are assumed constant. However, the

value of intangible capital could diﬀer over time and across ﬁrms; indeed, the compari-

son of Dell and HP suggests that this is a realistic possibility. Regrettably, the empirical

framework is not rich enough to accommodate this consideration. In practice, the prob-

lem is not as bad as it might seem, since I control for ﬁrm- and time-speciﬁc eﬀects.




                                            10
Nevertheless, to the extent that the multipliers are not constant after controlling for

these eﬀects, the empirical estimates of the multipliers will be averages across ﬁrms

and time.6 Hence, extreme caution must be exercised in interpreting the estimates as

structural parameters; rather, the estimates are revealing about the average return of

intellectual property and organizational capital. Lastly, it should be recognized that

this limitation is not unique to my setup. On the contrary, my setup is closely related

to production or cost function estimation, where it is also assumed that the param-

eters are constant across ﬁrms and time, in spite of the debatable case for such an

assumption.




3    Estimation of the Empirical Valuation Equation

Estimation of the empirical valuation equation (5) would be straightforward if there

were data on the intrinsic value of the ﬁrm and the error term was an innovation.

As I will discuss in turn, each of these conditions is unlikely to hold. As a result,

ordinary least squares estimates will be biased. Identiﬁcation is still possible in certain

circumstances using generalized method of moments. However, the GMM approach

does have some notable drawbacks which I discuss in the ﬁnal subsection.

    Two primary issues must be confronted when it comes to estimating equation (5):


    • The intrinsic value of the ﬁrm is unobservable.

      What I have called the equity market approach explicitly assumes that the stock

      market value of the ﬁrm, V E , equals the intrinsic value of the ﬁrm, V . Alternatively,

   6 Cross-sectional estimation wouldn’t sidestep this problem entirely because the estimates would still

be averages across ﬁrms. Moreover, cross-sectional estimation is inadvisable since there are no controls
for ﬁrm-speciﬁc eﬀects.




                                                  11
      one could argue that any market mismeasurement is orthogonal to the ﬁrms’

      current capital stocks and investments. Since either condition is at least suspect,

      I propose an alternative that arguably rests on ﬁrmer footing.


   • The productivity shock  — think of a new product or process — is unobservable

      to the econometrician and it aﬀects both the value of the ﬁrm and its investment

      policy.

      As a result, OLS estimates will be biased. Alternatively, I use the system-GMM

      estimator proposed by Blundell and Bond (1998, 2000).         They show that the

      system-GMM estimator performs well when there are ﬁxed eﬀects and the en-

      dogenous variables have near unit roots, as is true of all three types of capital.



3.1   Unobservable Value of the Firm

The most widely-used proxy for the intrinsic value of the ﬁrm is its stock market

value. According to one view of the stock market, this makes good sense since share

prices reﬂect the discounted value of expected future distributions from the ﬁrm to

its shareholders. If this is the case, there are two possible explanations for share

price movements: changes in expected future proﬁtability that support future divi-

dend payments, or changes in investors’ required rates of returns. Hence, share prices

of intangible-intensive companies may have been rising until 2000 on advance news

of unprecedented proﬁt growth. Another possibility consistent with this view is that

investors decided that the stock market was much less risky than they previously be-

lieved. For example, Siegel (1999) argues that the safest long-term investment vehicle

has been stocks, not bonds. Accordingly, investors may have realized that they were

irrationally fearful of stocks. In an environment in which stocks are not really all that



                                           12
risky, rational investors will bid up stock prices. In other words, the equity premium

was too high in the past but it’s just right now.7

    Another view of the stock market cautions that share prices may sometimes have

a life of their own, away from the intrinsic level represented by the discounted value

of future distributions. The theoretical possibility that share prices deviate from their

intrinsic value because of a rational bubble has long been recognized.8 Outside of

this particular paradigm, there is an abundance of models in which share prices are

inﬂuenced by noise traders, fads or other psychological factors. While I cannot explain

the disconnect between asset prices and their intrinsic values, simple observation of the

behavior of — to name just two examples in addition to the ones already discussed —

tulip prices in 1634-37 and Japanese share prices in 1989, suggests that such behavior

is diﬃcult to dismiss on empirical grounds. In which case, the recent stock market

boom and at least partial bust may be another example of such anomalies. Indeed,

Shiller (2000) argues that investors have not rationally learned that the stock market is

less risky than they previously thought. Rather, he details a whole host of reasons why

investors have been, and continue to be, irrationally exuberant.

    It is important to highlight the key distinction between these two diﬀerent views of

the stock market. In the ﬁrst, market eﬃciency is treated as a maintained hypothesis.

In the second, market ineﬃciency is treated as a maintained hypothesis. To illustrate

the implications of this, pick a stream of expected proﬁts. The ﬁrst theory tells us what

   7 McGrattan and Prescott (2000) use this argument to conclude that “it is troubling that economic theory

failed so miserably to account for historical asset values and returns while, at the same time, it does so well
in accounting for current observations.” The “current observations” in their study date from the beginning
of 2000, so apparently economic theory needs some work to explain the subsequent downturn (see also
Kiley 2000).
   8 A rational bubble occurs when the expected discounted future price does not converge to zero in the

limit. There are both theoretical and empirical arguments that can be used to rule out rational bubbles
(see, e.g., Campbell, Lo, and MacKinlay 1997, chapter 7). Hence, rational bubbles are unlikely to oﬀer a
persuasive explanation for ﬁnancial market behavior.




                                                     13
the (possibly time-varying) discount rate (i.e., the return) must be in order to justify the

observed stock price. The second theory tells us that there is some reason outside the

basic model — bubbles, noise traders, fads, or the like — why the stock price diﬀers

from its intrinsic value. It’s very diﬃcult to determine which of these explanations is

preferable because they both rely on unobservable factors to explain the very same

data. To have any degree of conﬁdence in either explanation, one must exploit the

testable implications of the dynamic stochastic structure of the unobservable factors.

To do so I set out a model based on joint research with Stephen Bond (2000, 2002).

   Suppose the stock market reveals the intrinsic value of the ﬁrm with some error, so

that



                                     VtE = Vt + µt ,                                     (7)



where µt is the measurement error in the equity valuation VtE , regarded as a measure

of the intrinsic value Vt . Substituting VtE for Vt in equation (5) then gives the empirical

valuation equation when there are noisy share prices:



       VtE = λK (Kt − It ) + λKIT (KITt − ITt ) + λKIP (KIPt − IPt ) + (µt + t ).       (8)



Let’s consider the eﬀect of measurement error in the model’s dependent variable, and

ignore the diﬃculty presented by the unobservable productivity shock which is consid-

ered in the following section. The conventional wisdom is that measurement error of

this type biases the standard errors but not the coeﬃcient estimates (see, e.g., Haus-

man 1991). However, this is untrue when the measurement error is correlated with the

explanatory variables.



                                             14
   To illustrate the argument, consider a simpliﬁed version of equation (8) in which the

ﬁrm has only IT capital. The coeﬃcient estimate on IT capital, call it bKIT , will consist

of the true return on IT, βKIT , and the bias caused by measurement error:



                            p lim bKIT = βKIT + βµ,KIT ,



where βµ,KIT is the coeﬃcient estimate from a hypothetical regression of the measure-

ment error on IT capital: βµ,KIT = COV(µ, KIT )/VAR(KIT ). Clearly, there’s no bias if

COV(µ, KIT ) = 0; the measurement error is uncorrelated with the regressor and the

conventional wisdom about measurement error in the dependent variable is correct.

However, if the stock market overestimates the value of IT-intensive companies, then

βµ,KIT > 0 and, therefore, the return to IT investment will be upward biased. Since

my sample is skewed toward the kind of companies commonly thought the have been

overvalued compared to fundamentals — companies in the 1990s with big IT budgets

— it seems reasonable to suspect that this upward bias could be substantial. However,

if the stock market were to underestimate the value of IT-intensive companies, the bias

would go in the other direction. Indeed, this type of downward bias would imply that

the true return to investment exceeded the estimated return during periods like the

1970s when the stock market was arguably undervalued compared to fundamentals.

Although it is not possible to sign the bias based on a priori reasoning in the multivari-

ate case, the estimated returns to IP and tangible capital are also likely to be biased.

However, the IT and IP coeﬃcients seem likely to be severely aﬀected because the stock

market appears to have overestimated the value of intangible-intensive companies in

the 1990s.




                                           15
     As an alternative to using the stock market to infer the value of intangibles, I rely on

analysts’ proﬁt forecasts. Intangible assets create value only to the extent that they are

expected to generate proﬁts in the future. Professional analysts are paid to forecast the

future proﬁts of the ﬁrms they track — and leading analysts are paid very well indeed

for performing this role. Thus it is possible to ask whether analysts are forecasting

proﬁt growth in line with the intangible asset growth that seems to be implied by stock

market valuations. Though the popular press regularly lambastes analysts for being

far too optimistic, the answer is ‘no’.9 After introducing the data in the next section, I

show that analysts’ forecasts of future proﬁts are informative.

     Combining these forecasts with a simple assumption about the discount rates βtt+s , I

construct an alternative estimate of the present value of current and future net revenues

as


                                                                        
                            Vt = Et Πt + βtt+1 Πt+1 + . . . + βtt+s Πt+s .                               (9)



I then use this estimate in place of the ﬁrm’s stock market valuation. Clearly the esti-

mate Vt will also measure the ﬁrm’s intrinsic value, Vt , with some error ν. The potential

sources of measurement error include truncating the series after a ﬁnite number of fu-

ture periods, using an incorrect discount rate, and the fact that analysts forecast net

proﬁts rather than net revenues. The resulting empirical valuation equation is:



         Vt = λK (Kt − It ) + λKIT (KITt − ITt ) + λKIP (KIPt − IPt ) + (νt + t ).                     (10)


   9 Armed with a time-varying, ﬁrm-speciﬁc discount rate, one can equate any stream of proﬁt forecasts to

the observed stock price at every observation; without additional restrictions there are, in fact, an inﬁnite
number of paths of time-varying discount rates that can equate the two. The key point is that extreme
assumptions would be required to obtain the V E ’s in the sample from the analysts’ forecasts of future
proﬁts. Share prices in my sample appear to be high not only in relation to current proﬁts, but also in
relation to the best available forecasts of likely future proﬁts.



                                                    16
As discussed in the following section, identiﬁcation will depend on whether the mea-

surement error ν is uncorrelated with suitably lagged values of instruments, for ex-

ample, capital stocks. This seems plausible since the current measurement error from

using analysts’ forecasts is unlikely to be correlated with lags of the capital stock. Ul-

timately, however, this is an empirical question that will be investigated using tests of

overidentifying restrictions.



3.2   Unobservable Productivity Shock

Despite some important diﬀerences, the empirical valuation equations (8) and (10) re-

semble a production function. This similarity is unfortunate because, as Griliches and

Mairesse (1999) say, “In empirical practice, the application of panel methods to micro-

data have produced rather unsatisfactory results.” Mairesse and Hall (1996) show

that attempts to control for unobserved heterogeneity and simultaneity — both likely

sources of bias in the OLS results — have produced implausible estimates of production

function parameters. To be more speciﬁc, in my setup I assume that the unobservable

productivity shock consists of a ﬁrm-speciﬁc, a time-speciﬁc, and an idiosyncratic com-

ponent. In this case, the application of GMM estimators, which take ﬁrst diﬀerences to

eliminate unobservable ﬁrm-speciﬁc eﬀects and use lagged instruments to correct for

simultaneity in the ﬁrst-diﬀerenced equations, has produced especially unsatisfactory

results.

   Blundell and Bond (1998, 2000) show that these problems are related to the weak

correlation between the regressors and the lagged levels of the instruments. This re-

sults in weak instruments in the context of the ﬁrst-diﬀerenced GMM estimator. Bond

and Blundell show that these biases can be dramatically reduced by incorporating more




                                           17
informative moment conditions that are valid under quite reasonable conditions. Es-

sentially, their approach is to use lagged ﬁrst-diﬀerences as instruments for equations

in levels, in addition to the usual lagged levels as instruments for equations in ﬁrst-

diﬀerences. The result is the so-called system-GMM estimator, which I use as the

preferred estimator. This is implemented using DPD98 for GAUSS (Arellano and Bond

1998).10

   There are two types of diagnostic tests for the empirical models. First, I report the

p-value of the test proposed by Arellano and Bond (1991) to detect ﬁrst- and second-

order serial correlation in the residuals. The statistics, which have a standard normal

distribution under the null, test for nonzero elements on the second oﬀ-diagonal of the

estimated serial covariance matrix. Second, I report the p-value of the Sargan statistic

(also know as Hansen’s J-statistic), which is a test of the model’s overidentifying re-

strictions; formally, it is a test of the joint null hypothesis that the model is correctly

speciﬁed and that the instruments are valid.



3.3   Limitations of the Empirical Approach

If the GMM-based empirical approach were successfully implemented, then that would

be the end of the story in most applications. However, intangible assets pose a special

problem. According to my model, intangibles are associated with speciﬁc investments

but clearly that’s not the whole story; sometimes intangibles are not associated with

any identiﬁable outlay. In that case, at least some of the intangibles end up in the error

term as an omitted variable or as part of the unobservable productivity shock.

 10 In all speciﬁcations, time eﬀects are captured by including year dummies in the estimated

speciﬁcations.




                                             18
   To ﬁx ideas, suppose the ﬁxed eﬀect in the unobservable productivity shock repre-

sents intangible capital. If the ﬁxed eﬀect embeds intangible capital in this way, the

econometric cure may be worse than the disease. In particular, ﬁrst-diﬀerencing would

sweep out the eﬀect of ﬁxed intangible capital. As a result, the possibility that in-

tangible capital determines the level of the ﬁrm’s intrinsic value would be completely

missed.

   To take another interesting example, MFP is normally thought of as a black box

but perhaps this box is full of what researchers mean by intangibles. Indeed, many of

the examples used to illustrate the role that intangibles play in organizations have the

ﬂavor of MFP. That is, intangible capital comes from a good idea like selling computers

over the Internet in Dell’s case; or, a unique corporate culture created by CEOs like Jack

Welch or Bill Gates. Be that as it may, most intangible assets appear to be created by

investment, as argued in the introduction. After all, Dell cannot sell computers over

the Internet without its own computers, and Microsoft spends more than $5 billion

annually on R&D and advertising.

   In summary, by pursuing an estimation strategy like GMM with instruments that are

arguably orthogonal to the error term, one might recover something closer to the direct

impact of any asset on market value. However, one will by construction miss the role

of omitted intangibles or intangibles that underlie the productivity shock. Thus, such

IV strategies can be informative, but they cannot provide the full set of answers about

the role of intangibles.

   In fact, Brynjolfsson, Hitt, and Yang (2000, 2002) have taken this argument one step

further: They say that the eﬀect of intangible capital can be indirectly inferred from




                                           19
OLS estimates of the return to IT capital. Two points are worth making about this

argument, the ﬁrst methodological and the second empirical.

   First, OLS cannot be used to separate out all the direct and indirect eﬀects of in-

tangible capital. In particular, the return to, or the stock of, intangible capital cannot

be inferred from the biased OLS coeﬃcient on IT capital. When intangible capital is

an omitted variable and IT capital is the only other type of capital, a straightforward

analysis of omitted variable bias reveals that the coeﬃcient on IT capital is



                         p lim bKIT = βKIT + βKIC βKIC,KIT ,



where βKIC is the return to intangible capital and βKIC,KIT is the coeﬃcient estimate

from a hypothetical regression of the omitted intangible KIC on IT capital: βKIC,KIT =

COV(KIC, KIT )/VAR(KIT ). For example, if $1 of IT capital is associated with more

than $1 of omitted intangible capital, βKIC,KIT > 1.

   Using ﬁrm-level data, Brynjolfsson et al. estimate bKIT using OLS and ﬁnd that each

dollar of IT capital is associated with about ten dollars of market value. They interpret

this ﬁnding as revealing the existence of a “large stock of intangible assets that are com-

plementary with IT spending (emphasis added).” However, that conclusion depends on

assumptions about little understood relationships. Speciﬁcally, to say anything about

the value of intangible capital, one has to know the return to IT capital. And to say any-

thing about the return to intangibles or the size of the stock of intangibles, the value

of intangible capital must be broken into its constituent components. Brynjolfsson et

al. solve these problems by assuming that there are no adjustment costs, in which case

the returns to IT and intangible capital are equal to unity (βKIT = βKIC = 1), and the

stock of intangible capital associated with IT capital can be backed out. According to



                                            20
this argument, the stock market doesn’t literally value $1 of IT capital at $10. Rather,

the estimate is a “marker” for the existence of a large stock of IT-related intangibles.

    The second concern is empirical: the results in Brynjolfsson et al. (2000) contradict

their interpretation of the estimate on IT capital. When the authors added a variable that

measures organizational intangibles, ORG, to the regressions, βKIT is almost totally

unaﬀected.11 If the additional variable better measures intangibles, as the authors

argue persuasively, then bKIT should have fallen signiﬁcantly because it’s a “marker”

for intangibles. Since the estimate was about unchanged, bKIT must be biased for

another reason, like the stock market mismeasurement or simultaneity bias that I’ve

highlighted. If that is the case, it is advisable to adopt an empirical technique that

corrects for the bias.




4     Data

4.1    Sources and deﬁnitions

The limiting factor in terms of the data is the availability of information about IT out-

lays. For IT expenditures I use a data set compiled by Lev and Radhakrishnan (this

volume) from Information Week, which is in turn based on surveys by the Gartner Group.

The total sample is an unbalanced panel of ﬁrms that appeared in the Information Week

500 list between 1991 and 1997 and for which Compustat and IBES data are available.

    The variables used in the empirical analysis are deﬁned as follows:

 11 In their subsequent paper, Brynjolfsson et al. (2002) did not include the telling regression from their

ﬁrst paper. Instead, they interacted ORG with employment. Although the interpretation of the eﬀect of
ORG is complicated this interaction, the take away point remained the same: the estimate on IT capital
did not change signiﬁcantly when ORG interacted with employment was included in the regression.




                                                   21
    • V E is the sum of the market value of common equity (deﬁned as the number of

      common shares outstanding multiplied by the end-of-ﬁscal-year common stock

      price) and the market value of preferred stock (deﬁned as the ﬁrm’s preferred div-

      idend payout divided by S&P’s preferred dividend yield obtained from Citibase).


    • V is the present value of analysts’ proﬁt forecasts. Let Πit and Πi,t+1 denote

      ﬁrm i’s expected proﬁts in periods t and t + 1 formed using beginning-of-period

      information. Let git denote ﬁrm i’s expected growth rate of proﬁts in the following

      periods formed using beginning-of-period information. Notice, the stock market

      valuation of the ﬁrm, V E , is dated at time t − 1 so the market information set

      contains these forecasts. Then I calculate the implied level of proﬁts for periods

      after t + 1 by growing out the average of Πit and Πi,t+1 at the rate git . Let this

      average be Π̄it .12

      The resulting discounted sequence of proﬁts deﬁnes Vit :



                    Vit =    Πit + βt Πi,t+1 + β2t (1 + git )Π̄it + β3t (1 + git )2 Π̄it

                                                           (1 + git )3 Π̄it
                             +β4t (1 + git )3 Π̄it + β5t
                                                               r̄ − ḡ


      The constant discount factor reﬂects a static expectation of the nominal interest

      rate over this ﬁve year horizon; that is I use the Treasury bill interest rate in year

  12 In principle, the horizon for calculating V should be inﬁnity. However, the analysts estimate g over a

horizon of ﬁve years. Thus, in order to match the horizon for which there is information, I set the forecast
horizon to ﬁve years. A terminal value correction accounts for the ﬁrm’s value beyond year ﬁve. The
correction assumes that the growth rate for proﬁts beyond this ﬁve-year horizon is equal to that for the
economy. Speciﬁcally, the last year of expected earnings is turned into a growth perpetuity by dividing it
by (r̄ − ḡ); where I assume that r̄ is the mean nominal interest rate for the sample period as a whole (about
15%, which includes a constant 8 % risk premium) and ḡ is the mean nominal growth rate of the economy
for the sample period as a whole (about 6%).

      t (plus a ﬁxed 8% risk premium as suggested by Brealey and Myers (2000) among

      others).


   • Dt is the book value of debt which is the sum of short- and long-term obligations.


   • Ct is net current assets, essentially cash-on-hand.


   • I and K are capital expenditures and the current-cost net stock of property, plant,

      and equipment (both excluding IT). The current-cost stock is constructed with the

      perpetual inventory method using an industry-level rate of economic depreciation

      constructed from Hulten and Wykoﬀ (1981).


   • IT and KIT are IT expenditures and the current-cost net stock of IT. IT outlays

      are from the Information Week survey. The current-cost stock is constructed with

      the perpetual inventory method using a depreciation rate consistent with annual

      economic depreciation of 40%.


   • IP and KIP are IP expenditures and the current-cost net stock of IP. IP expendi-

      tures are the sum of R&D and advertising. The current-cost stock is constructed

      with the perpetual inventory method using a depreciation rate consistent with

      annual economic depreciation of 25%.


   The sample used for estimation includes all ﬁrms with at least four consecutive years

of complete data. Four years of data are required to allow for ﬁrst-diﬀerencing and the

use of lagged variables as instruments. The determination whether the ﬁrm satisﬁes

the four-year requirement is done after deleting several observations that looked like

recording or reporting errors. Also, a few observations were deleted because V < 0.13

   Table 1 describes details about the sample. The ﬁrst two rows deﬁne the diﬀerent

proxies for the intrinsic value of the ﬁrm. The total value of the ﬁrm consists of three

components: the return to equity holders, V E or V , the return to debt holders, D, and

an adjustment for net current assets, C. At both the mean and median values, the

stock-market-based value is about three-quarters greater than the analyst-based value.

Another notable feature of the sample is that spending on IT and IP is a large fraction

of total investment spending at the mean and median values.



4.2   A Look at Analysts’ Forecasts

To lay the foundation for using the analyst-based proxy for the intrinsic value of the

ﬁrm, I compare the analysts’ forecasts of long-term growth, git , with realizations of

growth over a three-year horizon. As a ﬁrst pass, the analysts expected proﬁts to grow

at an annual rate of 11.3% for the mean ﬁrm in my sample. Over a three-year horizon,

proﬁts actually grew at just a touch slower rate of 11%.

   Figure 1 presents a more detailed comparison of actual and expected proﬁt growth

with each dot representing a single ﬁrm-year observation. Three features of the data

are apparent. First, analysts don’t forecast negative long-term growth. That’s sensible,

since such forecasts would be equivalent to saying that the company is essentially

worthless. Second, analysts are loath to forecast very high long-term growth rates.

That’s sensible too. Very few companies generate proﬁt growth in excess of 30%, and

it’s hard to identify ex ante those that may. Finally, actual proﬁt growth is highly

variable. Some companies do grow at very fast rates or suﬀer large retrenchments.

   The OLS regression line describes the average relationship between the two vari-

ables. Actual and expected earnings growth are positively related — the slope of the




                                          24
regression line is 0.74 with a standard error of 0.15 — but realized earnings growth

often diﬀers widely from analysts’ expectations.14 Moreover, the forecasts tend to be

overly optimistic on average. In addition, analysts do not issue particularly accurate

long-range forecasts; evidently, a lot can happen to a company over a three year period,

most of which cannot be anticipated. However, the key requirement for my purpose

is not forecast accuracy, but rather the ability of analysts’ forecasts to capture the

expected future returns on which the ﬁrm’s investment decisions are based. Judged

according to this metric, analysts’ forecasts appear to be reasonable and informative

assessments about companies’ future prospects.




5    Empirical Results

The empirical results are laid out in two stages. In Table 2, I present OLS estimates of the

empirical valuation equations in levels and within groups. After establishing that these

results are consistent with the sort of bias I’ve described, I present in Table 3 the results

from two GMM estimators. First, I present a standard estimator that ﬁrst-diﬀerences

the empirical equations and uses lagged capital stocks as instrumental variables. For

reasons described in section 3.2, the coeﬃcient estimates are likely to be downward-

biased in this case. Second, I present results from the system-GMM estimator. The

diagnostic statistics indicate that system-GMM is well-behaved when using the analyst-

based measure of intrinsic value and the results themselves are quite sensible.

 14 A few extreme observations have been left out of the ﬁgure in order to maintain a 1:1 aspect ratio.

These observations are, however, included in ﬁtting the regression.

5.1    OLS results

In the speciﬁcation in the ﬁrst column of Table 2, the coeﬃcient on IT capital substan-

tially and signiﬁcantly exceeds unity as does the coeﬃcient on IP capital. Meanwhile,

the estimate of the return to tangible capital is signiﬁcantly less than unity.15 According

to this ﬁrst pass at the data, $1 of IT capital is associated with about $2 of unmeasured

intangibles and $1 of IP capital is associated with about $1 of unmeasured intangibles.

Thus my basic results parallel those reported by Brynjolfsson et al. despite the fact

that I don’t use the same ﬁrms or estimation period; I use diﬀerent techniques for

constructing the capital stocks; and I use diﬀerent regressors.16

    The basic pattern of estimates in column 1 is similar to the pattern in column 2,

where V replaces V E . In particular, using an analyst-based or a market-based deﬁnition

of intrinsic value doesn’t make much of a diﬀerence when estimating in levels using

OLS. However, the estimates on IT capital are considerably smaller in columns 3 and

4, where net current assets are accounted for in valuing the ﬁrm. Apparently, large IT

capital stocks are associated with relatively abundant net current assets — an example

is Microsoft, which has a large stock of IT and has built up a huge cash cushion on

its balance sheet. When this relationship is ignored, the coeﬃcient on IT capital picks

up both the eﬀect of intangibles and the omitted eﬀect of net current assets. Thus, to

develop an accurate picture about the role of IT capital, the value of the ﬁrm has to be

deﬁned carefully.

  15 Recall from the theoretical model that the beginning of period capital stocks belong on the right hand

side of the empirical valuation equation. According to equation (2) the beginning-of-period capital stocks
are equal to the diﬀerence between the current capital stock and current investment. Hence, the relevant
regressors are (Kt − It ) and so on.
  16 It was not possible to investigate the eﬀects of these diﬀerences because Brynjolfsson et al. declined

to share their data.




                                                   26
    The results presented so far do not control for unobserved heterogeneity. As a re-

sult, the estimates are diﬃcult to interpret because the ﬁrm-speciﬁc eﬀect is surely

correlated with contemporaneous capital investments. To sweep out the ﬁrm-speciﬁc

eﬀect, the within-groups estimates presented in columns 5 and 6 express all of the

variables as deviations from within-ﬁrm means. In this case, the coeﬃcients on IT are

signiﬁcantly negative in both speciﬁcations, and the coeﬃcients on the other types of

capital appear downward biased in the ﬁnal column. These ﬁndings are not unexpected

because the capital stocks are highly persistent. While unit root tests are useless for

short panels, the (unreported) AR(1) coeﬃcient estimates from regressions of the cur-

rent capital stocks on their ﬁrst lags are all greater than 0.92. In such situations, the

received wisdom from the literature on production function estimation indicates that

one should expect downward bias from within-groups estimates.17



5.2    GMM results

The GMM estimates are motivated by the observation that the within-groups results

do nothing to control for simultaneity bias. Such bias must be important because the

value of the ﬁrm (no matter how it is measured) and its investment policy are jointly

determined. To see the intuition behind this point, compare the empirical valuation

equation to an empirical investment equation based on Tobin’s Q. In the current setup,

the ﬁrm’s intrinsic value is a function of the capital stock and investment, whereas the

reverse is true in an equation that relates the investment rate to Tobin’s Q. Put simply,

increases in market value may cause investment in IT (and other types of capital), not

  17 In fact, it is not unusual for production function estimates of the capital share to go from 0.3 in levels

to negative values for within-groups. The magnitude of the bias in Table 2 may seem surprisingly large by
comparison, but keep in mind that production functions are estimated in logs.




                                                     27
the reverse. To deal with simultaneity bias (and eliminate the ﬁrm-speciﬁc eﬀect at the

same time), the ﬁrst-diﬀerenced empirical valuation equations are estimated with GMM,

using lagged levels of the capital stocks as instruments. These results are reported in

columns 1 and 2 of Table 3.

   Taking a look ﬁrst at the Sargan test, the p-values in columns 1 and 2 do not indicate

a decisive rejection of the model’s overidentifying restrictions. That doesn’t mean,

however, that the instruments are informative. Indeed, in unreported results, I conﬁrm

that weak instruments cannot be rejected using the partial R 2 or ﬁrst-stage F -statistic

as criteria. If the instruments used in the ﬁrst-diﬀerenced equations are weak, then the

results should be biased in the direction of within-groups.18 Indeed, a comparison of

columns 1 and 2 of Table 3 to columns 5 and 6 of Table 2 shows that the direction and

magnitude of the bias are similar in the ﬁrst-diﬀerenced and within-groups estimates.

   To address concerns about weak instruments, I use the system-GMM estimator in

columns 3 and 4. Again, begin by looking at the Sargan test, which indicates that the

model using V E is decisively rejected while the one using V is not. This suggests that the

instruments are correlated with the market’s mismeasurement of companies’ intrinsic

values but not with the analysts’ mismeasurement of the same. Why might that be? As

I have argued, intangibles are diﬃcult to value. If, say, the lagged change in the stock

of intangibles is correlated with the extent to which the market overstates the ﬁrm’s

intrinsic value, then the system-GMM estimator will tend to be rejected. By contrast,

for reasons I’ve detailed, there’s less reason to worry that analysts’ forecast errors are

correlated with the lagged change in the stock of intangibles, and this conjecture is

 18 The technical explanation for this statement depends on two things. First, weak instruments will bias

2SLS in the direction of OLS. Second, the ﬁrst-diﬀerenced GMM estimator coincides with a 2SLS estimator
when the ﬁxed eﬀects are removed with the orthogonal deviations transformation; and, OLS transformed to
orthogonal deviations coincides with within groups. Therefore, weak instruments will bias this particular
2SLS estimator (which coincides with ﬁrst-diﬀerenced GMM) in the direction of within groups.



                                                  28
born out by the Sargan test. Therefore, my preferred estimates use the analyst-based

measure of the ﬁrm’s intrinsic value.

    In column 4, the coeﬃcient estimates on tangible and IP capital are insigniﬁcantly

diﬀerent from unity (although they are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from zero), and the coeﬃ-

cient on IT capital is signiﬁcantly greater than unity. Taken at face value, the coeﬃcient

on IT capital implies that organizational capital earns a 70% annual rate of return, a

ﬁgure that might seem excessive. However, two points are worth nothing. First, the

evidence of excess returns is statistically weak because the 95% conﬁdence interval en-

compasses returns as low as 7%. Second, in my model the return to IT capital includes

the eﬀect of adjustment costs; indeed, that is how organizational capital is deﬁned

in equation (6). This possibility is seldom noted because researchers usually estimate

the return to IT using a static production function, which assumes that capital is in a

steady-state equilibrium so that adjustment costs are zero by construction.19

    The coeﬃcient on IP capital is less than unity, a result consistent with earlier ﬁnd-

ings that R&D earns a somewhat less than normal rate of return (see, e.g., Hall 1993b).

Perhaps ﬁrms cannot reap the full beneﬁt of their IP investments owing to the nonex-

clusive nature of some types of R&D (see, e.g., Griliches 1979; Jaﬀe 1986; Bernstein

and Nadiri 1989). However, caution is warranted in drawing such a conclusion because

the 95% conﬁdence interval encompasses returns as large as 20%, more in line with the

recent ﬁndings in Hand (2002). Finally, the estimate on tangible capital (excluding IT) is

slightly less than unity. This is consistent with lower rates of return on these types of

  19 To elaborate on the implications of my approach in the context of a production function, notice that

the marginal product of capital in my model is equal to the traditional user cost plus adjustment costs. For
example, abstracting from taxes and setting the price of capital equal to unity, the equilibrium condition
                  ∂Π                   ∂C
in my model is ∂KIT   = r + δKIT + ∂KIT   . So long as adjustment costs are positive, the estimated return
to capital can exceed (r + δKIT ), the usual equilibrium required rate of return in the production function
framework.

capital and with recent studies in which estimated adjustment costs are quite modest

in size (see, e.g., Bond and Cummins 2002).




6    Conclusion

The dramatic rise of the stock market in the 1990s led some observers to conclude that

intangible capital was an increasingly important contributor to the bottom line at many

companies. However, the abrupt and sustained decline in the stock market that began

in 2000 seemed to suggest just the opposite. This reversal highlights the desirability

of alternative measurement strategies that would distinguish between the gyrations of

the stock market and the value created by intangibles.

    My empirical approach oﬀers such an alternative strategy, with both a diﬀerent

perspective about what intangibles are and how researchers can estimate their return.

In my model, intangible capital is not a distinct input to production like physical capital

or labor; indeed, I assume that intangibles cannot be purchased in a market like a

computer or a college graduate. Nor are intangibles some kind of relabeled MFP. Rather

intangible capital is the glue that creates value from the usual factor inputs. This

perspective naturally leads to an empirical model in which intangible capital is deﬁned

in terms of adjustment costs. As such, intangibles are the diﬀerence between the value

of installed and uninstalled inputs.

    In my empirical approach, I use two proxies for the intrinsic value of the ﬁrm, one

based on the ﬁrm’s stock market value and the other based on analysts’ proﬁt forecast.

In addition, I use a GMM estimation technique to control for unobserved heterogene-

ity and simultaneity bias in speciﬁcations with nearly-integrated regressors. Using

the analyst-based proxy and the GMM technique, there is no evidence of economically


                                            30
important intangibles associated with investment in intellectual property or physical

capital apart from IT. However, my estimates suggest that organizational capital cre-

ated by information technology generates a 70% annual rate of return.

   These ﬁndings come with a caveat attached. Controlling for simultaneity bias and

unobserved heterogeneity removes intangibles that may have been swept into the er-

ror term, either as omitted variables or as part of the unobservable productivity shock.

Nevertheless, alternative empirical approaches are unpalatable to say the least. Indeed,

my OLS estimates would seem to imply a strong role for intangibles but they are un-

reliable because the value of the ﬁrm and its investment policy are jointly determined.

In the end, how best to characterize the heterogeneity across ﬁrms and the role that

intangibles play remains an open question. Are intangibles a part of the unobservable

productivity shock? Are intangibles some ﬁxed (or quasi-ﬁxed) factor that interact in

complex ways with other inputs? The answers to these questions remain unresolved.

   Finally, it’s worth reﬂecting on whether my approach suggests ways to incorporate

intangible capital in national income accounting. At a very basic level, the implications

are not encouraging. Factor inputs in the national accounts have prices, albeit ones

that are often diﬃcult to measure accurately. By contrast, my approach starts with the

assumption that intangibles are nearly impossible to value on a standalone basis. In

particular, intangibles have unobservable shadow prices that depend on expectations.

This setup makes the return to intangibles impossible to measure directly and uncertain

by construction. These two features make intangible capital particularly ill-suited to

national income accounting. Nevertheless, my approach does suggest a road map for

improving the national accounts. A key ingredient for better understanding the scope

of intangibles is detailed data on the types of outlays that are closely connected with




                                           31
intangibles. In this regard, the national accounts could be considerably improved. I

focused on IT, R&D, and advertising but it would be desirable to have data on other

types of outlays as well, such as education, on-the-job training programs and the like.

In the ﬁrst-diﬀerences estimator, the instrumental variables are the levels of the period
t − 3 and t − 4 capital stocks.        In the system estimator, the valuation equation in ﬁrst-
diﬀerences is estimated jointly with the valuation equation in levels.            The instrumental
variables for the ﬁrst-diﬀerenced equation are the levels of the period t − 3 and t − 4 capital
stocks. The instrumental variables for levels equation are the ﬁrst-diﬀerences of the period
t − 2 capital stocks. Year dummy variables are also included as instruments in all speciﬁcations.


The tests for serial correlation in the residuals is asymptotically distributed as N(0,1) under the
null of no serial correlation. The test of the overidentifying restrictions, called a Sargan test, is
                               2
asymptotically distributed as χ(n−p) , where n is the number of instruments and p is the number
of parameters.
