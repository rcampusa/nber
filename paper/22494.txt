Level versus Variability Trade-offs in Wind and Solar Generation Investments: The Case

                                          ABSTRACT

Hourly plant-level wind and solar generation output and real-time price data for one year from the
California ISO control area is used to estimate the vector of means and the contemporaneous
covariance matrix of hourly output and revenues across all wind and solar locations in the state.
Annual hourly output and annual hourly revenues mean/standard deviation efficient frontiers for
wind and solar resource locations are computed from this information. For both efficient
frontiers, economically meaningful differences between portfolios on the efficient frontier and the
actual wind and solar generation capacity mix are found. The relative difference is significantly
larger for aggregate hourly output relative to aggregate hourly revenues, consistent with expected
profit-maximizing unilateral entry decisions by renewable resource owners. Most of the hourly
output and hourly revenue risk-reducing benefits from the optimal choice of locational generation
capacities is captured by a small number of wind resource locations, with the addition of a small
number of solar resource locations only slightly increasing the set of feasible portfolio mean and
standard deviation combinations. Measures of non-diversifiable wind and solar energy and
revenue risk are computed using the actual market portfolio and the risk-adjusted expected hourly
output or hourly revenue maximizing portfolios.

1. Introduction

       This paper quantifies the total renewable energy output and revenue consequences of

different combinations of wind and solar generation investments in California using hourly output

and real-time market revenue data for all wind and solar generation units in the California

Independent System Operator (ISO) control area from April 1, 2011 to March 31, 2012. This data

is used to construct an economic model that provides an estimate of the average annual mean and

covariance matrix of the hourly energy production and the hourly real-time revenues for all

existing wind and solar locations in California for any amount of renewable generation capacity at

each existing renewable location.

       The economic model is used to compute the shares of statewide wind and solar capacity at

existing wind and solar locations in California that yield the highest annual average hourly output

for a given value of the annual variability of hourly output, or equivalently the lowest annual

variability in hourly output for a given value of the average hourly output. These pairs        of

annual average hourly output and annual variability in hourly output define the mean output and

standard deviation of output efficient frontier for wind and solar investments at existing wind and

solar locations in California. Points on this efficient frontier are compared to the actual average

hourly output and annual variability in hourly output from actual wind and solar generation units.

       This same exercise is repeated for the annual average hourly revenue and annual variability

in hourly revenue for wind and solar generation locations in California. Locational capacity shares

at all existing wind and solar locations in California are computed that yield the highest annual

average hourly revenues for a given value of the annual variability of hourly revenues, or

equivalently the lowest annual variability in hourly revenues for a given value of the average

hourly revenues. These annual average hourly revenues and annual variability in hourly revenues



                                                1
pairs define the mean hourly revenue and standard deviation of hourly revenue efficient frontier

of wind and solar investments at existing wind and solar locations in California. Points on this

efficient frontier are compared to the actual hourly average revenue and annual variability in hourly

revenue from actual wind and solar generation units.

       Although the renewable generation locations are distributed throughout a state with a

geographic area slightly smaller than France and slightly larger than Germany, these two analyses

reveal a high degree of contemporaneous correlation between the hourly output of the 13 solar

locations and 40 wind locations in California that produced energy throughout the 2011-2012 fiscal

year. This result suggests modest opportunities to reduce the variability in the total hourly output

and hourly revenue of wind and solar resource owners by optimizing where and how much solar

and wind generation capacity is placed at each existing location in California. Nevertheless, the

hourly output efficient frontier implies that a 48 percent increase in the annual average hourly

output of solar and wind units is possible without increasing the annual standard deviation of

hourly output only by changing the state-wide capacity shares of the wind and solar investments

at the existing wind and solar locations in California. More modest increases in the average hourly

revenue for solar and wind generation units can be obtained by optimizing the locational capacity

shares of these investments. The hourly revenue efficient frontier implies that by changing the

state-wide capacity shares of the wind and solar investments at the existing wind and solar

locations, a 26 percent increase in the annual average hourly real-time revenue of the solar and

wind generation capacity is possible without increasing the annual standard deviation in hourly

revenues by changing the state-wide capacity shares of the wind and solar investments at the

existing wind and solar locations. This 26 percent increase in the annual average hourly revenue




                                                 2
is found to be statistically significantly smaller than the 48 percentage increase in annual average

hourly output.

        To assess the extent to which the results described above are robust across hours of the

day, separate efficient frontiers are computed for four groups of hours of the day. The largest gains

in expected output or reductions in the standard deviation of output as a result of moving from the

actual capacity shares of wind and solar investments to the efficient frontier appears to be during

the late morning and afternoon hours of the day.

        The capacity shares of wind and solar investments on the annual hourly output and annual

hourly revenue efficient frontiers are similar, however they are both very different from the actual

capacity shares. The capacity shares on both efficient frontiers concentrate the statewide capacity

of wind and solar investments on a substantially smaller number of locations than actual wind and

solar capacity investments.

        Taken together, these empirical results have implications for the design of policies to

stimulate the deployment of renewable generation capacity. As the share of annual energy

production provided by intermittent generation resources in a region increases, the cost of

managing the real-time supply and demand balance increases.1 For the same annual average

hourly output from wind and solar resources, a more variable hourly output from these generation

units implies that more operating reserves are required to maintain grid reliability standards.

Consequently, a substantial amount of the increased hourly renewable energy output variability

associated with scaling wind and solar energy production in California could be mitigated by

  Many jurisdictions have significant renewable energy goals. California has a legislative mandate to achieve a 33%
qualified renewable energy share by 2020 and a 50% share by 2030. Three-fifths of US states have similar mandated
renewables portfolio standards.

                                                        3
constructing additional wind and solar capacity in resource areas that minimize the increase in the

annual standard deviation of hourly output.

       To demonstrate the empirical content of this statement, the elasticity of annual average

hourly output with respect to the annual standard deviation of hourly output for a 1 MW increase

in capacity at that location is computed for each existing wind and solar location in California

starting from the current statewide locational capacity shares for wind and solar generation

capacity. There is substantial heterogeneity in these elasticities across locations. For some

locations the elasticity is as much as ten times larger than the typical California wind and solar

location,, indicating that at these locations a 1 MW increase in wind or solar capacity would have

a significantly larger increase in the annual average wind and solar output for the same increase in

the annual standard deviation in hourly output from these units. There are even some locations

where the elasticity is negative, meaning that a 1 MW increase in wind or solar capacity at that

location would increase the annual average hourly output and reduce the annual standard deviation

of hourly output. Wind and solar investments at locations with the highest values of these

elasticities are likely to minimize the system reliability costs and operating costs associated with

achieving any statewide renewable energy goal.

       The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. The next section provides a discussion

of related research. Section 3 presents a model of output and revenue risk diversification for wind

and solar generation investments. Section 4 contains descriptive statistics on the California

electricity market and discusses the data used to construct the efficient frontiers.     Section 5

discusses the computation of the efficient frontiers and the procedure used to compute the

maximum risk-adjusted expected output and the expected revenue points on these curves as well

as location-specific measures of non-diversifiable wind and solar output and revenue risk. Section

of potential policies to minimize the reliability and operating costs associated with meeting any

renewable energy goal. Section 8 concludes.


2. Portfolio-Based Approaches to New Generation Investment Decisions

       A number of papers have formulated electricity generation capacity technology mix

decisions as portfolio choice problems. Bar-Lev and Katz (1976) first applied expected return and

risk (standard deviation return) portfolio theory to the choice of the mix fossil fuel generation

capacity—coal, natural gas, and oil—used to produce electricity. Awerbuch and Berger (2003)

employed mean-variance portfolio theory to derive European Union (EU) generation portfolios

that enhance energy securities objectives.            They quantified the investment return risk

diversification benefits of increasing the amount of renewable generation capacity in the EU.

Roques, Newbery and Nuttal (2008) employ Monte Carlo simulations of natural gas, coal, and

nuclear generation unit investment return distributions to solve a mean-variance portfolio choice

problem for an optimal mix of these generation technologies for firms in a re-structured wholesale

electricity market. Bazilian and Roques (2008) contains a number of papers that extend in a

number of directions the application of expected return and risk portfolio theory to the electricity

supply industry investment decision-making processes.

       Westner and Madlener (2010) apply mean-variance portfolio theory to Monte Carlo

simulations of distributions of the net present value (NPV) of individual combined heat and power

technologies in the four largest Western European countries to study the potential for regional

diversification benefits of investments in these technologies. Westner and Madlener (2011)

consider investments in four combined heat and power technologies in Germany and employ

Monte Carlo simulations of the joint distribution of the NPVs of each technology, and from this


                                                  5
compute the NPV mean-variance efficient frontier for the four technologies. Delarue, De Jongho,

Belmans, and D’haeseleer (2011) apply mean-variance portfolio theory and Monte Carlo

simulations to compute distributions of the cost per MWh by technology to derive the efficient

frontier in cost per MWh and standard deviation-of-cost per MWh space of investments in nuclear,

coal, gas, oil and wind generation units. Bhattacharya and Kojima (2012) assess the impact of

adding renewable generation investments to the existing generation capacity mix on the portfolio-

level return and risk profile for the Japanese electricity sector.

       Several papers have also applied mean/variance portfolio theory across geographic

locations. Yu (2003) considers the question of choosing efficient portfolios of energy and ancillary

services sales by generation owners able to sell in spatially distributed wholesale electricity

markets. Roques, Hiroux, and Saguan (2010) consider the optimal country-level deployment of

wind generation units for France, Denmark, Austria, Germany and Spain, using a sample of

country-level hourly wind output in these five countries. They derive a mean hourly output and

standard deviation of hourly output efficient frontier for wind deployment across these five

countries.

       Madlener (2012) provides an accessible and comprehensive survey of this growing

literature. Garnier and Madlener (2016) expands the set of risks that a potential investor faces by

incorporating regulatory regime risk into a portfolio choice model for an investor in a virtual power

plant composed of a mix of distributed renewable energy resources where the investor must

manage both intraday energy balancing cost risk and policy regime risk.

       The present paper builds on this previous work by applying the mean-variance portfolio

theory to generation investment decisions in order to understand how substantial intermittent

renewable energy goals can be met with minimal reliability consequences. To this end, using



                                                   6
actual hourly output data, I characterize the trade-offs between aggregate renewable energy output

and intermittency risk for any portfolio of wind and solar resource locations in California. I then

quantify the magnitude of the deviations of the actual mix of renewable generation capacity from

the mix capacity on the hourly output and hourly standard deviation efficient frontier. I also

explore the extent to which the location decisions of existing renewable generation capacity in

California are consistent with maximizing the unit owner’s expected profits. I accomplish this by

comparing the actual portfolio of renewable generation investments to the portfolios on the

expected revenue and standard deviation of renewable generation revenues efficient frontier.

Finally, I compute location-specific measures of output and revenue risk and find that only a few

actual renewable locations are necessary to achieve a frontier of the highest expected hourly

capacity factor or highly hourly revenue per MW of capacity for a given value of these two

location-specific risk measures.

3. Model of Renewable Output and Revenue Risk Diversification

       The level versus variability tradeoffs in the system-wide hourly output and hourly total

revenues for wind and solar resource locations studied in this paper can be conveyed through a

simple example with N intermittent renewable resource areas. The contemporaneous correlation

between the hourly output at each intermittent energy location and the impact of the level of hourly

output on real-time prices at each intermittent renewable energy location determines the output

and revenue volatility reductions that are possible from different intermittent renewable energy

investment policies.

       Suppose that during a typical hour of the day at each of these N locations 1 megawatt-hour

(MWh) of intermittent renewable energy is available to be harvested with probability p. If the

availability of 1 MWh energy at one location is distributed independently of the availability of 1



                                                 7
MWh energy at any other location, then the expected number of MWh produced in an hour across

these N locations is pN MWh, in other words the probability of the event times the number of

resource areas. The variance of the hourly output from the N intermittent renewable resources is

equal to Np(1-p). Now consider the opposite extreme in terms of correlation between the hourly

outputs of the N locations. Suppose that there is perfect positive correlation between the hourly

outputs at these same N locations. The expected hourly output of the facilities is still equal to pN,

but the variance of the aggregate hourly output measure is equal to p(1-p)N2 because of the perfect

positive correlation between the hourly output across the N locations. The hourly variance is N

times larger than it is for the case in which the hourly availability of energy is independently

distributed across locations.

       This example shows that for the same aggregate amount of renewable generation capacity

in a region, the variance in the total hourly output of wind and solar generation facilities can be as

much as N times larger as a result of correlation in the output across the N locations. Conversely,

by accounting for the contemporaneous correlation between the hourly outputs at pairs of the N

renewable energy locations, the variance in the total hourly output of renewable energy units can

be reduced by installing different amounts of capacity at each of the N available locations.

       To understand how this hourly renewable output variability reduction can be realized,

consider the following wind and solar investment portfolio choice problem. Suppose that Qjh is

hourly output in megawatt-hours (MWh) at location j during hour h and Kj is the MW capacity at

location j for j=1,2,…,J. Define fjh = Qjh/Kj as the hourly capacity factor at location j, which is the

ratio of the wind or solar energy actually produced during the hour at location j divided by the

amount energy that could be produced during one hour at location j by fully utilizing the Kj MWs

of capacity for an entire hour. Note that fjh is continuously distributed on the interval [0,1]. Let



                                                  8
KT = ∑            equal the total amount of wind and solar generation capacity in the control area. Let

wjact = Kj/KT equal the actual share of total wind and solar generation capacity at location j.

           The total renewable energy produced during hour h is equal to                           ∑

∑                    . The second equality illustrates that            can be written as the capacity-share-

weighted sum of the hourly capacity factors of the individual wind and solar resource locations

multiplied by the total amount of wind and solar capacity in the control area. This result implies

that the mean and standard deviation of                  depends on the J-dimensional mean and (J x J)

covariance matrix of the vector of hourly location specific capacity factors Fh = (f1h,f2h,…,fJh)’.

Let the expected value of Fh, E(Fh), equal the J-dimensional vector μ and the covariance matrix of

Fh, E[(Fh – μ)(Fh – μ)’], equal the (J x J) symmetric, positive definite matrix, Ω.2 In terms of this

notation, the mean and standard deviation of               can be expressed as:

                            ∑                  and                 ∑      ∑                    /
                                                                                                       .   (1)

where μj is the jth element of μ and ωjk is the (j,k)th element of Ω.              This result shows that the

expected value of            is equal to the expected value of the capacity-share-weighted sum of the

location-specific hourly capacity factors,                    ∑            , multiplied by the total amount of

renewable capacity, KT. The standard deviation of                   is equal to the standard deviation of the

capacity share weighted sum of the location-specific capacity factors multiplied by the total

amount of renewable capacity, KT. These decompositions imply the following two results:

                                                           and                           ,                 (2)

which implies that for a fixed amount of renewable generation capacity, KT, the capacity shares

that yield the highest expected hourly output are those that maximize the expected value of                  ,

    Throughout the paper E(X) denotes the expectation of a random variable X.

                                                          9
and the capacity shares that yield the lowest standard deviation of hourly output are those that

minimize the standard deviation of       .

       To compute the hourly total revenues earned by wind and solar resources, let Pjh equal the

real-time price at location j during hour h. The total revenues earned by a wind or solar resource

at location j is equal to TRj = Pjh*fjh*Kj. The expected revenues earned by renewable resources

at location j is equal to E(TRj) = [E(Pjh)*E(fjh) + Cov(Pjh,fjh)]Kj, where Cov(X,Y) denotes the

covariance between the random variables X and Y. This expression implies that there are several

ways to increase expected renewable energy revenues at a location. A higher expected value of

the hourly capacity factor, E(fjh), and a higher expected price, E(Pjh), both increase the expected

revenues of the renewable resources at location j. Note that a positive covariance between the

hourly real-time price and hourly capacity factor at location j also increases expected revenues at

that location. The variance of total revenues at location j depends on higher-order moments of

the hourly capacity factor and hourly price at location j. Specifically,

    Var(TRj) = {E[(Pjh)2]E[(fjh)2] + Cov[(Pjh)2,(fjh)2] - [E(Pjh)*E(fjh) + Cov(Pjh,fjh)]2}(Kj)2.   (3)

       The total revenues earned by renewable resources during hour h,           can be expressed as

                                             ∑                   .                                 (4)

Let rjh= Pjh*fjh equal the revenue per MW of capacity paid to resources at location j during hour

h. Let Rh = (r1h,r2h,…,rJh)’ be the vector of locational revenues per MW of capacity during hour

h. Let the expected value of Rh, E(Rh), equals the J-dimensional vector λ and the covariance matrix

of Rh, E[(Rh – λ)(Rh – λ)’], equals the (J x J) symmetric, positive definite matrix, Γ. In terms of

this notation, the mean and standard deviation of       can be expressed as:

                                                                                         /
                        ∑                and                 ∑       ∑                         ,   (5)




                                                 10
where λj is the jth element of λ and γjk is the (j,k)th element of Γ. This result shows that the expected

value of       is equal to the expected value of the capacity-share-weighted sum of the location-

specific revenues per MW of capacity,               ∑             , multiplied by the total amount of

renewable capacity, KT in MWs. The standard deviation of                 is equal to the product of the

standard deviation of the capacity-share-weighted sum of the location-specific revenues per MW

of capacity multiplied by the total amount of renewable capacity, KT. These decompositions imply

the following two results:

                                                        and                          ,               (6)

which implies that for a fixed total amount of renewable capacity, KT, the capacity shares that yield

the highest expected hourly revenue are those that maximize the expected value of               and the

capacity shares that yield the lowest standard deviation of hourly revenue are those that minimize

the standard deviation of       .

4. Renewables Output and Revenues in California Electricity Market

        This section describes the data used to estimate the parameters of the mean and covariance

matrices of Fh, the vector of hourly location-specific capacity factors, and Rh, the vector of hourly

location-specific revenues per MW of capacity. To motivate the efficient frontier modeling results

presented in Section 6, this section first presents summary statistics on the California wholesale

electricity market.

4.1.    Descriptive Statistics for California Wholesale Electricity Market

        The sample period is the California ISO fiscal year from April 1, 2011 to March 31, 2012.

There were 40 wind generation locations and 13 utility-scale solar locations in the California ISO

control area, with 3,040 MW of wind capacity and 499 MW of solar capacity, available to operate

throughout this time period. Table 1 lists the amount of generation capacity in the California ISO


                                                   11
control area by technology as of April 1, 2011. The vast majority of generation capacity is natural

gas-fired. There is also a significant amount of hydroelectric capacity and nuclear capacity.

                                         [Insert Table 1 Here]

                                         [Insert Figure 1 Here]

          The left panel of Figure 1 graphs the mean within-day pattern of aggregate demand and the

within-day pattern of the standard deviations of each hour-of-the-day demand level. If QDhd is

the aggregate demand for hour h of day d, then each point along the curve is equal to

  ∑             , which is the mean of the demand during hour-of-the-day h over the D = 365 days

in the sample.     Each point along the hourly standard deviation curve is equal to

                               /
      ∑                            , the standard deviation of Qhd over all days in the sample period.

The left panel of Figure 1 repeats these two graphs for the QWSdh, the total output of wind and

solar generation units during hour h of day d. The graph of SD(QWS)h is only slightly lower than

the graph of         , ranging between 70 and 60 percent of           across all hours of the day. In

contrast, the graph of SD(QD)h is substantially below the graph of        , ranging between 9 percent

and 16 percent of         across all hours of the day. The volatility (as measured by the standard

deviation) of hourly wind and solar production is a much larger fraction of the mean hourly wind

and solar production than the volatility of hourly demand is relative to the mean of hourly demand.

          The California ISO and all other formal wholesale markets in the United States operate a

multi-settlement locational marginal pricing market which sets a potentially different price at each

generation unit or load withdrawal location in the control area for every hour of the day. The price

depends on the configuration transmission network, the location of electricity demand, the location

and level of output of dispatchable generation units, and the level of wind and solar energy



                                                   12
production.3 High levels of close-to-zero marginal cost of wind and solar energy production are

likely to displace the more costly fossil fuel energy production to the extent that the configuration

of the transmission network and the location of demand allow it. Conversely, low levels of wind

and solar energy production are likely to require significantly more production from fossil fuel

generation units to the extent that the transmission network and location of demand allow it. If

either of these outcomes is limited by transmission capacity or other operating constraints, this will

result in different prices at different locations in the transmission network. Generation-rich

locations will have lower locational marginal prices (LMPs) and generation-deficient locations

will have higher LMPs, so that no more than the amount of energy equal to the capacity of each

transmission link will flow between any two locations in the transmission network.

        The other important feature of the California market and all United States electricity

markets in general, is that they have at least one formal forward market prior to real-time in which

participants can purchase and sell firm financial commitments to buy or sell electricity.                    For

example, the California ISO operates a day-ahead market where participants submit offers to sell

and bids to buy electricity in each of the 24 hours of the following day.                The total amount of

energy sold in the day-ahead market by a specific generation unit is typically referred to as the

unit’s day-ahead energy schedule.

        This day-ahead energy schedule is a firm financial commitment that must be settled in the

real-time market, which operates every five minutes in the California ISO control area. For

example, a generation unit owner that sells 100 MWh of energy from a generation unit during the

10 am to 11 am period of the following day must either produce that amount of energy from its

unit to cover this sale or purchase the 100 MWh from the real-time market at the real-time LMP

 Jha and Wolak (2013) provide a description of the key features of the operation of a multi-settlement, locational
marginal pricing wholesale electricity market.

at that location. By similar logic, a load that purchased 70 MWh in the day-ahead market for this

same hour can sell some or all of this energy in the real-time market at the real-time LMP at that

location by consuming less than 70 MWh during that hour. Alternatively, if the load consumes

more than 70 MWh during the 10 am to 11 am hour, then it must purchase the additional energy

from the real-time market at the real-time price for that location.      Similar logic applies to a

generation unit.   If it produces more than the 100 MWh it sold in the day-ahead market, this

additional energy is paid the real-time price at that location.

       The above logic implies that the real-time price at a generation unit’s location is the

relevant price for valuing any deviations from a supplier’s day-ahead schedule. Because wind

and solar resources are intermittent and their actual output can differ significantly from what might

be scheduled in the day-ahead market, they face exposure to the real-time price. The hourly real-

time price is computed as the arithmetic mean of the twelve five-minute real-time prices during

that hour. Because the real-time price is the opportunity cost of energy consumed or produced

within the hour, this is the hourly price used to compute a generation unit owner’s revenue stream

throughout the remainder of this paper.

                                       [Insert Figure 2 Here]

       Suppose that pjhd is the real-time LMP at location j during hour h of day d and qihd is the

actual energy produced by generation units at location j during hour h of day d. For each hour of

the sample, I compute the quantity-weighted average LMP for all J = 630 generation units in the

California ISO control area. For each day d and hour of the day h, this price, pwhd, is equal to

         ∑
                      . I also compute the quantity-weighted average price for all 53 wind and solar
             ∑


generation units in the California ISO control area for each hour in the sample. The left panel of

Figure 2 reports the hourly mean and standard deviation of pwhd for h=1,2,…,24 across all days in

                                                  14
our sample for all generation units. The right panel of Figure 2 repeats these same two plots for

the quantity-weighted average LMP for all wind and solar generation units. Although significantly

less pronounced than was the case for the hourly demand versus the hourly output of all wind and

solar units, the coefficient of variation of the quantity-weighted average price paid to wind and

solar resources is uniformly higher than the coefficient of variation for the quantity-weighted

average price for all generation units. This result is consistent with the greater hour-to-hour

variability in the energy produced from wind and solar resources, which can also result in greater

hour-to-hour variation in the LMPs paid to wind and solar units when transmission and other

relevant operating constraints are binding.

       To provide a measure of the extent of variability in prices across locations within each hour

during our sample period, I construct the following measure of the hourly range of real-time prices

paid to different generation units. Define

                                                     max          min      ,                    (7)

which is the difference between the maximum real-time LMP over all J = 630 generation units

during hour h of day d and the minimum real-time LMP over all J = 630 generation units during

hour h of day d. The upper panel of Figure 3 plots the hourly means of DFhd and the pointwise

upper and lower 95 percent confidence intervals on realizations of DFhd across days of our sample

for each hour of the day.

                                      [Insert Figure 3 Here]

       I also compute a version of DFhd taking the maximum over all of the real-time LMPs paid

to all 53 wind and solar generation units during hour h of day d and the minimum of the real-time

LMPs over these same units during the same hour and day. The lower panel of Figure 3 plots the

hourly means of DFhd and the pointwise upper and lower 95 percent confidence intervals on


                                                15
realizations of DFhd across days of our sample for each hour of the day all wind and solar

generation units.

       Two results emerge from Figure 3. First, the mean of the DFhd for h=1,2,…, 24 across

days is largest for the highest demand hours of the day. This is consistent with the logic described

earlier that high demand hours are more likely to require managing transmission and other

operating constraints by setting different prices at different locations in the transmission network.

The second result is that although the hourly means and length of the 95 percent confidence interval

of DFhd is larger for the all 630 generation units in the California ISO control area, the

corresponding features of the distribution of DFhd for the 53 wind and solar generation units

account for a significant fraction of the total spatial variation in prices within each hour of the day.

                                       [Insert Table 2 Here]

                                       [Insert Table 3 Here]

       Tables 2 and 3 present the location-specific coefficients of variation for the hourly output

and the hourly real-time price for all wind and solar locations in the California ISO control area.

The final column of each table contains the sample correlation between the hourly output at each

location and the hourly real-time price at that location. For each of the wind locations, the hourly

output is negatively correlated with the hourly price, consistent with most of the energy production

from wind units occurring during the low-priced periods of the day.             For each of the solar

locations, hourly output is positively correlated with the hourly price, consistent with most energy

production from solar units occurring during the high-priced periods of the day.

4.2.   Potential for Diversification to Reduce Output and Revenue Variability

       A final descriptive analysis assesses the extent which is possible to construct a portfolio of

wind and solar generation units that significantly reduces the standard deviation of the hourly



                                                  16
capacity factor,        , and the standard deviation of the hourly revenue per MW of capacity,                ,

relative to the values of these variables using the actual capacity shares. If the off-diagonal

elements of the covariance matrices of Fh and Rh are positive and large (relative to the diagonal

elements of these matrices), meaning there is significant positive correlation between elements of

Fh and Rh, then the potential aggregate output or revenue variability reduction from optimizing the

sizes of wind and solar generation units at existing locations in California is limited.

        The spectral decomposition of a covariance matrix yields a useful summary measure of the

degree of contemporaneous correlation between elements of a random vector that can be used to

assess the extent to which diversification can significantly reduce the variability in aggregate

output or revenues. Recall that Fh, the J-dimensional vector of hourly location specific capacity

factors of the wind and solar units in the California ISO control area, is assumed to have mean

vector μ and covariance matrix Ω. This covariance matrix has the spectral decomposition Ω =

QDQꞌ, where D is a diagonal matrix composed of the eigenvalues of Ω, ordered from the largest

to smallest, and Q is an orthonormal matrix composed of the eigenvectors of Ω. Let d11 ≥ d22, …,

≥ dJJ be these eigenvalues sorted from largest to smallest. Note that because Ω is a positive definite

matrix, all of its eigenvalues are positive. The relative magnitude of the J eigenvalues quantifies

the extent to which elements of Fh can be explained by common factors that cause them to be

correlated. Note that if the elements of Fh were uncorrelated and all had the same variance, then

all of the eigenvalues of Ω would be equal.4

        The spectral decomposition theorem of a symmetric matrix can be used to reduce the

matrix Ω into J orthogonal factors, where the sum of the variances of each factor is equal to the

sum of the variances of the elements of Fh. This result is derived as follows. Let qi equal the


4
 The example presented at the beginning of Section 3 of N locations with the same independently distributed
probability of providing 1 MWh of energy during the hour satisfies these conditions.

                                                       17
normalized eigenvalue (which is also the ith column of Qꞌ) associated with the ith eigenvector, dii.

Because the eigenvectors are orthonormal, qi’qi = 1 for all i and qi’qj = 0 for i ≠ j. Using the

definition of an eigenvalue and eigenvector yields the following equation for each i (i=1,2,..,J),

Ωqi = diiqi. Pre-multiplying both sides of the equation by qi’ yields qi’Ωqi = dii, because qi’qi =

1. Note that qi’Ωqi is also equal to the variance of qi’Fh, and because qi’qj = 0, the covariance

between qi’Fh, and qj’Fh is zero for i ≠ j. Thus, the ith orthogonal factor is qi’Fh and the variance

of this factor is dii.

        Because the trace of Ω is equal to the sum of the eigenvalues of Ω and each random variable

zih ≡ qi’Fh has variance equal to dii and is uncorrelated with all other zjh, the sum of the variances

of the elements of Fh, the trace of Ω, is equal to the sum of the variances of the zih for i=1,2,…,J.

Consequently, one measure of the extent of correlation among elements of Fh is to normalize each

eigenvalue by the sum of the eigenvalues of Ω, or the sum of the diagonal elements of Ω. Compute

                                          ∑
                                                      for k=1,2,…,J .                             (8)
                                          ∑
The larger Sk is for a given value of k, the greater is the correlation between the elements of Zh. Sk

is the proportion of the sum of the variances of elements of Fh that is explained by the first k

orthogonal factors, zih ≡ qi’Fh for i=1,2,…,k, each term of which has variance dii.

        Figure 4 plots the values of Sk for k=1,2,..,J, for the solar units separately, the wind units

separately, and the combination of wind and solar units. For a given k, the value of Sk is largest

for all of the solar units. Next largest value of Sk is for the wind units alone. The combination of

wind and solar units has the smallest value of Sk for a given value of k.

        Each plot also contains the values of Sk for the hypothetical case that the hourly capacity

factor at each of the N locations is independently distributed of the hourly capacity factor at all

other locations and each location has the same variance of the hourly capacity factor. For each


                                                 18
generation technology, these values are straight lines using the same line-type as the actual values

of Sk from the origin to the point (N,N), where N is the number of locations with that technology.

For example, for the case of just the solar units, this is the dotted line in Figure 4 from (0,0) to

(13,13).

        The results in Figure 4 demonstrate substantial differences between the case of independent

hourly capacity factors with the same variance at all locations and the actual covariance matrix of

hourly capacity factors across locations for: (1) solar locations, (2) wind locations, and (3) the

combination of wind and solar locations. These results show that a single common factor is

responsible for more than 80% of the hourly variation in the 13 solar generation units and more

than 60% of the hourly variation in the 40 wind units. Even for the case of the 53 wind and solar

units, one factor is responsible for more than 50% of the hourly variation.

                                        [Insert Figure 4 Here]

                                        [Insert Figure 5 Here]

        Figure 5 presents the same calculation for Rh, the vector of unit-specific revenues per MW

of capacity. The graph of the Sk for the hypothetical case of independent elements of Rh with the

same variance is also presented for each of the three sets of generation locations. The actual Sk

function rises at least as fast as it does for the vector of hourly capacity factors. The first factor

accounts for more than 80% of hourly variation in the revenues earned by the 13 solar units. The

first factor accounts for more than 70% of the hourly variation in the revenues earned by the 40

wind units. For the 53 wind and solar units, almost 60 percent of the hourly variation in revenues

is accounted for by the first factor.

        The results of applying the spectral decomposition theorem to the covariance matrices of

Fh and Rh suggests that because of the high degree of contemporaneous correlation between the



                                                  19
elements of each of these vectors, there are likely to be modest reductions in the standard deviation

in the aggregate of output of wind and solar units and more modest reductions in the standard

deviation in the total revenues for wind and solar units from optimizing where these units are

located within the state. Virtually all of the area in Figures 4 and 5 above the Sk lines that assume

uncorrelated elements of Fh and Rh with identical variance is below the actual Sk curve for that

combination of generation locations. Nevertheless, as we demonstrate in the next section, even

with this potential for modest gains (relative to the uncorrelated and same variance for all locations

case) from optimizing the portfolio of wind and solar units, significant increases in the average

hourly output of renewable energy providers are possible without increasing the variability in

hourly output by optimizing the locations and sizes of these generation units.

       The magnitudes of the pairwise spatial correlations in the hourly capacity factors at 53

wind and solar locations in California are significantly larger in absolute value than those

computed by Roques, Hiroux and Saguan (2010) for the country-level hourly wind capacity factors

for Spain, Germany, Austria, Denmark and France. These capacity factors were computed using

2006 and 2007 hourly wind output data for each country normalized by the total amount of

installed capacity in each country. With the exception of Austria and Germany, which have a

pairwise correlation in their hourly wind outputs of 0.362, and France and Germany, which have

a pairwise correlation in their hourly wind outputs of 0.147, none of the eight remaining pairwise

correlations in hourly wind output is above 0.062 in absolute value.

       The results in Figures 4 and 5 suggest that the use of country-wide aggregate hourly wind

output may mask a higher contemporaneous correlation between nearby locations in the adjacent

countries and which implies greater reliability benefits from diversification than is actually

possible.

5. Computation of Efficient Frontier for Wind and Solar Output and Revenues

        This section describes the computation of the mean-standard deviation of output and

revenue efficient frontiers for wind investments, solar investments, and combined wind and solar

investments. Each point along the efficient frontier computes the capacity shares for each existing

wind and solar location that minimize the standard deviation of hourly output or hourly revenues

subject to achieving a given level of expected hourly output or expected hourly revenues. This

section also describes the computation of the maximum output risk-adjusted portfolio and the

maximum revenue risk-adjusted portfolio and two measures of location-specific non-diversifiable

wind and solar risk.

        In terms of the notation from Section 3, each point on the hourly output efficient frontier

is the solution to the following optimization problem in the J-dimensional vector w, for a given

value C,

                               ∑      ∑                    subject to       ∑        ̂ and 1    ∑        (9)
                       , ,…,


where      is the estimate of         and ̂ is the estimate of          based on the sample values of Fh and

J is equal to the number of solar locations, the number of wind locations, or the number of

combined wind and solar locations. If H is the set of hours of data that forms our sample, then

is the (j,k) element of Ω and ̂ is the jth element of ̂ , where

                                   ∑   ∈          ̂             ̂ ′ and ̂             ∑   ∈            (10)

and card(H) is equal to the number of elements in the set H. This problem can be solved using

standard quadratic programming methods. Solving the problem for each value of C from the

minimum element of ̂ to the maximum element of ̂ yields the set of mean and standard deviation

pairs along the efficient frontier.



                                                      21
                          ∗
       Specifically, if            for j=1,2,…,J is the solution to this optimization problem for a given

value of C, then the point on the efficient frontier corresponding this value of C is equal to the

mean-standard deviation pair:

                                       ∗                             ∗            ∗            /
                              (∑             ̂ , ∑       ∑                                         ).         (11)

The actual capacity-weighted hourly mean output and standard deviation of hourly output is

plotted on the same diagram as the mean-standard deviation efficient frontier to illustrate how far

this portfolio is from the efficient frontier. The actual capacity-weighted share point is equal to

the portfolio mean-standard deviation pair:

                                                                                      /
                              (∑           ̂ , ∑        ∑                                 ),                  (12)

where the       (j=1,2,…,J) are the actual installed capacity weighted shares defined in Section 3.

       I compute three efficient frontiers which involve different dimensions for the vector Fh.

The first involves just the solar units, so that J = 13. The second involves just the wind units, so

that J = 40. The third involves both wind and solar units, so that J = 53. In solving for the efficient

frontier with both wind and solar units, the constraint is imposed that the overall capacity share of

solar units must equal the actual capacity share of solar units. Suppose that the first 13 units are

solar units, so this constraint becomes                 ∑                . This implies that the efficient frontier

for the combination of wind and solar units is the solution to:

                                                        ∑        ∑                                            (13)
                                                , ,…,


                   subject to          ∑        ̂ , 1        ∑           ,                ∑             .

This efficient frontier minimizes the standard deviation of the portfolio-level hourly capacity factor

subject to achieving a given expected hourly capacity factor and maintaining the same total

capacity shares for wind and solar capacity as actually exists.


                                                        22
        Two sets of hours, H, are used to compute the estimates of μ and Ω. The first uses all hours

of the day and all days of the sample, so that card(H) is equal to 8760 = 24 hours x 365 days. The

second computes efficient frontiers for groups of hours of the day to quantify how far the actual

portfolio is from the efficient frontier for different groups of hours of the day. For this calculation,

hours of the day are separated into four groups, hours 1-6, 7-12, 13-18, and 19-24, so that in this

case, card(H) = 365 x 4 = 1460.

        For each efficient frontier, I also compute the risk-adjusted maximum (RA-Max) output

portfolio for that frontier. This is the point on the wind and solar efficient frontier that has the

largest value of the ratio of the expected hourly output divided by the standard deviation of the

                          ∗
hourly output. Let              for j=1,2,…,J equal the set of portfolio weights that solve this problem

and , the value C for these portfolio weights. The RA-Max expected hourly output portfolio is

equal to:

                                                ∑       ∗

                                                    ∗            ∗    /
                                                                          ,                                 (14)

where       is the value of C that yields the largest value of this ratio.

        Computing the efficient frontier for expected hourly revenues and the standard deviation

of hourly revenues follows the exact same process but with the vector Fh replaced by the vector

Rh. Each point on the hourly revenues efficient frontier is the solution to the following optimization

problem in the J-dimensional vector w, for a given value D,

                                ∑   ∑                        subject to       ∑         and 1    ∑          (15)
                        , ,…,


where        is the estimate of     and     is the estimate of            based on the sample values of Rh. For

each of the sets of hours, H, defined above                 is the (j,k) element of Γ and   is the jth element of

 , where

                                                            23
                           ∑   ∈                               ′ and                ∑   ∈        .        (16)

Increasing the value of D from the minimum element of                          to the maximum element of , and

solving the problem for each value of D, yields the mean and standard deviation pairs along the

efficient frontier.

        Points along the efficient frontier take the form

                                      ∗                                ∗            ∗        /
                               (∑              , ∑             ∑                                 ).       (17)

We also plot the actual capacity-weighted expected hourly revenues per MW of capacity and

standard deviation of hourly revenues per MW of capacity on the same diagram as the efficient

mean-standard deviation frontier to demonstrate how far the actual portfolio of wind and solar

resources is from this efficient frontier. The actual capacity-weighted share point is equal to the

portfolio mean-standard deviation pair:

                                                                                    /
                               (∑           , ∑            ∑                            ),                (18)

where the          (j=1,2,…,J) are the actual installed capacity shares defined in Section 3. Similar

to the case of the hourly output efficient frontier, for the combined wind and solar hourly revenues

efficient frontier the constraint that the efficient capacity share of solar resources must equal the

actual capacity shares of solar resources is imposed.

        The same two sets of hours that are used to compute the efficient frontiers for hourly output

are used to compute the estimates of λ and Γ. The RA-Max expected hourly revenue portfolio is

equal to:

                                               ∑       ∗

                                                   ∗               ∗   /
                                                                           ,                              (19)
                                      ∑    ∑


where       is the value of D that yields the largest value of this ratio.




                                                           24
        Following the logic of the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), the actual capacity-share-

weighted portfolio and the risk-adjusted maximum expected hourly output portfolio can be used

to compute measures of the non-diversifiable hourly output risk associated with each wind and

solar location in the California ISO control area. These measures of risk can be computed using

the following linear regression:

                                             fjh = αj + βjfmkt,h + εjh                                (20)

where fmkt,h is the weighted average of location-specific capacity factors that is computed as either

the actual capacity share weighted average (              ,         ∑          ) or as the RA-Max share

                                         ∗
weighted average (      ,          ∑                 ).       The coefficient βj is the measure of the non-

diversifiable risk associated with wind and solar production at location j. It measures the

sensitivity of movements in fjh to movements in fmkt,h, the hourly weighted average capacity factor

across all wind and solar locations.

        A similar non-diversifiable wind and solar risk measure can be derived for the hourly

revenue per MW of capacity from the linear regression

                                             rjh = αj + βjrmkt,h + εjh                                (21)

where rmkt,h is the weighted average of location-specific revenues per MW that is computed as

either the actual capacity share weighted average (             ,       ∑         ) or as the RA-Max share

                                        ∗
weighted average (      ,          ∑                 ).       The coefficient βj is the measure of the non-

diversifiable risk associated with hourly wind and solar revenues at location j. It measures the

sensitivity of movements in hourly revenues per MW of capacity at location j, rjh, to movements

in the hourly weighted average of revenues per MW of capacity across all wind and solar locations.

6. Hourly Output and Hourly Revenue Efficient Frontiers

       This section presents the results of computing the hourly output-per-unit-of-capacity and

hourly-revenues-per-unit-of-capacity efficient frontiers. For each efficient frontier, the risk-

adjusted maximum expected hourly output or expected hourly revenues portfolio is computed.

The location-specific measures of non-diversifiable risk are computed for both the actual capacity-

weighted-share output and revenue portfolios and the RA-Max expected-hourly-output or RA-

Max expected hourly-revenues-portfolios.

                                       [Insert Figure 6 Here]

                                       [Insert Figure 7 Here]

       Figure 6 plots the annual hourly output per MW of capacity efficient frontier for solar units

alone, wind units alone, and the combination of wind and solar units. This efficient frontier

computes the estimates of μ and Ω using the set H that contains all hours of the day and all days

in the sample period. The actual capacity share-weighted portfolio is plotted with a “+” and the

RA-Max expected hourly output maximizing portfolio is plotted with an “o”.

       Several results emerge from this figure. First, the efficient frontier composed of only solar

generation units lies to the right of the efficient portfolio of only wind units, suggesting that on an

annual hourly basis, almost any efficient portfolio of only wind units dominates any efficient

portfolio of only solar units. Second, the addition of solar units to a wind-only efficient portfolio

only slightly increases the expected hourly output per MW of capacity for the same standard

deviation of hourly output per MW of capacity. Third, a 48 percent increase in the expected hourly

output per MW of capacity of the actual portfolio of wind and solar units (denoted by “+” in the

figure) can be obtained without increasing the annual hourly variability in renewable output per

MW by optimizing the capacity shares of individual wind and solar locations subject to the



                                                  26
constraint that the aggregate wind and solar capacity shares are equal to the actual total wind and

solar capacity shares. The risk-adjusted expected hourly output per MW of capacity maximizing

portfolio selects a 15 percent lower expected hourly output per MW of capacity but a 50% lower

standard deviation of the hourly expected output per MW of capacity relative to the actual

capacity-weighted-share portfolio.

        Figure 7 presents efficient frontiers for solar, wind and the combined wind and solar

resource locations for four 6-hour periods of the day. In this case, the estimates of μ and Ω are

computed separately for four groups of hours of the day (1-6, 7-12, 13-18, and 19-24). For all of

these groups of hours of the day, the actual portfolio of wind and solar units is significantly to the

right of the efficient frontier. Moreover, this distance gets even greater during the hours of the

day when there is significant wind and solar output.            During hours 13-18, the benefits of

combining wind and solar resources yields the greatest hourly output risk reductions relative to the

efficient portfolios that contain only one of these generation technologies. This is confirmed by

the larger horizontal distance between the wind only efficient frontier and the wind and solar

efficient frontier for these hours.

        During the daylight hours (7-12 and 13-18), the risk-adjusted output maximizing portfolio

yields a lower expected hourly output per MW of capacity and a smaller standard deviation of

hourly output per MW of capacity.          During the night-time hours, the risk-adjusted output

maximizing portfolio selects a higher expected hourly output per MW and a higher standard

deviation of hourly output per MW of capacity.        This result is consistent with the within-day

pattern of wind output in the California ISO control area. Typically, the highest hourly capacity

factors occur during the night-time hours.

                                       [Insert Figure 8 Here]



                                                 27
                                       [Insert Figure 9 Here]

       Figure 8 computes the efficient frontier for hourly revenues per MW of capacity for all

hours of the year. The set of hours used to estimate λ and Γ is composed of all hours of the day

and all days of the sample period. The actual portfolio of wind and solar generation units yields

higher expected revenues per MW of capacity than an efficient portfolio with the same hourly

revenue risk composed of only solar units. The relative distance between the actual portfolio and

portfolios on the efficient frontier for hourly revenue is smaller than is the case for hourly output.

One explanation for this result is the positive correlation between hourly prices at solar facility

locations and the hourly output at these locations shown in Table 3. For same amount of revenue

risk per MW as the actual-capacity-weighted portfolio, moving to the efficient frontier increases

expected hourly revenues per MW of capacity by 26 percent. Although these are sizeable percent

changes, they are not as large in absolute value as the percent change for the hourly output per

MW.

       A bootstrap procedure can be used to compute the standard error of the difference between

the 48 percent increase in the average hourly output to move to the output efficient frontier

described earlier to the 26 percent increase in the average hourly revenue to move to the revenue

efficient frontier. Although the actual portfolio of wind and solar generation units remains the

same, the closest portfolio on each efficient frontier in terms of increasing the annual average value

of output or revenue depends on the estimated values of the mean and variance of Fh and Rh. To

compute this standard error, daily realizations of these two vectors are re-sampled to construct a

bootstrap resample of the 8760 values of Fh and Rh. Estimates of the mean and variance of Fh and

Rh are computed and the minimum distance to each efficient frontier is computed. The difference

between the percentage change in the annual average hourly output to reach the efficient frontier



                                                 28
and the percentage change in the average hourly revenue to reach the efficient frontier is computed

for each resample. This process is repeated B times and the standard deviation of these re-samples

is a consistent estimate of the standard error of the difference. Dividing the observed difference,

(48-26) by this standard error estimate yields at Z-statistic of 2.97 which is larger than the 0.01

percentile of a N(0,1) random variable, which implies rejection of the size 0.01 test of the null

hypothesis that the two percentage changes are equal.

        Figure 9 shows the hourly revenue per MW of capacity efficient frontiers for the four 6-

hour periods of the day for solar locations, wind locations, and the combined wind and solar

locations.   In this case, the estimates of λ and Γ are computed using the 4 sets of hours, Hj,

described above. These results for hourly revenue per MW of capacity are broadly similar to the

results for the hourly output per MW of capacity. They demonstrate that for all hours of the day,

the actual portfolio of wind and solar units is significantly to the right of the efficient frontier for

that hour. The greatest revenue diversification benefits from combining wind and solar generation

units occurs during the 13-18 hours of the day.

        One question that immediately arises from the results in Figures 6 to 9 is: How do the

capacity shares on the hourly-output-per-MW-of-capacity and hourly-revenue-per-MW-of-

capacity efficient frontiers compare to the actual capacity shares?            Figure 10 addresses this

question for the hourly output per MW capacity frontier. The solid line in Figure 10 orders the

                                                        ∗
wind and solar energy locations by the values of             , j=1,2,…,J, the risk-adjusted expected-

hourly-output-maximizing portfolio shares. The “squares” are the values of the actual capacity

shares in the same order.     The most glaring difference between the two sets of weights is the

                                                        ∗
relatively small number of non-zero values for the           relative to the       , which are non-zero

for all j=1,2,…,J. This figure also plots the weights associated with the point on the efficient


                                                  29
frontier that has the same annual standard deviation of hourly output as the actual capacity share-

weighted portfolio but with a higher annual average capacity factor. These weights, in the same

                            ∗
order of locations as the       , are denoted by “+” in the figure. The final series, denoted by “o”

in the figure, plots the weights associated with the point on the efficient frontier that has the same

annual average hourly output as the actual capacity share-weighted portfolio, but a lower standard

deviation of hourly output. Both these portfolios on the efficient frontier have very few non-zero

weights. No more than 15 of the 53 locations have non-zero weights in all of these portfolios.

For both the “+” and “o” weights, the locations that are non-zero are very similar in relative

magnitude to the RA-Max portfolio.

                                          [Insert Figure 10 Here]

                                          [Insert Figure 11 Here]

          Figure 11 repeats the calculations in Figure 10 for the case of the hourly revenues per

MW of capacity. The solid line in Figure 11 orders the wind and solar energy locations by the

             ∗
values of         , j=1,2,…,J, the RA-Max expected hourly revenue per MW of capacity portfolio

shares. The “squares” are the values of the actual capacity shares in the same order. Again, the

most glaring difference between the two sets of weights is the relatively small number of non-zero

                  ∗
values for the          relative to the        , which are all non-zero.   This figure also plots the

weights associated with the point on the efficient frontier that has the same annual standard

deviation of the hourly revenue per MW as the actual capacity share-weighted portfolio but a

higher annual average hourly revenue per MW. These weights, in the same order of locations as

      ∗
the         , are denoted by “+” in the figure. The final series, denoted by “o” in the figure, plots

the weights associated with the point on the efficient frontier that has the same annual average

hourly revenue per MW as the actual capacity share-weighted portfolio, but a lower annual


                                                   30
standard deviation of hourly revenue per MW.            Both these portfolios have very few non-zero

weights and the ones that are non-zero are very similar in relative magnitude to the RA-Max

portfolio.

                                        [Insert Figure 12 Here]

        Figure 12 compares the RA-Max hourly output and RA-Max hourly revenue per MW

portfolio weights. The solid line orders the weights according to the RA-Max mean hourly output

weights. The RA-Max mean hourly revenue weights in the same order of locations are denoted

by “o”. With five exceptions, the same wind and solar locations have non-zero weights for both

sets of weights. In addition, for the non-zero weights, there appears to be a positive correlation

between the value of the RA-Max hourly output weight and the RA-Max hourly revenue weight.

        To determine whether the actual capacity shares and the three sets of portfolio weights

shown in Figures 10 and 12 are statistically different, I perform the following hypothesis test:

               :              for i=1,2,…,53 versus      :                                ,       (22)

where        is the weight for wind or solar location i in efficient portfolio M, where M is either the

(1) RA-Max portfolio, (2) the efficient portfolio with same mean but lower standard deviation (LS)

than the actual portfolio, or (3) the efficient portfolio with the same standard deviation but higher

mean (HM) than the actual portfolio. Because the portfolio weights for each of these efficient

portfolios depends on the estimates of the mean and covariance matrix of Fh or Rh, I use a moving-

blocks bootstrap to compute an estimate of the covariance matrix of the vector estimated portfolio

weights for the RA-Max, LS and HM portfolios. For each of the b=1,2,…,B bootstrap resamples

of the estimated portfolio weights, I sample blocks of 7 consecutive days from the original sample

with replacement to construct a new 365 values of Fh or Rh. Blocks of days of data on Fh and Rh




                                                   31
are resampled to account for the fact that the values of Fh or Rh are correlated across days.

However, this correlation dies out as the time between observations increases.

          The values of each set of efficient frontier portfolio weights are computed based on the

estimates of the mean and covariance matrix of Fh or Rh using the resampled annual time series of

values. The sample covariance matrix of the B resampled portfolio weight vectors is the moving

blocks bootstrap covariance matrix estimate, Var(WM), that is used construct the test statistic

                                                                          ,                        (23)

where Wact is the 52-dimensional vector of the 52 largest capacity shares for the actual portfolio,

WM is the 52-dimensional vector of capacity shares for these same locations for portfolio M, and

Var(WM) is the moving blocks bootstrap estimate of the covariance matrix of WM. (Note that the

test statistic drops one capacity share because the sum of all capacity shares in all of the portfolios

is equal to one.) This test statistic is asymptotically distributed as a χ2-distribution with 52 degrees

of freedom under the null hypothesis. Table 4 reports the test statistics for the three hypothesis

tests for the hourly output and hourly revenue efficient frontiers. For all cases the null hypothesis

is overwhelmingly rejected, which implies that the three portfolios on the hourly output and hourly

revenue efficient frontiers all have statistically different portfolio weights from the actual capacity

shares.

                                         [Insert Table 4 Here]

          The results in Figures 10 to 12 imply that by concentrating California’s total wind and solar

capacity investments at fewer locations a capacity mix can be achieved that has either a higher

annual average hourly output and a lower annual variability in hourly output or a higher average

hourly revenue and lower annual variability in hourly revenue. Moreover, because of the high

degree of positive correlation between the non-zero weights for the two RA-Max portfolios, it is



                                                   32
possible to move closer to both the hourly output and hourly revenue efficient frontiers with a

different capacity mix from the present one.

                                          [Insert Table 6 Here]

       The upper left panel of Figure 13 plots pairs of      , the estimated market-specific renewable

energy output risk at location j, using       ,    ∑                as the market portfolio and the value

of ̂ , the mean hourly capacity factor associated with location j. The upper right panel repeats

                                             ∗
this same plot using       ,       ∑                    as the market portfolio. Both of these figures

also plot two estimates of the analogue of the Security Market Line from the Capital Asset Pricing

Model (CAPM) relating the market-specific output risk at a location j to the expected capacity

factor at location j. The solid line in the figure is the ordinary least squares fit from regressing ̂

on     for all wind and solar locations and the dotted line is the fit using only observations with a

non-zero capacity shares in the RA-Max portfolio on the hourly output efficient frontier. The

bottom two panels of Figure 13 repeats these calculations for the market-specific measures of

renewable energy revenue risk at each location, where the           in the bottom left panel are estimated

using the actual capacity shares to compute the market portfolio revenue per MW of capacity and

the    in the bottom right panel are estimated using the RA-Max portfolio weights on the hourly

revenue efficient frontier to compute the market portfolio.

                                          [Insert Figure 13 Here]

       Several conclusions emerge from this figure. First, across all four panels, the fitted lines

relating expected output and expected revenues to their respective market-specific risk measures

using only wind and solar resource locations with non-zero shares in the RA-Max portfolios yield

uniformly higher expected output and expected revenue for the same value of market-specific risk
                                                   33
than the fitted lines that use all wind and solar resource locations. This result clarifies why many

of the actual wind and solar locations did not receive a positive weight on the output or revenue

efficient frontiers. A higher expected hourly capacity factor or a higher expected revenue per MW

of capacity can be obtained for the market-specific risk measure value at locations with zero

weights in the RA-Max portfolio by taking a weighted average of locations with non-zero weights

in the RA-Max portfolio.

        Second, using the RA-Max output or revenue portfolio as the market portfolio implies a

much greater range of values of market-specific risk measures across locations. The range of

estimated values of the market-specific measure is roughly double the range of values for the case

in which actual portfolio shares are used to compute the market portfolio. This occurs because

many actual wind and solar resources locations have zero weights in the efficient RA-Max output

and revenue portfolios.

        Third, the fit of pairs of expected output and market-specific risk and pairs of expected

revenue and market-specific risk measures to the analogue to the Security Market Line are far

superior for market-specific risk measures computed using the RA-Max portfolio as the market

portfolio. Consistent with our earlier result that the actual portfolio is relatively closer to the hourly

revenue efficient frontier than to the hourly output efficient frontier, the fit of the expected revenue

and market-specific risk line, using only locations with non-zero weights in the RA-Max revenue

portfolio, is far better than the fit of the expected output and market-specific risk line which uses

only locations with non-zero weights in the RA-Max output portfolio.

6.1. Qualifications and Caveats with Counterfactual Results

        The empirical results presented in this section demonstrate the possibility of increasing the

annual average hourly output of wind and solar resources in the California ISO control area without



                                                   34
increasing the annual standard deviation of this hourly output by changing the locational capacity

shares of the state’s wind and solar generation capacity. It is important to emphasize what is being

assumed in constructing the counterfactual capacity investments implied by these efficient

frontiers. Each point along the efficient frontier assumes that the mean and covariance matrix of

Fh would be same regardless of how much generation capacity at each location is constructed,

subject to the constraint that the total amount of wind and solar capacity built in California is equal

to the aggregate amount that has actually been built.

       Clearly, one explanation for higher mean capacity factors and lower standard deviation of

capacity factors at some locations in the California ISO control area is the vintage of the technology

installed at that location. However, the sample correlation between the age of the generation units

at each wind location and the average annual capacity factor at that location does allow rejection

of the 0.05 test of the null hypothesis of zero correlation. This could be explained by the fact that

although wind capacity was installed at locations with the best wind resources first, the efficiency

of the turbines installed over time increased fast enough to counteract this effect.

       An alternative approach to this analysis would be to use wind speed data at each location

and assume standardized wind energy to electricity conversion factors to compute an estimated

hourly capacity factor at each location. Green and Vasilakos (2010) take this approach in their

study of the impact of large amounts of wind generation on the behavior of hourly prices in the

Great Britain electricity market in 2020. The strength of their approach is that a standardized

technology for converting wind energy to electricity can be applied across all wind resource

locations. However, this approach does not account for how the generation technology actually

performs at each wind resource location. Using the actual hourly wind energy production at each

wind resource location, addresses this concern. A topic for future research is to compare the hourly



                                                  35
output of a wind generation unit at each location estimated using hourly wind speed measurements

to the actual hourly output of the wind units at that location and the hourly solar output at each

location estimating using hourly solar irradiance data to the actual hourly output of the solar units

at that location.

7. Implications for Wholesale Market Design with Significant Wind and Solar Goals

        The empirical results presented in the previous section demonstrate the reliability and

operating cost benefits of accounting for the impact on the annual average hourly output and annual

variability in the hourly output of renewable energy in making wind and solar capacity investment

decisions. Locating wind and solar facilities to maximize the increase in the annual average hourly

output for a given increase in the annual standard deviation in hourly output can yield significant

reliability benefits and operating cost savings.

        The results from Section 6 argue in favor of taking these reliability and operating reserves

cost savings into account in making wind and solar generation investment decisions. By doing so,

investments in wind or solar generation capacity could provide the largest possible increase in

average hourly renewable energy output while limiting the aggregate reliability consequences of

this investment. Conversely, investments made in this manner would minimize increases in the

annual variability of hourly wind and solar output for a given increase in the average hourly energy

output from these generation units.

        The difference between the relative distance to the hourly revenue frontier versus the

hourly output frontier for the actual portfolio of wind and solar investments provides a rough

measure of the extent to which failing to account for these reliability and operating cost savings

distorts wind and solar location decisions. If one is willing to assume that the cost per megawatt

of constructing a wind or solar generation unit is roughly the same for all existing locations in



                                                   36
California, then an expected profit-maximizing investor in wind or solar generation capacity in

California will choose the location that yields the highest expected revenues, because the cost of

constructing and operating the unit is roughly the same at all locations. As the analyses in the

previous section have demonstrated, this choice will likely increase the annual standard deviation

in the hourly output of all wind and solar units in the California ISO control area because the

supplier does not take into consideration the impact of its investment decision on overall grid

reliability and only considers the expected profits this individual investment will earn. If prices at

that location are sufficiently high and/or positively correlated with renewable energy output at that

location, the expected profit-maximizing location decision may not even increase the annual

average hourly output of wind and solar energy.

       This logic is consistent with the results presented earlier that the closest portfolio on hourly

revenue efficient frontier with the same annual variability in hourly revenues as the actual portfolio

of wind and solar generation investments has a 26 percent higher annual average hourly revenue,

whereas the closest portfolio on the hourly output frontier with the same annual variability in

hourly output as the actual portfolio has a 48 percent higher annual average hourly output. As

shown in Section 6, the annual average hourly output percent increase is statistically significantly

larger than the annual average hourly revenue increase. The difference in these estimates points

towards significant reliability improvements and operating reserves cost savings from accounting

for these reliability benefits in wind and solar capacity location decisions.

       To provide quantitative evidence in favor of this claim, the left panel of Figure 14 reports

a histogram of values of following variable for each location. Starting from the actual portfolio of

wind and solar generation capacity in California, compute the percentage increase in the annual

average hourly output of all wind and solar units associated with adding one more 1 MW of wind



                                                 37
(if it is a wind location) or solar capacity (if it is a solar location) at wind or solar location k. Call

this variable %ΔE(Q)/ΔMW(k). For each location compute the percentage increase in the annual

standard deviation of hourly output of all wind and solar units associated with adding one more 1

MW of wind or solar capacity at each wind or solar location k. Call this variable %Δσ(Q)/ΔMW(k).

Compute     the   ratio   of   [%ΔE(Q)/ΔMW(k)]/[%Δσ(Q)/ΔMW(k)]               and   call   this   variable

%ΔE(Q)/%Δσ(Q)(k). This variable measures the percentage increase in the annual average hourly

renewable output for a one unit increase in the annual standard deviation of hourly renewable

output that results from a 1 MW investment at location k.          Following this same procedure for

hourly revenue produces the variable %ΔE(R)/%Δσ(R)(k), the percentage increase in the annual

average hourly wind and solar revenue for a one unit increase in the annual standard deviation of

hourly wind and solar revenue associated with a 1 MW investment at location k. The histogram

of values of %ΔE(R)/%Δσ(R)(k) are plotted in the right panel of Figure 14.

                                        [Insert Figure 14 Here]

        The histogram of values of %ΔE(Q)/%Δσ(Q)(k) demonstrate that substantial reliability and

cost savings that are possible from a policy that sites wind and solar facilities based on the value

of %ΔE(Q)/%Δσ(Q)(k) at that location.             There are renewable locations with values of

%ΔE(Q)/%Δσ(Q)(k) that are ten times larger than the values at the majority of locations. There

are a significant number of locations where the value of %ΔE(Q)/%Δσ(Q)(k) is 5 times larger than

the majority of values, and even a small number of locations where an additional MW of renewable

capacity would both increase the annual average hourly output and reduce the annual standard

deviation of hourly output, which yields a negative value of %ΔE(Q)/%Δσ(Q)(k).                       The

heterogeneity in values of %ΔE(R)/%Δσ(R)(k) is substantially less than the heterogeneity in values

of %ΔE(Q)/%Δσ(Q)(k). The values of %ΔE(Q)/%Δσ(Q)(k) range from slightly more than -5 to



                                                   38
less than 12, whereas the values of %ΔE(R)/%Δσ(R)(k) range from slightly more than 0.5 to 2.5,

which is consistent with the logic that profit-maximizing entry decisions focus on maximizing

expected revenues.

                                      [Insert Figure 15 Here]

                                      [Insert Figure 16 Here]

       Figure 15 repeats these calculations for just wind generation capacity. Figure 16 repeats

them for just the solar generation capacity. The major result to emerge from these figures is that

accounting for the reliability and cost savings associated with wind investments and combinations

of wind and solar investments is likely to yield greater operating cost savings than for solar

investments alone. The heterogeneity in the values of %ΔE(Q)/%Δσ(Q)(k) for the wind-only

portfolio is substantially greater than for solar-only portfolio. This result is consistent with the

results presented in Figure 4 and 5 showing much greater contemporaneous correlation in both

hourly output and hourly revenues across solar locations than wind locations.

7.1. Methods for Incorporating Reliability and Costs Benefits

       These results emphasize that a major challenge in wholesale electricity markets with

significant wind and solar energy goals is to provide the appropriate incentives for wind and solar

project developers to locate and size these investments to maximize system-wide wind and solar

output subject to a given increase in the standard deviation in system-wide hourly wind and solar

output. By providing incentives for wind and solar project developers to internalize the impact

their location decisions impose on the cost of managing real-time system balance, a lower system-

wide cost of achieving a given wind and solar energy production goal can be achieved.

       There are a number of potential approaches to achieving this goal. A first step is for control

areas to compile and make publicly available information similar to what is reported in the



                                                39
previous section. Values for %ΔE(Q)/%Δσ(Q)(k) at each wind or solar resource location would

provide valuable information to the control area operator, new wind and solar capacity investors,

and transmission planners on the reliability implications of different new capacity investment

decisions, because they would know which locations result in the greatest risk-adjusted increase

in the annual average hourly output of renewable energy.

       The aggregate wind and solar energy risk associated with the location and scale of

investments in these technologies could be made a factor in the transmission planning process to

support wind and solar energy capacity expansion in any control area. Specifically, keeping all

other factors the same, expanding transmission capacity into wind and solar resource regions with

the largest values of %ΔE(Q)/%Δσ(Q)(k) would yield significant savings in real-time system

operating costs.

       The next step could be to eliminate any implicit support mechanisms for renewable

investments that unnecessarily increase the incentive of wind and solar developers to build new

capacity at locations that increase the aggregate volatility of wind and solar energy production.

Long-term contracts or feed-in-tariffs (FITs) for wind and solar resources that pay a fixed per

MWh price for all of the energy produced each hour of the year are prime example of the sort of

financing scheme that provides strong incentives to enhance, rather than reduce, hourly energy

output volatility from wind and solar resources. Transitioning wind and solar forward contracting

to the standard fixed-price and fixed-quantity contract used to finance dispatchable generation

units would reduce this incentive to enhance wind and solar output volatility.

       In the multi-settlement markets that exist throughout the United States, making wind and

solar generation unit owners liable for the hourly imbalance charges associated with deviations

between the amount of energy they sell in the day-ahead market and the amount of energy the units



                                                40
actually produce in real-time would increase the likelihood that new wind and solar investments

are made with some consideration for the aggregate wind and solar output volatility associated

with these investments.

       A final mechanism could be to charge differential grid interconnection fees inversely

related to the value of %ΔE(Q)/%Δσ(Q)(k) to provide the price signals necessary to cause investors

in new renewable generation capacity to take into account the increased system operating costs

associated with their location decisions. However, given the substantial complexity associated with

the determining the appropriate interconnection fees, this kind of policy must be implemented with

great care.

8. Conclusions

       Because a growing number of jurisdictions have set ambitious renewable energy goals,

understanding how the aggregate output risk of intermittent wind and solar resources scale with

the location and magnitude of these capacity investments is increasingly important to maintaining

a reliable supply of electricity. The mean and standard deviation efficient frontiers for the hourly

output and hourly revenues derived above are important tools for determining the magnitude of

the level versus variability trade-offs in total wind and solar output.

       Using hourly output data from the California ISO control area for a one-year time period,

this paper computed the hourly output and hourly revenue efficient frontier for all wind and solar

resource locations in the California ISO control area.       Points along the efficient frontier are

compared to the actual capacity-weighted portfolio of wind and solar resources in California. For

both mean/standard deviation efficient frontiers, economically meaningful differences between

portfolios on the efficient frontier and the actual wind and solar capacity mix are found.      The

relative difference was particularly large for the hourly wind and solar output frontier, with a 48



                                                  41
percent increase in the expected hourly output of wind and solar energy possible without increasing

the standard deviation of the total renewable hourly output beyond its actual level. For the hourly

revenues efficient frontier, a 26 percent increase in mean hourly total renewable revenues was

found to be possible without increasing the standard deviation of hourly revenues beyond its

current level. These result were shown to be consistent with expected profit-maximizing behavior

by solar and wind capacity investors under the current renewables interconnection policies.

       Most of the hourly output and hourly revenue risk-reducing benefits of optimal wind and

solar generation capacity location decisions in California can be captured by employing a mix of

wind resources, with the addition of solar resources only slightly increasing the set of feasible

portfolio mean and standard deviation combinations. The diversification benefit from including

solar generation units in the portfolio of renewable resources is particularly modest for the hourly

revenue efficient frontier.

       The risk-adjusted maximum expected hourly output portfolio on the efficient hourly output

frontier and the risk-adjusted maximum expected hourly revenue maximizing portfolio on the

efficient hourly revenue frontier were computed.        In both cases, weights for these portfolios

focused on a small number of wind and solar locations, with the vast majority of existing locations

having a zero portfolio weight. The market-specific risk measures for the risk-adjusted maximum

output portfolio and the risk-adjusted maximum revenue portfolio found approximately linear

relationships between the actual expected output at a location and the market-specific risk output

measure at that location and actual expected revenue at a location and the market-specific revenue

risk measure at that location, particularly for the locations with non-zero portfolio weights in risk-

adjusted maximum output and revenue portfolios.
