        Integrated Regressors and Tests of the Permanent Income Hypothesis




                                    ABSTRACT




      We use recent research on estimation and testing in the presence of unit
   roots to argue that Hall's (1978) t and F tests of whether consumption is
   predicted by lagged income, or by lags of consumption beyond the first, are
   asymptotically valid. A Monte Carlo experiment suggests that the asymptotic t
   and F distributions provide a good approximation to the actual finite sample
   distribution.

 1.   Introduction

       Are regression tests of the permanent income model of consumption valid

 when consumption and income have unit roots? Recent research on estimation and

 testing in the presence of unit roots has emphasized that standard procedures

 are often asymptotically valid even with stochastically growing regressors. In

 this paper, we use these developments to show that Hallts (1978) t- and F-tests

 of whether consumption is predicted by lagged income, or by additional lags of

 consumption beyond the first, are legitimate under some standard assumptions

 about the first differences of consumption and income.

      This result might at first seem surprising, since in their study of

Flavin's (1981) test of the permanent income model Mankiw and Shapiro (1985)

presented dramatic evidence that Itif income is indeed a random walk, then the

standard testing procedure is greatly biased toward finding excess sensitivity"

of consumption to current income (p. 165). This evidence is of course

consistent with the results of many other studies that show that standard

procedures may be severely biased in the presence of unit roots (e.g., Fuller

(1976), Nelson and Kang (1981)).

      Standard procedures are not, however, always misleading when the regressors

have unit roots. Sims, Stock and Watson (1986) and West (1986) show that even

with nonstationary regressors the usual testing procedures are asymptotically

valid if a regression can be rewritten so that the coefficients of interest are

on stationary, zero mean regressors. In particular, if consumption and income

are difference stationary and cointegrated -- as is argued empirically in

Campbell (1985) and Engle and Granger (1987), and as the permanent income model

implies --   Hall's   (1978) regression can be rewritten in just this way. The

presence or absence of time trends is not relevant to this result (Sims, Stock
                                      2


and Watson (1986)). The essential distinction between Hall's (1978) and Mankiw

and Shapiro's (1985) regressions are that Hall included a lag of consumption as

a regressor, Mankiw and Shapiro (1985) did not.   This seemingly minor

discrepancy means that Hall's regression can be rewritten in the necessary

fashion, Mankiw and Shapiro's cannot. This important example emphasizes the

general proposition that integration and cointegration properties of the

regressors matter for the distribution of test statistics. We make this

argument precise in Section 2.

     Of course, the finite sample performance of these tests might differ

substantially from that predicted by asymptotic theory. To investigate this

possibility, in Section 3 we report the results of some Monte Carlo experiments

based on a cointegrated model of consumption and income.   The support for the

asymptotic theory is dramatic: in a sample of size 100, t-   and F-tests based on

the usual 5% asymptotic critical values are found to reject in 4% to 6% of the

trials.

     We caution the reader that we are     suggesting   that standard procedures

are always valid in the presence of unit roots.   The arguments concerning

nonstandard distributions in Mankiw and Shapiro (1985), for example, are

appropriate in many circumstances. Rather, we are explaining that standard

testing procedures are appropriate in many other circumstances.    Determining

when the usual asymptotics apply requires a careful examination of the

integration, trend and cointegration properties of the regressors.



2. The Model and Tests

     We adopt Flavin's (1981) interpretation of the permanent income model.

Consumption (Ce) equals permanent income, the annuity value of the sum of human
                                                3

 wealth (ht) and nonhuman wealth (Wt):


                 =
                     rw   + r(l+r)1h,

 (1)          ht =   EtE(l+r)Jyt+.,
                                         -
                     (l+r)wti +              Cr1.
 In (1), r is the real interest rate,               is labor income, and E denotes

 expectations conditional on the consumer's information set (assumed to be

equivalent to linear projections). Thus consumption is proportional to the sum

of human wealth - -       the   expected present value of future labor income - -    and
accumulated savings.

       Flavin (1981) showed that (1) implies that the change in consumption equals

the unpredictable change in the annuity value of labor income, i.e., that                  =
          =
C.C1          r(ht_Et1h)=€.          This leads to Hall's (1978) famous conclusion that

consumption follows a random walk: C =
                                                    C11   + '   where
                                                                        Et1EtO.
       Current savings can also be obtained from (1). Let Y be disposable

income, YYr Substituting the expression for human wealth into the
first expression in (1)




(2) Y-C                         =
                                     (l+r)Xl+r)3(EtY÷_Y)

                                _EEt(l+r)JAy..
                                jl


       Thus current savings is the negative of the expected present discounted

value of changes in future labor income, as emphasized by Campbell (1985). This
                                       4

implies that C and       are cointegrated in the sense of Granger (1983) and Engle

and Granger (1987). Following Nelson and Plosser (1982) and Mankiw and Shapiro

(1985), suppose first that     has a unit root with possibly nonzero drift --    the
case considered in our Monte Carlo experiments -- so that        is stationary with

possibly nonzero unconditional mean a. Then (2) implies that Y-Ct

where K-ra and u is stationary with mean zero and finite variance. That is,

      and C individually have unit roots, but Y-C is stationary.1

Alternatively, suppose that      is stationary with a nonzero mean; again, (2)
           d                                            d
implies Y and C are cointegrated. Although so far           and C. have been assumed

to have zero drift, we generalize this to let EAYEACtP, so that       Y-C is
stationary.

       Mankiw and Shapiro (1985) follow Flavin (1981) and consider testing the

random walk prediction using detrended data. One of their tests is the t-test of

710 in the regression



(3)            ACtp+rYi+t+Et.

Mankiw and Shapiro (1985) assume that income is a pure random walk with drift

and that consumer uses only past income to forecast future income. Since in
                    d
this    framework
                                       .
                          the test (3) is equivalent to regressing C on C_1 and

a time trend and testing whether the coefficient on lagged consumption is one,

where C is a random walk under the null.2 The theoretical and Monte Carlo

results in Fuller (1976) and the Monte Carlo results in Mankiw and Shapiro

(1985) show that there is a strong tendency towards incorrectly rejecting the

null hypothesis that nO in (3). Indeed, Mankiw and Shapiro (1985, Table 2)

find that if the usual 5 percent critical value for a t-test is used in a sample
                                                          5

 of size 100, the null is rejected 61 percent of the time. As illustrated in

 Banerjee et al. (1986), the poor finite sample performance is indicative of

 nonstandard asymptotic behavior of the t statistic on rr.

       Neither Fuller's (1976) nor Mankiw and Shapiro's (1985) analysis, however,

 is relevant to the regressions of the form reported by Hall (1978),



 (4)         Ct = p +                  + 'l-l +               +          +



 in which l =      ... = iT =          0, and, in general, CtY, under the null hypothesis.

Although either (3) or (4) can be used to test the random walk hypothesis, the

statistical properties of the test statistics based on the two regressions are

different indeed. The key statistical difference between the regressions (3)

and (4) is that, even though income has a unit root, the coefficients on income

in (4) can all be written as coefficients on mean zero
                                                                             stationary variables,
whereas in (3) this is impossible. It is impossible for (3) since no linear

combination of a time trend and a variable with a unit root is
                                                                                      stationary. By
contrast, the right hand side of (4) can be rearranged to yield



(5) Ct =
            (p-4-n1ic+.
                          .   .+iTK)   + (+iT1+. . .+iT

                  + TI (Y Ct1K) +


or



(5') Ct = m + C1 + el(Y i-Ce l-K) + ...                           +
                                                                      e(Y pCt 1K) +

where m =                 .+ITK,          (41rl+.. .+'TI) and e.=Tr,. Since the OLS estimators
                                        6

of [e.1 in (5') are algebraically identical to the OLS estimators of         in

(4), the null hypothesis could be tested using either regression.

        The fact that (4) can be rewritten as (5) means that some standard results

hold (given, of course, some standard assumptions about       and         When time

is excluded as a regressor and consumption and income have nonzero drift,

Theorem 1 of Sims, Stock and Watson (1986) and Theorem 3.1 of West (1986) imply

that the OLS estimators of {ir.1 are jointly asymptotically normally distributed,

converging at the rate T"2.      Theorem 2 of Sims, Stock and Watson (1986) and

Theorem 3.4 of West (1986) imply that t- or F-tests examining any or all of

these estimated coefficients have the usual asymptotic distributions. The

theorems in West (1986) show that these results hold even if        is conditionally

heteroskedastic.3 The theorems in Sims, Stock and Watson (1986) show that these

results hold even if a time trend is included on the right hand side of (4), and

consumption and income have zero drift. The key condition is that it is

possible to rewrite the equation so that the coefficients of interest are on

mean zero stationary variables.4 The asymptotic normal distribution follows

because the stationary and mean zero regressors {Y_±_Ct_1_KJ, i=l,. ..,p, are

asymptotically uncorrelated with the other regressors in (5'). Thus 18.1 have

the usual joint asymptotic normal distribution, and converge at the usual T1"2

rate.

        It is useful to contrast the asymptotic distribution of the coefficients on

lagged income with that of the coefficients on lagged stock prices, which Hall

(1978) also used to test the unpredictability of consumption changes. Suppose

that stock prices have a unit root, but that consumption and stock prices are

not cointegrated.6 Then Hall's (1978) F-tests of the predictability of

consumption using p lags of stock prices are not valid. However, since any p-I
                                            7

 of the coefficients on lagged stock prices can be rewritten as coefficients on

 mean zero stationary variables (lagged changes of the stock price minus their

 means), tests based on any p-l of the p estimated coefficients on stock prices

     valid. In particular, if p>l, the usual t-test on each of these

 coefficients, considered individually, provides a valid basis for testing the

 predictability of consumption.

         We close this section by providing some intuition for the result that

 imposing the true restriction l in (4) so sharply changes the asymptotic

analysis. To be concrete, suppose that only one lag of income is included as a

regressor (pl), and imagine for the moment that consumption and income are

stationary. Then imposing a true coefficient on C_1 (which would be less than

one) would in general improve the efficiency of the estimate of the coefficient

from imposing the restriction. In the case at hand,            and C1 are
cointegrated, so that they are perfectly correlated in the sense that the R2 of

a regression of consumption on income will converge to one. The efficiency

gained asymptotically from imposing l in (4) reflects this asymptotic perfect

multicollinearity, with the coefficient on Y_ in the constrained case

                                        at the rate T rather than T /

3. Monte Carlo Results

     Might these asymptotic results provide a useful guide in practice? We

investigated this question using Monte Carlo experiments of the model (1).

Let changes in labor income consist of two independent white noise components,

e1 and e2, so that the nondeterministic portion of the process for labor
                                              8


income evolves according to yy_1+e1+e2. Suppose that the consumer knows

the first component contemporaneously but knows the second component one period

in advance, so that the consumer's information set is te1te2t_+iIO}. It

is straightforward to show that, under the model (1)




(6)              = p +
                         e1   +
                                  (l+r)'e2,

(7)        AC = + e1          +
                                  (l+r)1e2+i.

We have added the drift p to account for a possible deterministic component of
                                                  d
income and consumption growth. Thus C. and            have unit roots, but
      d     -l
Ct_Yt(l+r) e2+i is stationary.
      The Monte Carlo simulations were performed using income and consumption

series generated by (6) and (7) with (e1t,e2t) -        N(O,.512) (where 12 denotes the
2x2 identity matrix) and with Mankiw and Shapiro's (1985) value for r (1.25% per

period). Out of concern that the small sample distributions of the tests might

be sensitive to the size of the drift (see Evans and Savin [19841), the

experiments were repeated for pO, 0.3, 0.6, 1.0, and 3.0; the 0.6 drift matches

the ratio of the mean change in quarterly real per capita disposable income to

its standard deviation from 1959:1 to 1983:4, the value used by Mankiw and

Shapiro (1985). Regressions of the form (4) with pl and p4 were estimated,

both excluding and including time as a regressor. The experiments were repeated

5000 times using T50 and Tl00 observations, respectively representing the

final observations of 55 and 105 draws of consumption and income.

      Table 1 contains the results of the t-tests based on the pl regressions.

A comparison of the asymptotic and Monte Carlo quantiles when time is excluded
                                               9

  from the regression (panel A) indicates that the t-statistic exhibits a slight

 negative shift when there is no drift; with a positive drift the distribution is

 shifted slightly to the right. The shift in the distribution is more marked

 when time is included as a regressor (e.g., with T100 the 5 per cent Monte

 Carlo percentile is -1.82, while the asymptotic is -1.65). 7              This shift

 diminishes as the sample size grows. Moreover, in all the cases in Table 1, the

 two sided t-test rejections fall between 9.0 per cent and 11.3 per cent using

 the asymptotic 10 per cent critical value, supporting the use of the asymptotic

 theory.

      The results for F-tests based on regressions with four lags of income are

 reported in Table 2. As in the case of the t-tests, the tendency to reject too

often is slight, the worst case at the 10% level being a rejection of 13.6%

using detrended data with T=50. When the sample size is increased to 100, this

rejection fraction drops to 12.0. Finally, differences in the size of the drift

evidently have little effect on the size the F-tests.

      We close this section with some evidence on Mankiw and Shapiro's (1985)

suggestion that spurious excess sensitivity to income in the regression (3)

should be attributed to small sample consumption-income correlations induced by

incorrectly detrending a random walk. It appears instead that the spurious

sensitivity is mainly due to the shift in the asymptotic distribution of the

estimator of iT in (3) from a normal to Fuller's (1976) "unit roots"

distribution. This may be seen in tests of
                                                       H0: ir1 =

with p=l or p=4. We generated 5000 Monte Carlo samples of size 105 (so T100),

and tested H0 using the usual asymptotic t and F critical values. The results

are in Table 3. The effect of even a small drift is to shift the upper tail of

the distribution of the t-statistic substantially to the right. However, for

p0.6 (approximately the standardized shift in U.S. disposable income),

substantially more mass remains in the left tail than is predicted by the

asymptotic normal approximation. Nonetheless, the percent rejections for the F-

and two sided t-tests are satisfactory for all nonzero drifts considered; they

are, of course, quite unsatisfactory for



4. Conclusions

     These results suggest three conclusions. First, while it is premature to

conclude that the qualitative results in this paper are applicable to other

regressions in which the right hand side variables are all integrated or

cointegrated,9 the asymptotic distribution theory provides a remarkably good

guide to the small sample properties of the test statistics in the simple model

of consumption studied here.

     Second, while "spuriously detrending" an integrated process can often lead

to highly biased inference (Nelson and Kang [19811), this is not the case for

the test statistics studied here. The methodological lesson of this exercise is

that it is important to examine, either theoretically or empirically, the joint

integration properties of the regressors in question as a step towards obtaining

asymptotically justifiable inferences.

     Third, Hall's (1978) tests involving lags of income are asymptotically

valid in the context of the model presented in this paper. This conclusion does

not, however, mean that there is little evidence against the permanent income
                                    11

model. Such evidence can be found in a difference-stationary or cointegrated

environment (e.g. Campbell [1985], Nelson [1987], Watson [1986], and West

[19871) and in the individual t-statistjcs for the stock price regressions in

Hall's (1978) original paper.

Newey and West (1987) adjustment for conditional heteroskedasticity. West

(1986) also shows that the standard formulas would apply if the disturbance ct

were autocorrelated, or if one were estimating (4) by two stage least squares or

Hansen's (1982) two-step, two stage least squares (although neither of these is

a relevant possibility, in the present example).

4. There is no unique way to rewrite        as coefficients on mean zero,

stationary variables. For example, an alternative approach would be to write

p-i of these as coefficients on (AY.-p), i1,. . ,p-l.     However, this is

unimportant: the transformation is needed only to show the existence of such a

rewriting, and tests based on all such transformed regression models will be

asymptotically equivalent.

5. See Fuller (1976) and Sims (1978) for a similar conclusion in the estimation

of a univariate AR(p) process with a unit root. It may be useful to note that

if consumption has no drift or a time trend is present,     converges to its

limiting distribution at rate T and p and     are not asymptotically normal.

Similarly, fr in (3) converges to it limiting nonnormal distribution at rate T.
                                        13

 Conversely, if consumption has a drift and no time trend is present, 'b converges

 at rate T3"2 and p and p   are asymptotically normal. Incidentally, the fact that

   converges more rapidly than [8.} means that in asymptotic hypothesis tests

 that involve both    and [e,},   can be treated as known with certainty. This is

a useful fact in some contexts (see Sims, Stock and Watson (1986)), though not

in the present example.

6. For real, nondurables services and consumption, and the real S and P 500

stock price index, per capita, 1950:1-1984:4, the null hypothesis of no

cointegration is not rejected at even the 20 per cent level by either the Engle

and Granger (1987) augmented Dickey-Fuller test or the Stock and Watson (1986)

q(2,l) test.

7. When a time trend is included, we report results only for p0, since the

results using detrended data do not depend on the size of the drift.

8. The fact that     is less biased in Table 3A than in Table 1A is consistent

with the more rapid convergence of fr when the unit root in C is imposed. See

the discussion at the end of Section 2.

9. In particular, the asymptotic approximation might not work as well in a Monte

Carlo experiment in which savings C-Y were serially correlated.
