       This paper develops a theoretical model that relates changes in educational inequality
to the combined eﬀects of innovations that have increased the relative demand for more ed-
ucated labor and innovations that have increased ability premiums. We deÞne educational
inequality to be the ratio of the average wage or salary of workers with more years of edu-
cation to the average wage or salary of workers with fewer years of education.1 Educational
inequality comprises the relative earnings of eﬃciency units of more and less educated labor,
which we assume are complements in production, and the average abilities of more and less
educated workers, measured as the average number of eﬃciency units of more or less edu-
cated labor that a worker supplies. We deÞne ability premiums to be diﬀerences between
wages and salaries received by workers with the same years of education who are more or
less able.
       Under the assumption that in the long run individual decisions to become more edu-
cated equalize the lifetime earnings of more educated workers and comparable less educated
workers, our model yields two novel implications: First, given the existence of ability pre-
miums, an innovation in the relative demand for more educated labor increases educational
inequality in the short run, but, ceteris paribus, would induce a large enough increase in the
supply of more educated labor to decrease educational inequality in the long run. Second,
in the long run innovations that increase ability premiums, by causing the supply of more
educated workers to be smaller than otherwise, causes educational inequality to be larger
than otherwise.
       Looking at workers who have and have not attended college, Claudia Goldin and Lawrence
Katz (2001) found that in the United States educational inequality exhibited a generally U-
   1
       Some authors refer to educational inequality as “the return to education” or “the education premium”.
As deÞned by Peter Gottschalk (1997, page 29), “The college premium is captured by the coeﬃcient on the
dummy college variable in a standard regression explaining (the log of) weekly earnings; essentially, that
coeﬃcient shows how much more a college graduate earns than does a high school graduate holding other
factors, such as experience, constant.”



                                                      1
shaped pattern over the twentieth century. Educational inequality apparently decreased
from 1900 until 1950, but then increased from 1950 to the end of the century. Strikingly,
Goldin and Katz estimate that “the relative earnings of the more-educated [in 1999] are
similar to that which prevailed in the early twentieth century.”
       This U-shaped pattern, however, was not smooth. Goldin and Katz found that edu-
cational inequality decreased in “two giant steps”, one in the years before and after 1920
and the other during the 1940s. David Autor, Katz, and Alan Krueger (1998) found that
educational inequality increased from 1950 to 1970, but then decreased during the 1970s,
as a prelude to a large and widely discussed increase during the 1980s. Looking at more
recent data for workers who are college and high school graduates, Lawrence Mishel, Jared
Bernstein, and John Schmitt (2001) Þnd that educational inequality increased further over
the 1990s, although at a slower rate than in the 1980s.
       Ability premiums result from the advantage in production associated with being more
able, combined with factors that determine diﬀerences in ability, such as the innate character-
istics of individual workers and the quality of the educations that workers receive. Analyzing
American data from 1963 to 1989, Chinhui Juhn, Kevin Murphy, and Brooks Pierce (1993)
found that the residual inequality in wages or salaries that remains after accounting for
years of education and experience increased steadily from the late 1960s through the 1980s.
According to Mishel, Bernstein and Schmitt (2001) more recent data indicate that resid-
ual inequality peaked about 1995 and since then has declined. We can presume that these
changes in residual inequality reßect, either wholly or in part, changes in ability premiums.2
In addition, Richard Murnane, John Willett, and Frank Levy (1995) report that the depen-
dence of wages or salaries on a measure of mathematical skill, which we can take to be a
   2
       Some authors refer to residual inequality as “within-group inequality”. For simplicity, our theoretical
analysis abstracts from inequality associated with experience. Juhn, Murphy, and Pierce (1993) report that
their data also show an increase in the relative return to experience. Robert Topel (1997) indicates that this
increase occurred steadily from the late 1960s until the early 1980s.

proxy for ability, increased between the 1970s and the 1980s especially for college-educated
workers and also for less educated workers.3
       Our framework for analyzing changes in educational inequality allows for innovations
in three structural factors: One factor is the relative demand for more educated labor. In
modeling relative demand we focus on technological innovations that increase the relative
importance of more educated labor in production. We could, however, readily generalize the
analysis to take into account the eﬀects of capital accumulation, working through comple-
mentarity in production between physical capital and human capital, as well as innovations
that increase the relative demand for education-intensive products, such as might result
from the removal of barriers to international trade. These factors would be isomorphic to
technological innovations in increasing the relative demand for more educated labor.4
       The other structural factors that drive our analysis are advantages in production asso-
ciated with diﬀerences in ability and diﬀerences in the quality of education that underlie
diﬀerences in ability. Positive innovations in either of these factors directly cause increases
in ability premiums, and, as we shall see, in the long run also have an indirect eﬀect on
educational inequality.
       Innovations in any of the three structural factors that drive our analysis can be a con-
comitant of technological progress and economic growth, but are conceptually distinct from
   3
       Eric Gould, Omer Moav, and Bruce Weinberg (2000) point out that since the late 1960s inequality
among less educated workers has increased as much as inequality among more educated workers. This
observation suggests that an increased ability premium does not account completely for increased inequality
among less educated workers. Appealing to the distinction introduced by Steven Davis and John Haltiwanger
(1991) between inequality within plants and inequality among plants, Gould, Moav, and Weinberg associate
increased inequality among less educated workers with “increasing variance of technological implementation
across industries”.
   4
       Robert Baldwin and Glen Cain(1997) claim that technological innovations have been the main force
in increasing educational equality, but James Harrigan and Rita Balaban (1999) report that both capital
accumulation and a decrease in the price of traded goods also have contributed.



                                                    3
technological progress and economic growth. For example, in a standard production function
exhibiting constant returns to scale an increase in the relative importance of more educated
labor in production could be associated either with an increase or with a decrease in total
factor productivity. As another example, increases in diﬀerences in the quality of educa-
tion could result either from improvements in higher quality education or, as some people
think has been happening, deterioration in lower quality education. Also, although some
authors argue that the relative importance of more educated labor and/or the advantage
associated with high ability increase with the rate of technological progress,5                  we think
that distinguishing the eﬀects of the innovations that drive our analysis from the eﬀects of
technological progress provides a useful clariÞcation.
       Our analysis shows that the determination of educational inequality is complex. In the
short run, in which the number of more educated workers is given, an increase in the relative
demand for more educated labor causes an increase in educational inequality. In the long
run, however, this short-run increase in educational inequality causes a larger fraction of
workers to choose to become more educated. SpeciÞcally, our analysis implies that, given
that ability premiums exist, an increase in the relative demand for more educated labor
would induce a long-run increase in the relative supply of more educated labor that by itself
would be large enough more than to reverse the short-run increase in educational inequality.
       But, our analysis also implies that educational inequality is positively related to ability
premiums. Most interestingly, in our model the larger are ability premiums the smaller is the
fraction of workers that must choose to become more educated in order to equalize the lifetime
earnings of more educated workers and comparable less educated workers. Consequently, in
the long run innovations that cause increases in ability premiums also cause the relative
supply of more educated labor to be smaller than otherwise. As a result increases in ability
   5
       For various versions of this story, see, for example, Oded Galor and Daniel Tsiddon (1997), Francesco
Caselli (1999), Huw Lloyd-Ellis (1999), Philippe Aghion, Peter Howitt, and Giovanni Violante (1999), Galor
and Moav (2000), and Gould, Moav, and Weinberg (2000).

premiums in the long run causes educational inequality to be larger than otherwise. In
applying our theory to recent changes in educational inequality in the United States, we
suggest that increases in ability premiums have dampened the long-run response of the
relative supply of more educated workers that otherwise would reverse previous increases in
educational inequality.
   In related papers that focus on educational inequality, Daron Acemoglu (1998, 2000),
picking up on the observation that the relative number of more educated workers increased
unusually rapidly in the 1910s and 1920s and again in the 1970s, argues that these changes
in the pattern of supply were at least partly exogenous, and he accepts that their contempo-
raneous eﬀect was to decrease educational inequality. Acemoglu assumes, however, that the
larger number of more educated workers caused the development of more education-intensive
production technologies. He suggests that in subsequent decades this endogenous response
of technology more than reversed the initial decrease in educational inequality.
   The analysis in the present paper is complementary in that it treats the relative demand
for more educated labor as exogenous and the relative supply of more educated labor as
endogenous. Together Acemoglu’s analysis and the present analysis imply that either an ex-
ogenous increase in the relative number of more educated workers or an exogenous increase
in the relative demand for more educated labor could lead to an endogenous cycle in edu-
cational inequality. More importantly, the present paper adds an analysis of the combined
eﬀects on educational inequality of innovations that change the relative demand for more
educated labor and innovations that aﬀect ability premiums.

1. Educational Inequality in the Short Run
   Assume that more educated labor and less educated labor perform complementary func-
tions in the production process. SpeciÞcally, assume that the output per period of a repre-
sentative Þrm in a representative industry, denoted by Y, is a Cobb-Douglas function of




                                             5
inputs of more educated labor and less educated labor, as in

(1)                                    Y = Lσm L1−σ
                                                `   ,      σ ∈ (0, 1),

where Lm and L` denote the numbers of eﬃciency units of more educated labor and
less educated labor that the Þrm employs per period. This formulation implies that more
educated labor and less educated labor diﬀer qualitatively. The parameter σ measures the
relative importance of more educated labor in production.6
       Let L̃m and L̃` denote the quantities supplied per Þrm per period of eﬃciency units of
more educated labor and less educated labor, and let wm and w` represent the earnings
per period of an eﬃciency unit of more educated labor and less educated labor. Assume that
the Þrm takes the earnings of an eﬃciency unit of labor as given and demands quantities of
each type of labor such that the marginal product of an eﬃciency unit of labor equals the
earnings of an eﬃciency unit of labor. Calculating marginal products from equation (1), and
using the market-clearing conditions that L̃m equals Lm and L̃` equals L` , we Þnd that

                                            wm     σ    L̃`
(2)                                            =            .
                                            w`   1 − σ L̃m

Equation (2) shows that the relative earnings per period of eﬃciency units of more and
less educated labor depend negatively on the relative supply of more educated labor and
positively on the relative importance of more educated labor in production.
   6
       The Cobb-Douglas function in equation (1) is a special case of an aggregate production function that
exhibits constant elasticity of substitution between more educated labor and less educated labor, as in
Y = [ σ Lρm + (1 − σ) Lρ` ]1/ρ , ρ < 1, ρ 6= 0. Equation (1) obtains in the limit as the parameter ρ
goes to zero. If we were to replace equation (1) with the general CES function, then we would have to
replace subsequent equations that are derived using equation (1) with more complicated equations involving
ρ. These equations are given in the mathematical appendix. As we can see, as long as ρ is not a large
negative number, none of our qualitative conclusions, which we draw mainly from equations (11) and (13),
are changed. Autor, Katz, and Krueger (1998) cite various estimates of the elasticity of substitution between
workers who are or are not college educated, all of which imply that ρ is in the neighborhood of 1/3.


                                                      6
       A worker’s wage or salary equals the product of the number of eﬃciency units of labor
that he (or she) supplies per period and the earnings per period of an eﬃciency unit of his
type of labor. We assume that all more educated workers perform the same function in
the production process, and that all less educated workers perform the same complementary
function in the production process. But, the number of eﬃciency units of labor that a worker
supplies per period depends on his ability. In other words, diﬀerences in ability result in
quantitative diﬀerences among more educated workers and among less educated workers.
       For simplicity, we assume that a worker can have either high ability, or ordinary ability,
or low ability, and that a worker’s ability is readily discernable. We also assume that workers
with either high ability or ordinary ability are capable of becoming more educated, whereas
workers with low ability are not educable beyond a basic education, and that workers with
high ability can realize their advantage over workers with ordinary ability only by becoming
more educated. As we shall see, this last property implies that, if any workers with ordinary
ability choose to become more educated, then all workers with high ability choose to become
more educated.
       Abstracting from diﬀerences in experience, let α denote the number of eﬃciency units of
labor that a more educated worker who has high ability supplies per period, and let β denote
the number of eﬃciency units of labor that a more educated worker who has ordinary ability
supplies per period, where β < α. Accordingly, we have Wmh = αwm and Wmo = βwm ,
where Wmh denotes the wage or salary of a more educated worker with high ability, and
Wmo denotes the wage or salary of a more educated worker with ordinary ability. The ratio
Wmh/Wmo , which equals the ratio α/β, measures the ability premium for more educated
workers.7 These ratios reßect the advantage in production associated with being a more
   7
       Because in our model more educated workers have either high ability or ordinary ability and less educated
workers have either ordinary ability or low ability, ability premiums do not depend on the numbers of more
or less educated workers. If, alternatively, we were to model ability as being continuously distributed, then
an increase in the fraction of workers who choose to become more educated would imply an increase in the


                                                        7
educated worker with high ability rather than ordinary ability, combined with factors that
determine the diﬀerences among workers, such as their innate characteristics and the quality
of the educations that they receive.
      Again abstracting from diﬀerences in experience, let γ denote the number of eﬃciency
units of labor that a less educated worker who has ordinary ability supplies per period, and
let δ denote the number of eﬃciency units of labor that a less educated worker who has low
ability supplies per period, where δ < γ. Thus, we have W`o = γw` , and W`` = δw` , where
W`o denotes the wage or salary of a less educated worker with ordinary ability, and W``
denotes the wage or salary of a less educated worker with low ability. The ratio W`o /W`` ,
which equals the ratio γ/δ, measures the ability premium for less educated workers.
      Let Nmh denote the number of more educated workers who have high ability, and let
Nmo denote the number of more educated workers who have ordinary ability. Also, let N`o
denote the number of less educated workers who have ordinary ability, and let N`` denote
the number of less educated workers who have low ability. In the short run all of these
numbers are given, whereas in the long run some of them depend on the decisions of workers
to become more educated. Given α, β, γ, and δ, the relative supply of eﬃciency units
of more educated labor is related to the numbers of workers of each type according to

                                           L̃`    γN`o + δN``
(3)                                            =              .
                                          L̃m    αNmh + βNmo

      Let Wm denote the average wage or salary per period of more educated workers, and let
W` denote the average wage or salary per period of less educated workers. To calculate Wm
we divide the aggregate earnings per period of more educated workers, (αNmh + βNmo )wm ,
ratio of the wage or salary of the most able more educated worker to the wage or salary of the least able more
educated worker and an decrease in the ratio of the wage or salary of the most able less educated worker to
the wage or salary of the least able less educated worker. If ability premiums were deÞned as these ratios,
then ability premiums would depend on the identities of the least able more educated worker and the most
able less educated worker, hence, on the numbers of more or less educated workers.

by the number of more educated workers, Nmh + Nmo . To calculate W` we divide the
aggregate earnings per period of less educated workers, (γN`o + δN`` )w` , by the number of
less educated workers, N`o + N`` . Alternatively, we can characterize Wm as the product
of the earnings of an eﬃciency unit of more educated labor, wm , and the average ability of
more educated workers, (αNmh + βNmo )/(Nmh + Nmo ), and similarly for W` .8
      The ratio Wm /W` measures educational inequality. Calculating Wm and W` and
dividing we obtain

                               Wm   αNmh + βNmo N`o + N`` wm
(4)                               =                           .
                               W`    Nmh + Nmo γN`o + δN`` w`

Equation (4) shows how educational inequality comprises the relative earnings per period of
eﬃciency units of more and less educated labor and the average abilities of more and less
educated workers.
      Substituting equations (2) and (3), which determine the ratio wm /w` , into equation (4),
we obtain

                                      Wm     σ    N`o + N``
(5)                                      =                  .
                                      W`   1 − σ Nmh + Nmo

Equation (5) implies that educational inequality depends positively on the number of less
educated workers relative to the number of more educated workers. Topel (1997) reports that
the data for many countries are consistent with this implication. In addition, equation (5)
implies that, given the relative number of more educated workers, which is Þxed in the short
run, a technological innovation that increases the parameter σ, the relative importance of
more educated labor, increases educational inequality.9

      These calculations correspond to the standard way of calculating the average wage or salary of more
and less educated workers from panel data. For more detailed explanations, see Katz and Murphy (1992)
and Mishel, Bernstein, and Schmitt (2001).

      According to equation (5) educational inequality in the short run does not depend on α, β, γ, or
δ. Given the earnings per eﬃciency unit of more educated labor, an innovation that increases either α

2. Educational Inequality in the Long Run
       To analyze educational inequality in the long run, consider a constant population of
workers per Þrm, normalized to one, with constant fractions of workers that have high
ability, ordinary ability, and low ability. Let H, O, and L, respectively, denote these
fractions, where H + O + L = 1.
       Low ability can be either innate or a result of the quality of the basic education that a
worker receives. By assumption workers with low ability are not educable beyond a basic
education. In contrast, workers with either ordinary ability or high ability can choose to
become more educated. Ordinary ability or high ability can be either innate or a result of a
combination of the quality of the basic education that a worker receives and the quality of
the advanced education that is available to a worker.
       Let M denote the fraction of workers with ordinary ability that chooses to become more
educated. The fraction 1 − M remains less educated. For ability premiums to be observed
both for more educated workers and for less educated workers, both M and 1−M must be
positive. Hence, workers with ordinary ability must be indiﬀerent between becoming more
educated and remaining less educated.
       Remember that workers with high ability can realize their advantage over workers with
ordinary ability only by becoming more educated. Given this assumption, and assuming that
a worker chooses to become more educated or to remain less educated according to which
choice yields higher lifetime earnings for him,10 with workers with ordinary ability being
or β would increase the average wage or salary of a more educated worker. But, the increased supply of
eﬃciency units of more educated labor also would decrease the relative earnings per eﬃciency unit of more
educated labor. With a Cobb-Douglas production function these two eﬀects on educational inequality are
exactly oﬀsetting. With the general CES production function educational inequality in the short run would
be either positively or negatively related to both α and β as ρ is positive or negative. A similar analysis
applies to γ and δ. See the mathematical appendix.
  10
       This assumption abstracts from liquidity constraints on the ability to Þnance education. Galor and
Moav (2000) point out that, if technological progress relaxes liquidity constraints on the ability to Þnance


                                                    10
indiﬀerent between becoming more educated or not, all workers with high ability choose to
become more educated.
      We deÞne the long run to be a steady state in which M is the same in all age cohorts.
This deÞnition of the long run implies that σ has stabilized at a constant value. Realization
of the long run, which requires convergence to the steady state associated with a constant
value of σ, can require as much as enough time for an age cohort to pass completely through
a life cycle.
      Assume that each worker is active for T periods and that to become more educated a
worker must spend τ periods in school rather than in the work force, where τ < T. Thus,
in the long run Hτ /T young workers who have high ability and OM τ /T young workers
who have ordinary ability are in school. Accordingly, the number of workers of each type
who are in the work force is
                                        ∗
                                       Nmh = H(T − τ )/T,
                                        ∗
                                       Nmo = OM(T − τ )/T,

                                        ∗
                                       N`o = O(1 − M), and
                                       N``∗ = L,

where the ∗ denotes a value that obtains in the long run.
      Substituting equations (6) into equation (5) we obtain

                                Wm∗    σ O(1 − M ) + L T
(7)                               ∗
                                    =                      .
                                W`    1−σ  H + OM     T −τ

Equation (7) relates educational inequality in the long run to the fractions of the workers
who have high, ordinary, or low ability, the fraction of workers with ordinary ability that
chooses to become more educated, the fraction of his active life that a more educated worker
spends in the work force, and the relative importance of more educated labor in production.
education, then technological progress can be associated with a decrease in educational inequality. Gould,
Moav, and Weinberg (2000) introduce an additional precautionary motive for becoming more educated.



                                                   11
      The Þnal problem is to determine the fraction of workers with ordinary ability that
choose to become more educated. A critical element in our analysis is that in the long
run this fraction responds positively to short-run increases in the relative earnings of more
educated workers. Topel (1997) suggests that the facts are consistent with such a positive
response.
                                     ∗
      To analyze this response, let Emo denote the lifetime earnings of a more educated
                                                       ∗
worker with ordinary ability in the long run, and let E`o denote the lifetime earnings of a
less educated worker with ordinary ability in the long run. Assume that the cost of becoming
more educated includes both the earnings foregone while becoming more educated and an
out-of-pocket cost for tuition and other expenses. Let c, which for simplicity we assume to
be the same for more educated workers with high ability and with ordinary ability, denote
the ratio of the out-of-pocket cost of becoming more educated to the gross earnings of a
more educated worker. Thus, we have

                               ∗                      ∗
                              Emo = (1 − c) (T − τ ) Wmo and
(8)
                               ∗
                              E`o = T W`o∗ .

      As we have noted, for ability premiums to be observed both for more educated workers
and for less educated workers, workers with ordinary ability must be indiﬀerent between
becoming more educated and remaining less educated. This property of indiﬀerence implies
      ∗              ∗              ∗       ∗
that Emo must equal E`o . Equating Emo and E`o we Þnd that in the long run the
fraction of the workers with ordinary ability that chooses to become more educated is such
that the wage or salary of a more educated worker with ordinary ability relative to the wage
or salary of a less educated worker with ordinary ability satisÞes
                                 ∗      ∗

      According to equation (9) neither   Wmo /W`o∗   nor     ∗
                                                             wm /w`∗ depend on σ. Thus,
equation (9) has the following implication:

                                               12
       In response to an innovation that increases the relative importance of more edu-
       cated labor, in the long run an increase in the fraction of workers with ordinary
       ability that chooses to become more educated reverses the short-run increase in
       earnings per eﬃciency unit of more educated labor relative to earnings per eﬃ-
       ciency unit of less educated labor, and, hence, also reverses the short-run increase
       in the average wage or salary of a more educated worker with ordinary ability rel-
       ative to the average wage or salary of a less educated worker with ordinary ability.

   Earnings per eﬃciency unit of more educated labor and less educated labor also must
satisfy market-clearing conditions. Substituting equation (3) into equation (2), and using
equation (6), we Þnd that market clearing implies that

Solving equations (9) and (10) for M, we obtain

                                                    1−σ
We assume that the values of the parameters are such that M, as given by equation (11),
is a positive fraction. Equation (11) shows that M is not only positively related to σ, an
eﬀect that already was implicit in equation (9), but that M is also negatively related to
the ratios α/β and γ/δ.
   This important result obtains because ability premiums aﬀect the average wage or salary
of a more educated worker with ordinary ability relative to the average wage or salary of a
less educated worker with ordinary ability. SpeciÞcally, we can understand why M depends
                                                                                ∗
negatively on α/β as follows: (An analogous explanation applies to γ/δ.) Given Nmo
     ∗
and N`o , the larger is α the larger would be the relative supply of more educated labor
                                                                 ∗
and, hence, from equation (10), the smaller would be the ratio βwm /γw`∗ that satisÞes


                                                13
                                                 ∗
the market-clearing conditions. But, the ratio βwm /γw`∗ also must satisfy the equality
 ∗     ∗
E`o = Emo , and the implied equation (9), which does not involve α. Consequently, equation
                                              ∗                       ∗
(10) implies that, with a larger value of α, Nmo must be smaller and N`o must larger.
                         ∗                         ∗
Both a smaller value of Nmo and a larger value of N`o imply a smaller value of M.
                    ∗       ∗
       Also, given Nmo and N`o , the smaller is β the smaller is the relative supply of more
                            ∗                                     ∗
educated labor. But, given wm , the smaller is β the smaller is βwm . It is easy to see
that, with a Cobb-Douglas production function, the latter eﬀect dominates. Consequently,
                         ∗     ∗
to satisfy the equality E`o = Emo , the smaller is β again the smaller must be M.
       In addition, with a Cobb-Douglas production function, the eﬀects of α and 1/β on
M are equal, as are the eﬀects of γ and 1/δ.11 To see these results algebraically, observe
that, after multiplying by β/γ, equation (10) becomes
                             ∗
                            Wmo    σ  O(1 − M ) + (δ/γ)L   T
(12)                         ∗
                                =                             .
                            W`o   1−σ   (α/β)H + OM      T −τ

Equation (12) implies that, ceteris paribus, the larger is either α/β or γ/δ the smaller is
           ∗    ∗                                                           ∗     ∗
the ratio Wmo /W`o for any given value of M. Thus, to satisfy the equality E`o = Emo
and equation (9), the larger is either α/β or γ/δ the smaller must be M.
       In sum, equation (11) has the following implication:

         Whereas an innovation that increases the relative importance of more educated
         labor causes a larger fraction of the workers with ordinary ability to choose to
         become more educated, innovations that increase ability premiums cause a smaller
         fraction of workers with ordinary ability to choose to become more educated.

The net change in the fraction of workers that chooses to become more educated depends on
  11
       With the general CES production function M would be either more or less sensitive to 1/β than to
α as ρ is positive or negative. But, as long as ρ is not a large negative number, M still would be
                                                                                               ∗
negatively related to both α and 1/β. The same eﬀect would carry over to the relation between Wm /W`∗
and α and 1/β. Analogous results apply to γ/δ. See the mathematical appendix.

the net eﬀect of innovations that increases the relative importance of more educated labor
and innovations that increase ability premiums.12
       We turn now to educational inequality in the long run, Wm∗ /W`∗ . Substituting equation
(11) into equation (7) we obtain a solution for Wm∗ /W`∗ as a function of the exogenous
variables,

       Given that α is larger than β and that γ is larger than δ, equation (13) implies that
Wm∗ /W`∗ is smaller the larger is σ. In the limit as the ratios α/β and γ/δ approach one,
Wm∗ /W`∗ becomes independent of σ. Thus, equation (13) has the following implication:

         If and only if ability premiums exist, an innovation that increases educational
         inequality in the short run causes a decrease in educational inequality in the long
         run.

       We can explain this result as follows: As we have seen from equation (9), an increase
in σ in the long run causes suﬃciently more workers with ordinary ability to become more
educated to oﬀset the short-run eﬀect of σ on the relative earnings per eﬃciency unit
of more educated labor. The addition of more workers with ordinary ability to the total
  12
       Equation (11) also tells us that M does not depend on either T or τ. This result obtains because the
                                     ∗               ∗                     ∗    ∗
larger is T /(T − τ ) the larger is Emo relative to E`o for a given ratio Wmo /W`o , but also the smaller is
           ∗    ∗
the ratio Wmo /W`o that satisÞes market-clearing conditions. Given the assumed Cobb-Douglas production
                                                                                            ∗     ∗
function, these two eﬀects are oﬀsetting. Hence, the value of M that satisÞes the equality E`o = Emo
is independent of T /(T − τ ). With the general CES production function M would be either positively
or negatively related to T as ρ is positive or negative. If ρ is positive, then the conclusions about
                             ∗
the eﬀect of T /(T − τ ) on Wm /W`∗ that we draw from equation (13) would be reinforced. See Sebnem
Kalemli-Ozcan, Harl Ryder, and David Weil (2000) for a model in which the longer that a worker expects
to live the larger is the number of years of schooling that he chooses.


                                                     15
number of more educated workers also decreases the average number of eﬃciency units of
more educated labor that more educated workers supply and increases the average number
of eﬃciency units of less educated labor that less educated workers supply. The result is
      ∗
that wm /w`∗ is unchanged and that Wm∗ /W`∗ is decreased.
   Equation (13) also implies that Wm∗ /W`∗ is larger the larger are the ratios α/β and
γ/δ. Thus, equation (13) also has the following implication:

     Innovations that increase ability premiums cause educational inequality in the
     long run to be larger than it otherwise would be.

This result obtains because, as we have seen from equation (11), an increase in either α/β
or γ/δ causes a decrease in M.
   From equation (13) we also see that Wm∗ /W`∗ is larger the larger is either c or T /(T −τ ).
The eﬀect of c on educational inequality obtains because, from equation (11), the larger
the out-of-pocket cost the smaller is the fraction of the workers with ordinary ability that
chooses to become more educated. The eﬀect of T /(T −τ ) on educational inequality obtains
because, from equation (7), for any value of M, the smaller is the fraction of his active life
that a more educated worker spends in the work force the smaller is the relative supply of
more educated labor, and the larger is Wm∗ /W`∗ .

3. The Observed Pattern of Educational Inequality
   Over the past few centuries life expectancy at all ages has steadily increased. A con-
comitant of this steady increase in life expectancy has been a steady increase in the fraction
of his active life that a more educated worker can spend in the work force. In addition,
from the middle of the nineteenth century until at least the middle of the twentieth century
expansion of publicly-Þnanced higher education steadily decreased the relative out-of-pocket
cost of becoming more educated. In terms of our model, there has been a secular increase in
(T −τ )/T and a secular decrease in c. Equation (13) implies that the secular increase in the
relative supply of more educated labor resulting from both the secular increase in (T − τ )/T

                                              16
and the secular decrease in c tends to decrease educational inequality. Goldin and Katz
(2001) suggest that over the Þrst half of the twentieth century the increased relative supply
of more educated labor seems to have been the dominant inßuence on educational inequality,
despite technological innovations that increased the relative importance of more educated
labor in production.
       Now, suppose that during 1950s and 1960s and again during the 1980s and 1990s inno-
vations that increased the relative demand for more educated labor were large enough to
outweigh the eﬀect of continuing increases in the relative supply of more educated labor. In
our analysis we have modeled innovations that increased the relative demand for more edu-
cated labor by increases in σ. These innovations could account for the observed deviations
during these decades from the secular trend of decreasing educational inequality.13
       Our analysis implies, however, that increases in σ do not cause permanent increases
in educational inequality. On the contrary, our analysis implies that an induced long-run
increase in the relative supply of more educated labor more than reverses any short-run
increase in educational inequality caused by an increase in σ. Thus, our model predicts
that, to the extent that an increase in educational inequality reßects the short-run eﬀect of
an increase in σ, educational inequality will tend to return to its long-run downward trend.
We might speculate that the slowing of the rate of increase in educational inequality in the
1990s compared to the 1980s indicates the beginning of this process.
       But, our analysis also suggests that there is more to the story than increases in the relative
demand for more educated labor. As we have noted, the data tell us that ability premiums
increased steadily from the late 1960s until the mid 1990s. We suggested that these increases
in ability premiums resulted from a combination of increases in the advantage in production
associated with being more able and increased diﬀerences in the quality of education. In our
  13
       Autor, Katz, and Krueger (1998) speculate that a temporary slowing in the rate of increase in the
relative supply of more educated labor, resulting from exogenous demographic factors, also contributed to
the increases in educational inequality during the 1980s and 1990s.


                                                    17
model ability premiums aﬀect the average wage or salary of a more educated worker with
ordinary ability relative to the average wage or salary of a less educated worker with ordinary
ability. This eﬀect has the critical implication that increases in ability premiums cause a
smaller fraction of workers with ordinary ability to choose to become more educated. Hence,
in the long run increases in ability premiums cause educational inequality to be larger.
   This implication suggests an additional reason for the increase in educational inequality
during the 1980s and 1990s. More importantly, to the extent that increases in ability pre-
miums are contributing in the long run to educational inequality, the theory implies that,
although induced increases in the relative supply of more educated labor may moderate ed-
ucational inequality, the increases in educational inequality during the 1980s and 1990s are
unlikely to be soon reversed.

4. Summary
   This paper has analyzed a model in which in the short run an innovation that increases
the relative demand for more educated labor increases both the earnings of an eﬃciency
unit of more educated labor relative to the earnings of an eﬃciency unit of less educated
labor and the average wage or salary of a more educated worker relative to the average wage
or salary of a less educated worker. Thus, in the short run such an innovation increases
educational inequality.
   But, in the long run the relative supply of more educated labor is endogenous, and an
increase in the relative demand for more educated labor causes an increase in the fraction of
workers that chooses to become more educated. By itself, this educational response would
reverse the short-run increase in the relative earnings of an eﬃciency unit of more educated
labor and, if ability premiums exist, would more than reverse the short-run increase in
educational inequality.
   The model also allowed for the eﬀects of innovations that increase ability premiums. Most
interestingly, we found that such innovations cause a smaller fraction of workers to choose


                                              18
to become more educated than otherwise. As a result, in the long run increases in ability
premiums result in more educational inequality than otherwise. In applying our theory to
recent developments, we suggested that increases in ability premiums have dampened the
long-run response of the relative supply of more educated workers that otherwise would be
reversing previous increases in educational inequality.
