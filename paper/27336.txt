                                          ABSTRACT

The educational attainment of siblings is highly correlated. We test for a specific type of peer
effect between siblings in educational attainment: genetic nurture. Specifically, we test whether a
person's educational attainment is correlated with their sibling's polygenic score (PGS) for
educational attainment, controlling for their own PGS for educational attainment. Models
estimated using genetic data in the National Longitudinal Survey of Adolescent to Adult Health
(Add Health) yield strong evidence of such genetic nurture between siblings, and this result is
robust to alternative measures of educational attainment and different measures of polygenic
score.

I. Introduction

         Educational attainment is an important determinant of current and future

socioeconomic status (SES) (Bandura 2001; Hastings et al. 2013; Hanushcek and Woessman

2020; Ashby 2010; Wickrama 2013; Blau and Duncan 1967; Nielsen and Roos 2015), and

has also been described as the most important correlate of good health (Grossman and

Kaestner, 1997). Given the importance of educational attainment for SES and health, there is

great interest in factors that determine it, such as within-family influences (Black et al.,

2011).

         Many studies have noted a high correlation of educational attainment between

siblings, which varies by the age and country of the sample, and ranges from 0.4 to 0.6

(Lindahl, 2011; Raaum et al., 2006; Solon, 2000; Nicoletti and Rabe, 2013). Siblings might

influence each other's educational attainment in a number of ways (Griliches, 1979; Conley

et al., 2007; Yi, Heckman, et al. 2015). Youths might tutor their siblings or help them with

their homework. Youths may serve as role models or examples for their siblings (Benin and

Johnson 1984; Nicoletti and Rabe 2019). Youths may update their beliefs about their own

academic potential based on the achievements of their siblings (Altmejd et al., 2020). In

addition, parents might reallocate family resources based on each child's academic

performance (Griliches, 1979; Yi, Heckman et al., 2015).

         However, estimating peer effects is notoriously difficult (Manski, 1993, Manski,

2000; Angrist, 2014). One challenge is the "reflection problem" -- it is hard to distinguish

the effect of sibling A on sibling B from vice-versa. Another challenge is correlated

environments or shocks that are unobserved to the econometrician. In other contexts there is

also the challenge of self-selection, that people may choose peers similar to themselves,

                                                2
although this is not an issue when the peers in question are full siblings and thus they did not

self-select.

         There have been several creative studies with credible identification strategies to

address these challenges. Exploiting admissions thresholds for colleges, Altmejd et al. (2020)

find evidence that an older sibling's enrollment in a more competitive college increases the

probability that the younger sibling enrolls in college at all. Landersø et al. (2019) exploit

Danish school entry policies and estimate that a later school start for the focal child improves

the academic performance of older siblings. Karbownik and Ozek (2019) estimate regression

discontinuity models around school starting ages using data from a school district in Florida.

They find evidence of positive spillovers from older to younger siblings in lower-income

households -- younger siblings earned higher test scores if their older siblings were born

right after (as opposed to right before) the school-entry cutoff, and thus tend to be the old for

their grade. Interestingly, they find the opposite effect for higher-income households; there,

students perform worse if their older sibling is old for their grade. Joensen et al. (2018)

exploit an unexpected pilot scheme in Denmark which lowered the cost of advanced math

and science at high school. They estimate that students were 2-3 percentage points more

likely to take advanced math or science courses in high school if their older siblings did.

Qureshi (2017) found that younger siblings benefit if their older sibling had a more

experienced teacher; there is no such benefit from younger siblings having more experienced

teachers.

         In this study, we contribute to the literature on sibling effects in education and, more

broadly, to that on peer effects in education (see the review in Paloyo (2020)). Specifically,

we test for a particular form of sibling influence on education: genetic nurture, which is

defined as one individual's genes affecting another individual's outcomes (Wolf, Brodie,

                                                3
Cheverud, Moore, & Wade, 1998). Empirically, we test whether the focal person's

educational attainment is associated with their sibling's polygenic score (PGS) for

educational attainment, controlling for the focal person's own PGS for educational

attainment. A polygenic score (PGS) is an index of the number of alleles -- or specific forms

of a gene --that are associated with a specific trait; in this case, educational attainment. In the

absence of genetic nurture, the focal person's educational attainment should not be associated

with their sibling's PGS after controlling for the focal person's own PGS for that outcome.

        This empirical approach addresses the problems that confound empirical research on

peer effects. There is no issue of self-selection because the peers in question are full siblings

(people who have the same two biological parents) so they do not self-select into the peer

group. The reflection problem is addressed because we examine the effect of the PGS, which

is determined before birth (at conception).

        This paper also contributes to the literature that tests for genetic nurture. Kong et al.

(2018) test for genetic nurture from parents to children; specifically, they test whether

parental alleles that were not transmitted to (i.e., not inherited by) the child are still associated

with the child's outcomes. In their Icelandic sample, they find that parental alleles associated

with education that were not transmitted to the child have 29.9 percent effect of the alleles

that were transmitted to the child. Domingue et al. (2015) test for genetic nurture between

friends in the National Longitudinal Survey of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health); they

find that educational attainment is correlated with the average of friends' PGS for educational

attainment, even after controlling for own PGS. However, because friends are selected, this

correlation could be the result of assortative matching or omitted variable bias from similar

environments. In an earlier study (Cawley, Han, Kim, Norton, 2019), we found no evidence

of genetic nurture among siblings with respect to body mass index or obesity.

                                                 4
        Testing for genetic nurture is only possible if genes in fact influence the trait in

question. Numerous studies have confirmed that educational attainment has a strong genetic

component. A meta-analysis by Branigan, McCallum, and Freese (2013) estimates that the

heritability of educational attainment is roughly 40%. Of course, there is variation in these

estimates. The estimated heritability of educational achievement has declined over decades in

the United States (Nielsen and Roos 2015; Reardon 2011; Bailey and Dynarski 2011;

Branigan, McCallum, and Freese, 2013). A recent study using Add Health estimates that the

heritability of highest grade completed is roughly 23% (Nielsen and Roos 2015) in the US.

Studies using data from Denmark, Sweden, and Finland estimate that the heritability of

educational attainment is 35% to 50% (Bingley, Christensen, and Walker 2005; Isacsson

1999; Silventoinen et al. 2004). Okbay (2016) identifies 74 genome-wide significant loci

associated with the number of years of schooling, which are mostly found in genomic regions

regulating gene expression in fetal brain. The high explanatory power found in these studies

makes educational attainment well-suited for a test of genetic nurture.



II. Methods

       Our empirical test for genetic nurture in educational attainment exploits the natural

experiment of Mendelian randomization. The variation across full siblings in the set of genes

received at conception is the result of each separately drawing genes from the same two

parents. To appeal to a classic classroom example in statistics, full siblings each draw balls

(genes) from the same two urns (the set of genes of their parents). Although they draw from

the same urns, there will be random variation in the genes they draw, which is the concept of

Mendelian randomization.




                                                5
        We measure each individual's genetic endowment using the polygenic score (PGS)

for educational attainment, which reflects the combined additive influence of single-

nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with educational attainment across the entire

genome. The specific PGS we use is based on a Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS)

of educational attainment with a sample size of 1,131,881 (Okbay et al. 2018, Lee et al.

2018). This PGS represents the associations of more than 1,271 SNPs across entire genome

with educational attainment, and explains 11­13% of the variance in that outcome (Lee et al.

2018)

        The PGS has several advantages in this context. It has high explanatory power for a

single variable and has good out-of-sample reliability. Also, alleles are determined prior to

birth (at conception) and are largely immutable. Therefore, alleles are not affected by the

actions or characteristics of one's siblings. To clarify, gene expression can be affected by the

environment (this is the subject of the field of epigenetics), but generally not one's alleles,

and thus one's PGS is exogenously determined.

        We follow the nomenclature of previous studies (e.g., Cohen-Cole and Fletcher,

2008) and refer to the individual whose educational attainment may be affected as the ego,

and the individual who may be affecting them as the alter.

        Our basic reduced-form model regresses the ego i's educational attainment ( ) on the

alter's PGS for educational attainment ( ), the ego's own PGS for educational

attainment ( ), and various other ego-level exogenous explanatory variables  :

              = 0 + 1  + 2  + 3  + 4  +                                           (1)

        In our main results, the dependent variable Y is an indicator variable for whether the

respondent has earned a four-year college degree (BA/BS) or higher. In subsequent

robustness checks, we examine alternative measures of educational attainment: (i) years of

                                                6
education; (ii) at least high school completion; and (iii) at least graduate school completion.

Given the binary nature of the dependent variable and the goal of estimating an average

treatment effect, we estimate linear probability models.

        The PGS is equal to the number of risky alleles associated with lower educational

attainment, each weighted by its relative contribution to educational attainment. Therefore, a

higher PGS score is associated with lower educational attainment. Thus, the sign of 2 (i.e.

the coefficient on an individual's own PGS for educational attainment) should be negative.

        The test for genetic nurture is whether 1 , the coefficient on the alter's PGS for

educational attainment, equals zero. Because the model controls for the ego's own PGS for

educational attainment, we are testing whether the variance in genetic predisposition of the

alter that is uncorrelated with that of the ego is correlated with the ego's educational

attainment. If 1 <0, that represents evidence of genetic nurture; specifically, of a form that

generates a positive correlation in education among siblings (i.e., if the alter has more risky

alleles associated with a lower education, the lower the education for the ego as well). If

1 >0, that is consistent with genetic nurture that generates a negative correlation in education

among siblings (i.e., if the alter has more risky alleles associated with a lower education, the

higher the education for the ego). Based on the previous literature on sibling peer effects in

education, we predict that genetic nurture would create a positive correlation in educational

attainment between siblings; in other words, that 1 <0.

       To clarify, we do not examine whether specific SNPs inherited by the alter (but not

the ego) affect the ego's educational attainment, but instead whether the aggregate measured

genetic predisposition of the alter that is independent of that of the ego is correlated with the

ego's educational attainment.




                                                7
       The distribution of allele frequency is not random across race and ethnic groups (Price

et al., 2006; Conley et al., 2016). If one did not address this, it could cause omitted variable

bias. A standard approach in the literature is to control for the principal components of the

GWAS; by doing so one controls for ethnic and racial variation across the genome (Price et

al., 2006). We follow that approach; the regression model controls for 10 principal

components from the GWAS (denoted  in equation 1).

        In the regression model (1), the vector  includes the following set of control

variables: the respondent's age in years; sex; race (African-American, Hispanic, other, with

white as the omitted reference category); an indicator for whether the ego currently lives with

the parents; total household income (categorical variables for $20k-$40k; $40k-$50k; $50k-

$75k; $75k-$99; > $100k, with < $20k as the reference); parental educational attainment

(high school graduate, some college, college graduate, with less than high school as the

reference); the respondent's marital status (married, with not married as the reference); and

the respondent's employment status (work full time, part time, with unemployed or out-of-

labor force as the reference).

       One strength of the reduced-form approach is that it does not restrict the possible

mechanisms for genetic nurture. They may operate through role model effects, tutoring,

budget or time constraints of the parents, or any other mechanism. Moreover, our test may

pick up genetic nurture from other family members. Genetic nurture may operate through the

observed sibling (the alter), another sibling that we do not observe whose genes are correlated

with those of the alter, or the parents (from whom the alter drew genes). Any and all such

effects will be reflected in the reduced-form estimate and are of interest to us because they all

represent genetic nurture within families affecting educational attainment.




                                                8
       To avoid the selection bias that would result from studying a self-selected peer group,

our peer group of interest is full siblings (i.e., siblings with the same two biologic parents).

We exclude twins from our sample because they may exhibit different patterns of genetic

nurture than other types of siblings. Specifically, twins may actively seek to establish their

own identities, or more enthusiastically mimic each other. In addition, the model cannot be

estimated for monozygotic (i.e., identical) twins because for them ego and alter genes are

perfectly collinear, so there is no independent variation in the alter PGS controlling for ego

PGS.

       All individuals in the sample appear in two observations per wave of the data: one in

which they are the ego (i.e., their educational attainment is the dependent variable) and one in

which they are the alter (i.e., their PGS is the key independent variable). To account for the

correlation in error terms among siblings, we cluster the standard errors by family.



III. Data

        We examine data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult

Health (Add Health), which is a longitudinal study of a nationally representative sample of

adolescents in the U.S. The Add Health is an ideal data set to test for genetic nurture because

it contains genetic data on a large number of full siblings and has followed the sample for

enough years that nearly everyone will have completed their formal education.

        We use the most recent wave -- Wave IV -- which was conducted in 2008­2009

when the subjects were aged 25­34 years old because by that age most people will have

completed their formal education. We identify sibling pairs from the Wave I sibling pair data

and restrict our sample to full siblings (i.e., siblings with the same two biological parents)

who are not twins.

                                                 9
        Our main regressor of interest is the polygenic score (PGS) for educational

attainment. The PGS was constructed by the Social Science Genetic Association Consortium

(SSGAC) and is available for respondents who, during Wave IV, had saliva samples

collected by trained field interviewers for genetic testing. Roughly 96% consented to data

collection and 78% to archiving of their data. There are two types of polygenic scores

available based on different sets of summary statistics: (i) a score based on standard GWAS

(Genome Wide Association Study) summary statistics, which are the coefficient estimates

from univariate GWAS of educational attainment; and (ii) a score based on MTAG (Multi

Trait analysis of GWAS) summary statistics, which are obtained from a multivariate analysis.

The correlation between these two polygenic scores for education attainment is 0.95. Because

it is not a priori obvious which measure is preferred, we run all analyses twice, once with

each measure of PGS.

        There are 1,251 full sibling pairs in Wave I sibling data. Out of them 557 pairs are

matched with SSGAC PGS variable. We drop 241 sibling pairs because either of them has

missing or invalid PGS for education. When data on control variables (other than PGS) are

missing, the variable with the missing value is set to 0 and an indicator for missing values of

that variable is set to 1 and included in the model. The main sample has 632 observations for

316 sibling pairs.



IV. Results

A. Summary Statistics

        Table 1 presents the summary statistics for the sample. Our primary dependent

variable is whether the respondent has completed a four-year college degree; this is true for

34.2% of the sample. The mean educational attainment is just over 14 years. High school

                                              10
graduates constitute 92.1% of the sample, and 12.0% have a graduate school degree. The

PGS (based on MTAG) has a mean of 0.294 with a standard deviation of 0.16 and a

minimum value of -0.165 and maximum value of 0.669. The PGS (based on GWAS) has a

similar distribution with slightly smaller mean (0.202) and standard deviation (0.146). The

sample is overwhelmingly white (98%), with a slight majority female (52.2%) and mean age

of 28.5.

           The correlation in years of education between siblings is 0.44 and the correlation in

college completion is 0.42. The correlation between siblings in PGS based on MTAG is 0.52

and that in PGS based on GWAS is 0.49.



B. Results of Reduced-Form Regressions

           Table 2 contains the results of our reduced-form regressions in which the dependent

variable is an indicator variable for having a college degree or higher education. Columns 1

and 2 report results from models using the PGS based on MTAG, whereas column 3 and 4

report results from models using the PGS based on GWAS. For each measure of the PGS

(MTAG and GWAS), we estimate two models: with and without controlling for parental

educational attainment.

           Looking across the first row of Table 2, the ego's own PGS is consistently negatively

and significantly correlated with the probability that the ego has a college degree. This makes

sense; the PGS was constructed to predict the person's own educational attainment. The

negative sign is to be expected, given that the PGS is a count of alleles that predispose one to

lower educational attainment. Therefore, the higher the PGS, the lower the probability of a

college degree.




                                                 11
        Recall that our test of genetic nurture is whether the alter's PGS is correlated with

the ego's educational attainment, after controlling for the ego's PGS for educational

attainment. The results, shown in in the second row of Table 2, are consistent with genetic

nurture between siblings in educational attainment. Across all four models, the alter's PGS is

negatively and significantly correlated with the probability that the ego has a college degree.

These reduced-form results cannot tell us the mechanism for these effects, but indicate that

the effects do exist. The effects are also substantial in magnitude: the correlation of alter's

PGS with the ego's educational attainment is roughly one-third to one-half as large as the

correlation of that outcome with the ego's own PGS.

        To better explain the magnitudes of the coefficients, we describe the change in the

probability that the ego has a college degree, associated with a two-standard-deviation change

in alter's PGS. This corresponds to a change big enough to move the alter from the 50th

percentile of PGS to the 98th percentile of PGS. In models that control for parental education,

a two-standard deviation decrease in alter's PGS (associated with a better-educated alter) is

associated with a 7.8% increase in the probability that the ego has a college degree. That is

based on the PGS based on MTAG. If the PGS based on GWAS is used, the corresponding

change is 7.1%. For both measures of the PGS, the magnitude of the estimated genetic

nurture is substantial.

        The finding of genetic nurture is robust to alternative measures of PGS and of

including parental education. Adding a control for parental educational attainment should

reduce the coefficient on alter PGS because both are correlated with the unobserved parental

genes associated with education. It is debatable whether the model should include parental

education. An argument against including it is that the alter's genes were drawn from the

parents' genes, so controlling for parental education may be an over-control (Angrist and

                                                12
Pischke, 2009). On the other hand, controlling for parental education may give us a better

sense of whether the genetic nurture operates through the sibling or the parent. We find, in

columns 2 and 4 of Table 2, that controlling for parental education reduces the coefficient on

alter's PGS by about one-third (and reduces the magnitude of the coefficient on alter PGS

relative to that on ego's PGS from roughly 50% to roughly 35-40%), and reduces its

significance level from 1% to either 5% or 10%, but it remains statistically significant. This

suggests that some of the genetic nurture is operating through the sibling, as opposed to

exclusively through the parents.

        For additional robustness checks, we also re-estimated the models using different

dependent variables that represent alternate measures of educational attainment. These appear

in Table 3A (highest grade completed), 3B (binary variable for high school graduate), and 3C

(binary variable for graduate school completion). For both highest grade completed (Table

3A) and high school completion (Table 3B), the pattern is robust that alter's PGS is

significantly and negatively correlated with ego's educational attainment, even controlling for

ego's own PGS. This is true using the PGS based on MTAG or the PGS based on GWAS,

and whether or not one controls for parental education. In Table 3B, which concerns high

school completion, the coefficients on alter PGS are actually larger than those on ego PGS,

although the difference is not statistically significant.

        The pattern is slightly different for graduate school completion (Table 3C). For that

outcome, the alter's PGS predicts ego's educational attainment but only when parental

education is excluded from the model. When the model controls for parental education, the

coefficient on alter's PGS is smaller and not statistically significant. On the whole, however,

the pattern that alter's PGS is significantly negatively correlated with ego's educational

attainment is strongly robust for three measures of educational attainment (college

                                                 13
completion, high school completion, and years of schooling). For subsequent models, we

consistently use the dependent variable of college completion.

        Several past studies of sibling peer effects in education have found evidence of

heterogeneity (Paloyo, 2020), such as a greater peer effect from older to younger siblings

than vice-versa (e.g. Qureshi, 2017). It is possible that the degree of genetic nurture depends

on the age difference between the siblings and whether they are the same as opposed to

opposite sex. To test this, we add to the model controls for the age difference in years

between the siblings, and an indicator for whether the siblings are the same sex. We also add

interactions of the alter's PGS with those two variables. The results, shown in Table 4, are

somewhat mixed. The interaction term between age difference and alter PGS is positive and

statistically significant, but only when the model includes a control for parental education.

There is no detectable heterogeneity by whether the siblings are the same versus opposite sex;

the interaction between alter PGS and whether the siblings are the same sex is not statistically

significant in either case (i.e. whether or not one controls for parental education).

        We next test for heterogeneity in genetic nurture in a different way: by estimating our

models separately based on whether the ego is older or younger than the alter, whether the

ego is the same versus opposite sex as the alter, whether the ego is female or male, and

whether the ego's PGS for educational attainment is above or below average.

        The results are consistent with heterogeneity in genetic nurture. Table 5A indicates

that there is only detectable genetic nurture when the ego is younger (not older) than the alter.

Table 5B indicates that genetic nurture is only detectable when the siblings are of different

sex, not the same sex. Table 5D indicates that genetic nurture is only detectable when the ego

has a PGS that is below average (i.e. predisposed to greater education).




                                                14
        Models estimated separately by ego's sex (Table 5C) suggest that genetic nurture is

stronger for female than male egos, although it is only significant when parents' education is

not controlled for. All of the aforementioned results used the PGS based on MTAG; we also

estimated models using the PGS based on GWAS. Those estimates (shown in Tables 6A-6D)

are very similar, with the exception that there is stronger evidence that genetic nurture exists

only for female egos. Overall, the results suggest that genetic nurture is stronger when: the

ego is younger than the alter, the ego and the alter are of different sex, the ego has a below-

average PGS (implying higher education), and the ego is female.



V. Discussion

        We test for evidence of genetic nurture in educational attainment by regressing an

individual's educational attainment on both their own polygenic score (PGS) for educational

attainment, and that of their full sibling (the alter). We consistently find that the alter's PGS is

significantly correlated with the ego's educational attainment; this is robust to using various

measures of educational attainment and two different calculations of PGS, and whether or not

one controls for parental education.

        Moreover, the magnitude is large; a 2-standard-deviation decrease in alter PGS

(implying a predisposition to higher education in the alter) is associated with a 7.1% to 7.8%

increase in the probability that the ego has a college degree. Subgroup analyses suggest that

genetic nurture is stronger when the ego is younger than the alter, the ego and the alter are of

a different sex, and when the ego has a below-average PGS (implying higher education).

        These findings contribute to the literature on peer effects in education (e.g. Paloyo,

2020) and more specifically on family effects on education (Altmejd et al., 2020; Landersø et




                                                15
al., 2019; Karbownik and Ozek, 2019; Joensen et al., 2018; Qureshi, 2017). In particular, the

results of this paper add to the evidence of within-family spillovers in education.

        The following factors should be kept in mind when generalizing from these results.

We study genetic nurture for one type of peer: full siblings. This is an important strength,

because it is an exogenously determined peer group; any similarity cannot be due to self

selection. However, other peer groups may exhibit different degrees of genetic nurture.

        The fact that we find strong and consistent evidence of genetic nurture in education

does not mean that there is genetic nurture among full siblings in all outcomes. In fact, our

prior study (Cawley, Han, Kim, and Norton, 2019) using the same methods consistently

failed to detect any evidence of genetic nurture in body mass index (BMI) or waist

circumference. The non-significance of those results was not driven by imprecision; the point

estimates were quite small in magnitude. Thus, genetic nurture does not seem to be a general

rule among siblings for all heritable traits.

        Other limitations of the study include that the PGS explains a modest amount of

variance in educational attainment: 11­13% (Lee et al. 2018). As more powerful PGS

become available, further studies should be conducted. Another issue for generalizability is

that we examine siblings during the ages of 25 to 34 years; it is possible that genetic nurture

in education differs with age. Despite these limitations, this study provides important

evidence of genetic nurture -- and, more generally, family effects -- in educational

attainment.
