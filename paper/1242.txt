                   International Capital Mobility and the
                       Coordination of Monetary Rules


                                  ABSTRACT



     The paper develops a two—country model with flexible exchange rates and

perfect capital mobility, for evaluating the alternative macroeconomic policy

rules. Macroeconomic performance is measured in terms of fluctuations in

inflation and output. Expectations are rational, and prices are sticky; wage

setting is staggered over time. The countries are linked by aggregate spending

effects, relative price effects, and mark—up pricing arrangements. The model

is solved and analyzed through deterministic and stochastic simulation

techniques. The results suggest that international capital mobility is not

necessarily an impediment to efficient domestic macroeconomic performance.

Changes in the expected appreciation or a depreciation of the exchange rate

along with differentials between real interest rates in the two countries can

permit macroeconomic performance in one country to be relatively independent

of the policy rule chosen by the other country. The results depend on the

particular parameter values used in the model and suggest the need for further

econometric work to determine the size of these parameters.

     International capital mobility is frequently cited by economists as a

serious constraint on domestic monetary policy. Since highly mobile

capital forces a close linkage among interest rates in different countries,

it appears that any one country's interest rate cannot be manipulated

independently in order to achieve an efficient domestic macroeconomic

performance. Although the classic Mundell—Fleming models with flexible

exchange rates show that perfect capital mobility need not reduce the

effectiveness of monetary policy, recent research on exchange rate

overahootng, on the direct nflatonary effects of exchange rate

depreciation, and on the beggar—thy—neighbor contractionary repercussions

of domestic monetary expansion, seems to have reinforced the conventional

reasoning that macroeconomic goals are difficult to achieve under such

circumstances. In reviewing the literature, Tobin (1978) concluded that

capital mobility is such a hindrance to efficient macroeconomic

performance, that we should "throw some sand in the wheels of our

excessively efficient international money markets." By making the

international capital market less efficient, domestic macroeconomic

performance might become more efficient.

    The purpose of this paper is to develop a quantitative framework for

evaluating macroeconomic policy rules in a world of flexible exchange rates

and of perfect capital mobility. We begin by defining a criterion for

measuring macroeconomic performance. In early fixed—price demand oriented

models, the natural criterion for macroeconomic performance was real output

stability—policy would be effective or ineffective depending on whether or

not it could be used to stimulate, and thereby stabilize,
                                      2




real output. However, the resurgence of aggregate supply issues and

renewed emphasis on the simultaneous determination of prices and output

have created the need for a broader measure of macroeconomic performance,

one that includes both price and output stability. The static Phillips

curve policy tradeoff—in which macroeconomic performance can be measured

in terms of the level of inflation and output——could serve as such a

measure of macroeconomic efficiency, were it   not    for widely documented

shifts of this tradeoff. An alternative performance measure, in which

macroeconomic performance is measured in terms   of   fluctuations in inflation

and output, is used in this paper.1

    The framework for policy evaluation involves the application of this

performance measure to a two—country model in which financial capital is

perfectly mobile, exchange rates are flexible, and expectations are

rational. Aggregate supply is modelled using a staggered price setting

approach, in which there are recurrent supply or price shocks in each

country. We assuma that all the shocks to the model are due to such price

shocks, abstracting entirely from demand shocks. It is assumed that the

two countries are linked by aggregate spending spillovers, relative price

effects, and mark—up pricing arrangements. Each country is assumed to

follow a monetary policy rule that can be characterized by how strongly the

money supply responds to price shocks. The model is solved and analyzed

through deterministic and stochastic simulation techniques which enforce

the rational expectations restrictions. Using these techniques we evaluate

hcw the choice of a monetary policy rule in one country affects the

macroeconomic performance of the other country. This provides a way to
                                      3




assess the importance of capital mobility for macroeconomic

interdependence.

     The results of this evaluation suggest that international capital

mobility is not necessarily an impediment to efficient domestic

macroeconomic performance. For certain values of the parameters of our

model and f or certain monetary policy rules, changes in the expected

appreciation or depreciation of the exchange rate along with differentials

between real interest rates in the two countries can permit macroeconomic

performance in one country to be relatively independent of the policy rule

chosen by the other country. The results do not hold universally,

however. Interdependence can become stronger with alternative parameter or

policy configurations. Our results, therefore, suggest a need for

econometric work to determine the size of certain crucial parameters.

     The paper proceeds as follows. In Section I we review the aggregate

supply side of the model and show how policy can be evaluated in terms of

output and price variability using a rudimentary quantity theory model of

aggregate demand. In Section II we discuss a more detailed model of

aggregate demand which includes interest rate effects, and we examine

monetary policy in a closed economy version of this model. In order to

achieve macroeconomic efficiency in the closed economy-, policy-makers must

offset the effects of fluctuations in the expected inflation race.    It is

shown that a real interest rate rule automatically provides this offset.

Section III describes the full two—country model and examines the

interaction between the macroeconomic policies of each country.

I. AGGREGATE SUPPLY

        The aggregate supply side of the model is derived from staggered wage

setting assumptions as modified to incorporate the price linkages that are

important in open economy applications.2 The staggered wage setting

approach has the advantage of incorporating forward—looking (rational

expectations) behavior, while at the same time allowing for realIstic

short—run rigidities that lead to a tradeoff between output and price

stability. These rigidities also guarantee the effectiveness of monetary

policy in stabilizing real output, despite the existence of rational

expectations. Nevertheless, an increase in the rate of money growth is

neutral over the long run, increasing the rate of inflation but not output;

that    is, the long run Phillips curve is vertical.
        In general we assume that wages are set for ii periods and that 1/a of
all    workers have their wages determined at              the start of    each period. The

equations of the supply side         for   a single open economy (the home" economy

in this paper) can then be written:

                       e   + (l—e)   (e + p)
where    p is the log of the priâe level,              '   is the log of real GNP relative
to trend, w is the log of the average wage, xt is the log of the contract
wage set in period t to last three periods, e is the Log of the exchange
rate,    and         is a "supply' shock. The hats on          the    variables indicate
                                            5




expectations based on information available through period t.               The "stars"

identify variables external to the     home country         (the rest of the world).

For example, p in equation (3) is the average price level in the rest of

the world.

      Equation (1) is the wage determination equatioi; it reflects the

tendency for contract wages to be bid up if aggregate wages or prices are

expected to rise or if aggregate demand, a repesentd by y, is expected

to   rise.3 The distributed leads in quation (1)            extend for n periods

because contracts last n periods. The           weights   on the;e distributed leads

are equal because workers are asumed t            average   future price, wage and

demand conditions over the a future periods of the contract. Parameter

5 represents the relative importance of prices            versus   wages. In order to

preserve the long run   neutrality   of money growth, the weights on prices and

wages together must sum to one, as     is   indicated in the notation of equation

(1). Parameter I measures the sensitivity of wage             adjustment   to demand

pressures. Equation (2) defines the aggregate wage in terms of contract

wages negotiated in the current and previow periods.

      Equation (3) is the price equation; it states that prices are set as a

markup on wage costs, w, and the costs of                      inputs denominated in

domestic currency units, (e ÷   p).     The effects of exchange rates and

foreign prices on domestic price determination, as represented in (3), are

an important feature of the supply side of the model.              It is through this

channel that foreign price shocks or exchange rate depreciations (increases

in e) have inflationary consequences. An alternative way to model such

external price linkages would be to assume that wages are directly indexed
                                                h




to consumer prices that include the domestic price of imported goods. This
alternative would give somewhat different dynamic responses of wages and

prices to foreign price shocks or exchange rate changes. However, except

for the extreme case of perfect, instantaneous indexing, the effets on the

output—inflation tradeoff would be similar to those obtained in this paper.

     At this point it is useful to review briefly how this aggregate supply

framework (with the closed economy assumption I) can be joined with a

rudimentary treatment of aggregate demand to generate a macro policy

tradeoff between output and price stability.4 Consider the simple quantity

equation "   + Pt    tn
                          , where   tnt
                                          is   the log of the money supply, and

suppose that monetary policy is driven by the rule tu                    in which

a is the accommodation parameter. An aggregate demand relationship

between Pt and      can be derived by substituting the money supply rule into

the quantity equation, resulting in y —(1--a)                   Substituting this

aggregate demand relationship into (1), and substituting equations (2) and

(3) into (1), results in a two—sided difference equation in x, involving

both leads and lags. The leads from this equation can be eliminated to

generate a stochastic difference equation in x. The shock                 is the

disturbance in this relation. From (3), one can then obtain an

autoregressive moving average, ARNA (n—I, n-1), representation for p in

which the parameters depend on the policy parameter a and the structural

parameters 6 and r   .    The behavior of y follows directly from the

aggregate demand relation. The variances of both Pt and y can then be

calculated from these relationships. The properties of the variances are

such that the variance of Pt increases and the variance of               decreases
                                           7




as   ci   rises.   This traces out a tradeoff curve; a more accommodative policy

(higher.cz) results in more output stability and less price stability.

          The tnechanics of this tradeoff and its dependence on 0. can be

explained graphically. Figure 1 illustrates an aggregate supply curve

corresponding to the difference equation for            The supply curve shifts

with lagged movements in p and the shock term c. The           parameter

determines the slope of the aggregate demand curve, also shown in Figure

1. The slope of this curve determines how large the output effects of a

supply shock will be. A steep aggregate demand curve (ci near 1), results

in very small output fluctuations, given the size of supply shocks.

However, a close to I also causes a given shock to the aggregate supply

curve to persist for a long time. A flat aggregate demand curve, as

illustrated in Figure 2, increases output fluctuations while reducing price

fluctuations.


II. AGCR.ECATE ORMAND, INTEREST RATES, AND POLICY RULES

          A more explicit model of aggregate demand than the simple quantity

equation is necessary in order to capture the impact of capital mobility on

the output—price stability tradeoff. Our approach to the demand side is

conventional and corresponds closely with that of the Mundell—Fleming

models. We distinguish between the effects of the real and the nominal

interest rate. The real interest rate is assumed to affect expenditures on

investment and consumer durable goods, while the nominal interest rate is

assumed to affect the demand for money. Inflationary expectations, which

determine the differential between the real and the nominal rate of

interest,          are formed rationally. Je also allow nominal interest rates to

differ at home and abroad to allow for the expected rate of exchange rate

appreciation, a modification of the Mundell—Fleming model explored by

Dornbusch (1976) and others.

        The aggregate demand equations for the home country can be written as:


(4)                    = —dr       +   f(e   +          + gy

                               = —bi +ay

                   t     't         t -t
(6)                rt =it —rt

where          =         —
                                   is the rate of inflation, rt is the real interest
         iTt                  Pt
rate, i is the nominal interest rate, and                       is the log of the money

supply. Equation (4) is an "IS                   type   equation in which total demand

depends on the real interest rate, terms of trade and foreign demand

(parameters d, f, g, b, and a are positive). Inclusion of the terms of

trade in this way permits short run deviations from purchasing power

parity. The elasticity is positive because exports are stimulated and

imports are reduced by a higher relative price of foreign goods. Equation

(5) is the money demand equation and equation (6) defines the real rate of

interest. As our analysis will not consider demand side shocks, we have

omitted shift terms from these equations. All variables are measured as

proportional deviations from secular trend and therefore have a zero mean.

      In a simple quantity model of aggregate demand, the natural way to

write the monetary reaction function is in terms of the money supply, as

was done in the previous section. There are obvious alternatives to money

supply rules when interest rates play an explicit role in demand

determination. Interest rate rules in particular, either a nominal

interest rate rule:


(7)


or a real interest rate rule

are possible characterizations of monetary policy. Note that (7) and (8)

as well as the money supply rule (m        o. p) considered in the previous

section can be interpreted as "prices rule" such as those recently

discu8aed as alternatives to "inonetarist" policies. They state that the

interest rate should be increased whenever prices rise above target. In

this model the price target is normalized to zero.

       Before turning to the case of a two—country model with capital

mobility, it is useful to consider the analysis of a closed economy.5 To

close the economy we set fagO and L. A reduced form aggregate demand

curve (in p—y space) can be derived by substituting the interest rate and

money response rules into (4) arid (5). This results in the following

alternative aggregate demand equations:


(9)         y — —da +     dTt

 for the nominal interest rate rule, real interest rate rule, and money rule

                                     —1
 respectively, where h   (a +


     As is clear from these equations, the rules differ in two ways:

 first, in how they affect the slope of the aggregate demand curve, and

 second, in how they offset the effect of the expected inflation rate on

aggregate demand. Both the nominal interest rate rule and the money rule

result in aggregate demand equations in which the expected inflation rate

has an impact. This is a disadvantage of these rules since it results in

another source of instability. This instability could be avoided by using

a money supply rule in which the money supply responded to changes in the

expected inflation rate. In other words, the money supply rule could be

written as m    c Pt +          If   the response of the money supply to

expected inflation were exactly equal to the interest rate coefficient in

the money demand equation, that is, if B       —b, then the effect of a change

in the expected rate of inflation would be perfectly offset. The primary

advantage of the real interest rate rule is that it automatically offsets

the effects of shifts in expected inflation on aggregate demand.

     The dynamic response of the economy to supply shocks with and without

the inflation offset appears in Figures 3 and 4.      (The parameters used to

generate this and following simulations are reported in Table 1.) The

disturbance generating these responses is a one—period shock to the

contract wage equation. As a result of this shock, output declines and

prices increase over the short run before returning to their initial

levels. The mechanics of wage contracting lead to a maximum decline in

 real output during the third period following the disturbance, simultaneous

with the peak in the real interest rate. The inflation offset reduces the

magnitude of these output and interest rate effects, while increasing price

and nominal interest rate adjustments. In Figure 4, the behavior of the

money supply illustrates the intervention necessary in order to offset

changes in inflationary expectations.

     The importance of offsetting variations in the expected inflation rate

can be Illustrated graphically. Suppose that a monetarist policy iS

adopted with a   0 and without any attempt to offset expected inflation.

If a supply shock shifts the aggregate supply curve upward, as shown in

Figure 5, then output initially will fall and prices will rise. Because

the price effects take time to work through the system of staggered

contracts (in the diagram it is assumed that contracts last 3 periods,

a—3), there is a period of time in which the expected rate of inflation

rises. Without a policy offset to this increase, the aggregate demand

curve will shift to the right, partially reducing the contractionary effect

of the shock. Because the price level eventually returns to its previous

level (or trend path), there is subsequently a period of declining

inflationary expectations. This decline results in an increase in the real

rate of interest and causes the aggregate demand curve to shift back to the

left. The leftward shift in turn causes a large decline in output before

the economy returns to full employment. The responses of prices and output

are shown by the intersections of the various supply and demand diagrams in

Figure 5. The dynamic response patterns corresponding to those price—

Notes

     The home and foreign economies are equal in size and are symmetrically
parameterized. The alternative parameter values shown in parentheses are
used in the moderate interaction simulations of the two—country model
reported in Section III. Parameter d is the semi—elasticity of aggregate
demand with respect to the real rate of return. At the equilibrium level
of the real rate, the interest elasticity of aggregate demand is
approximately equal to —.06. Parameter b is the semi—elasticity of money
demand with respect to the nominal rate of return. At the equilibrium
level of this rate, the interest elasticity of aggregate demand equals
—.2. This is a rough average of the estimates reported by' Goldfeld (1973)
and Simpson, et al. (1979).

output intersections in Figure 5 are shown in Figure 3.   Note that there is

a large increase in the real rate of interest in period 3, the same period

in which the price level peaks and price declines are anticipated in future

periods. This rise in real interest rates causes output to fall sharply in

the same period as is shown in the diagram.6

    The pattern of nominal and real interest rate movements is much

different when there is an attempt to offset the effects of the expected

inflation rate on aggregate demand.    En Figure 6 we show the impact of the

same aggregate supply shock when the money stock is increased or decreased

to perfectly offset the effect of shifts in the expected inflation rate on

aggregate demand. In this simulation       —b. The dynamic response

patterns for this alternative policy rule are shown in Figure 4. Note the

smooth patterns of real interest rate movements compared with the wide

swings in Figure 3. For this smooth movement in real interest rates there

is a corresponding irregular pattern for nominal rates. Recall that the

aggregate supply shock first increases and subsequently decreases the

expected rate of inflation. If real interest rates are to move smoothly,

then there must be an increase in nominal rates in the first few periods

after a supply shock, followed by a fall in nominal rates below normal

before returning to their original level. The pattern of the money supply

is also irregular; The money supply is reduced below normal in the first

few periods and subsequently rises above normal.

     In terms of failing to offset the expected rate of inflation, nominal

interest rate targeting is always worse than money stock targeting. With

an interest rate target, the expected—inflation induced shifts in the IS
                                                    L7




curve translate into larger output fluctuations than with a money supply

target. Using the algebra of equations (9) and (11), this can be seen by

comparing the coefficients of expected inflation (d > hb).

     As one should expect in a situation without demand shocks, there are

certain equivalence relationships between the various types of price"

rules. The response of a money supply rule to prices will have exactly the

same effects as an interest rate rule (ignoring the problem of offsetting

expected inflation) if ci          (1—a) .               For example, a monetarist

rule (ci —   0) results in a positively responding interest rate rule with a
response coefficient equal to hid. An interest rate rule which is

completely non—responsive (ci          0)       ,    corresponds to a fully accommodative
money supply rule (ci       1)

     A nominal GNP rule could also be contemplated within this framework.

A nominal GNP rule takes the form                   +             where     is the response
                                                         Pt
of nominalGNP to price disturbances. Although nominal GNP rules are

usually discussed as if nominal GNP (or its growth rate) were unresponsive

to prices (ci —    0),   as we will see below this results in very nonaccommo—

dative policy. Clearly, a given nominal CNP rule is equivalent to a real
                                 a—i
interest rate rule if ci
                            r      d
                                            .
     The previous analysis indicates that real interest rate rules                   (or   more

generally, monetary rules that offset the effects of expected inflation on

aggregate demand) ought to work better than money stock or nominal interest

rate rules. In order to illustrate this, we have computed combinations in

output and price stability for the closed economy version of the model

using stochastic simulation techniques. These output—price stability

points are computed under the assumption that independent and identically

distributed random variables E   continually   shock equation (3). By

stochastically simulating the model for alternative values of the policy

rules, the average fluctuations of output and prices can be computed for

these different rules——measured in terms of the standard deviations of

output and prices.

     The results of this exercise are shown in Figure 7. The triangles

indicate output—price stability points corresponding to different monetary

policy rules. iUl of the points indicated by triangles correspond to

policies in which changes in the expected rate of inflation are offset.

Points on the upper left—hand segment of the diagram correspond to

accommodative policies, that is, policies in which the real interest rate

rises only slightly in response to price movements above normal. Points on

the lower right—hand segment of the diagram correspond to less

accommodative policies. For these points, real interest rates are

increased by a larger amount in response to price shocks. The scatter of

the points is due to the uncertainty associated with the stochastic

simulations, and could be eliminated by increasing the size of the

samples.8 Despite the scatter, a downward sloping tradeoff is evident.

Note that the fixed money supply rule and the interest rate rule are well

inside the scatter, supporting our earlier argument that such policies are

inefficient.

     Before proceeding with the two country analysis it is useful to

consider the dynamic response of the closed economy to a classic

macroeconomic policy shock——an unanticipated permanent increase in the

level of the money supply. The macroeconomic responses to a one percent

increase in money are shown in Figure 8. There is a positive real output

effect which diminishes exponentially to zero in the long run. Prices rise

slowly at first but eventually by the same amount as the increase in

money. Both the real and the nominal interest rate eventually decline, but

the decline in the nominal rate is comparatively small. The nominal

interest   rate returns to the initial level more quickly than the teal
rate. Throughout the simulation, the expected rate of inflation holds the
real interest rate below the nominal rate, making the impact of monetary
policy   on real interest rates larger than its impact on the nominal rate.

The plots in Figure 8 pertain to the closed economy parameter values listed

in Table 1. For other parameter values which we have experimented with (a

small y, for example), the nominal interest rate falls by a larger

amount. The decline in the real rate is always larger than the decline in

the nominal rate, however.


III. MONETARY POLICY IN A TWO-COuNTXY MODEL WITh CAPITAL MOBILITY

     We now consider the effects of capital mobility on macroeconomic

performance in a two—country flexible exchange rate world. We have already

summarized in equations (1) through (6) the basic elements of aggregate

supply and aggregate demand for a single open economy. (We now emphasize

that #l, and that neither f nor g equals zero.) To close the system we

need to add a corresponding model for the rest of the world, and to provide

a link between capital markets in the home country and the rest of the

by the assumption of perfect capital mobility——that is) perfect

substitutability between domestic and foreign interest earning assets plus

instantaneous adjustment of capital flows. Algebraically, the perfect

capital mobility assumption can be written as:

In other words, the domestic interest rate is equal to the rest of the

world interest rate plus the expected rate of depreciation of the home

currency.

The rest of the world equations (14) through (19), when combined with the

capital mobility equation (13) and home country equations (1) through (6),

form the complete model. How the model is solved depends on the exchange

rate regime. With flexible exchange rates) each country's money supply
                                     23




(rn and tn*) can be set either exogenously or by a policy rule. With fixed

exchange rates the money supply in only one country can be set, either

exogenously or by a policy rule, while the other country's money supply is

determined by the fixed exchange rate objective. No sterilization, in the

usual sense of the word, is possible with perfect capital mobility. We

will focus on flexible exchange rates in this paper.9

     The dynamic response of- the flexible exchange rate model to an

unanticipated permanent increase in the home country money supply is shown

in Figure 9. These responses are calculated using the parameter values in

Table I that suggest a low degree of interaction between the two

countries. The effects on prices and output in the home country are much

like those in the closed economy model shown in Figure 8. The increase in

prices is slightly more rapid and the effect on output is slightly

smaller. Both real and nominal interest rates decline, with the real

interest rate declining more than the nominal interest rate. The exchange

rate in the home country depreciates in the first period by the same

percentage as the increase in the home money supply. Hence, to a first

approximation, the exchange rate immediately jumps to its new long—run

equilibrium value. There is some overshooting, analogous to that studied

by Dornbusch (1976), but this is very small in comparison with the size of

the jump to the region of the new equilibrium rate. Despite perfect

capital mobility, monetary policy in the home economy of this two—country

model has many similarities with monetary policy in the closed economy

model. A decline in real interest rates temporarily stimulates output and

 leads to a rise in prices.   In addition, the exchange rate depreciates,

 raising the rea,l exchange rate to further stimulate demand and adding to

 the rise in the domestic price level.

     The impact of the increase in the home money supply on foreign output

 is positive but fairly small. This contrasts with the Mundell—Fleming

result that an expansionary monetary policy at home causes contraction in

demand in the rest of the world due to the appreciation of the exchange

rate.1° According to this model, the impact effects of monetary policy

have the same sign at home and abroad. The intuitive reason for this is

found in the price linkage or markup equations. The appreciation of the

exchange rate in the rest of the world tends to reduce the foreign price

level through its effect on import costs. This lower price level translates

into an increase in real money balances in the rest of the world, despite

the fixed nominal money supply. This increase in real money balances can

stimulate demand and can offset the negative effects of the appreciation,

unlike the Mundell—Fletning model where the fixed price level prevents the

real money stock from increasing.

     Given our focus on capital mobility, it is interesting to study the

impact of the home monetary expansion on foreign interest rates. Because

the exchange rate jumps almost exactly to the new long—run equilibrium

value and then stays with very little overshooting at that value, there is

only a very small expected appreciation of the home currency after the

first period. Hence, domestic and foreign nominal interest rates cannot

diverge from each other by much. But recall that the nominal interest rate

in the home country declined by only a small amount. Most of the
                                       26




stimulative effects of the monetary expansion came from the decline in real

interest rates as caused by the increase in the expected inflation rate.

Because monetary policy works in this model primarily by reducing the real

interest rate, and because it is nominaL rather than real interest rates

that are linked in this model by capital flows, it is possible for monetary

policy to have powerful domestic effects.

       We now go on to examine the output—price stability tradeoff and how

the world economy responds to supply shocks under alternative policy rules.

From the analysis of Section II it is clear that macroeconomic

inefficiencies will result from a monetary policy rule that does not offset

the impact of changes in the expected inflation rate on aggregate demand.

So that we can assess whether capital mobility impinges on macroeconomic

efficiency, we therefore focus on monetary rules for which such an

inflation offset automatically occurs. Equivalently, we limit our analysis

to real interest rate rules. Since there are now two countries, we need to

specify two such interest rate rules. Let these be:

country (as called for in (20)), but almost no change in the interest rate

in the rest of the world. Unlike the case of an unanticipated increase in

the money supply, the exchange rate is expected to change by significant

amounts following a supply shock. These expected movements in the exchange

rate permit a divergence between nominal interest rates in the two

countries.   tn the early periods of the simulation, the exchange rate

depreciates and is expected to depreciate, permitting the interest rate to

rise at home relative to abroad. This rise is necessary if real interest

rates are to rise. Later on, the exchange rate appreciates back to the

long run equilibrium value, and the nominal interest rate falls at home

relative to abroad (as it should, because by this time the decline in the

expected rate of inflation has its own negative effects on real interest

rates).

     These results suggest that the output—price performance that is

generated by such supply shocks might be surprisingly unaffected by policy

choice abroad despite perfect capital mobility. To test this proposition,

we stochastically simulate the two—country model under parameterizations of

equations (20) and (21) corresponding to different values of a and d'.

These calculations are made under the assumption that supply shocks

continually occur in both countries, that these shocks are unanticipated

and temporary, and that they are uncorrelated between the countries.     In

other words, C and C are serially and contemporaneously uncorrelated

random variables. Only a limited number of policy rule parameterizations

have been examined in.order to save on computation costs." Variances

calculated for a and a* equal to .2 and .6 are reported in Tables 2 and

3.   In Table 2, we have computed the variances of output and prices

assuming a low degree of direct interaction between the countries. In

Table 3, the interaction is moderate.12

     Tables 2 and 3 indicate in what sense there is relatively little

interaction between the policy rules in the two countries. For example, as

the home country moves from a relatively nonaccomxnodative interest rate

rule to a more accommodative interest rate rule, its output variability

declines and its price var1ablity Lncreases. But the effect of this move

on the other country's variability measure is very small. There Is some

indication that the rest of the world benefits from a more accommodative

policy at home (its performance improves), but the effect is second order.

     This relative independence is illustrated by Figure 11, in which the

standard deviations of output and prices under the moderate interaction

parameterization are plotted for a ranging from .05 (accommodative) to .90

(nonacconimodative). These stability pairs are plotted first under the

assumption that foreign policy is nonaccommodative (a    .6) and second

under the assumption that foreign policy is relatively accommodative

(a    .2). Figure 11 suggests a slight positive feedback between the

policy choices of these two nations. When the home nation is interested in

pursuing an accommodative domestic policy, it can achieve more efficient

macroeconomic performance if the foreign nation also adopts an

accommodative policy. And when domestic policymakers prefer a

nonaccommodative response rule, macroeconomic performance is enhanced if a

similar policy is chosen abroad. The results reported in Figure 11.

indicate, however, that the magnitude of this interaction is small.

 IV.   CONCLUDING REMARKS

       The purpose of this paper has been to develop and test a quantitative

 framework for evaluating macroeconomic performance in a world of perfect

 capital mobility. The framework is based on a simulation procedure for      a

 two—country rational expectations model with price (or supply) shocks.

       The simulation results suggest that if exchange rates are flexible,

capital mobility does not necessarily place constraints on domestic

macroeconomic performance and does not necessarily prevent individual

countries from choosing their own monetary rules without interfering with

other countries in significant ways. This conclusion is dependent on the

particular model structure and parameter configuration we chose to

investigate. Further research is required to determine the robustness     f
such results to widely different parameter and model configurations and to

obtain econometric estimates of the crucial parameters in different

countries. 13

         1See Taylor (1980), for example.

        2Bhandari (1982), Calvo (1983), Dornbusch (1982), Rehm (1982) and

 Taylor (1982) have previously used staggered wage—setting models of

 aggregate supply in an open—economy framework. See Mussa (1982) and

 Liederman (1982) for alternative 'sticky—price" approaches to aggregate

 supply in open economy models.

        3Because prices are partly influenced by foreign import prices, it is

important to include both wages and prices in the contract determination

equation in order to capture all the dynamic effects of a foreign price

disturbance.

        4mis paragraph and the next provide a very brief overview of the

results in Taylor (1980).

        5Rehm (1982) has provided an extensive set of deterministic

simulations to illustrate the dynamic properties of a closed economy model

like this one, and has also examined the case of a small open economy.

Calvo (1983) has studied a small, open economy model using continuous time

techniques.

        6The dynamic response patterns shown in Figure 3 were computed

numerically for the parameter values shown in Table I using the extended

path algorithm described in Fair and Taylor (1983). The patterns show the

response of the closed economy model to a one unit shock to       in the first

period of the simulations. This corresponds to a temporary unanticipated

contract wage shock, which we refer to simply as a "supply shock" in the

text.

      7The simulation results reported in the text take advantage of this

 correspondence among response rules. The interest rate and nominal GNP

 response rule simulations are generated using a money response rule

 parameterized to yield the appropriate aggregate demand relations.

      8The stochastic simulation results are based on single runs of 500

periods for each parameter configuration.    tn order to ensure stationarity,

the standard deviations are computed using the last 450 observations of

each of these runs.

     9This model could also be used to investigate the choice of exchange

rate regimes (fixed versus flexible) using the same stochastic simulation

approach. See Carlozzi (1982) for this type of application using a

different model.

     t0See Dornbusch (1980, p. 102) fcr a discussion of this.

     ]--Johnson (1982) has computed two—country output—inflation tradeoffs

of this type in a model without capital mobility arid with explicit exchange

rate management, and has explored alternative equilibrium concepts in the

choice of rules in the two countries.

     12The parameter values for the low and moderate interaction

simulations of the two—country model are reported in Table 1.

     t3Structural estimates can be obtained using the econometric

procedures employed by Rehm (1982) to estimate small open—economy models

for Germany and the U.S.
