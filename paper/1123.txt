                       Which Effective Tax Rate?




                                ABSTRACT


     In   estimating the effects of capital income taxation, different

studies measure different effective tax rates. This paper categorizes

effective tax rate estimates into six basic types, and discusses the

usefulness of each. For marginal effective tax rates, some studies esti-

mate the additional taxes associated with a marginal increase in the

inflation and interest rates, while others estimate the additional taxes

associated with a marginal increase in investment. Because there are

six basic types of rates, because of the different procedures that can

be used to estimate each type, and because of different assumptions about

the margin, care should be taken in the application and use of effective

tax rate estimates.

1. Introduction

    Economists have long been concerned with the incentive effects of

capital income taxation. Because taxes are imposed on different kinds of

income at different rates by different revenue authorities at the federal,

state, and local levels, the combined effects are unlikely to correspond in

a meaningful way to any single coherent plan for the maximization of social

welfare. Moreover, because of the complexities involving inflation, corporate

financial policy, separate personal and corporate tax systems, investment

tax credits, depreciation allowances, pension savings, insurance companies,

and the effects of uncertainty, an overall evaluation of capital income

taxation is necessarily a difficult and ambiguous exercise.

    The first type of task faced by studies of capital taxation is to measure

the effective size of the tax wedge between the pre—tax return to investment

and the post—tax return to the saver. This wedge, or effective tax rate, may

differ according to the asset, industry, or other characteristics of the

activity being taxed. A second kind of task is to use these different effec—

tive tax rates to measure efficiency losses associated with particular types

of capital misallocation. Following Arnold Harberger (1966), different studies

have measured efficiency effects of favoring noncorporate capital over corporate

capitalj' equipment over structures,- owner—occupied housing over rental

housing,--" present consumption over future consumption,-" and even debt—finance

over equity—finance)-" A couple of studies have looked at misallocations in

terms of who saves and who bears

     The purpose of this paper is to discuss the first type of task as it
relates to the second. In particular, there has been a wide variety of
                               —2—


methodologies as well as a wide variety of results in the estimation of

effective tax rates for the U.S. Different effective tax rate methodologies

may be designed and suited for different purposes. Often, however, when we

undertake only the first of the two tasks outlined above, we do not clearly

specify the purposes for which our effective tax rate estimates are best

suited. We refer to our estimates of "the effective tax rate," without

further defining the term. Other researchers are left to interpret these

effective tax rates and to err in their use.

     The next section of this paper looks at this wide variety of effective

tax rates and categorizes them into six basic types. In particular, we

distinguish between "average" effective tax rates and "marginal" effective

tax rates. These rates may include only "corporate" taxes (i.e. average

effective corporate tax rate, marginal effective corporate tax rate) or may

include the "total" of corporate, personal, and property taxes. Such distinc-

tions are important because of the prominence that different estimates have had

in U.S. policy discussions and in publications such as the Economic Report of

the President.

     Section 3 considers why, in practice, average effective tax rate esti-

mates are so different from marginal effective tax rate estimates. We suggest

eleven separate reasons for such differences in the U.S., but most of these

reasons apply to other countries as well.

     The situation is further complicated by the existence of different pro-

cedures to estimate each basic type of effective tax rate. Section 4 discusses

some of these choices and the appropriate use of each type of rate. In

particular, the marginal effective tax rate depends fundamentally on the

nature of the margin. One can calculate the additional tax associated with

a marginal increase in the nominal interest rate, the real interest rate,

or the amount of investment. A marginal increase to investment in different
                                 —3—

assets might be undertaken in proportion to existing capital stock, or in

proportion to gross investment, net investment, or other annual flows.

     Effective tax rates are used to measure the impact of taxes on incentives,

but the proper use of such rates requires a careful answer to the question:

incentives to do what? In particular, we argue that the extra tax associated

with a particular marginal investment is a useful measure for the incentive

to make that investment. The extra tax associated with an increase in the

nominal interest rate is a useful measure for some of the redistributive

effects of taxation, but it has no significance for the actions of investors.

     These arguments are applied to particular cases in Section 5, where we

look at the different assumptions and procedures used in two studies of U.S.

effective tax rates. In order to determine the importance of each difference,

we start with the data and procedures of one study and make one change at a

time until we have only the data and procedures of the other study. Section

6 provides concluding remarks.



2. A Suggested Taxonomy

    Table 1 distinguishes six types of effective tax rate. Each of these

types has been measured and used by different studies, and each has been

labelled as "the effective tax rate." The first two of these types are

"average" effective tax rates, generally defined by actual taxes paid as a

proportion of capital income. The basic approach in this case is to look at

the "cash flow," in one year, from users of capital to owners of capital and to

government. These actual taxes might refer to just "corporate" taxes paid, or

to the "total" of corporate, personal, and property taxes.

     These average effective tax rates are relatively easy to calculate, and

they are useful for measuring incomes of capital owners, revenues of government,

and the size of the public sector. These ratios capture, for existing

capital, the reduction in taxes associated with accelerated depreciation

and the investment tax credit. They also capture the addition to taxes

associated with inflation through historical cost depreciation, FIFO

inventory accounting, the taxation of nominal capital gains, and fixed

nominal income tax brackets. Since all investments are affected by these

phenomena, the tax on previous investment might be a reasonable approxima-

tion of the expected tax on a marginal investment. The next section finds

eleven reasons why it might not be a reasonable approximation, however. The

allocation of capital is determined by the incentive of each industry to

employ the marginal unit of capital. Nevertheless, average effective tax

rates have been used in many studies to measure distortions in capital

allocation [see, for example, Harberger (1966), Shoven (1976), Fullerton,

Shoven and Whalley (FSW, 1978, 1983), and Slemrod (1983)].

     The measurement of average effective tax rates is not unambiguous.

Fiekowsky (1977), for example, points out that a.) U.S. tax as a proportion

of corporate income could omit foreign taxes already paid, b.) profits mea-

sured for tax purposes invariably differ from profits measured for financial

reporting, c.) a correct measure of profits requires actual depreciation,

a cost which is difficult to establish by market transactions or by arbitrary

schedule, and d.) actual taxes in any year may not be related to profits

in that year, due to carryforwards of previous credits or losses, and carry—

backs of current credits or losses. These problems have encouraged researchers

to use measures of economic depreciation such as those in Coen (1980), and

to take the average over several years for taxes in the numerator and for

profits in the denominator [see Rosenberg (1969) and FSW (1978, 1983)].

     There are additional problems measuring the average effective total tax

rate. Property tax data often are not sufficiently disaggregated by asset or
                                 —5—
 industry. Moreover, it is impossible to specify separately the personal

 taxes that are paid on capital income, because of the graduated rate structure.

Most studies assume that labor income is received "first", in that each type

of capital income is multiplied by the appropriate marginal rate to get the

tax paid on it. Thus many studies mix aspects of average and marginal effec-

tive tax rates. Next, the denominator requires information on real corporate

profits, interest paid, rents paid, and any real capital gains.    Finally,
for an effective tax rate in the noncorporate sector, entrepreneurial income

must be divided into labor and capital components. When Harberger and FSW

attribute a normal wage to National Accounts' estimates of
                                                             proprietors' hours
worked in each industry, the estimated labor component often comes to more than

the proprietors' total observed income.

     More recent studies have employed a cost of capital approach based on

Hall and Jorgenson (1967) to estimate a marginal effective tax rate. In

this approach, the net cost of a hypothetical investment project is defined

as the purchase price minus the present value of tax savings from depreciation

allowances and investment tax credit. Compare this net cost to the present

value of after—tax returns on the asset. If the two were not equal, profit—

seeking investors would drive up the cost of the asset or drive down the

return until they become equal. Given an interest rate for the opportunity

cost of funds, this equilibrium equality can be used to-estimate the pre—tax

real rate of return that the asset would earn, net of depreciation. The

marginal effective corporate tax wedge is defined as this pre—tax return

minus the corporation's real post—tax return. Division by the pre-tax return

provides a tax—inclusive rate, or division by the post—tax return provides a

tax—exclusive rate.

     This model assumes perfect information, competition, and zero excess

profits.   It usually abstracts from all considerations of risk, and it

usually assumes that the firm has sufficient taxable profits to use all

credits and deductions at the earliest opportunity. These choices are not
                                 —6—

 automatic, however, and studies differ in these respects.-21

      Marginal effective tax rate measures can account for
                                                               expected inflation,
 statutory tax rates, credit rates, and depreciation allowances, and they can

 be designed to include corporate, personal, and property taxes in the analysis.

 AS a practical matter, however, the algebraic expressions cannot be designed

 to account for all complexities of the way in which actual taxes are affected

 by myriad provisions such as graduated rate schedules, locational
                                                                          choices,

depletion allowances, export subsidies and the like. (Such complexities are

included in the average effective tax rate measure, but they might not affect

taxes on the marginal investment.)

     Data requirements for each investment include its rate of investment

tax credit, depreciation lifetime and allowances, actual depreciation rate,

the statutory tax rate, the expected inflation rate, and the opportunity cost

of funds (the interest rate used for discounting). Credits and allowances

can be obtained from the tax law and are explained in any of the papers

listed under number 3 of Table 1. Economic depreciation rates are often

obtained from Hulten and Wykoff (1981a). This careful study finds that

economic depreciation can be approximated by exponential rates for 32 dif-

ferent assets. It satisfies our immediate data problem but does not, of course,

"solve" the ultimate problem of measuring depreciation.

     For the statutory tax rate, only very small firms never reach the top

corporate bracket. The typical marginal investment is thus taxed at the

top federal rate of 46 percent, and at an average state rate. King and

Fullerton (1983) average over fifty states to get a statutory rate of 6.55

percent. Accounting for deductibility of state taxes at the federal level,

the statutory rate is thus [.46 + .0655(1 —   .46)J,   or 49.5 percent.

    Finally, the inflation rate and interest rate are usually chosen by

assumption.!" Bradford and Fullerton (1981) point out three major problems
                                —7—

in these choices. First, the present value of delayed depreciation allowances

depends in a nonlinear fashion on the net interest rate used for discounting.

Since the required pre—tax return depends on this present value, the marginal

effective tax rate can be very sensitive to the assumed interest rate. That

paper provides an example where the effective tax rate varies between 40 and

100 percent for real net returns between zero and 6 percent.

      Secondly, credits and accelerated deductions might imply negative

effective taxes. As the subsidy increases in the numerator of the effective

tax rate formula, the required pre—tax return approaches zero in the denominator.

The subsidy can thus be an arbitrarily high fraction of the pre—tax return.

Moreover, if the subsidy is large enough that the required pre—tax return turns

negative, the negative tax in the numerator is divided by a negative pre—tax

return. The resulting positive number is difficult to interpret at best.

This problem can be solved by using only the numerator or "effective tax

wedge," interpreted as the percentage of asset value paid in tax each year.

      Thirdly, a comparison of different inflation rates requires an assumption

 about how inflation affects nominal interest. Two candidates are "Strict

 Fisher's Law," under which inflation adds point—for—point to the nominal

 interest rate, and "Modified Fisher's Law" under which inflation adds more

 than point—for—point. Empirical studies conflict on which law actually

 holds,-' but they may not be relevant. To measure the effects of inflation

 alone, we may wish to make the ceteris paribus assumption that all else

 is held equal. A fixed real after—tax return logically implies Modified
             10/
 Fisher s Law.—
      Very few studies have extended this marginal effective tax rate method-

ology to include personal taxes. In fact, it may not be necessary to do so,

depending on the purpose of the study. As discussed in later sections, if

one is interested in the allocation of capital among competing uses, one can

assume that the firm makes decisions based on the interest rate it must pay
                                —8


in a general bond market. If the market is large and risk is ignored, this

opportunity cost does not depend on the particular characteristics of those

who buy the bonds. In other words, the cost of capital does not depend on

personal taxes. With a noncorporate sector, the cost of capital might

depend on property taxes and the entrepreneur's personal tax rate, however,

and some studies have included these costs.

     Many other phenomena do depend on personal taxes, including the alloca-

tion of risk taking among households, the allocation of savings among house-

holds, and the allocation of one household's savings among vehicles. Moreover,

if one is interested in the effect of taxes on the intertemporal allocation of

resources, one must include all taxes on income from investments. King and

Fullerton (1983) have measured marginal effective total tax rates for three

different assets, three different industries, three different sources of

finance, and three ownership categories.



3. Average vs. Marginal Rates

     The distinction between average effective tax rates and marginal effective

tax rates would be inconsequential if tax systems were proportional or if the

two measures turned out to have similar results. Unfortunately this is not

the case.   Fullerton and Henderson (1983) measure average effective corporate

tax rates for each of 18 U.s. industries and
                                               marginal effective corporate tax
rates for the same 18 industries, but there is almost no resemblance between

the two sets of rates. Both sets of effective tax rates were then recalculated

using different years, different data sources, different assumptions about

expected inflation, and different expected returns. Each vector of 18 average

effective tax rates was paired with each vector of marginal effective tax rates.

The correlation coefficients varied around zero but never exceeded 0.3.
                               —9—

    There are eleven possible explanations for the differences. The

relative importance of each explanation is likely to differ according to the

asset, industry, or other breakdown used for measuring different effective

tax rates. Also, most of these differences apply to effective total tax

rates as well as to effective corporate tax rates.

     1. The corporate tax system has four brackets of $25,000 where income

is taxed at low rates; only income above $100,000 is taxed at the 46 percent

top marginal rate. For this reason, the effective tax rate on the marginal

investment is likely to be higher than the effective tax rate on the average

investment.

     2. The marginal effective tax rate gives the net percentage of the

expected return that is expected to be paid in tax. Any unexpected income

from the investment, because it does not affect investment tax credits or

depreciation allowances, will be taxed at the corporation's statutory rate.

If the marginal effective corporate tax rate is less than the statutory tax

rate, and if there exist unusal profits (losses) due to business cycles or

structural changes in demand, then the actual taxes paid turn out to be

greater than (less than) the expected taxes.

     3. If profits are so low that not all deductions and credits can be

used, we have an additional reason for the two measures of effective tax rates

to differ. This time, for unprofitable firms, the marginal effective tax

rate is altered, It becomes very important to specify the nature of the

margin under consideration, because marginal investments might be undertaken

by profitable or unprofitable firms in an industry. Average effective tax

rates are also affected by the number of unprofitable firms that are not

paying taxes, and even in a profitable year they are affected by the carry-

over of losses from previous years.
                                — 10 —



     4.   Even if all firms are profitable, such thatall credits and deduc-

tions can be used, many firms do not minimize their taxes in this way. Some

firms use depreciation lifetimes that are longer than the minimum allowed

by law, some firms pay additional taxes by using FIFO rather than LIFO

inventory accounting, and some firms increase the total tax on capital income

by simultaneously paying dividends and issuing new shares. Finns also differ

in other aspects such as the charitable deductions that they take. These

choices affect actual taxes paid by firms without necessarily affecting the

distorting tax wedge that must be paid on the expected income from a marginal

investment.

     5.    Any pure profits, though not unexpected, are taxed at the statutory

rate without affecting credits or deductions. These pure profits may be

attributed to the ownership of an "asset" such as an idea, a valuable location,

or other source of monopoly power. If the statutory rate exceeds the marginal

effective rate (on tangible investments), then these pure profits tend to push

the average effective tax rate above the marginal effective tax rate.

     6. Changes in tax law affect deductions or credits for new investments

without changing the deductions remaining on previous investments. The

Accelerated Cost Recovery System implies reduced marginal effective tax

rates on new investments, while higher effective taxes are still being paid

on investments made under the Asset Depreciation Range system or even before.

     7. Even without changes in tax law, the growth rate for capital affects

actual taxes when only new investment qualifies for credits or when deprecia-

tion allowances are accelerated. An increase in the average age of existing

capital, through slower growth, tends to increase the average effective tax

rate because less capital is getting credits and deductions. A decrease in

the average age, through faster growth, tends to decrease the average effective
                                  11 —




tax rate. Neither of these changes in the growth rate affects the expected

tax on a single hypothetical marginal investment.

     8. The marginal effective tax rate depends on expected inflation,

while the average effective tax rate depends on actual or past inflation.

The two tax rates can differ anytime that actual and expected inflation

rates differ. A temporary and unanticipated increase in the rate of infla-

tion, for example, reduces the real value of depreciation allowances on past

investments and thus increases the real taxes paid on them. If it is not

expected to continue, however, it does not affect the marginal effective

tax rate (and therefore has nothing to do with investment incentives).

     9. Because interest is deductible at the corporate level, the effective

tax on a project financed by debt can be less than that on a project fin-

anced by equity. If the marginal investment were financed by a ratio of

debt to equity that is anything other than the firm's average ratio of debt

to equity, then the marginal effective tax rate could again differ from the

average effective tax rate. More on this later.

     10. Equity may be "trapped" in the corporation, as argued by King

(1977), Auerbach (1979), and Bradford (1981). If the market values of

shares already reflect the fact that taxes must be paid when profits are

distributed, then dividend taxes do not distort any behavior. These lump—

sum taxes could raise the average effective total tax rate without affecting

marginal incentives.

     11. Finally, the analysis could be expanded to include consideration

of risk and the taxation of the risk premium. If losses on the marginal

investment can be used to offset profits on other investments, then the tax

can be viewed as risk sharing by the government. The firm gives up a frac-

tion of the return, but gives up the same fraction of the risk. Taxes on

the risk—free part of the investment's return can lower the marginal incentives
                                  — 12 —



to   invest, but taxes on the risk premium exactly reflect the value of the

risk forgone. Because the latter tax payments reflect no marginal investment

disincentives, the average effective tax rate can exceed the marginal effec-

tive tax rate for this reason as well [see Fullerton and Gordon (1983)1.

       In light of all these reasons for the two effective tax rate measures

to differ, it may be surprising that the correlation coefficient was ever

as high as 0.3! Yet the differences are very important for policy purposes.

Some of these phenomena affect actual taxes, income flows, and government

revenues, while others affect marginal behavior, new investment, growth,

and factor allocations.

      Figure 1, obtained from Hulten and O'Neill (1982), very neatly summarizes

the overall effect of these differences from 1952 to 1980. The dotted line

shows the top bracket statutory corporate tax rate, the dashed line shows their

average effective corporate tax rate, and the solid line shows their marginal

effective corporate tax rate. This marginal rate averages over equipment

and structures, a procedure to which we will return in the next section.

For now, however, we merely note that the eleven reasons discussed in this sec-

tion are enough to create substantial deviations between average and marginal

effective tax rates over time. The lines cross frequently, indicating no

general presumption about which rate is higher.



4. Uses for Effective Tax Rates

      Previous sections argue that average effective tax rates are appropriate

for measuring cash flows, while marginal effective tax rates are designed to

capture incentives to use new capital. It is difficult for marginal rates to

capture many legal complexities, however, so average rates have often been

used as estimates of the taxes to be paid on marginal investments.

    The choice between effective corporate tax rates and effective total

tax rates is much clearer. Assuming that all corporations operate in the

same risk—free bond market, they all face the same opportunity cost of

funds. The personal characteristics of the investors are unimportant, and

differing effective corporate tax rates can be used to measure the efficiency

costs associated with resource misallocations. Average effective corporate

tax rates can be measured for different industries and used to study inter—

industry distortions. Alternatively, marginal effective corporate tax rates

can be measured for different assets and used to study inter—asset distortions

[see Gravelle (1982)]. In fact, the required pre—tax returns can be used

directly to measure inter—asset distortions. There is no need to subtract

the expected real after—tax return and calculate an effective tax rate)11'

     Measuring the cost of inter—asset distortions also requires information

on how firms substitute among types of equipment, among structures, or among

those and other assets. In the absence of elasticity estimates, many have

assumed that firms can substitute among all assets with a unitary elasticity

in a Cobb—Douglas production function. This is a powerful assumption since,

 for example, the extreme alternative of fixed coefficient technology would

 imply no misallocations among assets due to differential taxation.   Even

 the unitary elasticities are ambiguous. On the one hand, firms may use

 one percent more of the asset in response to a one percent fall in its

 rental price (cost of capital gross of depreciation). On the other hand,

 firms may use one percent more of the asset in response to a one percent

 fall in its required return (net of depreciation). With non—zero and differ-

 ing depreciation rates, the two assumptions about investment behavior are

 quite different. A given tax cut can imply that the required rate of return

 falls more for equipment than for structures while the gross rental price

 falls more for structures than for equipment)'
                               — 14 —




     Since actual income and taxes are not attributed to individual assets,
average effective tax rates are not available on that breakdown. Similarly,

marginal effective tax rates are not immediately available on an industry

breakdown. With information on the use of each asset by each industry, how-

ever, marginal effective tax rates for different assets can be converted into

rates for different industries. Each industry's tax rate is then a weighted

average of the different assets' tax rates. Though asset usages clearly

differ by industry, the weighted—average industry tax rates exhibit far less

variation than the asset tax rates. In any case, these rates have been used

to study inter—industry distortions [see Fullerton and Henderson (1983)1.

     More problems arise when the marginal effective corporate tax rates for

different assets are averaged for the whole economy. First, such averages

typically involve equipment and structures, ignoring taxes on the income from

investments in land, inventories, and intangible assets such as goodwill

through advertising or knowledge through R&D. Second, such averages no longer

provide information on inter—asset or inter—industry distortions. Third, they omit

personal taxes and property taxes and thus provide no information on intertemporal

distortions. Figure 1, for example, shows a falling marginal effective corporate

tax rate from 1970 —1980, averaged over equipment and structures. We cannot

 conclude that there has been a reduction in overall tax disincentives, because

 such a rate provides no information on changes in personal taxes, changes in

 state and local property taxes, or changes in corporate taxes on assets

 other than equipment and structures. In fact, it is difficult to think of a

 useful question for which this averaged marginal effective corporate tax rate

 provides an appropriate answer.

      Intertemporal distortions require an estimate of the marginal effective

 total tax rate. (Average effective total tax rates have been used for this
                               — 15 —




purpose, but only as a way to estimate the likely total tax on a marginal
investment.) Generally, such rates pose a number of tricky problems.

     First, it is not clear that the property tax represents an investment

disincentive. The Tiebout Hypothesis suggests that local jurisdictions

compete for residents and for firms by offering a package of local public

services. With sufficient mobility among a sufficient number of jurisdic—

tions, no one town would be able to charge more for these services than

they were worth to the firm.---' Property taxes are thus tied directly to

benefit levels and represent only voluntary payments for intermediate input

of services. Even if this mechanism does not operate, however, property tax

abatements for new entrants suggest that the marginal effective tax rate

could be less than the average effective tax rate.

     Secondly, the effective total tax rate includes the entire wedge between

the pre—tax return and the post—tax return of the ultimate owner who provides

the finance. If we are interested in U.S. savings incentives, however, we

might not want to include any inferences about the behavior of foreign

investors or government. The rate might be designed to measure all taxes

on the typical U.S. investment, or all taxes on the typical U.S. investor.

These are not the same, and again the proper definition of the effective

tax rate depends on the purpose to which it will be put.

     Thirdly, the difference between the pre—tax return and the post—tax

return does not include all of the disincentives associated with taxation.

For tax—exempt bonds, since no taxes are actually paid, the pre—tax return

equals the post—tax return and the "effective tax rate" is zero. Yet

this tax—free return is less than it would have been in the absence of

taxes on taxable bonds. An implicit tax is missed by the usual measure of

effective tax rate [see Galper and Toder (1982) and page 158 of U.S. Treasury

(1977)].
                               -16-


     Fourthly, it is difficult to aggregate the effective total tax rates

on different kinds of investment. Suppose, for example, that the corporation

finances one marginal investment project by selling a bond to an individual

retirement account (IRA). The corporation receives an investment tax credit

and accelerated depreciation allowances. The entire return to the asset

is then deducted by the firm, since it is paid out in interest. Ultimately,

the individual is not taxed on his Interest receipts. The result is a

substantially negative total tax rate. For a different investment, if it

is financed by selling new shares directly to the household, and if the

return is paid out in taxable dividends, the total tax is substantially

positive. King and Fullerton (1983) aggregate these different investments

together, weighting by the airunts of actual capital that are financed in

each way. There is no assurance, however, that marginal investments would

be financed in the same way as past investments. For effective corporate

tax rates, as mentioned above, many studies assume that firms minimize taxes

by using LIFO inventory accounting, minimum lifetimes, and the earliest

possible depreciation deductions. The logical extention of this assumption

to total tax rates .iould imply that firms always use debt as the cheapest

source of finance and that individuals always save through tax—free vehicles.

The resulting negative effective total tax rate can always apply to the

marginal investment, as long as there are any taxable profits, including

a.) the normal return to old investments upon which taxes were deferred,

b.) normal returns to taxed investments like land and inventories, c.) unex-

pected returns to some new investments, d.) any pure profits, or e.) safe

harbor leasing.

     In using this kind of analysis, we are forced to make difficult judgments.

As mentioned above, even the simple cost of capital formula implies a judgment

that opportunities for profits are exhausted. We might simultaneously decide,
                                 — 17 —




for   some reason, that opportunities for investments in tax—free accounts

are not exhausted. There are a number of equilibria that might be consistent

with investor arbitrage, and we must choose among them. This is particularly

difficult in a model with perfect certainty. On the one hand, when the

firm undertakes a marginal investment, it always has the option of reducing

its debt instead. In equilibrium, no matter how the investment is financed,

its net of tax return should be equal to that of retiring a unit of debt.

Thus the net of tax interest rate represents the opportunity cost of funds

and is always used for discounting the investment's return.

      Arbitrage at the firm level implies that the firm's cost of funds is

independent of the source of finance. With differences in personal taxes

on interest, dividends, and capital gains, however, the individual's net

of tax return is not independent of the source of finance. An alternative

assumption is that arbitrage at the individual level insures equality in

the net returns to an individual. In this case, since dividends are highly

taxed at the personal level, new equity represents an expensive source of

finance. Any equity financed investment must provide a high enough pre—tax

return that the dividend recipient can pay these higher taxes and still earn

the same net return that he could have earned in the bond market. In this

case, the cost of funds to the firm is not independent of the source of

finance.

       A reconciliation can be accomplished in either of two ways. First, con-

straints might prevent the kind of. arbitrage discussed at either level. Firms

may face limits on their borrowing and/or requirements on their dividends.

Individuals may face limits on their borrowing and/or ceilings on their tax—

free accounts. Financial markets may be completely specialized such that only

low—brackQt investors hold bonds and only high—bracket investors hold equity.

No single investor wtuld then have to earn the same net return on bonds
                               — 18 —



as on equity. Secondly, the simultaneous holding of debt and equity with

different net returns can be reconciled through the introduction of risk

into the analysis. Either type of reconciliation, however, will affect the

allocative significance of taxes.   If all individuals are at their IRA

ceilings, then these tax—free vehicles are irrelevant for the marginal

investment. If investors self—select debt or equity, as in Miller (1977)

then the tax on an additional unit of either might be represented by the

tax bracket which divides the two. Lastly, if additional debt increases the

risk of bankruptcy, the marginal interest rate may be higher than the rate

previously paid.


5. A Specific Comparison

     Feldstein and Summers (1979) find that the effective total tax on U.S.

capital income is about 66 percent. King and Fullerton (1983), under one

 set of assumptions, find it to be 37 percent. Is it possible to reconcile

 these divergent estimates? The former study looks at the annual cash flow of

 corporate taxes and capital income. For this reason it must be classified

 in the above taxonomy as an average effective total tax rate, even though it

 includes personal taxes on interest and dividends at the weighted average

 personal marginal rates. The latter study considers new investment and

 measures a marginal effective total tax rate. As a consequence, any or

 all of eleven reasons in Section 3 may contribute to the divergence in

 results. A reconciliation of the two numbers mentioned above is virtually

 impossible.

      This section undertakes the less ambitious task of reconciling just

 part of the difference between these two studies. In particular, Feldstein

 and Summers (hereafter FS) find that the appropriate corporate rate for

 interest deductions is 40.4 percent and that the appropriate personal rate
                                     — 19 —




    for   taxes on interest income is 42.0 percent. As a result, when inflation

    increases nominal interest deductions and nominal interest receipts, the

    effective tax rate goes up. Inflation also increases effective taxes through

    historical cost depreciation, FIFO inventory accounting, and the taxation of

    insurance   companies. In contrast, King and Fullerton (hereafter 1(F)
-



    find that the appropriate corporate rate for interest deductions is 49.5

    percent and that the appropriate personal rate for taxes on interest income

    is 23.6 percent. In this case, one effect of inflation is to increase the

    value of nominal interest deductions by more than it increases taxes on

    interest recipients. This effect of inflation is to reduce the effective

    total tax rate.

           At initial levels of inflation, the effect of historical cost deprecia-

    tion is strong enough that inflation raises effective tax rates. The real

    value of depreciation allowances can only be reduced so far, however, so

    further inflation has less and less impact through depreciation. Since

    additional inflation continues to augment the nominal interest rate, with

    the value of increased deductions exceeding the increased tax on receipts,

    the effective total tax rate eventually starts to fall. King and Fullerton

    estimate an effective tax rate curve with a peak at about a 15 percent

    inflation rate in the U.S.

           The 1979 FS study includes years through 1977, while the 1983 KF book

    is able to include rates for the 1981 and 1982 tax acts as well as for the old

    law. For present purposes, we use KF rates from the old law for comparability

    to the FS study. Also, while FS try only to include federal level taxes,

    KF include both federal and state level taxes. Surprisingly, these two

    differences make very little impact. The major difference between the two

    studies involves their assumptions about what margin is relevant.
                              — 20 —




    This difference can be explained by looking at capital income as iK,
the product of a nominal rate of return i and a capital stock K. This capital

income can increase at the margin either because of a higher rate of return

or because of an addition to the capital stock. FS are interested in the

taxes associated with an increase in the inflation rate and thus an increase

in the nominal return i. KF are interested in the taxes associated with an

increase in capital stock K. The difference is particularly important for

marginal effective tax rates because taxes on additional nominal income are

not offset by investment tax credits or accelerated depreciation allowances.

The appropriate treatments of banks and insurance companies also depend

heavily on this difference, as we shall see.

     To obtain the appropriate rate for corporate interest deductions, PS

start by looking at personal taxes on equity income. Dividend receipts of

households, pension funds, banks, and insurance companies are taxed at a

weighted—average rate of 28.7 precent. Capital gains are taxed at an

effective accrued rate of 4.7 percent. With a 46 percent average payout

ratio, the average personal rate for marginal equity income is 15.7 percent.

Next, FS suppose that inflation raises nominal interest payments by one

dollar with no change in real income. This change in itself would save

the shareholders 48 cents of corporation tax   (under   1977 law), but the

48 cents of additional equity income is taxed at the 15.7 percent personal

rate. The net saving to shareholders is .48(l—.157), which equals 40.4

percent. An increase in i reduces shareholders' taxes by 40.4 percent, so this

 rate is used for interest deductions.

     When KF calculate the rate for interest deductions, they consider an

 additional unit of debt—financed capital. The income from the investment is

 used to make interest payments, with no change in shareholders' income. The
                                 — 21 —



interest   payments are deducted at the corporation's 46 percent federal rate

(under 1980 law) and at an average state rate of 6.55 percent. As mentioned

in Section 2, KF find that the total federal and state statutory corporate

tax rate is 49.5 percent, accounting for federal deductibility of state

taxes. Thus, in summary, the difference between the margins of IFS and KF

explains most of the difference between the rates they use for corporate

interest deductions.

      For taxes on interest receipts, Table 2 outlines the calculations of

each study. FS employ the tax rates in the first column, weight by the pro-

portions found in the second column, and obtain a 42 percent average rate

for marginal interest income. KF employ the tax rates in the third column,

weight by the l980 proportions in the last column, and obtain a 23.6 percent

average rate for marginal interest income. Let us look at each difference

in turn.

       Households. Both studies use estimates from the TAXSIM model of the

National Bureau of Economic Research. With tax returns from 25,000 households,

this model increases all interest receipts by one percent and calculates the

total additional tax as a proportion of the additional income. The resulting

25 percent federal rate is increased to 35   percent   by Feldstein and Summers,

because"corporate bonds are held by more affluent taxpayers than ordinary
bank account time deposits" (p. 454). Without evidence on the size of this
effect, KF decline to make this adjustment. They do include state taxes in
the   TAXSIM model, however, and obtain a 32.5 percent rate. If the 35 percent

rate of PS were replaced by 32.5 percent, their average rate would only fall

from 42.0 to 41.8 percent.

       Commerical Banks. If the bank's interest receipts increase, with no

new deposits, there is no reason for expenses to be affected. PS assume that

the additional profits of the bank are taxed at the corporate rate of 48 per—

cent and that the remaining 52 percent is taxed again at the average personal

rate on equity, 15.7 percent. The total rate is 54 percent)' This assumption

also requires that the banks earn monopoly profits that are not bid away by

increased expenses due to competition within the banking sector. If instead,

as in KF, the additional- income is associated with a new deposit used to make

a new investment, then much of the bank's income must be used to pay interest

on the new deposit and to cover expenses of servicing it. With competition

for new accounts, there is no excess profit. Some of the interest is taxed

at the depositor's marginal rate of 32.5 percent, and some is received by

the depositor in the form of tax—free services. In this approach, time

deposits are just a conduit through which corporations borrow from individuals

and pay interest to them. Demand deposits are another conduit for some cor-

porate financing, but individuals receive check—writing services in place of

pecuniary returns. Flow of Funds data reveal that demand deposits make up

23.5 percent of commercial bank liabilities, so KF use .325(l—.235) = .249

for the personal tax on corporate interest payments to commercial banks. If

just the commercial bank rate of .54 is replaced by .249, the overall tax in

the FS study falls from 42 to 31.2 percent. This difference, attributable

to the nature of the margin, is large because conmiercial bank holdings are
      15 /
large.—
     Savings Institutions. For increased nominal interest income of mutual

savings banks, FS again start with the 48 percent corporate rate of the bank.

They assume that some of this nominal income is sheltered through holding

local mortgages and that some is passed through to depositors. They use a

24 percent rate, assuming half is sheltered. For an additional corporate

investment however, KF assume that the bank receives an additional deposit

and lends to the corporation. Except for a small interest differential, used

to cover costs, all of the corporate interest is passed on to the new depositor
                               — 23 —



and taxed at his 32.5 percent personal rate. This KF assumption by

itself would raise the overall FS rate from 42.0 to 42.5 percent.


     Finance Companies. FS use the unsheltered rate of 56 percent, reflecting

the 48 percent corporate rate plus the 15.7 percent personal rate on equity

income. Again, the additional interest income is monopoly profit to the

finance company which has no additional expenses. KY assume that the finance

company must borrow in order to make the new corporate loan and therefore

must pass all interest through to the household lender, taxed at 32.5 percent.

This change by itself would reduce the FS rate from 42 to 41.2 percent.

     Pensions. Both studies use zero for the marginal tax rate on interest

income of pensions funds. Differences in the amount of savings through pensions

are discussed below.

     Life Insurance. Both studies assume that the life insurance company is

taxed under "Phase I", where reserve requirements are determined for each

company in the "Nenge Formula", with several steps. First, the "adjusted

reserve rate" (arr) is found as the lesser of the company's current rate of

 return (i) and the average rate of return for the last five years. Next, the

"average reserve interest rate" for all companies is derived from various

assumptions. This average rate assumption has remained close to .03 and has

not changed in response to inflation. Finally, the "adjusted life insurance

reserves" are calculated by assuming that each percentage point by which the

company's adjusted reserve rate (arr) exceeds the average interest rate (.03)

implies a ten percent reduction in required reserves. If all assets are held

only for reserves and the adjusted reserve rate (arr) equals the actual

interest rate (i), then Tax = .46 iK[l0(i—.03)].     When FS calculate the

extra tax for a change in i, they essentially differentiate this expression

with respect to i. Evaluated at i =     .07, they get a rate of 57 percent)áJ
                                 — 24 —


If   this derivative were evaluated at the 1980 interest rates of approximately

12 percent, the tax rate would be 96.6 percent. KF, of course, are not con-

cerned with an increase in i. From the above expression, the tax rate on

interest income ilC is equal to .46[l0(i—.03)]. Inflation still affects this

tax rate through i, but not as much as in the FS study. With i =   .07,   this

rate is 18.4 percent. KF employ an interest rate near 12 percent and obtain

a tax rate of 40.3 percent. When the overall FS rate is recalculated using

40.3 for life insurance, the 42 percent rate falls to 37.8 percent.'

      Life Insurance Pensions. FS assume that all life insurance interest

income is taxed at the 57 percent combined corporate and personal rate. KF

recognize that the pension fund business of life insurance companies is not

taxable. These pension reserves make up an increasing fraction of total

life insurance reserves over time. In 1976, the year of the FS weights, pension

reserves were 35 percent of the total. If this proportion of life insurance

income were made nontaxable, keeping a 57 percent rate on the rest, then the

42 percent rate of FS falls to 36.9 percent. In 1980, the year of the KF

weights, pension reserves were 44 percent of the total.

      Other Insurance. For interest income, insurance companies other

than life—insurance companies are basically taxed like other corporations.

FS take this to mean that an increase in the interest rate would be taxed

to shareholders at the combined corporate and personal tax rate of 56 percent

mentioned earlier. KF effectively assume that these insurance companies

make new investments out of their net earnings. Since personal tax would

have to be paid on those earnings in any case, the only additional tax is

the 46 percent corporate rate. This replacement reduces the overall FS rate

from 42 to 41.9 percent.

       Weights. FS include zero tax rates for actual corporate interest pay-

ments to government and foreign investors. Instead of looking at actual

interest flows, KF consider a hypothetical marginal investment in a 13.5.
                                 — 25 —




nonfinancial   corporation, financed by selling debt to domestic private savers.

They include state and local government pensions, at a zero tax rate, assuming

that these are funded and actuarily fair. Finally, the KF study uses a later

year. In order to show the effect of time on these relative holdings, the

last three columns of Table 2 show weights for 1960, 1970, and 1980. Bank

holdings of debt have increased dramatically, mostly at the expense of life

insurance business. Pension holdings of debt have decreased slightly (but

pension holdings of equity have increased very dramatically). If the 1976

weights from the PS study are replaced by the 1980 weights from the KP study,

with no change in the FS tax rates, the 42 percent average rises to a 42.9

percent average tax rate for marginal interest income. If 44 percent of

life insurance holdings in 1980 are attributable to pensions, as in the KF

study, the rate falls to 37.1 percent.

     Some of the KF data tend to raise the PS tax rate, but most tend to

lower it. The major differences, found for commercial banks and life

insurance business, involve the nature of the margin. FS consider an

increase in the nominal interest rate i, while KF look at additional

capital K.
     The two margins have very different implications for behavior.

To determine desired investment, individuals want to know the extra tax

associated with the marginal investment. Corporations receive investment

tax credits and accelerated depreciation at historical cost on this marginal

investment, and banks must pay the going rate of interest on the marginal

deposit. By contrast, the extra tax associated with a marginal change in

the interest rate does not involve any new credits or depreciation, or any

new deposits. It is not clear, however, that individuals can do anything

about the extra tax associated with a marginal change in the inflation rate

and the interest rate. Rather, if the inflation and interest rates change,
                                 - 26   -




individuals   want to know the new extra tax associated with the marginal

investment, including the ITC, accelerated depreciation at historical cost,

and taxes on the interest of the new deposit.



6. Conclusion

     In estimating the effects of capital income taxation, different studies

measure different effective tax rates. This paper categorizes effective

tax rate estimates into six basic types, and discusses the usefulness

of each. For marginal effective tax rates, some studies estimate the addi-

tional taxes associated with a marginal increase in the inflation and interest

rates, while others estimate the additional taxes associated with a marginal

increase in investment. Because there are six basic types of rates, because

of the different procedures that can be used to estimate each type, and

because of different assumptions about the margin, care should be taken in

the application and use of effective tax rate estimates.

7/   Slemrod (1983) and Fullerton and Gordon (1983) consider risk in their
     analyses. Fullerton and Henderson (1983) assume that the firm uses
     statutory investment tax credits, LIFO inventory accounting, minimum
     asset lifetimes, and most accelerated depreciation method available.
     Jorgenson and Sullivan (1981) employ lower credits and longer lives,
     based on actual practices of firms.

8/   Some studies have used the actual inflation rate and actual return in
     each year to estimate marginal effective corporate tax rates for each
     year. This procedure is essentially wrong, in that the expected future
     inflation rate and interest rate are the important variables affecting
     the decision to undertake a new Investment. The only implicit assumption
     under which this procedure makes sense is that investors are very myopic
     and always expect the current inflation and interest rates to hold in
     all future periods. While most studies choose these input parameters
     by assumption, more thorough procedures would make explict assumptions
     about expectations based on past values and then, for each year's invest-
     ment, generate expected future inflation and interest rates.


—
9/   Fraumeni and Jorgenson (1980) find a constant real after—tax return
     to corporations. Summers (198lb) finds that inflation adds at most
     point—for—point to interest rates, so the real after—tax interest
     rate must be falling as inflation rises. These results can be
     compatible if returns to debt and equity differ systemmatically with
     the inflation rate, but they are not compatible if corporations
     arbitrage between bonds and real capital as discussed below.

10/ A fixed real after—tax return for a corporation taxed at rate u
     implies that nominal interest increases by the inflation rate
     over (1—u). If personal tax rate differ, we could assume a constant
     real return after the average tax rate m. Or, if the relevant
     investor is tax—exempt, a constant real return implies Strict Fisher's
     Law.

11/ Assets with different tax rules have different required pre—tax returns,
     but they all have the same cost of funds. Because the firm could retire
     a unit of debt instead, any marginal investment faces an opportunity cost
     given by the net of tax interesrrate. As a result, the different pre-
     tax returns and ;esulting costs of distortions do not depend on whether
     debt or equity finance is actually used. While the pre—tax returns are
     correct for any type of finance, subtraction of the post—corporate—tax
     return provides a marginal effective corporate tax rate for only equity
     finance. The assumption about arbitrage i.s discussed more below.

/   This ambiguity reflects recent debate in the literature about what
    constitutes a neutral tax incentive. Assuming that a tax cut is
    intended to affect all assets similarly, it is not clear whether there
    should be equal percentage reductions in the rental prices (gross of
    depreciation) or in the required returns (net of depreciation). Since
    Emil Sunley (1973, 1976b) has argued for each view in turn, the issue
    has come to be known as the Sunley vs Sunley controversey. Bradford
    (1980) concurs with Sunley (1976b) that maximization of net output
    requites equalized social returns net of depreciation.

13/ Clarification and discussion of the necessary assumptions are provided
     in Tiebout (1956), McGuire (1974), Hamilton (1976), Fisehel (1975),
     and White (1975).

14/ The 48 percent corporate rate and 15.7 percent personal rate combine
     to 56 percent, but FS assume that the increase in the interest rate
     is partially passed on to depositors. Interest rate ceilings constrain
     the depositors' increase to 0.3 percent for each one percent increase in
     the inflation rate. The total marginal tax rate on banks and their
     depositors is then 54 percent.

15/ In a comment on the Feldstein—Summers study, Gravelle (1980) concentrates
     on "(1) the questionable assumption that no other tax policies would have
     changed in the absence of inflation, (2) the use of NIPA depreciation, and
     (3) the inappropriateness of attempting to measure the effect of tax policy
     on investment behavior over time using the accounting measures of effective
     tax rates derived from the NIPA" (p. 474), that is, the use of average
     rather than marginal effective corporate tax rates. On the 54 percent
     rate of banks, Gravelle calls into question the assumption that all addi-
     tional nominal interest income would be profits for the bank. She uses
     data indicating that 37.9 percent of bank income goes to operating costs,
     49.3 percent goes to interest payments, and only 12.8 percent to profits.
     For increases in the nominal interest rates paid to banks, she finds much
     lower marginal tax rates. KF make similar points about the FS study, but
     differ in that they look at additions to investment rather than additions
     to interest rates.

16/ This expression uses the .46 federal corporate tax rate rather than
     the .495 combined corporate tax  rate,because state governments typically
     impose premium taxes (on the consumer's purchase of life insurance services)
     rather than income taxes (on the investment income of the life insurance
     corporation). Feldstein and Summers use a 48 percent federal rate, and
     they take the difference between the tax at i   .07 and the tax at i    .08,
     rather than actually differentiating.

17/ The difference between the two margins is recognized by Feldstein, Poterba,
     and Dicks—Mireaux (1983). They measure an average effective total tax
     rate by including actual corporate taxes in the numerator, plus the taxes
     on marginal interest (and dividend) receipts that would be associated with
     additional savings from households, pensions, and life insurance companies.
