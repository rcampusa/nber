                                          ABSTRACT

Following the introduction of the one-child policy in China, the capital-labor (K/L) ratio of China
increased relative to that of India, and, simultaneously, FDI inflows relative to GDP for China
versus India declined. These observations are explained in the context of a simple neoclassical
OLG paradigm. The adjustment mechanism works as follows: the reduction in the growth rate of
the (urban) labor force due to the one-child policy permanently increases the capital per worker
inherited from the previous generation. The resulting increase in China’s (domestic K)/L thus
‘crowds out’ the need for FDI in China relative to India. Our paper is a contribution to the nascent
literature exploring demographic transitions and their effects on FDI flows.

1.      Introduction

This paper explores the in‡uence of population dynamics on relative foreign direct investment

(FDI) ‡ows. We contrast China’s 1982 mandatory one-child policy decree with India, which

initiated a voluntary, but ine¤ective two-child population control program. Viewing the

former as the test case and the latter as the control in a natural experiment, we compare

macroeconomic data from the two countries post 1982. We …nd that the FDI/GDP ratio has

been increasing in both countries but declining in China relative to India.1 We show these

observations to be consistent with a neoclassical adjustment process by replicating them in

a two-country and ‘rest of the world’(ROW) overlapping generations (OLG) model.

      The key mechanism in the analysis arises from di¤erential future population growth rates

and, in particular, a sudden, exogenous relative decline in the population growth rate of one

of the two countries. As such, in every generation the national savings of the older age-cohort

in the country with declining population growth accrues to a signi…cantly smaller younger

generation, leading to a comparatively higher capital-labor ratio in that country. This leads

to relatively lower capital returns, thereby discouraging FDI ‡ows into that country. Two

institutional arrangements are key to this result:

        1. Home bias in investment …nancing: in either country investment …nancing

        needs are …rst satis…ed using domestically generated savings with FDI covering

        any shortfall. Indeed, emerging markets economies are usually characterized by

        a shortage of domestic investment capital with FDI partially making up the

        shortfall.

        2. Individual savings rates are una¤ected by fertility: the opportunity to al-

        locate bequest wealth over fewer progeny does not diminish household wealth
1   See Figures 3 and 4 to follow.

         accumulation, suggesting that other social phenomena have a dominant role to

         play in the determination of the household savings rate.2 Indeed, the literature

         focused on the impact of China’s one-child policy on its national savings rate

         identi…es an enormous increase in China’s savings rate following the one-child

         policy implementation (Choukhmane et al. (2017)).


      Various papers o¤er di¤erent explanations for this savings increase, all of a social nature.

Curtis et al. (2015) and Choukhmane (2017) hypothesize that reduced fertility implies fewer

children to support parents in their old age, thereby inducing parents to increase their own

savings. Wei and Zhang (2011) explain the increased savings rate as a competitive response

to the policy-induced sex ratio imbalance: families save more to increase the wealth of their

sons in order to enhance their position in the competition for increasingly scarce spouses.

Imrohoroglu and Zhao (2018) emphasize the long-term care insurance traditionally provided

by families, and how the one-child policy has decreased the ability of families to provide it.

Parents are thus forced to self-insure and do so by saving more. Other relevant work includes

Chamon and Prasad (2010) and Yang et al. (2013). That the savings rate has increased in

China only strengthens the mechanism of this paper. More precisely, the mechanism only

requires that any savings decline due to reduced fertility does not exceed the rate at which

the capital stock per young worker increases.

      If capital adjustment costs are present, a model feature we adopt, the same relative FDI

patterns are observed, but over the course of a longer time interval. This does not, however,

alter the nature of the essential mechanism in any way. In addition, and consistent with the

model’s implications, we document that the trajectory of the capital stock growth di¤erences

between China and India closely track the di¤erences in their respective population growth
2   See, e.g. Constantinides et al. (2007).

rates.

     This paper is also related to the seminal work of Lucas (1990) which argues that the

neoclassical adjustment process (capital ‡owing to its highest rate of return use) fails to

explain the relative paucity of foreign direct investment in‡ows to poor countries from rich

ones, compared to ‡ows among rich countries themselves, where “rich”and “poor”refer to

countries with high and low capital-labor ratios.3 While our results are not in contradiction

to Lucas (1990), they do suggest that demographic factors may have important consequences

in determining FDI ‡ows.

     In summary, the broad message of the paper is two-fold. First, relative population

dynamics play a …rst order role in determining relative cross-country FDI ‡ows. Second,

accounting for these ‡ow dynamics suggests that the post-1982 macroeconomic observations

from India and China are consistent with underlying neoclassical fundamentals.

     An outline of the paper is as follows. Section 2 documents the relative population dy-

namics and FDI ‡ows for India and China post China’s implementation of its one child

policy. Sections 3 and 4 present a parsimonious neoclassical international investment model,

the implications of which are shown to replicate the patterns found in the data. Section 5

concludes.

In contrast, China’s one-child policy was mandatory and e¤ective.

      1. In China, an absolute decline in the working population (aged 15-59) began

      in 2010 and is predicted to continue under all reasonable scenarios.5

      2. With a high degree of con…dence, the working population in India is projected

      to continue increasing at least until 2030.

      3. After 2025, the working-aged population in India is projected to exceed that

      of China.


    Figure 1 clearly demonstrates that China’s policy intervention was not only e¤ective

almost immediately after implementation, in contrast to India’s, but also its e¤ects on pop-

ulation dynamics are expected to persist beyond one generation.6 The anticipation of these

persistent policy e¤ects is crucial for investment decisions because investors are forward-

looking and major investments are typically long-lived. The combination of contempora-

neous and expected future e¤ects of the one-child policy on these comparative population

dynamics strengthens the impact of the natural experiment.

2.2     Comparative macroeconomic performance

Table 1 presents comparative growth-performance features, such as productivity growth and

GDP growth. These were similar in China and India before and, most especially, after

the exogenous demographic intervention, a similarity that allows us to plausibly attribute

other trend di¤erences between China and India (e.g., relative FDI ‡ows) solely to China’s
5 Figure 1 documents a continued increase in China’s population for an extended period following the one-
child policy initiative. This is due to a gradual increase in policy e¤ectiveness and the gradual elimination
of rural exemptions. For the quantity of relevance to the present study, the working population, one would
expect a delayed reaction due to schooling and work preparation at least to the age of 16. The model to be
proposed captures this decline as occurring in a single 25 year period, which is an artifact of the model’s
parsimony and the choice of a time interval equivalent to 25 years.
6 The recently introduced (2017) two-children policy in China may alter the anticipated population dynamics
in China, depicted in the left panel of Figure 1, after 2030. Nevertheless, predictions about population
dynamics 15 years ahead will not be a¤ected. These predictions are captured later in the time interval
bracketed by the vertical dashed lines.

      Both China and India experienced very similar rapid GDP growth in the post implemen-

tation (1982-2014) period (see the two columns under “ ” in Table 1).7 Note that labor

productivity growth was also similar in China and India both in Period 1, and even more so

in Period 2 while increasing in both.8 The capital stock grew more rapidly in China in the

latter period, while the dramatic labor force growth slowdown in China is clearly evident in

the “ ”column.

      Data as far back as the 1960s and 1970s is presented for comparison purposes only. Both

China and India instituted market economy reforms in 1992. Our competitive model, to be

detailed in Sections 3 and 4, thus provides insights only for the post 1992 period.
7 For the calculations in Table 1 and the subsequent theoretical analysis, we employ a Cobb-Douglas pro-
                                            1¬
duction function given by  =  (  )     , where  is GDP,  is capital,  is labor, and  is la-
bor productivity ( is measured as the value of the capital stock and  as total hours worked). The
two columns of Table 1 under “ ”, labor productivity growth, have been calculated using the formula
 = ( ¬  )  (1 ¬ ) ¬  (we have assumed that the capital intensity parameter, = 13 in both
China and India).
8 The similarities in productivity di¤erences between China and India are also supported by Hsieh and
Klenow (2009), and Bollard, Klenow and Sharma (2013).

Prescott …ltered series. Shortly after 1982,         assumes negative values which persist

(right axis in Figure 2), demonstrating that there has been a strong exogenous demographic

intervention in China relative to India.




         Figure 2 - Di¤erential growth rates of capital and labor: China vs India.

   A key feature of Figure 2 is the simultaneous reversal of the      and     trajectories.

It supports our hypothesis that China’s exogenous demographic intervention has played

a substantial role in explaining the di¤erential capital-accumulation dynamics in the two

countries post 1982.

      The fact that         is positive after 1982 the demographic intervention is not surprising,

as      rose from ¬048% before 1982 to 020% after 1982 (see Table 1). This rise in            is

not, however, strong enough to mask the impact of di¤erential population growth on capital

growth:          , while positive, is in general decline post 1982.

While China’s FDI/GDP ratio persistently exceeds India’s it is evident that the gap is, on

average, gradually narrowing. This ‘catch-up’e¤ect is more evident in the time path of the

    While neither country has experienced a monotonic increase in its historical FDI/GDP

ratio, the ratio in both is presently quite high, roughly in the range of 3% to 5% (Figure 3).

By comparison, the analogous ratio for the USA in 2017 was a negligible 0.033%.11

    We next turn to the relative growth rates, China vs. India, as regards capital per worker

() and FDI as a share of GDP for the period surrounding 1982. These are presented in

Figure 5.
10 For example, India’s FDI/GDP ratio in 1983 was 0.002%.
11 For 2017, the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) lists FDI into the USA in the categories “establish
new US businesses” and “expand existing foreign-owned businesses” as respectively $4.1 billion and $2.4
billion, as compared to a 2017 GDP of $19.485 trillion (BEA News, July 11, 2018).

        After the demographic intervention, the K/L ratio of China grew more rapidly than that

of India. During the same period, FDI intensity (measured by FDI as a share of GDP)

grew faster in India than in China. In 1990, the intensity of FDI in China was about 30

times larger than that of India, but by 2014, the intensity of FDI in China was less than 2

times that of India.12 In the remainder of this paper we provide a model to rationalize these

trends of the non-agricultural workforce in both countries (see Figure A.6 and Table A.2 in Online Appendix
C). It is important to note that FDI in China and India during the period examined did not represent the
purchase of existing domestic capital by foreign entities; observed FDI data predominantly describes the
formation of new capital. This experience contrasts with that of the US where the vast majority of FDI is
for the purchase of claims to already existing capital stock.

3.        The Model

We construct a parsimonious OLG model of two countries, 1 and 2, and the rest of the world

(ROW). We assume that countries 1 and 2 are price takers in international capital markets,

where the ‘world interest rate’, denoted by  , is constant. For simplicity, we elect to focus

on FDI ‡ows from ROW to these two countries. Other key simplifying assumptions are:


          - Capital ‡ows from ROW to countries 1 and 2, but there are no capital ‡ows

          between countries 1 and 2.

          - The labor force of each country cannot move to the other country.

          - There is no international trade in …nal goods.13


     None of these assumptions is crucial to the model’s implications.




3.1        Production

Aggregate domestic production in country  2 f1 2g in period  is characterized by the

production technology,

                                              =  +  ,                                       (1)
13 This is a simplifying assumption, following Backus, Kehoe, and Kydland (1992) and Holmes, McGrattan
and Prescott (2015). While there are plausible reasons to assume that FDI may be more focused on selling
in a local market rather than as a base for exports (see the discussion in Holmes, McGrattan and Prescott,
2015, p. 1159), this assumption is not critical for the qualitative conclusions implied by the model. Assuming
a fully integrated …nal-goods market would add more arbitrage conditions but would not eliminate the key
arbitrage conditions behind the K/L ratio dynamics studied here. Our empirical application focuses on
China and India, two countries that have, historically, faced both geographical and political barriers to
capital ‡ows and trade.

abstractions and notation of our model, domestic production in a McGrattan and Prescott (2009, 2010) type
of model would be,

They motivate their formulation by the observed correlation between population size and FDI-location ca-
pacity. The McGrattan and Prescott (2009, 2010) formulation is convenient for obtaining an aggregate
Cobb-Douglas domestic-production function. In this paper we suggest company-speci…c Cobb-Douglas pro-
duction technologies and clearly distinguish those who work in FDI-related companies and those who work
in domestically …nanced companies.

3.3     Households, domestic savings, and national capital

We use a simple variant of the overlapping-generations (OLG) model developed in Diamond

(1965). Individuals live for two periods. Omitting subscript , unless necessary, the following

notation applies:


      1   consumption of a young agent born at time  ( speci…es the generation)

      2   consumption when old at time  + 1 of an individual born at time 

           number of individuals born in period  and working in period 

           competitive wage received in period 

      +1     interest rate paid on savings held from period  to period  + 1.


   Aggregate consumption in period  + 1 is thus  2 + +1 1+1 (see below)


                                                              Periods

                                                    +1            +2         +3

             Age        born in         1         2

             Groups born in  + 1                    1+1         2+1

                        born in  + 2                               1+2      2+2

                        aggregating               2 +      +1 2+1 +

                                                +1 1+1      +2 1+2

   We further assume:



                                                14
     1. Within each cohort, individuals are identical. The utility function of a repre-

     sentative individual is given by,

          (1  2 ) = log (1 ) + log (2 ) , with discount factor       2 (0 1) .   (9)


     2. Labor supply is completely inelastic and equal to one unit per period. Ac-

     cordingly, the labor income of an individual when working in period  is  .

     3. When young, individuals work, consume and accumulate capital (save). When

     old, individuals rent their capital to …rms (in which the young generation works),

     consume, and die.

   The consumption of generation , when old (occurring in period  + 1), is thus given by,

                                        2 = (1 + +1 )  ,                                       (10)

where  denotes period  savings of a household (when young). Since the only source of

income when young is the wage income  ,  =  ¬ 1 , and (10) becomes,

                                                  2
                                       1 +            =  .                                       (11)
                                                1 + +1

Maximizing lifetime utility (9) subject to the lifetime constraint (11) yields,

                                            =               .                                     (12)
                                                  1+

Aggregate domestic savings of the young generation,  =   , is equal to aggregate

investment, which augments the national capital stock of the country in period . Equation

(12) then implies,

                                                   15
    Under one additional assumption,

                                     =  =  ,  = 0 1 ,                             (14)

production in both countries  2 f1 2g is given by an aggregated domestic production

function of the form,

                                                      ¬ 

    This special case allows the derivation of analytical results with direct empirical impli-

cations. Nevertheless, assuming  6=  , and  6=  , gives the same empirical

implications as described below, while depriving us of certain simplifying formulae that fol-

low later in the paper. In what follows, we thus maintain assumption (14).15 See Online

Appendix A for the derivation of expression (15).

    Although we make assumptions (namely logarithmic preferences) that lead to a constant

savings rate, all of our qualitative results and testable implications are preserved if the savings

rate is increasing through time. The mechanism on which this paper is based is one where

the declining population means that each generation provides the next with higher capital

per worker, a fact that discourages/crowds-out FDI ‡ows.16 An increased savings rate would

only reinforce the phenomenon we emphasize. Indeed, from 1980-2010 the household savings

rate in China doubled (see, e.g., Imrohoroglu and Zhao, 2018).

3.4     Capital adjustment costs

In the absence of any capital adjustment cost, optimal investment is governed by,

                                    + =    ,             2 f1 2g .                           (16)
15 We also assume that  =  because we lack any data on labor productivity growth in foreign owned
vs. domestically owned …rms.
16 The expression ‘crowding out’ implies that the lower capital returns which follow on higher K/L ratios
reduce the incentives for foreign …rms to undertake FDI.

                                                        16
With frictionless capital ‡ows and unlimited capital availability at the world cost of capital

 , steady state transitions due to underlying parameter changes will occur in one period

which, in this model, corresponds to one-half of an adult lifetime. In order to better match

the empirical duration of transitions we impose a capital adjustment cost on the dynamics

implied by equations (13) and (16). In particular, we modify equation (16) to be of the form:


                               + =    +           ( ) ,    2 f1 2g ,                           (17)

where       0,      2 (0 1).17 The symbol   0 denotes the period in which an exogenous

intervention shocks the equilibrium away from its steady-state path. For some periods after

a transitional shock there is a loss of           (1 ¬ )¬ ¬1 in capital returns, which we postulate

as due to some combination of industrial relocation costs and institutional adjustment costs

such as bureaucratic frictions.18 These institutional adjustments are gradually smoothed

out, and the capital-returns wedge,             (1 ¬ )¬ ¬1 , decays over time at rate .

3.5       Equilibrium

Equilibrium is characterized by a set of prices and quantities at which all …rms maximize

pro…ts, all households maximize utility as price takers given these equilibrium prices and all
17 Note that equation (17) assumes a constant return on capital worldwide and in the countries under study.
A large literature has developed seeking to explain China’s high and stable return on capital of around 20%
in conjunction with the high savings rate (see Bai et al., 2006, and Song et al. 2011). India’s return on
capital is di¢ cult to estimate since much of it is held in non-…nancial assets.
18 The exogenous wedge that we impose upon condition (16) through equations (17) and (18) is similar to
measured wedges that re‡ect deviations from the covered interest rate parity condition observed by Du,
Tepper, and Verdelhan (2017) after the recent …nancial crisis. Du, Tepper, and Verdelhan (2017) attribute
these deviations to costs associated with bank regulation. They can be seen as adjustment costs of moving
from pre-crisis to post-crisis leverage ratios. For some countries, these covered interest rate parity deviations
were stronger during the …nancial crisis crisis and then started fading away over time, as equation (18)
implies (Du, Tepper, and Verdelhan, 2017, Figure 2).

                                                       17
domestic and international markets clear at these equilibrium prices and quantities.

   In the model with adjustment costs, equilibrium in country  2 f1 2g is characterized by

conditions (13) and (17), with adjustment costs introducing long-lasting transitions in the

capital labor ratio. In a steady state, adjustment costs are zero by construction.

   In the next sections we study the e¤ects of an exogenous demographic intervention on

the equilibrium K/L ratio and FDI. The intervention is characterized by a sudden decrease

in population growth in one of the two countries, similar to what occurred after the intro-

duction of the one-child policy in China. This intervention puts a country in a transition

characterized by changes in its K/L ratio and FDI ‡ows. Speci…cally, following a drop

in population growth, momentum in capital dynamics, exaggerated by capital-adjustment

costs, increases the K/L ratio, which leads to a drop in the marginal product of capital, that,

in turn, discourages FDI in‡ows.

   To analyze these e¤ects in detail, we rely on speci…c relationships describing K/L ratio

dynamics both along the transition path toward the steady-state growth path, and along

the steady state growth path itself. These are presented below:

   a) Transition Dynamics

   Equation (17) implies,

                                                                      1

                                          =                                .                     (19)
                                     + ¬ ( )
In turn, equation (19) implies that the growth rates of capital, labor and labor productivity

are jointly related according to

                                            1              + ¬ ( ¬ 1 )
       ln ( ) ¬ ln (¬1 ) =            ln                     +  +  .   (20)

From equation (20) we see that an exogenous demographic intervention that reduces popu-

lation growth from a constant rate  to a lower constant rate  , will also cause a drop

                                                         18
in the growth rate of domestic capital, absent changes in labor productivity growth.



    b) Steady State Growth Dynamics ( ( ) = 0)

    We maintain our assumption that population growth is constant and further assume that

productivity growth is also constant over time in country  2 f1 2g, i.e.,
                                      +1           +1

between steady states that arise as the result of a fundamental parameter change, a reduction

in the population growth rate.

librium outcomes of the model just detailed when one of the countries experiences a negative

shock to its population growth rate.


4.      Model Implications

The goal of this paper is to emphasize the role played by the one-child policy in China

in explaining the comparative FDI/GDP dynamics in China and India. Explaining the

precise trajectories of the FDI/GDP levels in China and India, especially the very low

FDI/GDP levels of the early 1980s, when neither of the two countries were market economies,

is a challenge that requires introducing market and trade wedges, something we eschew.

Accordingly, we focus on the post 1990 period, when both China and India displayed robust

FDI/GDP ratios and almost free access to international markets. For this period the role of

demographics in explaining the comparative FDI trajectories in China and India should be

transparent.20

     In particular, we study a parametrized version of the model where an exogenous demo-

graphic intervention occurs in period 10. The length of each period is  = 25. The annual

rate of time preference is (1 ¬ ) = = 6%. The annual labor productivity growth rate is

 = 4%, a rough average of the data summarized in Table 1. For the treated country,

the annual population growth rate prior to the intervention is  = 2%, and ~ = ¬1%

afterwards. For the control country it is 2% throughout. The output elasticity of capital
20 As shown in Table 1, the productivity di¤erences between China and India have been very small. This
similarity allows us to focus on the comparative e¤ects caused by the exogenous intervention in the population
growth rate of China.

is    = 13, while the value for the annual world interest rate,  , is set to  = 3%, in ac-

cordance with estimates in Holston, Laubach, and Williams (2017). Following Klenow and

Rodriguez-Clare (1997, p. 76), the annual depreciation rate, , is set to             = 3%. The annual

wedge on the world capital return is             = 05%, and the rate of decay of the world-interest

rate wedge is     = 30%.21

4.1       Relative growth in capital and labor

Since India’s demographic-control policies were broadly ine¤ective and it was exposed to the

same globalization factors as China (especially in the mid-1990s), we postulate that India

remained close to its steady-state path, and examine the di¤erence in the capital growth

rate between the two countries. In particular, equation (20) can be re-written as,

                                1             + ¬ ( ¬ 1 )
                      =             ln                    +           +    ,            (26)
                              1¬    1           + ¬ ( )

where        1 ¬ 2 . Identifying country 1 as China and country 2 as India, equation

(26) relates the relative capital stock growth, China vs. India, to the relative labor force and

productivity growth rates.

     Consistent with the data in Table 1, we assume                = 0. With      = 0, equation

(26) implies a direct positive connection between             and    and o¤ers an identi…cation

test: if growth dynamics in China and India are governed by the neoclassical production

process assumed in equation (15), then the unique demographic intervention in China (the

imposition of the one-child policy, a quasi-natural experiment) should be manifest empirically

as a simultaneous reversal of the             and     trajectories post the intervention. Direct

4.2      The impact of an exogenous demographic intervention on rel-
         ative FDI dynamics

In this section we focus on FDI, speci…cally the trajectories of capital in‡ows from ROW.

It is assumed that both countries are identical as regards their initial K/L ratio and have

identical labor productivity growth rates before and after the intervention.

    Using the parameter values detailed in the previous section, Figure 7 depicts model-

generated di¤erences between one country experiencing an exogenous period-10 demographic

intervention, and a country on its steady-state path. Panels A, C and E describe the con-

sequences for the treated country while Panels B, D and F compare its response to the

intervention with the corresponding quantity in the control country.

    First consider Panels A and B of Figure 7.24 Following the demographic intervention, the

K/L ratio of the treated country spikes up (Panel A) before returning to its long run steady

state value.25 As a result, the K/L ratio in the treated country increases relative to the

control country as captured in Panel B.26 After some generations, the e¤ect disappears, with

the K/L ratio in both countries identical once again (Panel B) as required by their identical

productivity growth rates. The K/L ratio e¤ects are directly re‡ected in the corresponding

MPK values: the abrupt increase in the treated country’s K/L ratio has its counterpart in an

absolute reduction in its MPK (Panel C), and a relative MPK reduction vis-a-vis the control

country (Panel D). Following equation (18), adjustment costs of industrial relocation, and
24 To assess the implications of Figure 7, the reader is again reminded that if we consider two time series, 
and  , and plot log ( ) ¬ log ( ) over time, then an upward-sloping log ( ) ¬ log ( ) implies that  grows
faster than  .
25 As stressed above, in equation (19), capital in e¢ ciency units,  (), is tied to the world interest rate,
 . In order to better understand the dynamics of K/L ratios we need to control for changes in the dynamics
of labor productivity, , which we plot in Panel A of Figure 7 as  ().
26 Following the identi…cation mentioned in the preceding paragraph, the K/L ratio in the treated country
grew relative to its equivalent in the control country.



                                                         23
institutional adjustments such as bureaucratic frictions are manifested in a temporary drop

in capital returns, driven by the capital-returns wedge,   ( ) =   (1 ¬ )¬ ¬1 , that decays

over time. Our choice of parameter      is an annual rate of 05%, and the decay parameter

  = 03 implies that the half-life of this interest-rate wedge        is about 50 years, which

corresponds to two generations of young workers (T=25 years). These values of            and

reproduce empirically plausible K/L ratio dynamics.

                                              24
    Panels E and F detail the consequences of the intervention for the FDI/GDP ratio of the

treated country. As evident in equation (25), the steady state FDI/GDP ratio of country

 is positively related to its population growth rate  . Accordingly, a reduction in the

treated country’s  reduces its FDI/GDP ratio, an e¤ect manifested in Panel E. Relative

to the control country, its FDI/GDP ratio declines as well (Panel F): although the K/L

ratio of the treated country eventually returns to its pre-intervention values (Panel A), the

composition of its ownership of its capital stock has changed in favor of proportionately

less FDI. We summarize these model implications as follows: a permanent decline in the

population growth rate of the treated country leads to, (i) a temporary, though prolonged,

increase in the K/L ratio above its steady state value, (ii) a temporary, though prolonged,

decrease in the marginal product of capital below its steady state value, and (iii) a permanent

reduction in its FDI/GDP ratio both absolutely and relative to its control counterpart. Note

that Panel A of Figure 7 depicts the time path of the normalized (by labor productivity, )

K/L ratio. The K/L ratio of both countries, except on the transition path for the treated

country, thus continues to grow at the same growth rate as .

    The permanent decline in the relative FDI/GDP ratio following a permanent reduction in

the treated country’s population growth rate (Figure 7, Panel F) is not due to the temporarily

lower marginal product of capital (Figure 7, Panel D) and thus lower capital returns. We

emphasize that it is not the (temporarily) lower capital returns that discourage FDI. Rather,

less FDI is needed since greater capital per worker is being inherited from the prior generation

due to the reduction in the population growth rate in an environment where the savings rate

is unchanged.27 It is a “crowding-out”type e¤ect. Model dynamics are thus in accord with

data (Figure 5).
27 Theseresults are robust to a reduced savings rate response to fewer descendants in a model of implicit
voluntary bequests, provided the savings rate decline is not too great.



                                                   25
    We present further evidence (Figure 8) in support of the ‘crowding out’ mechanism

resulting from China’s one child policy on FDI by exploring FDI as a share of domestic

investment (FDI/I ratio) in China and India for the period 1982-2014.

Prior to 1992, the FDI/I ratio was low in China and negligible in India. This is evident from

Figure 8. While India’s FDI/I ratio is generally increasing in the years following 1992, the

pattern for China is one of an initial dramatic increase, followed by a pronounced general

decline. A major reason for the initial increase in China’s FDI/I ratio is easily identi…ed.

In 1992 the Chinese government formally established “market economy reforms”in its con-

stitution and began to strengthen private property rights by enforcing the “rule of law”for

commercial transactions. As a landmark on China’s transition to a market economy, these

reforms made China a dramatically more attractive place for foreign investment.28 While
28 The   second landmark year, 2001, marked China’s accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO).



                                                     26
the observed decline in China’s FDI/I ratio is theoretically consistent with the perspective

of this paper –the “crowding out”of FDI by increases in China’s K/L due to demographic

repression – it may also be due to the dramatic increases in China’s domestic household

savings rate in this period (see Choukhmane et al. (2017)), a feature absent in the present

model formulation. As noted earlier, however, introducing an increasing savings rate would

only strengthen the model’s prediction of a declining FDI/I ratio.

   In summary, our theoretical predictions are as follows:

     1. After a permanent drop in a country’s population growth rate its FDI/GDP

     ratio will steadily decline to a new, permanently lower, level (see Figure 7, Panel

     E, and equation (25)).

     2. After a permanent drop in a country’s population growth rate, its FDI/I ratio

     will similarly decline to a new, permanently lower, level.

   In Figure 8, China’s FDI/I ratio does decline with time, in accordance with the theoretical

predictions. In Figure 3, however, China’s FDI/GDP ratio is seen to stabilize at around 4%,

a seeming contradiction to the theory presented here.

   We attribute this discrepancy to other factors at play, and, in particular, labor productiv-

ity growth. Speci…cally, Table 1 portrays a dramatic increase in China’s productivity growth

in the decades following 1982. Moreover, equation (25) implies a positive steady-state rela-

tionship between the FDI/GDP ratio and labor productivity growth. Taken together, these

facts suggest that China’s enhanced productivity growth post 1982, per se, would lead to

a higher FDI/GDP ratio, and that this e¤ect may overwhelm the opposing force of lower

population growth emphasized in the present paper. Accordingly, we hypothesize that the

FDI/GDP pattern evident in Figure 3 is the result of the e¤ects of higher productivity

growth and lower population growth counterbalancing one another.

                                             27
     Nevertheless, the fact that productivity growth was similar in China and India after 1982

allows us also to focus on comparative FDI/GDP dynamics between China and India. On

Figure 4 we have focused on these comparative FDI/GDP dynamics, empirical observations

that are replicated theoretically in Figure 7 (Panel F).


5.      Relationship to the existing literature

The neoclassical foundation for dynamic FDI analysis was …rst articulated in McGrattan and

Prescott (2009, 2010), and Holmes, McGrattan and Prescott (2015). These three studies in-

troduce international capital ‡ows in a fashion similar to the present model. The paradigms

they consider assume that both population growth rates and labor-productivity growth rates

are equal across countries (see McGrattan and Prescott, 2010, p. 1503, and Holmes, McGrat-

tan and Prescott, 2015, p. 1172), an assumption necessary for the existence of steady states

in their formulations.29 In these papers both developed and developing countries have the

same population growth, suggesting that developing countries catch up with the world pro-

duction frontier mainly through capital deepening. Alternatively, the concept of “technology

transfer” in McGrattan and Prescott (2009, 2010), and Holmes, McGrattan and Prescott

(2015) represents another appropriate technique for analyzing, e.g., the post-World-War II

transition of southern European economies toward the EU frontier.

     From a pure demographic perspective, Backus et al. (2014) and Cooley and Henriksen

(2018) are two additional works. In the former, the authors directly explore the implications
29 To  see why this paradigm does not allow for steady states with heterogeneous rates of population growth
across countries, consider an intertemporal Euler equation relating the growth rate of consumption to a

                                     = ¬  ¬  [ (1 +  )] . A steady state in which ^+1 = ^ in e¢ ciency

units is impossible for all countries if population growth rates are heterogeneous. Other steady states are
impossible, as well.

of di¤ering population dynamics (life expectancies, population age distributions) for capital

‡ows between countries. In the latter work the focus is more on the implications of population

dynamics for economic growth rates within countries, particularly Japan and the US. The

mechanism we have emphasized, however, is not showcased in these papers.

       The present paper is also a contribution to the growing literature studying savings and

investment in China. Bai et al. (2006) were the …rst to document the high capital returns

in China (exceeding 20% post 1993) carefully. They conclude that China’s high investment

rate is consistent with the observed high returns. Song et al. (2011) explore the seeming

contradiction implicit in China’s simultaneous high capital returns and high capital out‡ows.

Their model rests on the internal reallocation of capital out of low growth …rms that are

large, externally …nanced, and whose capital needs are low. In contrast, high growth, high

productivity …rms are small and subject to capital constraints. They thus …nance their

rapidly increasing investments out of internally generated funds alone. As a result, the

surplus capital from low growth …rms migrates abroad, while the relative growth in the high

productivity …rms allows high overall capital returns to be observed.30 Nothing in the present

model depends on the precise level of capital returns. The large literature that studies the

impact of China’s one-child policy on its national savings rate was noted in the introduction.

       Finally, the ability of the model to replicate the facts depicted in Figure 3 does not

contradict the Lucas paradox per se: FDI/GDP and K/L were higher in China compared

to India throughout the entire sample period.31 It does suggest, however, that the search
30 A more recent study also reporting high capital returns in China and focusing on the link between these
returns and the housing boom in China, is Chen and Wen (2017).
31 The present model is also able to replicate the Lucas (1990) paradox as a potential competitive equilibrium
outcome. To see this, …rst note that by equation (24), the level of labor productivity,  , in‡uences the
K/L ratio. By equation (25), however, the level of labor productivity has no in‡uence on the steady state
FDI/GDP ratio. Imagine two countries, one with a lower  , a higher level of capital intensity  , and
higher labor force and labor productivity growth rate. By equation (25) this country will have the higher
steady-state FDI/GDP ratio ( and being common to both countries). If this country simultaneously
enjoys labor productivity  dramatically above its counterpart, this high FDI/GDP ratio country will also

for neoclassical fundamentals underlying FDI ‡ows may be more productively undertaken

by exploring cross-country relative rather than absolute FDI dynamics.32


6.     Conclusion

This paper is a contribution to the nascent literature on the role of FDI and technology

transfer in international markets in the context of integrated capital markets (see McGrattan

and Prescott, (2009, 2010), and Holmes, McGrattan and Prescott, (2015)). We emphasize

the e¤ects of cross-country heterogeneity in population growth on relative FDI ‡ows, a

topic not previously addressed in that literature. More speci…cally, the mandatory one-child

policy in China is contrasted with India’s comparatively laissez faire approach as a natural

experiment to test for the presence of neoclassical FDI dynamics. Our evidence and analysis

support the hypothesis that neoclassical fundamentals do govern relative FDI ‡ows.

     As in the literature cited above, we employ a straightforward OLG construct for our

analysis, and focus on studying temporary, though prolonged departures from steady states.

For emerging markets, real-world transitional dynamics which are far from the steady state,

can be quite complicated, suggesting that the assumption of household perfect foresight may

be too strong. The “myopia” (beyond an adult’s life span of, e.g., 50-60 years) of an OLG

model however, is perhaps the more appropriate starting point for capturing the rules of

thumb used by savers in emerging economies.




have a higher (K/L). Accordingly, more capital ‡ows from the ROW to the richer of the two countries, where
we measure wealth in terms of capital per worker. This is one version of the Lucas (1990) paradox in our
neoclassical setting.
     In fact, the high FDI/GDP, high  country described above resembles the USA in many respects: a
country with a high absolute TFP level, high TFP growth by developed world standards, a high income
share to capital and low savings (low ).
32 Notably, this natural experiment could not showcase these mechanics back in 1990, when the Lucas-paradox
paper was written.

Assuming frictionless cross-country capital ‡ows, condition (7) implies the equilibrium condition:

Combining equations (28), (2), and (3), we obtain,

Adding the term   to both sides of equation (29) leads to ( +   )  = 

                  Table A.1 Data on FDI/GDP ratios
Foreign Direct Investment1

We use four different data sources to cross-verify the FDI inflows and outflows of China and India.

    1. OECD: 1990-2013. Historic time series from OECD FDI statistics to end-2013
       (http://www.oecd.org/daf/inv/investment-policy/fdi-statistics-according-tobmd3.htm).
    2. National Accounts: 1982 – 2014. National Bureau of Statistics China (NBS-China) provides FDI
       outflow and inflow information (http://data.stats.gov.cn/english/index.htm).
    3. UNCTAD (United Nations Conference on Trade and Development): 1981-2013.The UNCTAD work
       program on FDI Statistics documents and analyzes global and regional trends in FDI.
    4. DataStream: 1981-2016 (Quarterly). Thomson Reuters DataStream provides quarterly data on FDI
       inflows and outflows for China and India.2

Population Estimates and Forecasts: 1950-2100. United Nations: probabilistic population projections based
on the world population prospects (the 2015 revision)3.

GDP Series: 1990-2014, 2015-2018 (estimates). Work Bank, PPP adjusted at constant 2011 international
USD.

Capital Stock -GDP ratio (K/Y ratio): PWT 9.0 (The Penn World Table).


FDI data come from four sources: (a) National Accounts, (b) OECD, (c) Datastream, and (d) UNCTAD. These
sources cover different years, so we specify which we use in each context and document the correlation among
these data sources. National account data for India is downloaded from the RBI website
(https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/SDDSView.aspx) and it is identical to the data provided by OECD. So, we only
report the OECD source.

  All FDI statistics from different sources use 2010 USD as the base dollar value.

The sources used in the paper are National-accounts data for the period 1982-2014 and Datastream data for
years 2015-2016. National-accounts data and Datastream data overlap over the period 1982-2014 with a
correlation coefficient of 99.79%.

The sources used in the paper are UNCTAD data for the period 1981-2013 and Datastream data for years
2014-2016. UNCTAD data and Datastream data overlap over the period 1981-2013 with a correlation
coefficient of 92.56%. The reason we have chosen UNCTAD data for the period 1981-2013 is because, (a)
for the period between 1981 and 1989 Datastream reports zero values (but not missing values), and (b) the
two data sources overlap over the period 1991-2013 with a correlation coefficient of 99.87%.

To address the concern that large-scale internal migration in China would decrease the capital-labor ratio
instead of increasing it, we use the urban population, restricted to ages 15-64 and perform a robustness check.
Figure A.5 shows that the linear time trend coefficient (of the log K/L ratio of China over the K/L ratio of
India) is positive and statistically significant (not equal to 0 with p-value at 0.3%). In Figure A.6 where we
plot a similar data series as Figure 5 (in the paper) using this restricted sample, all the quantitative results
remain.
The first two columns of Table A.2 provide the data appearing in Figure A.6 (without the logarithmic
conversion of ratios). The last two columns of Table A.2 are the two new urban (working) population series
appearing in Figure A.6.
