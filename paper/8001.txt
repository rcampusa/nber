Introduction

       Since most phenomena understood as pollution tend to be related either to industrial

production or consumption that come with high levels of material prosperity, one might expect a

generally positive link between a country’s income level and environmental pollution. This

would be true even if environmental externalities were continually accounted for optimally in the

usual economist’s sense of balancing marginal benefit of regulation with marginal cost in non-

environmental benefits foregone. At least two offsetting effects on the demand side of the

system might be posited as people get richer. First, they may be prepared to pay more for

environmental quality (environmental amenity is a normal good). Second, the composition of

the consumption bundle might shift in the direction of less pollution-intensive goods, such as

digitally recorded entertainment. There may also be offsetting effects on the supply side. The

high wages associated with high income might make pollution-intensive goods relatively

expensive to produce. The technological change that generates higher incomes might be biased

in favor of less pollution-intensive goods (like software services). General equilibrium effects in

the world trading system might also give rise to systematic effects on the location of pollution-

intensive production activities in countries at different stages of development.

        A priori theory thus gives us no particularly clear prediction about the association

between differences in income levels and pollution, either across countries or over time. The

idea that, as an empirical matter, there is a tendency on balance for pollution to worsen as

economies develop and then to improve as economies become rich, has come to be known as the

environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis. The term refers by analogy to the "inverted U"

relationship between the level of economic development and the degree of income inequality

pointed out by Simon Kuznets (1955) in his 1954 presidential address to the American Economic

Association. Brought to prominence by the World Bank's 1992 World Development Report and

papers prepared in connection with that report, a substantial literature has developed, debating

the theoretical basis for such a regularity in environmental quality and the merits of the evidence

relating thereto.1

        This paper aims to add to the list an exploration that uses a new model specification and

approach to estimation. The approach seems rather well adapted to the investigation of the

environmental Kuznets curve, with regard to which the available evidence consists of a relatively

short panel of observations from economies at widely diverse levels of development and with

idiosyncratic features that may be expected to have a significant influence on the environmental

variables of interest.

         These are the characteristics of the data used in an influential paper (1995) by Princeton’s

Gene Grossman and Alan Krueger (hereinafter GK).2 In their pioneering study they analyzed

readings over a period of at most twelve years (water pollutants within the span 1979-1990 and

air pollutants within the span 1977-1988) from instruments measuring levels of fourteen different

water and air pollutants at multiple locations in sixty-six countries. Although they found

considerable variation among different pollutants, GK concluded there was a detectable inverted

U relationship between a country’s income and the levels of most of the pollutants they

examined. Relatively low and high levels of income tend to be associated with relatively low

levels of pollution. Pollution tends to be highest at intermediate income levels.

         GK made no claim to have tested a structural model of the determinants of pollution.

Their finding is, however, most easily understood and described in structural, dynamic terms: A

poor country does not have enough industrial activity to cause significant pollution. As the

country develops economically, pollution grows. Furthermore, as its industrial potential

improves, it becomes an attractive location for high-polluting industrial production. At some

point, the opposing forces mentioned increase in importance. The pollution problem becomes

bad enough to stir collective action to control it; at the same time, incomes rise enough for the

country’s residents to be prepared to pay for it. Simultaneously, there is a shift toward low-

polluting products, so that, beyond that point, pollution falls as income grows.

2
    Grossman and Krueger (1993) applied a similar method to data confined to air pollution.
                                                  4



       The GK finding attracted widespread interest and controversy.3 The immediate impetus

for this paper is a somewhat serendipitous development of a novel specification of the Kuznets

curve that we think has some attractive properties. Using the data and programs kindly provided

by GK, we have applied the new specification to a reanalysis of the relationship between income

and pollution. Our specification augments theirs in data description. The question is whether, or

rather, for which pollutants, there is a signal in the data of some sort of inverted U. The spirit of

our analysis, then, is to draw a weight-of-the-evidence conclusion from the data examined by

GK. While we use the tools of hypothesis testing along the way, our approach is rather that of

exploratory data analysis.

       The data consist of observations of a variety of pollution indicators at several locations in

each of several countries over several years. The countries differ in their levels of economic

development, presenting the key variation of interest. The straight cross-sectional evidence

poses, however, a long-standing econometric problem (recalling the cross section vs. time series

studies of the consumption-income relationship). That is, the countries located at different levels

of income might have inherently different, unobserved, characteristics. If presently rich

countries happened to have the property of low pollution, a positive true relationship between

income growth and pollution would be masked in the cross section. The same goes for presently

poor or middle-income countries.

       The basic ways to deal with this problem are to use fixed effects or random effects

methods to analyze the relationship between pollution and income found in the panel data. The

                                                              5



fixed effects approach amounts to running a separate regression for each location on the

relationship between income and pollution, with the requirement that the relationship be the

same, up to the location-specific constant term, everywhere. (In principle, similar logic can be

extended to the slopes or higher-order terms.) Because it effectively adds a parameter for each

measurement station, fixed effects estimation imposes a severe cost in degrees of freedom. If the

location-specific influence can be itself assumed to be appropriately random, degrees of freedom

are saved and are exploited by random effects methods.4

        In terms of the notation used in the present paper, the specification used by GK (1995) is

given by

(1)                Pit = yit β1 + yit2 β 2 + yit3 β 4 + yit − β 4 + yit2− β 5 + yit3− β 6 + X it' β 7 + ε it

where

                  i = measurement station
                Pit = measure of pollution level at that station
                yit = per capita GDP in the country in which the station is located
               yit − = average GDP per capita over the prior three years
                X it = a vector of covariates

        Our reanalysis of the data brings to the estimation a fresh specification, whereby each

country’s income level (y) and growth rate (g) are reduced to single numbers (fixed cross-

sectionally). The trend rate of increase in pollution is assumed to depend on these two

characteristics of an economy.




4
 In their work on air pollution Grossman and Krueger (1993) used both methods. The relevant
coefficients indicating the EKC were significant by standard measures only for the random
effects estimation.

The Basic BSS Specification

         What we refer to as the GK functional form expresses the level of pollutant in a country

as a function of a cubic of the country's current and lagged per capita real GDP ("income"), plus

time and various controls. (Particular interest attaches to the quadratic term in income, which

gives rise potentially to the characteristic inverted U shape.)

         We arrived at the alternative functional form, which we call the BSS form, from the

thought that the Kuznets curve phenomenon, if it exists, might relate more to the long-term

growth trends in countries at different levels of development than to year-to-year variations in

income. This led us to the following schematic model (2):

                                       dP
(2)                                       = α ( y − y*) g ,
                                       dt

where

         •   P refers to the level of pollutant registered at a particular location (mean

             concentration (in water) or median concentration (in air)), 5

         •   y and g are the level and rate of growth, respectively, of income in the country in

             question over the reference period,

         •   t is time measured in years during the reference period and

         •   α and y* are constants (to be estimated in the empirical application) specific to the

             pollutant.

Note that the schematic omits an exogenous time trend and other controls that one might add.




5
    Henceforth, we use “mean” to refer to both these measures.
                                                   7



       For the cross-sectional estimation of the parameters of (2), we, in effect integrate it to

obtain (3)

(3)                                 P = α ( y − y*) gt + β ,

where β is a constant of integration of (2).

       Equation (2) describes a locally linear relationship between pollution and time at the

location in question. The trend rate of increase in pollution depends upon the level of

development (measured by y) of the country in which the measuring station is located and the

rate of growth, g, of that country's economy. If α is less than zero, then for y less than y*, the

more rapidly a country is growing, the more rapidly is pollution increasing. For y greater than

y*, more rapidly a country is growing, the more rapidly is pollution decreasing. (If a country's

rate of growth is negative, pollution will be trending down if the country is poor, trending up if

the country is rich.) Thus, y* in this formulation indicates the location (in terms of development)

of the top of the inverted U. A cross section snapshot of otherwise identical countries growing at

the same positive rate (but having started at different times, so as to reach the various income

levels at the time of the snapshot) would look like the graph shown in Figure 1. Alternatively, it

could be thought of as the pollution path of a country with constant growth as it gets richer

through time.

                   Constantly at the Same Rate, g , with Different Starting Dates

       Taking the GK specification as the more typical approach, we would note two features

that distinguish the BSS approach:

•   The income data are captured in two aggregates (average level and average growth rate); the

    GK specification uses actual year-by-year income (albeit while including lagged income

    variables that do some of the same smoothing as do our aggregates).

•   The GK structure is a cubic in income (or more generally a polynomial); the BSS structure

    maps into a function of the logarithm of income and the product of income and its log.

To explain the latter point, suppose an economy were growing at a constant rate, y = y0e gt . We

could then invert the growth function to express time as a function of income,

t = (ln y − ln y0 ) / g . Substituting in to the BSS form yields P = α ( y − y*)(ln y − ln y0 ) + β .

Differences in conclusions we may reach about the Kuznets curve from those of GK presumably

trace to these differences in the approaches.
                                                   9



The Cubic BSS Specification

         Although our very parsimonious functional form does seem to give us the ability to detect

the presence or absence of the inverted U phenomenon in the empirical record, we follow GK in

looking as well at the somewhat more flexible cubic formulation (4) (expressed in its integrated

form),

(4)                            P = α ( y − y*)( y − y **) gt + β .

GK concluded that for some pollutants concentration reached a peak at some level of income but

then at higher levels the concentration appeared to trend up again. In specification (4), this

pattern would be implied by a positive estimated value of α , with y * indicating the top of the

U and y ** indicating the income level at which pollution would tend up again.

Anticipating the Empirical Results

         In spite of the heavy information requirements imposed by fixed effects estimation,

perhaps because the BSS specification of the U-curve is so simple, we obtain coefficient

estimates with sufficient statistical significance to draw conclusions about the Kuznets curve

hypothesis by standard hypothesis testing standards. For the basic model, coefficients on ygt and

yt as regressors together imply the position of the turning-point income value and whether the

implied curve is inverted or not. In a very general sense, the inverted U-curve hypothesis can be

tested by examining the properties of these coefficients. Assessing the coefficients derived from

fixed effects estimation for statistical significance in the usual way, our results suggest that for

some pollutants (arsenic, COD, dissolved oxygen, lead, smoke, SO2), the effect is there; for

others (coliform, nickel, nitrates) there exists and effect but not in the expected direction. (For

still others, the hypothesis of no relationship cannot be rejected).
                                                 10



       As another way to assess the evidence in the regression relating to the environmental

Kuznets curve we have explored the question whether the implied pollution-income relationship

reaches a peak in the framework of income and growth levels within the span of historical

experience. If the inverted U hypothesis held, one would expect the time derivative of pollution

predicted by our formulation to be positive for a country at a low level of income and negative

for one at a high level of income, assuming both countries are growing at positive rate. On a bar

graph with income categories on the horizontal axis, we would expect to see the bars march

down from left to right, from positive to more and more negative (with the possibility of turning

positive at high levels of income for the cubic version of the hypothesis). Using values of the

income levels ($1000, $5000, $10,000 and $20,000) ranging from very low to a bit beyond the

top level in the sample distribution, a growth rate of 3% (fairly high but arbitrarily chosen for

illustrative purposes) and point estimates of the coefficients, BOD is added to the list of winners.

The details of these and other inferences are spelled out in the section on empirical results.


Empirical Results

The Data

       Environmental Data

       Since our main objective is to see what the data tell us using various approaches, we use

exactly the same data employed by GK (1995). Their paper includes an excellent description of

those data; we summarize the discussion here for purposes of a reasonably self-contained

exposition.

       Collected through the Global Environmental Monitoring System (GEMS), sponsored by

a consortium of United Nations agencies, the environmental data set includes annual statistical
                                                11



summaries for the years 1977-88 for the air pollutants and 1979-90 for the water contaminants. 6

The aim of GEMS is “to improve the validity and comparability of environmental data globally

and to provide for the collection and assessment of environmental data,” and the wide use of the

GEMS data in similar studies indicates that it is one of the most comprehensive sources of

international environmental data available. Still, one should note some concerns about them:

•   Because few stations have consistently reported data throughout the time period they do not

    comprise a balanced panel.

•   Because countries do not send reports to the organization within a regulated time period, the

    most recent years have fewer observations. If countries that report conditions more promptly

    are those with stricter environmental laws and less pollution the environmental data in these

    years may be biased downward. On the other hand, if countries with more severe

    environmental problems inform GEMS sooner, we may witness an upward bias in overall

    environmental concentrations.

•   There is also some concern that the selection of stations included in the sample is biased, for

    two different reasons. First, one might expect that since democratic countries value access to

    information more highly than non-democratic nations, stations located in democratic

    countries report data more frequently. Second, it seems possible that specific station sites are

    selected because of observed adverse environmental effects in the area. Therefore, when

    another station is added, one might anticipate that overall pollution as measured would

6
  The water pollution data are from “GEMS/WATER DATA SUMMARY 1988-90”
<http://www.cciw.ca/gems/summary/ intro.html> (26 March 1997). For the air pollutants, GK
(1995, footnote 2) report "The GEMS data for 1977-1984 are published by the WHO in the
series 'Air Quality in Selected Urban Areas.' We obtained unpublished data for 1985-1988 from
the U.S. EPA."
                                                  12



   increase. GEMS has tried to avoid this selection bias by establishing stations at major

   sources of water supply for municipalities, irrigation, livestock, and selected industries. They

   also include baseline stations where it is believed that humans have not polluted the area at

   all.

          The pollutants studied by GK and in this paper are arsenic, biological oxygen demand

(BOD), cadmium, chemical oxygen demand (COD), total coliform ("coliform" in our tables and

charts), fecal coliform, dissolved oxygen (a "good," rather than a "bad"), lead, mercury, nickel,

and nitrate in water, and smoke, suspended particles and sulphur dioxide (SO2) in air in urban

areas. The number of countries with data in each category ranges from 10 (nickel) to 52

(dissolved oxygen). These countries are listed in Table 1. Typically, a country has several

monitoring stations; by 1990 the GEMS program included 287 river stations. The yearly

statistics are derived from readings taken as frequently as biweekly for water and daily for air.

GK discarded observations from lake and groundwater stations and focused on river basins, the

category for which the most data are available.

          There is a slight difference in the measures used by GK for the water pollutants and the

air pollutants. For the former, the environmental indicator used is the arithmetic mean of the

year’s readings, for the latter, the annual median. The mean value is the preferred measure

because it evaluates more stations. Medians are only reported if a station has four or more values

during the year. However, the median must be used for the air data because GEMS/AIR did not

provide mean values.

          Table 2 provides a summary of the environmental data. It includes the mean level of

each pollutant and the standard deviation, both of which are calculated across all stations over
                                                             13



the entire time period. For several pollutants, we note large standard deviations relative to the

mean. From this relationship we infer that the distributions are not all necessarily bell-shaped.

          Income and Growth Data

          The GDP per capita data used by GK are from Summers and Heston’s (1991) Penn

World Tables Mark 5.6. All values are expressed in 1985 U.S. dollars. All references made

herein to income and GDP are in per capita terms.

          Controls

          GK's estimation incorporated a variety of controls for factors, other than level of

development, that would be expected to influence pollution levels. For air pollutants these

include population density and dummy variables indicating proximity to a coast or desert, and

location in a central city or residential or industrial area. The mean water temperature is

included for water pollutants because warmer water will dissolve a greater quantity and variety

of chemicals, releasing them into the aquatic environment. Because methods of measurement

may vary, regressions for some types of pollutants also include dummy variables for the type of

measuring device used.

Econometric Specification

          For estimation, we expand the specification of the relationship for each pollutant as

(5)                           Pi ,t = α ( yi − yi *) gi t + β ' Z i ,t + λt + ε i ,t ,

where

      •   i indicates the measurement station,

      •   Z i ,t is a vector of station control variables and

      •   t is the year of the observation.
                                                 14



       As has been discussed, the pollution variables are annual means of the measured levels.

(In the cases of fecal and total coliform the log of the annual means is used because the levels of

these pollutants display exponential growth and highly skewed distributions. In order to allow

for readings of zero, the variables used for the regressions are log(1+ P).)

       We discuss below alternative assumptions about the error term, ε i ,t .

       Income and Growth Variables

       The variable yi is a level indicator of the GDP per capita of the country in which the

station is located and gi is an indicator of the country's rate of economic growth. All stations

within the same country are assigned the same values of yi and gi. Consistent with GK, whose

income variables are all in per capita terms, the basic version of our model takes as the measure

of the rate of growth an average of the rate of increase in per capita GDP over a reference period.

Specifically, the variable g was calculated by first taking a four-year average (to minimize the

effect of short-term cyclical influences) of GDP per capita at the start of the period of

observations and a four-year average at the end of this period. The first average was of 1979-82

for all stations,7 and the second of 1989-92 for most stations. In the small number of cases where

the Summers and Heston data for a country do not extend to 1992, an earlier four-year period is

used. The rate of growth for a country is that exponential rate that takes the average in the first

period to the average in the second period; i.e., the difference between the natural logs of the two




7
 Because we study more water pollutants than air pollutants, we used 1979 as the first
observation year instead of 1977, when air pollution observations began. Also, Summers and
Heston provided no income data for Kuwait until 1980, so the period 1980-83 was substituted for
Kuwait's first average.
                                                 15



values divided by the time span (measured from the midpoints of the early income values and

later income values, usually equal to 1990.5-1980.5).

       The value of yi is obtained by taking the same four-year average of GDP per capita from

the start of the period of observations (1979-82) and using the rate of growth just described to

extrapolate to 1985.5, the midpoint of the years for which income data were available for most

countries. Using a level indicator for income de-emphasizes year-to-year fluctuations -- GK

used lagged income in their model with a similar objective. Table 3 provides a list of the

calculated income and growth values for the individual countries.

       Interpretation of the Parameters

       The parameter y* is the income level at which the concentration levels begin to fall under

the Kuznets curve inverted U hypothesis (or rise in the case of a U-shape). Because the

coefficients to be estimated on ygt and gt are α and α y * , respectively, the estimate of y* is

                                                                 αy*
found implicitly by calculating the ratio of the coefficients,       . The other coefficient of
                                                                  α

critical interest is α itself. A negative value indicates the inverted U shape of the Kuznets curve.

       The coefficient of t is intended to capture a possible exogenous worldwide trend in the

level of the pollutant in question.

       Error Structure

       To address the problem of locationally idiosyncratic but unobservable variation in

conditions, we use a fixed effects estimator of the coefficients in (5) and for the econometric

analogue of (4).

       GK used random effects estimation in their analysis. The general model is
                                                          16



(16)                                 Pi ,t = γ + δ ' xi ,t + ui + ε i ,t ,

where P is pollution, xit is a vector of all regressors over stations over time, ui is a station-specific

error, and ε i ,t is a random disturbance over time and across stations. The applicability of random

effects methods depends, however, upon the regressors being uncorrelated with the country-

specific error term, ui. We note that this condition is not especially plausible a priori. We would

not expect the controls such as proximity to a desert to be uncorrelated with the station. For our

specification a Hausman test rejects the random effects assumptions for most cases. Some

would, however, question relying on the Hausman test8 and so we also report the random effects

results.

Econometric Results

           The Basic Fixed Effects Model

           Table 4 displays the coefficients on ygt, gt, t and the implied y* values from the fixed

effects estimation. The usual conventions have been followed to indicate the level of statistical

significance. Because many of the variables used as regressors are time invariant -- such as

those relating to location -- these fall out of the fixed effects estimation. Only the mean

temperature of the water and the type of measuring instrument vary over time and remain in the

estimation.

           By examining the signs of α we can determine whether the implied shape is a U or an

inverted-U. A positive α indicates a U-shape, and a negative α , an inverted-U. As indicated in

Table 4, the estimates for arsenic, COD, dissolved oxygen (as a direct measure of environmental

quality), lead, smoke, and sulphur dioxide indicate the inverted-U shape at a ninety percent
                                                 17



confidence level or better. For total coliform, nickel and nitrates the estimates indicate a U-

shaped relationship between income and pollution, the opposite of the environmental Kuznets

curve hypothesis. (By contrast, GK find support for an inverted-U shape for all pollutants,

except for suspended particles, which decrease monotonically.)

         The shape of the pollution-income relationship in the relevant range is not completely

determined by the sign of the coefficient, α , however. The location of y* is also important. For

COD, the point estimate of the turning point is negative and for dissolved oxygen it is at a low

level of income. For these pollutants the estimated path falls continuously, which might,

however, be taken as in keeping with the spirit of the Kuznets hypothesis.

         Random Effects Estimates of the Basic Model

         Table 5 presents the results of the random effects estimation for the basic BSS

specification. Compared with the fixed effects estimates, COD and smoke drop from the list for

which there is support for the Kuznets curve; nickel is added; coliform joins the list with the

wrong shape. The last column of the table also shows the results of the Hausman specification

test of the null hypothesis that the regressors in a random effects estimation are uncorrelated with

the station-specific residuals. In only two cases is the probability more than 10% that the

assumptions needed for random effects estimation hold.

         Cubic Specification

         Table 6 presents the result of estimating the cubic version of the BSS model. The

environmental Kuznets Curve would imply a positive value for alpha. BOD, COD, lead, and

sulphur dioxide stay on the list with significant support in this regard. For COD and lead,


8
    See Antweiler, Copeland and Taylor (1998).
                                                 18



however, the estimated turning points are negative or very low. Although the sign of the alpha

for dissolved oxygen is "wrong," (since it is a good, the sign of alpha should be negative) and in

that sense does not support the environmental Kuznets curve, the estimates imply a peak level at

y** at a level comparable to that of sulphur dioxide. We therefore regard the cubic estimate as

favoring the Kuznets curve for dissolved oxygen.

        Table 7 presents random effects estimates of the coefficients of the cubic BSS model,

along with the Hausman test statistics.

        Graphical Display of Model Results

        The graphs presented in Figure 2 through Figure 15 show the implications of three

estimated relationships for the rate of change of the level of pollution for countries ranging from

very low to very high income levels, each growing at the same rate. The idea is to visualize the

validity of the environmental Kuznets curve hypothesis over (and slightly beyond) the range of

historical experience. If the income level of the low-income country is below the peak of the

inverted U, and the income level of the high-income country is above the peak, then the bars on

the left of the graphs should be positive and those on the right, negative, marching down from

left to right.

        To facilitate comparison across the pollutants in the strength of any effect, we carry over

to the graphs the measurement of pollution in units of standard deviation in the entire sample of

observations. This choice of units allows the reader to get a sense for whether effects are "large"

with respect to the different pollutants. In each case, we show the value of dP dt implied by the

standard BSS model, the cubic BSS model, and the GK model. The two BSS models are
                                                 19



estimated using fixed effects; the GK model is estimated using random effects, employing the

program provided to us by GK. The error bars show the 95% confidence intervals.

       The confidence intervals on the time derivatives serve their usual function of indicating

the strength of the evidence in the data for the signs and we include them in the pictures for that

reason. At the same time, it should be recognized that they do not directly inform us about the

evidence relating to the environmental Kuznets curve. For that purpose we would need a test of

the hypothesis that the derivatives go from positive to negative as the income levels increase.9

       Looking just at the point estimates of the time derivatives to draw conclusions about the

environmental Kuznets curve, the GK results support the environmental Kuznets curve

hypothesis for all pollutants, although for seven out of the fourteen pollutants the evidence

implies the curve turns up again at high incomes, suspended particles decline with income

throughout the range (arguably consistently with the EKC view) and for coliform the inverted U

appears only very early and very weakly. GK support for nitrates and cadmium are fairly muted,

as the initial derivative is negative. The BSS specifications reject an EKC for coliform fecal

coliform, nickel, nitrates and suspended particles; they agree in supporting an EKC finding BOD,

COD (which, however, declines with income throughout), dissolved oxygen, and sulphur

dioxide. For the rest, the picture is mixed.


Conclusions

       Table 8 summarizes the interpretations we draw from the fresh analysis. As a crude

device to pull together the signal in the evidence as explored here, to each pollutant we assign a

score of 1 for an entry of Y (supports a straight EKC) or YN (supports an EKC with an upturn at
                                                  20



high incomes; a score of .5 for an entry of "?" (the relevant coefficient is statistically

insignificant). On the basis of this ad hoc device, and in the spirit of exploratory analysis,

arsenic, BOD, COD, dissolved oxygen, lead and sulphur dioxide would seem to invite for further

investigation as to the validity of the EKC hypothesis. Coming in close are cadmium, mercury,

and smoke. Pretty definitely not: (total) coliform, fecal coliform, nickel, nitrates, and suspended

particles. Whether or not readers agree with this jury's verdict, we hope to have persuaded them

of the utility of our addition to the bag of specification/estimation tricks for thinking about the

Kuznets curve phenomenon.

* Y means the key coefficient is significant at at least the 10% level and of the right sign;
N means significant and of the wrong sign; ? means insignificant.
** For the charts, Y=graphs start positive, end negative; NN=graphs start negative and
end positive; N=graphs don't clearly or monotonically move up or down; YN=graphs start
positive, go negative, then go positive again.
