We show that if a certain nondegeneracy assumption holds, it is possible


to guarantee the existence of a solution to a system of nonlinear equations

f(x)     0 whose Jacobian matrix J(x) exists but may be         singular.    The

main idea is to modify small singular values of J(x) in such a way that

the modified Jacobian matrix (x) has a continuous pseudoinverse J(x)

and that a solution      x of f(x)       0   may be found by determining an

asymptote      of the solution to the initial value problem x(0)
x(t) = -J(x)f(x). We briefly discuss         practical (algoritl-unic) implications

of this result. Although the nondegeneracy assumption may fail for rrny

systems of interest (indeed, if the assumption holds and J(x*) is non-

singular, then x        is unique), algoritl-ffns using    (x) may enjoy a larger
region of convergence than those      that require   (an approximation to)

J1(x).

1.   Introduction
    In various settings it is necessary to solve a system of nonlinear
equations. Thus, given a mapping f: ff'-'-    it is necessary to find
a point x c R" such that f(x*) 0. Often f is continuously
differentiable, i.e., f C1( iR'), as we shall henceforth assume.
     Frequently certain features of the environment in which f arises,
such as physical features, imply the existence of a solution x.
However, it is of theoretical interest to determine conditions on f
which imply the existence of a solution without employing "outside"
considerations. Both constructive and nonconstructive approaches are
possible. For example, degree theory represents a nonconstructive
approach (see Chapter 6 of [Ortega C Rheinboldt, 1970]). Particular
algorithms usually underlie constructive existence theorems. Newton' s
method, for instance, underlies the well known Kantorovich theorem
(see below). In this paper we present a "semiconstructive" existence
theorem based on integrating a certain differential equation. Our
assumptions are weaker than those in the Kantorovich theorem and they
allow situations in which a continuum of solutions x* exists.
     In the next section we introduce some notation and, for reference,
state   several theorems.   Section 3 presents our main results, and Section
' discusses     implications for practical algorithms.
              some

     A nuimder of other authors have considered integrating various differ-
ential equations in order to solve a system of nonlinear equations.         See

LBoggs, 1970] for a survey of such   work.   Fletcher   [1970] has   briefly con-

sidered   "modifying" singular values by the use of pseudoinverses when solv-
ing general systems of nonlinear equations, while Ben-Israel [1966] has made
similar use of pseudoinverses for solving nonlinear least squares problems.
(See EBoggs, 1975] for discussion of the convergence of the Ben-Israel iteration.)

2.     Notation and Background
       Unless otherwise stated,                                     denotes the   Euclidean
vector norm x                (xTx)2 or the corresponding matrix norm.

flXp     stands    for the   set      of real nxp rrtrices. B(x,5)                and (x,S)
denote   respectively the open and closed              balls    of radius          about
x       n
       IR:


              B(x,'S)        {y c n                    <   }
              (x,'5)         {y   c           I jx-y       }.

       We shall make frequent use of pseudoinverses and the singular
value decomposition theorem. For our present purposes, we may state
the singular value decomposition theorem in the form:

(1) Theorem For any A c                  nxn there exist orthogonal matrices U
               nXn
and V                and scalers a1,. a         [0 ,oo) such that A usvT,

where S        dia.g (a1,. . . ,a) is a diagonal matrix having a1,.. . ,a1 on

that    a1 a 2... . a                 0, then they are unique. Moreover, if there
are k distinct singular values                  a. ,...,    with j 0, j kn,
                                                           a.
and              for          <
                                         j,     and if U and V are correspondingly
partitioned as U [U1 U2... Uk] and V [V1 V2... Vk] with
U, V         nx(j_j_1) then the matrices a. U0V0
                                              T
                                                 are unique, 1 . Z                                  k. S

       The pseudoinverse may           be   defined as follows. For any scaler a c IR,

let a (a                          .    The pseudoinverse S of a diagonal                 matrix
S                    . ,a) is then defined by s             E
                                                                                . ,a).
      diag(a1,..                                                diag(a1,.   .            Finally,
                                                                 —3—

          We    shall write J(x) for the Jacobian matrix f' (x) of f at x.

Often we shall              assume that J (x) is locally Lipschitz continuous, i.e •,
that for           each    point z   IR there exists a constant y and a neighborhood
N of z such that

          Following Ortega           & Rheinboldt                [1970,   p. 421], we may state the

Kantorovich theorem                 as   follows:


(3)       Theorem:         With f            as       above, assume (2) holds on a convex set
                                                                                       -1
      c    ffn•         Suppose for some x0                           that     J (x0                 arid

Newton iterates

       We   need below to be assured of the existence (and uniqueness) of
solutions to certain differential equations. The following theorem
 (which follows easily from Theorems 1.2 - the Cauchy-Peano existence
theorem - and 2.2 of [Codding-ton Levinsort, 1955]) suffices for our
purposes.

(5)    Theorem: If F:               R'1    is continuous, then for each x0
and to      E          there exists a     continuously differentiable function
x:               such that

(Sb)            x(t)       F(x(t)) for all t c ff.


Moreover, if F is locally Lipschitz continuous, then the solution

x(t) of (6) is unique. •



3.     Modifying        Singular   Values J (x)
       The region of convergence of Newton' s method (14)         may   often be enlarged
by the introduction of appropriate damping factors                   in which case the
iteration becomes

which,      following         Gavurin      [1958],       we call      the "continuous analogue" of

(Li.).     If    J(x) is singular then (Li), (7), and (8) are                         undefined,         while

if       J(x) is nearly singular, then nunerical attempts to compute (i-i.) or
(7)      or to solve (8) encounter serious difficulties. We could make (Li),
                                                                                                           +
(7), and (8) well-defined by changing J(xYa to J Cx)     but J (x)
is discontinuous at - and unbounded near - points x where J(x) changes
rank.                Thus it is nuch more appealing theoretically to modify the
singular        values of J(x) to produce a continuous substitute J (x)

for J(x)1. We shall do this as follows. Given A c                                                  with singular

J(x)   to be singular, we require a certain kind of nondegeneracy: we

this condition in more detail below. The following theorem rests heavily

upon it.

asptote x Urn x(t) with f(x"O z 0. Moreover, the following bound

(2L)                 I   Ix(t) - x*I     [I f(x0)I I/(ec)] e°


Proof:     Fix   x0. As already rerrrked, the existence of x(t) follows

easily from Theorems (13) and (5).

 Then (t) =              -2fJf so (22) lies '(t) <20 If(x(t))I                           -20 (t).

        While Theorems (3) and (23) are               both existence theorems, they differ
    in a siüficant way.         Whereas the nondegeneracy
    assumptions of (3)       that J(x) is nonsingular at each Newton iterate
                         imply

    xk, the corresponding assumption (22) of (23) allows J (x) to be
    singular everywhere (as we shall see presently). This weaker nondegeracy
                                            —12—




assumption is made at the cost of one of the prime conclusions of (3):

the    uniqueness of               For example, if f:             2 is the linear mapping
f (x) ( ) x, then (22) holds with G                          1   and x can be any point
in   the set {O} x IR.


          Note that (22) implies


(26)                    J(x) J(x) f(x)              G f(x)

                                                                                             2
Qn the other hand, if (9e) holds, then (26) implies fTJJ+f(x) > ®2

To see this, let J             J(x)     have singular      value   decomposition        usvT, whence


          fTJ+f      (uTf)T suTf) (Uf) (S)2 (uTf)                                 2

Thus (22) and        (26) are qualitatively the same and we           could have assumed

(26).       We have chosen (22) since it           yields sharper bounds.


          Let                           Ax-b is affine. We may assume
                us see what (22) means if          f(x)

that b lies in the column space of A, for otherwise at x Ab we
would have J(x) f(x) 0 with f(x) 0, whence (22) could not hold.
By the change of variables y x-Ab we may thus arrange that b    0 and

hence f(x) Ax. Let A usvT be a singular value decomposition of A,
with the singular values    ordered so that 01 02 2. . . G > OcY+f.

more   than this, at least when J(x)                       is locally Lipschitz continuous, which

we henceforth assume. In this case the zeros of f form a connected
set, arid if J(x) is nonsingular for some zero         then this set
consists exactly of x, i.e. f has a unique zero. Indeed, from
Theorems (13) and (5) we see that the solution x(t) of (21) and hence
       him x(t) are uniquely determined by x0                                      x( 0). Thus we may

      Theorem (28) implies that if f(O) has                       at   least two   components,
(in particular, if f has               at   least two     isolated     zeroes), then (22) cannot

hold.     (Note that the existence of 0 such that (22) holds does not depend

on which value of c > 0               has   been      chosen, though the value of 0 does,

of course, depend on E.)              Thus we may expect (22) to hold globally only
for   a small class of problems. However, it appears very likely that (22)
would often hold in       a   region D (as in           Corollary      (25)) containing points x
where J(x) is singular or nearly so and thus                      that methods using

instead of J(x) would enjoy a larger region of convergence.


        Eoggs [1971] advocates the use of A-stable integration techniques

for numerically solving (8). His arguments suggest that weakly A—stable

integration techniques (see [Soggs a                   Dennis,   l97L]) would be appropriate

for attacking (21) directly: such techniques aim                       to detennine   the

asymptote x quickly without spending excessive time compute x(t)

accurately. In practice, Boggs [1976] has                    experienced      numerical difficulties

when J(x) becomes singular                  or   nearly so. Intended numerical experiments

will    hopefully indicate how          much these       problems can     be alleviated by using
          in   place of J(x).

in D0, and converge at least Q—linearly to a zero x" c D0 of f. Moreover,

 whence     (3 'i) follows. U



         As can be seen from (36), the bounds (33) and (37) are not optimal,

 and a value smaller than (32) would suffice for t. However, a better

 factor                 than                based on (36) would still satisfy k > (1_®2)k/2


         As (3L)            suggests,           even if f is linear the iterates generated by

 (29) may converge only Q—linearly to x". The speed of convergence

 depends strongly on E:                       in the      linear case, for instance, the iterates

 converge in one step                       if E is       no larger than the smallest nonzero singular

and                                                          From this standpoint, the tolerance
         l/(02c2)            [l/(o11)J (c2/c1).

      should be chosen as small as possible. In practice, the accuracy to which

f is computed implies a lower bound on                                  Moreover, the smaller         c

is, the closer the search direction -Jf(x) can come to or'thogonality with

the gradient          2JTf(x)     of      (x)     I
                                                      f(x)        2;     this phenomenon can severely

hamper the numerical solution of                f(x*)        0,        so c should not be too small.
The    intended numerical experiments should indicate how crucial the choice
of c is.
       Choices (18-20) for a all behave similarly for a <<                                or a >>           c

the   relative difference between these choices remains bounded. Computationally
we should therefore not expect major differences between the perforrrnces to
which they lead. Since the small singular values contribute little to
fTJJ+f/ I     I 12,    we should expect the same to be true of any other choice of
a      which satisfies (9) along with aa + 1                           as   a÷   +

       Once     J(x)        and   f(x)    are    ]iown,           J(x) f(x) can be computed with
a     given   by (18) or (20) in          (t/3)n3 + 0(n2)               multiplications (and a
similar number of additions), as opposed to                        (113)n3 +   0(n2)   multiplications

for    computing J(xY1 f(x) by Gaussian elimination (assuming that                                   J(x)
is    nonsingular without special structure); when (19) is used, J (x)                          f(x)

may   be computed      in   (2/3)n3 + 0(n2)      multiplications; thus                    may   be
introduced with only a minor increase in the cost of an iteration. Go lab and
Reinsch    [1970] show how the singular           value decomposition of a matrix may be
efficiently and accurately computed. The above operation count for (18)
assumes that the factors U and V of the singular value decomposition
usvT of J = J(x)             are not explicitly computed, but               rather that   uTf is
accumulated and         V   is maintained in factored form.
