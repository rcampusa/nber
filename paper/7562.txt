                                             ABSTRACT

        This analysis provides an in-depth investigation of the determinants of pay in the nonprofit
sector. The main findings are as follows. First, holding constant individual characteristics, average
weekly wages are 11 percent lower in nonprofit than for-profit jobs. However, this difference is
entirely explained by the concentration of nonprofit employment in relatively low paid industries.
Second, an accompanying longitudinal analysis, focusing on movements of workers between
nonprofit and profit-seeking employers, suggests a nonprofit penalty of between 2 and 4 percent.
Third, nonprofit workers in three specific industries (hospitals, nursing/personal care facilities, social
services) earn as much or more than their for-profit counterparts. However, the effects of changing
the type of employment varies substantially across the three industries. These results raise questions
about several predominant models of nonprofit wage-setting.

                              Compensation in the Nonprofit Sector

        Nonprofit enterprises are an increasingly important part of the American economy.

Between 1980 and 1997, their fraction of GDP rose from 2.9 to 4.3 percent (Bureau of Economic

Analysis, 1998) and the number of national nonprofit associations grew 54 percent (Bureau of

the Census, 1998). Nonprofits utilize the majority of volunteer labor and account for a

significant proportion of paid employment in some industries. Despite their growing

significance, the compensation of persons employed by nonprofits remains poorly understood.

There is little question that nonprofit workers receive lower average earnings than observably

similar individuals working for profit-seeking companies.1 However, since the distribution of

jobs and employee characteristics differs markedly, it is difficult to determine whether the wage

disparities reflect some type of compensating differential or worker heterogeneity not accounted

for in standard earnings regressions.

        To address these issues, this analysis provides an in-depth investigation of the

determinants of pay in the nonprofit sector. Our goal is to ascertain how the earnings of

individuals employed by nonprofit enterprises compare to those of identical persons working in

profit-seeking firms. We also include government workers in our sample, and separately control

for this sector in our analysis, but do not focus on government pay differentials.2

        Compensation in the nonprofit sector may deviate from that in for-profit companies for a

variety of reasons. Since any single empirical strategy is unlikely to adequately account for these

complexities, our investigation utilizes four complementary approaches. The first investigates



1
  For example, Preston (1989) indicates that nonprofit managers and professionals earn 18% percent
lower hourly wages than their for-profit counterparts, after controlling for human capital characteristics
and the (one-digit) industry of employment.
2
  Previous researchers (e.g. Krueger, 1988; Moulton, 1990; Belman and Heywood, 1993) have examined
whether government workers are “overpaid” compared to private sector employees. We compare workers



                                                  Page 1
the size and pattern of the cross-sectional differentials. The second estimates how wages change

when workers shift between nonprofit and for-profit jobs. The third considers the corresponding

earnings progression for persons changing sectors following job displacements.3 The fourth

focuses on workers in three narrowly defined industries – hospitals, nursing/personal care

facilities, and social services – with a substantial mix of nonprofit and for-profit employment.

        Our results indicate that nonprofit jobs are concentrated in a relatively small number of

industries. This is important because the 11 percent pay penalty associated with nonprofit

employment disappears once industry controls are added to the wage equation. Movements

between nonprofit and profit-seeking enterprises continue to suggest lower pay in nonprofits, but

the differentials are dramatically smaller than in the cross-sectional models. Moreover, within

specific industries, nonprofit employment is often associated with earnings premiums.

                           1. Relative Earnings in the Nonprofit Sector

        Nonprofit enterprises differ from profit-seeking firms in important ways. They are

frequently exempt from corporate income taxes and receive preferential treatment in state

contract procurement processes (Frank and Salkever, 1994). The key feature, however, is that

they are barred from distributing net earnings. According to Hansmann (1980), nonprofits may

therefore be economically efficient when the consumer is in a poor position to judge the prices,

quantity, or quality of services delivered.4 This occurs because they have reduced incentives to

raise prices or cut quality, since it is more difficult for those controlling the organization to

benefit from the resulting increase in profitability. As a result, Hansmann and others (e.g. Easley



in nonprofit enterprises to those in profit-seeking firms, rather than government, because there is no
reason to assume that government wages are determined by market forces.
3
  Krueger and Summers (1988) use a similar mix of strategies to study inter-industry wage differentials.
4
  Hansmann calls this “contract failure”. A classic example occurs when the purchaser and recipient of
the service are separated (e.g. when financial donations are redistributed, either directly or in-kind, to



                                                   Page 2
and O’Hara, 1983; Handy and Katz, 1998) emphasize that nonprofits will be prevalent in

markets with asymmetric information because they help to solve the consumer trust problem.

        The nondistribution constraint provides two reasons why compensation in nonprofit

enterprises might exceed that in profit-seeking companies. First, managers may have less

incentive to hold down wages since they do not gain from the resulting cost-reductions. This has

been termed as “philanthropic wage-setting” by Feldstein (1971) or “attenuated property rights”

by Frech III (1976).5 Second, nonprofits have less incentive to shirk on quality and therefore are

likely to employ better quality workers.6

        Conversely, some individuals may be willing to “donate” a portion of their paid labor to

“socially responsible” nonprofit employers by working at reduced wages.7 The resulting

nonprofit wage penalty will be reinforced if these enterprises attract persons placing a relatively

high value on institution-specific fringe benefits (such as working conditions, or other

nonmonetary factors) and a low value on money.8 Also, Lakdawall and Philipson (1998)

postulate that nonprofits will be concentrated in more competitive and less profitable sectors of

the economy, where the benefits of choosing the nonprofit form exceed the costs imposed by the




needy individuals in distant locations). Day care and nursing homes provide other examples of contract
failure. In these cases, the recipients of services may have difficulty judging its quality.
5
  Feldstein argues that nonprofit hospitals pay relatively high wages due to “philanthropic wage-setting”.
Frech III emphasizes that “attenuated property rights” reduce the price of nonpecuniary amenities such as
pleasant offices and short working hours, resulting in higher production costs.
6
  For instance, in Newhouse’s (1970) model of nonprofit hospitals, managers maximize a utility function
with quantity and cost as arguments, subject to a zero profit constraint. This leads them to choose the
lowest cost method of production but to oversupply quality.
7
  A recent study of Cornell University graduates indicates that those working in “socially responsible”
occupations or companies received substantially lower wages than their counterparts after controlling for
sex, curriculum, and grade point average (Frank, 1996). Also, the vast majority of volunteer (unpaid)
labor is employed by nonprofits (Steinberg, 1990).
8
  Rose-Ackerman (1996) points out that “ideologues” may accept lower pay for nonprofit work to receive
greater certainty that their efforts achieve altruistic goals, rather than benefiting stock-holders.

                                                  Page 3
nondistribution constraint and other limitations of nonprofit status (e.g. the bar on equity

financing). The increased competitiveness implies downwards pressure on wages.9

       The factors suggest a complex interaction between the class of employer (nonprofit vs.

for-profit) and relative earnings. If labor donations are the dominant influence, nonprofit

workers are likely to earn less than their counterparts. This will also be true if nonprofits offer

other positive compensating differentials, such as better working conditions, shorter work hours,

or lower risk of job loss. The resulting wage penalty will probably be smaller within narrowly

defined industries, however, since organizations engaged in the same activities are likely to

generate fairly comparable social benefits and have similar working conditions. Nonprofit

workers might even be paid more than others in the same industry due to “attenuated property

rights” or “philanthropic wage-setting”, or if nonprofit enterprises utilize relatively high quality

labor.10 Conversely, the generation of social benefits is less likely to be linked to the category of

jobs (e.g. clerical workers) than the type of enterprise, implying that the nonprofit differential

may be little affected by the addition of occupation controls to the econometric model.11

       Useful information may be obtained from persons switching between nonprofit and for-

profit employees, since such changes automatically control for all individual time-invariant

sources of heterogeneity. With exogenous turnover, explanations emphasizing donated labor,

other compensating differentials, or greater competition in the nonprofit sector would predict

wage growth for persons moving from nonprofit to profit-seeking enterprises; those focusing on



9
  Weisbrod (1988) believes that nonprofits arise when the government us unable to meet the demand for
public goods (e.g. care for the medically indigent). This has no obvious predictions for wage-setting.
10
   This argument has been cogently made by Preston (1988). One important additional implication is that
nonprofit premiums will be less likely within industries that are extremely competitive.
11
   However, Handy and Katz (1998) and Preston (1999) argue that the nonprofit gap will be greater for
managers than blue collar workers, since the latter are further removed from the generation of social
benefits. Easley and O’Hara (1983) similarly suggest that the nondistribution constraint will lead to



                                                Page 4
philanthropic wage-setting or attenuated property rights would imply earnings reductions;

whereas wages would not change if cross-sectional gaps result from differences in average

worker quality. However, an important caveat is that the job turnover will frequently be

endogenous. Of particular importance are voluntary job changes, which are more probable when

they result in economic benefits. This issue is discussed in detail below.

                                       2. Previous Research

        Previous research on nonprofit compensation, summarized in Figure 1, yields ambiguous

results. Early investigations (e.g. Johnston and Rudney, 1987; Shackett and Trapani, 1987;

Preston, 1989) were hampered by the lack of information on the type of employer, requiring the

researchers to impute nonprofit status. Notwithstanding this caveat, the cross-sectional results

suggest a large nonprofit pay penalty, a portion of which may be due to unobserved

heterogeneity. By contrast, DuMond’s (1997) analysis of the 1994-1995 Current Population

Survey (CPS) Outgoing Rotation Groups (ORG), which directly indicate nonprofit status,

estimates a considerably smaller 6 to 11 percent wage gap, with relatively higher pay in

nonprofits for women than men.12 Moreover, fixed-effect (FE) models – focusing on switches

between for-profit and nonprofit employment – imply small (0 to 4 percent) and statistically

insignificant wage gaps, suggesting that the cross-sectional differential results from disparities in

individual characteristics or preferences that are transferable across jobs.13




relatively large pay reductions for nonprofit managers, although an alternative possibility is that
philanthropic wage-setting will result in relatively high nonprofit compensation for them.
12
   The regressions hold constant education, potential experience and its square, gender, and dummy
variables for race, marital status, union membership, part-time employment and (in the models with the
smallest gaps), one-digit industries and occupations.
13
   DuMond’s results should be interpreted with caution because government workers have been deleted
from his data set, and it is not clear how the FE models deal with transitions into or out of the public
sector. Also, few respondents switch types of employment over the two years and some reported changes
may be erroneous. Such measurement error is particularly problematic for FE models.

                                                 Page 5
        A second strand of the literature, focusing on nonprofit differentials within narrowly

defined industries, also obtains equivocal results. Weisbrod (1983) finds that public interest

lawyers earn 20 percent less per year than those employed in the private sector, are aware of the

lower earnings, and expect the difference to be permanent. He interprets this to indicate that the

nonprofit gap is due to heterogeneity in preferences rather than worker quality. However,

Goddeeris (1988) reanalyzes the same data and claims that the wage penalty actually reflects

personal characteristics and that public interest attorneys earn no less than had they been

employed by profit-seeking companies.

        Research on the nursing home and day care industries is similarly inconclusive. Borjas,

Frech III, and Ginsburg (1983) find that nonprofit nursing homes offer relatively generous pay

and suggest that this represents rent-sharing due to attenuated property rights. Conversely,

Holtmann and Idson (1993) claim the wage premium occurs because nonprofit nursing homes

use higher quality labor and that registered nurses could actually increase their earnings by

switching to for-profit nursing facilities. Preston (1988) shows that federally regulated nonprofit

day care centers pay 5 to 10 percent more than corresponding for-profits (although no differential

is observed for non-federally regulated centers) and interprets this as evidence of philanthropic

wage-setting. However, Mocan and Viola (1997) uncover a statistically insignificant 4 percent

nonprofit wage premium, with considerable dispersion depending on the type of ownership and

the racial composition of the staff.14

        Leete (forthcoming) considers both overall and within-industry differentials. Using 1990

Census data which (like recent waves of the CPS) explicitly identifies nonprofit status, she finds



14
  Roomkin and Weisbrod (1999) show that there is ambiguity even within industries. Using data for six
managerial positions in hospitals, they find that nonprofits offer lower compensation in three jobs (chief
executive officer, chief operating officer, and top patient care executive) but higher pay in three others
(chief financial officer, top human resources executive, head of nursing services).

                                                  Page 6
that the addition of detailed controls for industry, occupation, or industry-occupation interactions

eliminates the overall nonprofit differential. In detailed industries where there is a statistically

significant pay disparity, nonprofit workers are as likely to obtain premiums as penalties.15

                                       3. Data and Methods

       Most of our analysis focuses on 25 to 55 year old respondents to the 1994-1998 Current

Population Survey Outgoing Rotation Groups (ORG).16 The CPS is a nationally representative

survey of roughly 50,000 households. Individuals are interviewed for four months, out of the

sample for eight, and then return for four final months. The outgoing rotation groups include

persons in the last of each of the four month segments, hereafter referred to as years 1 and 2.17

Our cross-sectional sample includes data for year 1. The longitudinal analysis refers to

individuals for whom data are available in both years 1 and 2 (twelve months apart). Not all

persons can be matched across years. For instance, individuals are not followed if they changed

addresses between ORG surveys. Our match rate of 65 percent is similar to that obtained by

other researchers (e.g. MacPherson and Hirsch, 1995) using equally stringent criteria. The

procedures used to perform the matching are detailed in Appendix A.

       The dependent variable is the natural log of weekly wages on the “main” job.18 Weekly

rather than hourly earnings are used because the latter are likely to be measured with greater

error. However, work hours are sometimes directly controlled for. We are primarily interested



15
   These conclusions need to be interpreted cautiously for several reasons. The hourly wages will be
measured with considerable error, since they are estimated from data on annual incomes, weekly work
hours, and weeks worked per year. It is also not obvious how the analysis treats individuals holding
multiple jobs at a point in time or during the year. Moreover, the demographic characteristics may
inadequately account for differences in worker quality and the detailed controls for industry-occupation
interactions could absorb a portion of the nonprofit differential.
16
   Older and younger respondents are excluded to avoid the special experiences of persons making school-
to-work or work-to-retirement transitions.
17
   The outgoing rotation groups contain supplemental questions on weekly earnings and work hours not
included in the regular monthly CPS.


                                                 Page 7
in the parameter estimates for a dummy variable indicating whether the main job is with a private

nonprofit organization, rather than a for-profit company (the reference group) or the government.

The econometric models also control for a quadratic in age and dummy variables for education

(high school dropout, high school graduate, some college, college graduate, graduate degree),

marital status (currently married, previously married, never married), race (white, black, other

nonwhite), Hispanic origin, sex, residence in a metropolitan area, and the survey year. Some

specifications add regressors for industry, occupation, or usual weekly work hours.

        We also utilize the Displaced Worker Supplements (DWS) to the February 1994, 1996,

and 1998 Current Population Surveys. The DWS contain retrospective information on persons

permanently losing jobs during the preceding three years. Our sample includes individuals aged

25 to 55 (at the time of the interview) who were displaced due to a plant closure, slack work, or

position/shift abolished. The regressors are the same for the cross-sectional models as for the

ORG data, except that no information is available on weekly work hours. The retrospective

nature of the DWS implies some differences in the longitudinal analysis, as discussed below.

        Variable means are similar for the cross-sectional and panel ORG samples (see Appendix

Table B.1). The main differences are that the matched individuals are slightly older, more

educated, less often Hispanic, and considerably more likely to live in metropolitan areas. These

disparities probably reflect patterns of mobility and employment stability. By contrast, the DWS

job losers are relatively young, uneducated, infrequently married, and poorly paid. Most

importantly, the DWS sample is quite small and few of the respondents were displaced from

nonprofit employment. This substantially limits the scope of analysis using this data source.

        The cross-sectional wage regressions take the form:



18
   For multiple job-holders, the “main” job is the one at which the person usually works the most hours.
If he/she works the same number of hours at two jobs, it is the position of longest employment.

                                                  Page 8
(1)                                       Wi1 = Xi1β + Ni1γ + εi1,

where Wi1 is the natural log of weekly wages for worker i in year 1, X is the vector of control

characteristics, N is a dummy variable indicating nonprofit employment, and ε is the regression

error term.19 The coefficient of key interest, γ̂ , shows the predicted difference in (log) wages

between workers in nonprofit and profit-seeking enterprises. However, this provides a biased

estimate of the nonprofit differential if cov(Ni1εi1) ≠ 0, as will occur if the control variables do

not completely account for systematic differences in the selection process into nonprofit jobs.

        Decomposing the error term as εit = fi + eit, where fi is an individual fixed-effect and eit an

i.i.d. disturbance, γ̂ will be inconsistent if Nit and fi are correlated. We can take first-differences

to eliminate this bias. Specifically, if (log) wages in year t (where t=1,2) are determined by:

(2)                                       Wit = Xiβt + Nitγ + fi + eit,

we can difference away the fixed-effect through the wage-change equation

(3)                                       ∆Wi = Xiβ + ∆Niγ + ei,

where ∆Wi = Wi2-Wi1, ∆Ni = Ni2-Ni1, ei = ei2-ei1, and β = β2-β1.20

        Equation (3) will still yield inconsistent estimates if cov(∆Niei) ≠ 0. A possible reason is

that job mobility is not random. Specifically, economically motivated turnover occurs when

compensation is expected to increase, implying E(ei)>0. If nonprofit jobs are typically poorly

paid, switches from for-profit to nonprofit positions (abbreviated by P → N ) most often involve



19
   The regressions also include a dummy variables for government employment.
20
   An alternative is to estimate (1) with the inclusion of person-specific intercepts. Such fixed-effect
models yield virtually identical results to the wage change models presented below. One disadvantage of
the fixed-effect specification is that it can not easily be accommodated to the DWS data, which do not
provide predisplacement values for many of the included regressors. To obtain consistency across the
ORG and DWS data sets, Xi, in equation (3), is measured at year 2. We do not control for the selection
into employment in either years 1 or 2 because of the difficulty in obtaining plausible identifying
restrictions. This failure will not bias the estimated nonprofit differential as long as the selection process
is similar for persons working in nonprofit and for-profit enterprises.

                                                    Page 9
some combination of relatively low wages on the original employment or high compensation in

the new one. The nonprofit differential estimated from such moves is therefore likely to be

understated because the conditional expectation E(ei| P → N ) exceeds the unconditional

expectation E(ei). The bias will probably be absent or smaller when considering moves from

nonprofit to profit-seeking employers (denoted N → P ), if the latter generally offer higher pay.

        It is therefore useful to estimate “asymmetric wage change” models which allow different

effects of N → P and P → N and moves. Denoting these transitions by the dummy variables

NP and PN, the asymmetric models take the form:

(4)                                      ∆Wi = Xi2β + NPiγ1 + PNiγ2 + ei.

Notice that (4) collapses to (3) if γ2 = -γ1. Therefore, γ̂ 2 and − γ̂ 1 provide alternative estimates

of the nonprofit differential.21

        The transitions that follow displacements are more likely to be exogenous (there is no

presumption that E(ei)>0), since the job mobility is involuntary. This suggests that the wage

changes experienced by dislocated workers provide an alternative way to surmount the problem

of endogenous turnover. The estimating equations are altered slightly for this sample, reflecting

the information in the DWS. Cross-sectional wage differentials are obtained from:

(5)                                      Wid = Xiβ + Nidγ + εid,

where the subscript d indicates the predisplacement job. The individual characteristics are

measured at the survey date since data are not available at the time of displacement. Information

on work hours is also unavailable. The wage change equations take the form:

(6)                                Wis – Wid = Xiβ + (Nis – Nid)γ + ei,




21
  The models also allow for transitions into or out of government employment and compare the wage
changes for N → P ( P → N ) mobility to those of persons remaining in nonprofit (for-profit) jobs.

                                                 Page 10
where the s subscript indicates the survey date. A potential problem is that patterns of

reeemployment need not occur randomly. For instance, persons losing nonprofit jobs might first

look for similar positions and then, failing to find them, search in profit-seeking companies. If

so, the observed N → P transitions could reflect dislocated individuals with relatively

unfavorable readjustment experiences (E(ei| N → P ) < E(ei| N → N )) and the estimated

nonprofit differentials could still be biased.

                         4. The Distribution of Nonprofit Employment

       Nonprofit employment is concentrated in a small set of industries and (to a lesser extent)

occupations. This is illustrated in Tables 1 and 2. The first column of each table displays the

industry (occupation) composition of all employment. The second presents the corresponding

distribution of nonprofit jobs. The third and fourth columns indicate the share of employment in

the specific industry (occupation) accounted for by nonprofit and profit-seeking organizations,

with government the residual category. For example, the first row of Table 1 shows that

religious organizations account for 0.7 percent of all employment but 10.4 percent of all

nonprofit jobs, and that 85 percent of employees in this industry claim to work for nonprofits,

compared to 15 percent in profit-seeking organizations.

       Nonprofit positions are concentrated in seven fairly narrowly defined industries –

hospitals, nursing/personal care facilities, social services, primary/secondary education, higher

education, religious organizations, and other professional industries. These account for 26

percent of all jobs but 89 percent of nonprofit positions. Over half (55 percent) of nonprofit

employment is located in just three industries – hospitals, social services, and religious

organizations – that are responsible for only 8 percent of all jobs. The share of nonprofit

employment in these industries ranges from 34 to 85 percent, compared to an economy-wide

average of under 6 percent. By contrast, there is virtually no nonprofit involvement in the


                                                 Page 11
transportation, personal/business services, wholesale/retail trade, manufacturing, public

administration, agriculture, construction, or mining sectors. These industries are responsible for

almost two-thirds (66 percent) of all employment but just 6 percent of nonprofit jobs.

        Nonprofit jobs are more dispersed across occupations. Nevertheless, six categories –

health professionals, educators, other professionals, health technicians, administrative support

workers, and service occupations – account for 92 percent of nonprofit employment (versus 60

percent of all jobs). Three of these – health professionals, educators, and health technicians –

employ 37 percent of nonprofit workers, compared to 12 percent of overall employment.

Nonprofits are virtually absent from the sales, laborer, and transportation occupations that

employ a large share of the working population.

        Some of the econometric estimates below include dummy variables for the

aforementioned seven specific industries or six occupations. This contrasts with some previous

researchers (e.g. Preston, 1989 or DuMond, 1997) who control only for broad (one-digit)

industries and occupations, or with Leete (forthcoming) who includes as many as 20,000

industry-occupation interactions. Within broad industries or occupations there is substantial

heterogeneity in the prevalence of nonprofit activity. Conversely, extremely detailed industry-

occupation interactions could absorb much of the nonprofit “effect”, since many cells are

dominated by a single class of employer.

        The type of employment is reported by survey respondents, raising the possibility of

classification error. There is little reason to believe that government or for-profit workers

frequently misreport the class of employer.22 By contrast, nonprofit employment appears to be

substantially undercounted. A careful analysis by the Hodgkinson, et al. (1996) indicates that



22
  For example, 100 percent of respondents in public administration report holding government jobs and
99 percent of those in the wholesale/retail trade or manufacturing industries claim for-profit employment.

                                                 Page 12
nonprofits constitute 6.7 percent of the paid work force in 1994. Conversely, only 5.7 percent of

the ORG sample claim this type of employment, suggesting that around 18 percent of those in

nonprofit jobs erroneously report holding for-profit positions. An identical 18 percent error rate

is obtained by assuming that 100 percent of employment in religious organization is nonprofit,

compared to the 85.1 percent reported by ORG respondents.23 Such classification errors will

generally cause the observed wage gaps to be smaller than the actual differentials, since some

nonprofit jobs are averaged in with for-profit positions. We return to this issue below.

                               5. Cross-Sectional Wage Differentials

        We begin our empirical analysis by examining cross-sectional wage differentials for the

ORG sample (in year 1).24 The top panel of Table 3 displays the mean weekly earnings of

nonprofit, for-profit, and government workers in selected industries and occupations. Nonprofit

workers earn 3 percent less than those in profit-seeking firms (while government employees

receive 11 percent higher pay). However, within many narrow industries, there is a nonprofit

premium – 10 percent in education, 11 percent in hospitals, 14 percent in nursing/personal care

facilities, and 18 percent in social services. The major exception is a 7 percent wage gap in other

professional industries, a diverse category likely to exhibit considerable heterogeneity between

nonprofit and profit-seeking organizations. The overall wage gap combined with intra-industry

premiums reflects the concentration of nonprofit jobs in low paid sectors such as social services

and religious organizations. Nonprofit workers also frequently earn more than their for-profit



23
   The 34 percent of hospital workers claiming nonprofit affiliation appears low, given that around 65
percent of acute care hospital beds are in nonprofits. But this industry category also includes psychiatric
hospitals, rehabilitation facilities, and post-acute care hospitals, that are heavily for-profit. Hodgkinson,
et al. (1996) estimate that hospitals accounted for 33.7 percent of nonprofit employment in 1994,
somewhat higher than the proportion in Table 1 (29.9 percent) which covers the 1994-1998 period.
However, the hospital share of nonprofit jobs has been trending sharply down, suggesting that nonprofit
hospital positions are only modestly more understated in our sample than is other nonprofit employment.
24
   Similar results are obtained for year 2.

                                                   Page 13
counterparts in the same occupation (e.g. 1, 7, and 5 percent for health professions, educators,

and health technicians).

       The disparities in average earnings may reflect individual heterogeneity, rather than

differences in the pay determination process used by nonprofits. The bottom panel of Table 3

lends support to this possibility. Nonprofit and for-profit workers are equally likely to be

married or live in metropolitan areas, but the former are slightly older, much more educated,

almost twice as likely to be female, work fewer hours, and are less likely to be of Hispanic

origin. Some of these differences (e.g. age and education) are likely to increase the relative

wages of nonprofit workers while others (sex, Hispanic origin, and work hours) probably reduce

them. Econometric analysis is needed to disentangle these effects.

       Table 4 displays the coefficient on nonprofit status from regressions of equation (1).

Each cell presents results for a separate specification. All of the models control for the survey

year, age, marital status, race/ethnicity, education, metropolitan residence, and public sector

employment. Columns (b), (d), and (e) add dummy variables for the seven industry categories;

specifications (c) and (d) hold constant the six occupation groups; model (e) also accounts for

usual weekly work hours. The employment characteristics refer to the “main” CPS job.

       Nonprofit employment is associated with an 11 percent wage penalty, controlling for

individual attributes but not industry or occupation. This is consistent with the differentials

obtained by other researchers (e.g. Preston, 1989; DuMond, 1997). Adding the vector of

occupation variables modestly increases the gap (to 14 percent). Conversely, including industry

controls virtually eliminates the wage penalty (model b) and when work hours are also held

constant (column e), the average nonprofit job is predicted to pay a slight (1 percent) premium.25



25
  Information on work hours is missing for around 6 percent of respondents. To avoid excluding these
individuals, they are assigned a value of zero work hours and a dummy variable for missing hours is

                                                Page 14
These results imply that nonprofit employment is concentrated in low paying industries and that

observationally equivalent nonprofit and for-profit workers in the same industry receive identical

wages.26 Leete (forthcoming) has recently obtained a similar result. However, to eliminate the

cross-sectional differential, she controlled for 226 (3-digit) industries and 206 occupations or (in

many specifications) around 20,000 industry-occupation interactions. This contrasts with just 7

industries (and no occupations) in this analysis.

        The average wage gaps conceal significant differences across demographic groups, with

relatively high nonprofit earnings received by females, blacks, and Hispanics. The nonprofit

differential in specification (a) is -7, -2, and -7 percent for these groups, versus -20 percent for

males and -13 percent for whites. Holding industry and work hours constant (column e) shrinks

but does not eliminate the disparities –women, blacks and Hispanics receive 3, 7, and 6 percent

nonprofit premiums, compared to no differential for whites and a 3 percent penalty for males.27

        As mentioned, these results may understate the nonprofit pay differential because some

persons employed by nonprofits erroneously report working for profit-seeking organizations. A

simplified version of the formula derived by Leete (forthcoming) shows that the ratio of the

observed to actual gap in log wages (G) is:

                                                    φρ
(7)                                     G=1-                 ,
                                                φρ + (1 − ρ)



included. However, the results are very similar when these persons are deleted from the sample. Models
were also estimated with weekly work hours controlled for but without industry variables. These yield an
overall nonprofit differential of 5.7 percent, with a standard error of 0.4 percent.
26
   Weekly earnings are top-coded at $1,920 in 1994-1997 and $2,880 in 1998. The top-coding affects 1.6
percent of workers in for-profit companies and 1.4 percent in nonprofit enterprises. Two sets of cross-
sectional models were estimated to provide a crude test of bias due to censoring. The first deletes
observations with top-coded wage. In the second, persons with top-coded values were assigned earnings
equal to twice the censored amount (i.e. $3,840 through 1997 and $5,760 in 1998). The overall nonprofit
wage penalty (without controls for industry, occupation or work hours) is estimated to be 11 percent in
the first model and 12 percent in the second. Both are close to the corresponding estimate in Table 4.



                                                Page 15
where ρ is the employment share of nonprofits and φ is the reporting error rate among nonprofit

workers. Evidence presented in section 4 suggests that ρ=.067 and φ=.18. Substituting these

values into equation (7) indicates that the observed wage differential is 98.7 percent as large as

the actual gap, implying that the preceding results only very slightly understate the nonprofit gap.

                           6. Wage Changes for the ORG Panel Sample

        We next investigate wage changes between years 1 and 2 for the ORG panel sample. A

potential problem is that some reported movements from nonprofit to for-profit jobs (or the

reverse) probably reflect classification error. Most obviously, this occurs if respondents not

switching jobs misreport the employer type in one of the two years.28 The resulting

measurement error introduces noise and will attenuate the estimated nonprofit coefficients. For

this reason, we only set the dummy variables indicating changes in the class of employer to one

when the respondent states that such a switch has occurred and reports moving to either a new 3-

digit industry or occupation. Requiring a change in industry or occupation makes it much more

likely that a job transition has taken place, substantially reducing the classification bias.

        Table 5 documents the pattern of earnings changes. The first column shows the average

growth in (log) wages between years 1 and 2. The second and third columns provide sample

means for respondents making N → P and P → N transitions. Earnings rise faster for persons

switching from nonprofit to for-profit jobs than for those making the reverse move (11 versus 5

percent), suggesting lower pay in the nonprofit sector after controlling for transferable individual

characteristics. However, there is no difference for females or blacks, which further hints that

the nonprofit sector offers them comparatively favorable employment opportunities.



27
   Preston (1990) argues that the over-representation of females in nonprofits is entirely due to higher
compensation received in these jobs. She does not perform a corresponding analysis for nonwhites.
28
   Reported changes in employment type could be dominated by classification error even if most
respondents accurately indicate the class of employer.

                                                  Page 16
        The econometric estimates are summarized in Table 6. Model (a) refers to an equation

without controls for industry or work hours; specification (b) adds the seven industry dummy

variables; column (c) also holds constant weekly work hours. The first three columns refer to

cross-sectional wage regressions corresponding to equation (1). These results, which are

virtually identical to corresponding specifications in Table 4, provide a baseline comparison for

the wage change equations presented in the next five columns. As mentioned, the symmetric

models constrain the change in relative wages to be of equal magnitude for P → N and N → P

moves, whereas the asymmetric specifications do not.29

        The symmetric first difference models reveal an overall nonprofit wage gap averaging

between 2 and 3 percent, with relatively high earnings once again received by females and blacks

(but not Hispanics) employed in nonprofit jobs. The estimated nonprofit differentials are

insensitive to the inclusion of controls for industry or work hours (see models a through c),

which is expected since the change equations automatically account for time-invariant individual

effects. The asymmetric models predict a 4 percent average increase in weekly wages for

persons making N → P moves, compared to a 2 percent decline for P → N transitions. This

difference is anticipated if the P → N switches understate the nonprofit penalty, as discussed

above. However, the disparities are small and statistically insignificant for all groups, indicating

that there is little cost to imposing the assumption of symmetric wage changes.

                                       7. Displaced Workers

        Table 7 summarizes the results for displaced workers. As noted, nonprofit workers rarely

lose jobs so this is not a representative sample of either all employees or job changers. The four

columns labeled “transition hazard rates” show the probability of entering the destination



29
   The asymmetric model presented in the table includes controls for industries and work hours. Similar
results are obtained in specifications without these regressors.

                                                Page 17
employer type conditional on initial status. It is noteworthy that P → N transitions almost never

occur. Only 3 percent of persons displaced from for-profit companies work for nonprofits at the

survey date, compared to 92 percent by profit-seeking firms (and 5 percent in government

positions). The majority (57 percent) of those losing nonprofit jobs also enter for-profit

employment, versus 29 percent who remain with nonprofits (and 14 percent in government jobs).

       The cross-sectional equations indicate broadly similar predisplacement earnings for

persons terminated from nonprofit and for-profit positions. There is some suggestion of a small

nonprofit penalty, but this disappears when industry controls are included (compare columns a

and b) and the nonprofit coefficient is never significant. The wage change equations also supply

some indication of a nonprofit penalty in the absence of industry regressors; however, this is

again eliminated by adding industry covariates, and the parameters are imprecisely estimated.

Small sample sizes, particularly for nonwhites, and nonrandomness of the displacement process

imply that these results should be interpreted with caution. Generally, the small overall nonprofit

differentials, combined with more favorable effects for females and blacks than for males or

whites, are consistent with the results obtained using the ORG data.

                             8. Intra-Industry Wage Differentials

       Table 8 displays the findings of cross-sectional and wage change equations for ORG

respondents working in three specific industries – hospitals, nursing/personal care facilities, and

social services. Together, these industries account for 49 percent of nonprofit employment but

each also has substantial involvement by for-profit companies.30 Cross-sectional regressions,

corresponding to equation (1), were run for the full sample and for workers matched in years 1

and 2. Symmetric wage change equations were also estimated for persons employed in the same




                                               Page 18
industry in both survey years. This sample restriction avoids confounding the effects of industry

mobility with those resulting from changes in the type of employer. Specification (b) controls

for work hours, whereas specification (a) does not. Since the sample for each regression is

limited to a single industry, none of the models include industry covariates.

        The cross-sectional results suggest the presence of nonprofit wage premiums within the

three narrowly defined industries. Nonprofit hospital workers earn a statistically significant 3 to

7 percent more than their peers. An even larger 4 to 11 percent differential is obtained in the

social services, while nonprofit nursing facilities offer a 2 to 5 percent pay premium.

Interestingly, models estimated for subsamples stratified by race and sex (not shown), provide no

consistent evidence of higher relative nonprofit earnings for women or minorities than for men or

whites, suggesting that the relatively favorable “effects” observed above may have been due to

inadequately controlling for the industrial composition of nonprofit employment.31

        The first difference models indicate that switching between nonprofit and profit-seeking

employers has dramatically different effects on wage growth across the three industries. The

predicted pay progression of hospital workers is unaffected by N → P transitions; whereas,

similar mobility increases the expected earnings growth of nursing homes employees by a

statistically significant 18 percent while lowering the predicted wage increases of social service

workers by an insignificant 4 percent.




30
   Education and religious organizations employ around a quarter of the nonprofit labor force but have
limited participation by for-profits. Other professional industries account for an eighth of nonprofit jobs
but are extremely diverse and dominated by profit-seeking enterprises.
31
   The estimated nonprofit differential (in specification b) is 5.8, 6.3, and –0.9 percent for males in the
hospital, nursing home, and social services industries versus 2.5, 4.7, and 13.4 percent for females. The
differentials are 3.1, 4.4, and 11.0 percent for whites and 4.1, 7.1, and 11.3 percent for blacks.

                                                  Page 19
                                           9. Discussion

       The econometric analysis yields five main conclusions. First, holding constant individual

characteristics, average weekly wages are 11 percent lower in nonprofit than for-profit jobs.

However, the inclusion of industry controls eliminates the pay gap and, if anything, nonprofit

workers receive a small premium when differences in work hours are also accounted for. By

contrast, the differential is unrelated to the occupational distribution of nonprofit jobs. Second,

the wage changes experienced by persons switching types of employers suggest a nonprofit

penalty of between 2 and 4 percent. Third, the nonprofit sector offers relatively high pay to

females and blacks, although this is again largely explained by industry differences in the

composition of nonprofit employment. Fourth, the nonprofit differentials estimated for job

losers are generally consistent with those for other individuals, although small sample sizes and

nonrandomness of the displacement process require these results to be interpreted cautiously.

Fifth, nonprofit workers in hospitals, nursing/personal care facilities, and social services earn at

least as much as their observably similar counterparts, but the effect of changing between

nonprofit and for-profit employment varies substantially across the three industries.

       What do these results tell us about wage-setting in the nonprofit sector? The virtual

absence of nonprofit wage penalty, after controlling for industry, suggests that the scope of labor

donations to nonprofits by paid employees is limited. However, movements from nonprofit to

for-profit jobs are associated with relative wage increases of around 4 percent, raising the

possibility of modest amounts of donated labor. Differences in worker quality or philanthropic

wage-setting are also unlikely to predominate in explaining the observed patterns of pay. If

lower nonprofit wages resulted from the use of poor quality employees, the differential would be

robust to the inclusion of industry controls. And neither explanation predicts wage increases for

individuals moving from nonprofit to profit-seeking enterprises. Nevertheless, quality


                                               Page 20
differences or attenuated property rights may be relevant in some sectors. For instance, nonprofit

nursing home workers earn more than their peers employed by profit-seekers and experience

relative wage reductions when switching into for-profit jobs, as predicted by the rent-sharing

model. However, the nonprofit premiums do not dissipate when hospital or social service

workers make similar moves, suggesting that the higher initial wages result from transferable

individual characteristics rather than the payment of rents.

        The most important finding is that the low average nonprofit wages reflect the

concentration of these jobs in low-paying industries. This could take place because

disadvantaged groups (such as blacks and women) or low quality workers are selected into these

sectors. In this case industry controls would absorb a portion of the “true” nonprofit differential.

However, this seems unlikely. Models emphasizing restricted job availability (e.g. Bergmann,

1974) typically focus on occupations rather than industries and it is not obvious what mechanism

might limit access to the latter, given the broad set of occupations they employ. The low wages

might also occur if nonprofits locate in relatively competitive industries. Many industries with

high nonprofit shares are quite competitive, justifying further investigation of the role of market

structure in determining the patterns of pay.32

        An alternative explanation is that nonprofit jobs offer low pay because they are prevalent

in industries offering positive compensating differentials. If for-profit positions in the same

industries provide similar compensating differentials, no pay gap would be anticipated once

industries are controlled for. The relatively small wage changes associated with moves between



32
   Four-firm sales concentration ratios in the nursing/personal care facility and social service industries
were 14.8, and 7.9 percent in 1992 (Bureau of the Census, 1995). For comparison, Scherer and Ross
(1990) indicate four-firm sales concentration ratios of 20 percent or higher for more than 80 percent of
U.S. manufacturing industries in 1982. However, the relevant market is likely to be more localized for
service than manufacturing industries, so this comparison may overstate the competitiveness of the



                                                   Page 21
nonprofit and profit-seeking employers might then occur because job changers typically remain

in the same industry or move to ones offering similar nonwage benefits.

        Most obviously, nonprofits could disproportionately be represented in industries

performing “socially desirable” activities (e.g. helping the sick), resulting in a willingness of

workers to accept reduced compensation. This represents a variation of the labor donation

hypothesis. However, the key distinction is that individuals care not about the type of the

employer but rather about the goods or services they provide. When estimating the “pure” effect

of nonprofit status, as distinct from other specific attributes of the employer, it is therefore

appropriate to include industry controls.

        Another reason for lower weekly wages is that nonprofit employees work fewer hours

than their counterparts. An examination of work hours reveals the exact pattern hypothesized

above. Specifically, in a cross-sectional equation (estimated by OLS) nonprofit employment is

associated with a 1.7 per week reduction in work hours (with a standard error of .2 hours),

holding constant individual characteristics. Controlling for industries reduces the differential to

0.4 hours, and switchs from for-profit to nonprofit employment (between years 1 and 2) are

predicted to decrease them by just 0.2 work hours per week.

        Direct evidence on other compensating differentials is difficult to obtain. DuMond

(1997) indicates that pension and health insurance coverage (displacement rates) are relatively

high (low) for persons employed by nonprofit enterprises. This is consistent with the existence

of positive compensating differentials and makes it doubtful that nonprofits pay less because

they locate in more competitive sectors. However, his analysis is not definitive since it does not




sectors dominated by nonprofits. The four-firm concentration ratio is much higher for hospitals (47.7
percent) but this industry also pays relatively well.

                                                 Page 22
control for individual characteristics or the industry of employment.33 Finally, Gonyea (1999)

argues that nonprofit employers may be more sensitive to work-family issues, although the

evidence cited supporting this position is quite limited.




33
  The March Current Population Survey Annual Demographic file, used by DuMond, does not identify
the job providing the fringe benefits. This is problematic for persons holding multiple positions or
changing employers during the year.

          Appendix A: Construction of Longitudinal Sample from the ORG Files

       Households participate in the CPS for four months, followed by eight months out of the

sample and then four final months in it. The outgoing rotation groups include respondents in the

final months of each of the two periods (denoted years 1 and 2). The CPS contains household

identifiers (ID codes) and record line numbers but not individual codes. Individuals from the

same month in consecutive years can potentially be identified using the household ID codes and

record line numbers. The household ID represents a permanent residence and does not follow

families that relocate. The coding of the ID variable was changed from 12 to 15 characters in

July of 1995, implying that households whose ORG months crossed this date could not be

matched. Also, since different states sometimes use the same household ID, state (FIPS) codes

are needed to uniquely identify the household.

       The following procedure was used to create the ORG matched panel data set. First,

individual cross-sectional data sets were created for each of the years 1994 through 1998. The

samples were restricted to non-self employed persons working for pay and aged 25 through 55.

Second, the five annual data sets were merged and persons in time periods that were not

potentially matchable, because of changes in coding the household ID, were deleted. This

yielded a sample with 333,134 person-year observations, including 165,516 for year 1 and

167,618 at year 2. The sample was then sorted by year, month, household ID, state, and record

line. Several passes of the data were then used to limit the sample to cases where consecutive

observations were one year apart and had the same calendar month, household ID, state code,

and record line. This reduced the sample to 236,122 observations. To further insure that the

matched observations referred to the same individual, we deleted cases where there was a change

(between year 1 and 2) in sex or race, or more than a two year difference in age. (A two year age

difference was allowed because the surveys could take place on different days of the month.)


                                             Page 27
Finally, the matched pair was deleted if the first (second) observation was listed as the eighth

(fourth) month in sample, rather than the reverse. These restrictions reduced the sample to

107,422 individuals (214,844 person-year observations), corresponding to 64.5 percent of the

original sample and 64.9 percent of year 1 observations.

Note: See notes on Tables 1 and 2. All variable means are computed using CPS sampling
weights. The cross-section includes respondents in year 1 of the 1994-1998 Current Populatoin
Survey Outgoing Rotation Groups. The panel includes respondents for the same period who
could be matched in the fourth months of years 1 and 2. Job losers include respondents to the
1994, 1996, and 1998 Displaced Worker Supplements to the February CPS for whom data were
available on weekly wages in the predisplacement job and at the survey date. For the cross-
section and panel samples, all variables are measured at year 1. For job losers, the means are for
the survey date, except weekly wages and the sector, industry, and occupation of employment,
where they refer to the predisplacement job.

Note: The table shows the coefficient on a dummy variable indicating nonprofit status from a
series of regressions where the dependent variable is the natural log of weekly earnings for the
cross-sectional sample (in year 1). The equations also control for age and age squared, marital
status (currently married and never married), race/ethnicity (black, Hispanic), education (high
school graduate, some college, college graduate, post-graduate education), metropolitan
residence, the survey year, and government employment. Columns (b), (d), and (e) add
covariates for seven industry categories (hospitals, nursing/personal care facilities, social
services, other professional, religious organizations, primary/secondary education, higher
education); specifications (c) and (d) include dummy variables for six occupation categories
(non-health professional, health professional, administrative support, educator, service worker,
health technician); model (e) also controls for the number of hours worked per week. Standard
errors are in parentheses.

Note: The table shows (weighted) average changes in log wages, as a function of employment
status in years 1 and 2 for the ORG panel sample of persons matched in each year. The first
column displays the average change in (log) wages between years 1 and 2 for all sample
members. The second and third columns indicate corresponding wage changes for persons
transitioning between the nonprofit and for-profit sectors, over the two years, and changing three
digit industries or occupations. Sample sizes are shown in brackets.

metropolitan residence, the survey year, and dummy variables indicating employment in government jobs or corresponding transitions
into or out of government positions. Column (b) adds controls for the seven industry categories and model (c) also holds constant
weekly work hours (in the wage levels equations) or the change in work hours (in the change specifications). The wage level models
show the nonprofit differential from estimates of: Wi1= Xi1β + Ni1γ + εi1, where Ni1 is a dummy variable indicating whether respondent
i works for a nonprofit employer in year 2. The symmetric wage change equations take the form: Wi2 – Wi1 = Xi2β + (Ni2 – Ni1)γ +
εi; the table displays γˆ . The asymmetric specifications are: Wi2 – Wi1 = Xi2β + NPiγ1 + PNiγ2 + εi, where NPi (PNi) is a dummy
variable indicating movement nonprofit to for-profit (for-profit to nonprofit) employers between years 1 and 2. The table displays
 − γˆ1 and γˆ2 for specification (c), with controls for industry and work hours.

Notes: See notes on tables 4 and 6. Data are for job losers from the 1994, 1996, and 1998 Displaced Worker Supplements to the
February CPS who report weekly wages in both the pre- and post-displacement jobs. The transition hazard rates indicate the
probability of holding a specified type of post-displacement employment conditional on the class of the predisplacement job (e.g.
 N → N indicates the probability of working in a nonprofit job at the survey date conditional on having worked for a nonprofit
employer prior to displacement). These probabilities are calculated using DWS sampling weights. The wage level models show γˆ
from estimates of: Wid = Xiβ + Nidγ + εi, where the subscript d indicates the predisplacement job; (these are predisplacement
differentials). The wage change equations take the form: Wis – Wid = Xiβ + (Nis – Nid)γ + εi, where the s subscript indicates the
survey date and all of the covariates refer to values at this date; the table displays γˆ . All of the models also control for age and age
squared, marital status, race/ethnicity, education, metropolitan residence, the survey year, and government employment. Specification
(b) includes controls for the industry of employment, whereas specification (a) does not.
