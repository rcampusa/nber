The Relationship Between Health and Growth: When Lucas Meets Nelson-Phelps

                                             ABSTRACT

This paper revisits the relationship between health and growth in light of modern endogenous growth
theory. We propose a unified framework that encompasses the growth effects of both the rate of improvement
of health and the level of health. Based on cross-country regressions over the period 1960-2000, where
we instrument for both variables, we find that a higher initial level and a higher rate of improvement
in life expectancy both have a significantly positive impact on per capita GDP growth. Then, restricting
attention to OECD countries, we find supportive evidence that only the reduction in mortality below
age forty generates productivity gains, which in turn may explain why the positive correlation between
health and growth in cross-OECD country regressions appears to have weakened since 1960.

1     Introduction

Can health explain cross-country diﬀerences in levels and growth rates of income? This question is of primary
importance, in particular in current debates on the costs and benefits of new health programs. For example,
public support for more universal health coverage is obviously aﬀected by whether or not people believe
that improved health raises growth. While left-leaning politicians would still advocate such programs even
if they were not growth-enhancing, the programs would gain consensus if it could be shown, as it has been
for education, that improving health is another way to increase a country’s growth potential.
    Basic economic intuition, supported by partial empirical evidence, suggests that health should somehow
matter for growth. First, individuals with higher life expectancy are likely to save more, and savings in
turn feed back into capital accumulation and therefore into GDP growth as shown for instance by Zhang,
Zhang and Lee (2003). Second, individuals with higher life expectancy are likely to invest more (or to have
their parents invest more) in education, which in turn should be growth-enhancing1 . In an environment
marked by low child mortality, parents are likely to choose a low level of fertility2 , which limits the growth
of total population and supports per capita GDP growth. Finally, and more directly, healthier individuals
are typically more productive, better at creating and adapting to new technologies and generally more able
to cope with the rapid changes characteristic of a high growth environment.3
    A convenient way to address the relationship between health and growth is to look at health as a particular
form of human capital (see Weil, 2007). Then, drawing on the parallel between health and education, one
can distinguish between two basic approaches. A first approach, based on Mankiw-Romer-Weil (1992) and
Lucas (1988), would view health as a regular factor of production. Accordingly, output growth should be
correlated with the rate of improvement of health, in particular with the increase in life expectancy in a
country or region. A second approach, based on Nelson and Phelps (1966), would argue that a higher stock
of health spurs growth by facilitating technological innovation and/or technological adoption. Accordingly,
productivity growth should be positively correlated with the level of health, in particular with the initial or
the average level of life expectancy in a country or region over a given period.
    Both approaches have been followed by the existing macroeconomic literature on health and income/growth.
Thus, Acemoglu and Johnson (2007), henceforth AJ, follow a Lucas approach and regress income growth
on the increase in life expectancy between 1940 and 1980. To instrument for the growth of life expectancy,
   1 Miguel and Kremer (2004) as well as Jayachandran and Lleras-Muney (2009) provide convincing microeconomic evidence

that better health increases human capital investments.
   2 See Lee(2003) and Galor (2005) for a discussion of the demographic transition. Using a large panel of countries spanning

over the late XIXth and XXth centuries, Murtin (2009) displays empirical evidence that child mortality has been significantly
and positively associated with fertility.
   3 Howitt (2005) provides a framework for incorporating health improvements into an innovation-based growth model, which

emphasizes the direct eﬀects of health, especially early childhood health, on the pace of technological change.




                                                             2
AJ exploit the wave of health innovations that occurred as of the 1950s and aﬀected all countries world-
wide: more precisely, they use the pre-intervention distribution of mortality from 15 diseases and the dates of
global interventions to construct a country-varying instrument for life expectancy. Then, when regressing per
capita GDP growth on the growth of life expectancy over the 1940-1980 period, AJ find that improvements
in life expectancy over that period have no significant positive eﬀect. In contrast, Lorentzen, McMillan and
Wacziarg (2008), henceforth LMW, adopt a Nelson-Phelps approach and regress per capita GDP growth
on average child and adult mortality rates over the period 1960-2000. LMW use seventeen instruments for
these two mortality indicators: a malaria ecology index - originally developed by Sachs et al. (2004) - which
captures the exogenous portion of malaria incidence, twelve climate variables, and four geographic features
of countries, which are unlikely to be aﬀected by human activity and more particularly by income levels or
growth rates. LMW then find a strong eﬀect of mortality rates on income growth. In particular, they find
that adult mortality alone can account for all of Africa’s growth shortfall over the 1960-2000 period.4 ,5
    In this paper we combine the two approaches and look at the joint eﬀect of health and health accumulation
on economic growth, much in the spirit of Krueger and Lindahl (2001), who performed a similar exercise
when looking at the eﬀect of education on growth. We first develop a unified framework for analyzing the
relationship between health and growth, which embeds both level and accumulation eﬀects. Then moving
to the empirical part, we run cross-country growth regressions over the period 1960-2000 (the same period
as in Krueger-Lindahl) and show that over that period both the level and the accumulation of health have
significant positive eﬀects on growth of per capita GDP, even when we use the LMW instruments for the
level and accumulation of life expectancy. We also show that these instruments pass such standard tests as
the Hansen test for joint exogeneity of instruments and the Stock-Yogo test for weak instruments. Our basic
results are further confirmed by a robustness analysis which uses Bayesian techniques to assess the influence
of potential endogeneity biases on OLS estimates. Testing the influence of various priors on the probability
distribution of the correlation between residuals and explanatory variables, we find a robust positive eﬀect
of initial life expectancy and a somewhat less robust eﬀect of life expectancy growth. Together our results
also suggest that the omission of initial life expectancy, or the omission of the growth of life expectancy,
from the RHS of our growth regressions may generate a downward bias on the estimated coeﬃcients.
    The key to reconciling our results with those of AJ is convergence in life expectancy. As we document
   4 In  addition, LMW disentangle the negative eﬀects of mortality on investment and human capital accumulation from its
positive eﬀect on the fertility rate, and they find that investment and fertility are the strongest channels underlying the positive
eﬀect of health on growth.
   5 That the level of life expectancy should matter for growth is also consistent with recent work by Doppelhofer et al. (2004)

and Cervellati and Sunde (2009). The latter show that the level of initial life expectancy is a strong predictor of the growth rate in
fertility. As a result, introducing initial life expectancy inside the regression helps control for the eﬀect of demographic transition.
In particular the late decline in fertility should reduce population growth and thereby mitigate the negative Malthusian eﬀect
of growth in life expectancy upon per capita GDP growth. The former use Bayesian averaging models techniques to show that
the initial level of life expectancy is one of the most robust determinant of economic growth.



                                                                   3
below, growth of life expectancy is strongly negatively correlated with initial life expectancy across countries,
over both the 1940-80 and 1960-2000 periods. AJ show that countries where life expectancy grew rapidly
did not tend to experience more rapid income growth; but according to our results that was only because
these same countries also typically started with lower initial levels of health, which oﬀset the positive growth
eﬀect of their rapid improvement in health.
    Finally, we look more closely at the relationship between health and growth across various types of
countries and focus on OECD countries. We find a weaker relationship over the contemporary period, and
interpret this finding as reflecting an age-specific productivity eﬀect of health. Indeed, as of 1960, a large
share of the growth of life expectancy at birth appears to be related to a reduction in mortality at old age,
but we find that it is mostly the decrease in the mortality of individuals aged forty or less that matters for
growth.
    The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 lays out the theoretical framework. Section 3 describes
the data and the empirical methodology and presents our basic cross-country regression results. Section 4
discusses these results along three dimensions; first it analyzes the tradeoﬀ between multicollinearity and
endogeneity bias that is created by convergence in life expectancy; then it presents a Bayesian analysis of
endogeneity bias in our OLS results, and finally it presents the results from cross-OECD panel regressions.
Section 5 concludes by summarizing our results and suggesting avenues for future research.



2     A simple theoretical framework

In this section we sketch a simple model where the accumulation and level of health both matter for growth.
Final output is produced with human capital (health) so that per capita GDP is given in any period by


                                                   Y = AH β


where 0 < β < 1, H is the current stock of human capital, and A is a productivity parameter. Intuitively, a
higher level of health makes labor more productive and therefore increases the amount of eﬃciency labor in
the economy. Using lower case letters to denote natural logs, we have


                                                  y = a + βh                                                 (1)


Equation (1) embodies the Lucas eﬀect of human capital, which implies that the accumulation of health
(namely ḣ) should have a positive eﬀect on output growth (ẏ).



                                                       4
    Productivity itself evolves over time according to the Nelson-Phelps equation


                                            ȧ = θ(a − a) + αh + δ                                         (2)


where a is the log of the current world frontier productivity and where θ, α, δ are all constants. Intuitively,
the higher the stock of health and therefore the higher h, the higher is the level of cognitive ability in the
population, and therefore the easier it is for current productivity a to catch up with the “current world best
practice” a.
    Combining (1) and (2), we see that growth of per capita GDP should depend upon both the level and
accumulation of human capital, according to:


                                       g = ẏ = θ(a − a) + αh + β ḣ + δ


Alternatively, we can express this growth equation as


                                     g = δ + θa − θy + (α + βθ) h + β ḣ                                   (3)


which says that growth of per capita GDP should depend negatively upon its initial level, positively upon
the level and accumulation rate of health, and positively upon current world productivity.
   We test this equation in the remaining part of the paper, using cross country panel data. Note that if
                                                       ³       ´   ³       ´
θ = 0 then growth cannot depend on all three variables a, h, ḣ or y, h, ḣ , just on two of them.



3     Empirical analysis

In this section, we describe our empirical methodology and data, and then we present and discuss the
empirical results.


3.1    Empirical methodology

In line with equation (3), we will estimate the equation:


                           ∆ log yi = a + b∆ log LEi + c log LEi,0 + d log yi,0 + ui                       (4)


where ∆ log yi is the change per year in the log of per capita GDP in country i over a given time period,
multiplied by 100; ∆ log LEi is the change per year in the log of life expectancy in that country over the same


                                                      5
period, also multiplied by 100; log LEi,0 is the log of life expectancy at the beginning of the period; log yi,0
is initial log per capita GDP and ui is a residual term.6 Equation (4) embeds the pure Lucas approach if
one assumes that c = 0, as well as the pure Nelson-Phelps approach if b = 0. Each regression shown in this
section will be run three times: with the Lucas restriction c = 0, with the Nelson-Phelps restriction b = 0,
and without either restriction.
    We will provide both OLS and IV estimations for all our cross-country regressions, which span the
period 1960-2000. Measuring growth over a forty year period enables us to reduce measurement errors
aﬀecting growth of per capita GDP or life expectancy. Hauck and Wacziarg (2009) show that panel fixed-
eﬀects estimators typically magnify this problem of measurement error; hence our emphasis on cross-country
regressions. However, when restricting attention to OECD countries, we will exploit the time dimension and
run panel regressions using ten-year periods in order to avoid potential small sample size issues.


3.2       Data and summary statistics

We exploit two databases: the LMW data that cover 96 countries over the period 1960-2000,7 and the OECD
(2009) health database that provides information on life expectancy at various ages (0, 40, 60 and 80 years)
across OECD countries from 1960 onwards.
    Table 1 summarizes the main data sample drawn from LMW. The Table shows average per capita GDP
and average life expectancy among high-income countries and among low/middle-income countries from the
LMW sample over the period 1960-2000.8 Not surprisingly, we see that high-income countries achieved much
larger gains in per capita GDP but smaller increases in life expectancy than low/middle-income countries
over this period. To facilitate discussion of the quantitative importance of our coeﬃcient estimates, Table 1
also includes data on the Sub Saharan subsample of LMW.

                                                     T ABLE 1 HERE
   6 We  interpret ∆ log yi and ∆ log LEi as annual growth rates measured in percentage points, and refer to them as “growth
of per capita GDP” and “growth of life expectancy” respectively.
   7 The per capita GDP data, the child and adult mortality rates, the life expectancy data, as well as various sources for

their 17 instrument variables, are all drawn from the World Bank’s World Development Indicators (2004) data set. As quoted
from LMW, the malaria ecology index combines “the presence of diﬀerent mosquito vector types and the human biting rate
of the diﬀerent mosquito vectors" (Sachs et al. 2004). LMW add eleven climate variables borrowed from the Koeppen-Geiger
climate zones classification: tropical rainforest climate, its monsoon variety, tropical savannah climate, steppe climate, desert
climate, mild humid climate with no dry season, mild humid climate with a dry summer, mild humid climate with a dry winter,
snowy-forest climate with a dry winter, snowy-forest climate with a moist winter and highland climate. Finally, they add
a variable measuring the proportion of land with more than five days of frost per month in winter, as well as the following
geographical variables: the distance of a country’s centroid from the equator, the mean distance to the nearest coastline, the
average elevation, and the log of land area.
   8 Life expectancy has been defined as the non-weighted average of male and female life expectancy.




                                                               6
3.3        Cross country OLS regressions

Table 2 shows the results of cross country OLS regressions. Columns I and II reproduce the LMW methodol-
ogy.9 Regressing growth of per capita GDP on the level of health as measured by the average child and adult
mortality rates over the 1960-2000 period, we find a negative coeﬃcient on these mortality indicators. If we
believe the estimates in column II indicate causality, adding up the eﬀects of child and adult mortality as
well as cross-country convergence, accounts for a growth gap of 2.55 percentage points between Sub-Saharan
Africa and high-income countries.10 Next, columns III and IV show that the regression coeﬃcients are not
significantly aﬀected when substituting child and adult mortality rates in 1960 for their average values over
the period, in other words when moving to a more standard Nelson-Phelps approach. This result is not so
surprising as mortality rates evolve slowly over time: for example, the correlation between the 1960 adult
mortality rate and its grand average over the 1960-2000 period is equal to 0.93. Columns V and VI focus
on a diﬀerent explanatory variable, namely the log of life expectancy, while still adopting a Nelson-Phelps
approach. Doing so makes the analysis more comparable with that in AJ, which similarly looks at life
expectancy rather than mortality rates. Qualitatively, choosing life expectancy rather than mortality indica-
tors for health does not seem to make a big diﬀerence since we find that initial 1960 log of life expectancy11
is significantly and positively correlated with per capita GDP growth. In addition, the magnitude of the
regression coeﬃcient is broadly comparable to what we obtain using mortality rates instead.12
    Columns VII and VIII introduce the Lucas approach, whereby one regresses growth of per capita GDP
on growth of life expectancy. We find a non-significant coeﬃcient of the growth of life expectancy, even
after controlling for initial log per capita GDP. In substance, this result is consistent with AJ’s findings
of a non-positive eﬀect of life expectancy growth on per capita GDP growth, even though here we look at
diﬀerent time periods. Finally, columns IX and X combine the Lucas and Nelson-Phelps approaches, and
we find that there is a strong, positive and highly significant coeﬃcient of both the initial level and growth
rate of life expectancy over the period.

                                                    T ABLE 2 HERE

    The comparison between columns V and VII, or between columns VI and VIII, shows that the Lucas and
   9 See  LMW, page 93, Table 4, column 1.
  1 0 With  respectively 50 and 17 deaths per 1000 adults in Sub-Saharan Africa and high-income countries, and accounting for
the LMW normalization of adult mortality, the latter variable vehicles a gap of 5 x (0.5-0.17) = 1.65 percentage points of
annualized growth all along the period. As Sub-Saharan 1960 infant mortality was about 150 deaths per 1000 births, versus
roughly 20 in developed countries, infant mortality implies a gap of 20.85 x (0.15-0.02) = 2.7 percentage points of growth.
On the other hand, according to Table 1, the convergence eﬀect would imply a catch-up of about 1.03 x (log(7820/1354)) =
1.8 percentage points. The combined eﬀect of convergence, adult and child mortality therefore amounts to a growth gap of
1.65+2.7-1.8 = 2.55 percentage points.
  1 1 Similar results obtain if we simply use life expectancy as our health variable.
  1 2 Indeed, according to the data in Table 1, the gap in life expectancy between a developed country and a Sub-Saharan African

country would entail a 6.53 x log(68.3/39.2) = 3.6 percentage points gap in growth rates. Convergence would imply a catch-up
of 1.8 percentage points. Thus, overall, this regression can explain up to a 1.8 percentage point growth gap.


                                                               7
Nelson-Phelps approaches lead to diﬀerent conclusions on the country samples, as they respectively display
significant and insignificant correlations between (improved) life expectancy and per capita GDP growth.
When combining the two approaches, that is, when regressing per capita GDP growth on both the initial
level and the increase in life expectancy over the period, we find that: (i) both the accumulation and initial
level in life expectancy are positively associated with income growth; ii) the magnitude of the coeﬃcient
on initial life expectancy is larger than that obtained when following a pure Nelson-Phelps approach. In
fact, the combined approach corrects for biases arising from the omitted variable problems in both the pure
Lucas and pure Nelson-Phelps strategies, as witnessed by the increase in explained variance when regressing
growth over both the level of and increase in life expectancy.
    The magnitudes of our coeﬃcient estimates reinforce the point made by LMW, namely that health seems
to have an important eﬀect on growth: for instance, if we use the estimates in column X of Table 2, the gap
in 1960 life expectancy between developed and developing countries shown in Table 1 implies a diﬀerence
in average per capita GDP growth of 7.82 x log(68.3/47.6) = 2.8 percentage points between 1960 and 2000.
The eﬀect of initial life expectancy thus plays in favor of the developed countries. On the other hand, the
average growth of life expectancy over that period has been slightly faster in developing countries, which
in turn gives developing countries a per capita GDP growth advantage equal to 154.25 x (log(59.9/47.6)-
log(77.5/68.3))/40 = 0.40 percentage points. Combining the level and accumulation eﬀects, our approach
implies that diﬀerences in health between developed and developing countries over that period account for
an annual growth gap of 2.8-0.4 = 2.4 percentage points.


3.4     Instrumentation

To address endogeneity issues, we instrument for both the initial level and growth of life expectancy using
the LMW instruments; i.e., the Malaria Ecology index developed by Sachs et al. (2004) and the sixteen
climatic and geographical variables. The results are displayed in Table 3,13 which reports the corresponding
F-statistics and Shea’s R2 statistics from first-stage regressions. These statistics are high, with for instance
F-test p-values lying below 0.01. In addition, we run the Hansen-J test of overidentifying restrictions, which
is robust to the presence of heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation. In all regressions but that shown in
column I, we fail to reject the null hypothesis of the joint exogeneity of our instrumental variables, which
suggests that our geographical and climate variables operate through the life expectancy channel to impact
  1 3 As we focus on the 1960-2000 period, we cannot use AJ’s predicted mortality at initial date as an instrument for growth

of life expectancy because many global health interventions have already taken place by 1960. Also, the use of this instrument
relies on the assumption that initial mortality - in almost equal terms, initial life expectancy - does not matter for subsequent
growth in GDP per capita, an assumption that amounts to imposing the pure Lucas approach a priori. Relaxing this assumption
by itself precludes the use of the AJ instrument.




                                                               8
per capita GDP growth14 . As a further robustness check, we run the Stock-Yogo tests of weak instruments,
as several climatic and geographical variables are never significant in first-stage regressions. On columns I
and III (respectively II and IV), the test rejects the null hypothesis that the relative bias on IV estimates
caused by weak instruments is at maximum equal to 20% (respectively 10% and 30%). However, this result
is obtained using the full set of LMW instruments. When poor instruments are excluded as in columns V
and VI, the Stock-Yogo test rejects the null hypothesis of a maximal relative bias of magnitude 10%.
    We now briefly describe the substantive results in Table 3. Column I adopts the Lucas approach and
shows an insignificant and negligible eﬀect of the growth of life expectancy, thereby confirming the result
found in former OLS regressions. Similarly, the IV approach validates the OLS result drawn from the
Nelson-Phelps approach, namely that of a significant and positive impact of initial life expectancy as shown
in column II. Next, instrumenting the combined regression in columns III and IV confirms our previous
results from combined OLS regressions: namely, a positive and significant eﬀect of both the initial level and
growth of life expectancy on per capita GDP growth. Reducing the set of instruments hardly changes the

    Both level and accumulation eﬀects are found to be large in magnitude. As already emphasized by
LMW, initial diﬀerences in health have heavily contributed to Africa’s growth shortfall. Using column VI
as a benchmark, the gap in life expectancy between rich countries and Sub Saharan Africa in 1960 entails a
huge gap in per capita GDP growth of 8.1 x log(68.3/39.2) = 4.5 percentage points. The later gap is oﬀset
somewhat by the fact that the percentage growth in life expectancy shown in Table 1 was larger in Sub
Saharan Africa than in rich countries, but this oﬀset only amounts to 0.3 percentage points. According to
these estimates the combined eﬀect of the initial level and growth of life expectancy on the growth gap is
4.2 percentage points. This was compensated by a convergence eﬀect linked to initial diﬀerences in income,
which reduces it to an annual diﬀerence of 4.2-2.1=2.1 percentage points of annual growth15 . Furthermore,
this figure falls short of accounting for the HIV/AIDS impact, which has in some Sub Saharan countries
lowered life expectancy to the standards of the 1950s.16
    Overall, our results are in line with LMW’s finding that the causal eﬀect of health on growth is large.
This result is supported by several microeconomic studies examining the consequences of disease eradication,
  1 4 However, it should be noted that the Hansen test is only valid conditionally on the existence of some - in this case at least

two - valid instruments among the total set of instruments.
  1 5 According to Table 1 the convergence eﬀect equals 1.2 x log(7820/1354) = 2.1 percentage points.
  1 6 In South Africa, for example, life expectancy fell from 49.2 in 1960 to 47.8 in 2000, implying that diﬀerential growth in life

expectancy raised the South African growth gap (relative to developed countries) by an average of 172.58 x (log(77.5/68.3)-
log(47.8/49.2))/40 = 0.67 annual percentage points.

including Bleakley (2003, 2007) and Bleakley and Lange (2009). In contrast, Weil (2007) estimates the
macroeconomic impact of improvements in health observed at the microeconomic level, and argues that health
eﬀects are small. However, the latter analysis focuses on the impact of health upon workers’ productivity,
but abstracts from other economic dimensions (investment, fertility and so on). In that regard, Ashraf,
Lester and Weil (2008) analyze the channels though which mortality’s reduction impacts on per capita GDP,
and simulate the resulting income growth path. Their thoughtful analysis concludes that gains in income
from health improvement should be observed only on the long run, but much of their finding hinges on the
assumption that it takes 50 years for fertility to adjust to the decline in mortality.17 . Even if the literature
has acknowledged the fact that the decline in child mortality was not the main driver of fertility’s transition,
it remains a significant and important determinant. Accordingly, Murtin (2009) finds that child mortality
has been a significant and positive determinant of fertility at a global level over the XXth century. He finds
that child as well as adult mortality can account for two thirds of fertility’s decline in Europe between 1870
and 191018 . This suggests that health has an immediate impact upon fertility, and consequently, that health
improvement generates large per capita GDP growth.



4        Discussion

This section discusses three main issues: first, the multicollinearity versus omitted variable dilemma gener-
ated by convergence in life expectancy; second, the robustness of our OLS estimates to endogeneity bias;
and finally the correlations between growth and mortality by age when focusing on OECD countries.


4.1      Convergence, multicollinearity and the omitted variable bias

Over both the 1940-1980 and the 1960-2000 periods, life expectancy has converged across countries over
time. This is a well-known fact nicely analyzed by Becker, Philipson and Soares (2005). Thus, Figure 1
shows a powerful convergence eﬀect of the initial 1940 log of life expectancy on the growth of life expectancy
over the period 1940-1980, in AJ’s sample of countries. In turn, Figure 2 shows a somewhat weaker but still
significant convergence eﬀect over 1960-2000 in LMW’s sample. More precisely, the correlation coeﬃcient
between the two variables in the 1940-80 sample is -0.95, while in the 1960-2000 sample it is a more moderate
-0.46.
    For reasons we detail below, too high a high level of correlation between the two regressors raises a
  1 7 Actually, they find large income gains if the reduction in mortality triggers an immediate adjustment in fertility (see their

simulation described by Figure 11).
  1 8 Other findings suggests that primary education of the adult population is the main determinant of fertility. Income is

positively associated with fertility in early stages of development, explaining why a Malthusian income eﬀect eventually leads
to early fertility increases.



                                                                10
dilemma. Either one decides to simply omit one variable from the regression, which may introduce an
omitted variable bias, or both variables are included in the regression, which creates a multicollinearity
problem. This dilemma further motivated us to focus on the 1960-2000 period, over which the correlation
between the initial level and growth of life expectancy is lower.

   That the omission of one variable from our regression may lead to an underestimation of the other
coeﬃcient of interest has been mentioned in our introduction. In particular, over the period 1960-2000,
compared to pure Nelson-Phelps regressions, we find a higher magnitude for the eﬀect of initial health on
per capita GDP growth. And the conclusions from our combined regressions diﬀer even more radically from
what is suggested by pure Lucas regressions: these regressions show non-significant correlations between
per capita GDP growth and the growth of life expectancy, thereby suggesting that health should have no
significantly positive impact on per capita GDP growth. But suppose that, in line with our above model,
growth is truly aﬀected by both the level of health at the beginning of the period and by the improvement of
health over the period. Thus the relationship between health, its accumulation, and per capita GDP growth,
may be captured by regression equation (4). Now, let us also factor in the convergence in life expectancy
phenomenon. From an econometric point of view, convergence in life expectancy can be captured through a
linear regression of the form:
                                                      1
                                         ∆ log LEi = − log LEi,0 + vi ,                                        (5)
                                                      ρ

where vi is an error term.
   Plugging (5) into (4) yields:


                    ∆ log yi   = a + b∆ log LEi,0 + c(−ρ∆ log LEi + ρvi ) + d log yi,0 + ui

                               = a + (b − cρ)∆ log LEi,0 + d log yi,0 + wi


   In this equation, the coeﬃcient of ∆ log LEi picks up not only the eﬀect of life expectancy accumulation
b but also the negative correlation between the accumulation of health (the improvement in life expectancy)
and the initial level of health (or initial level of life expectancy). If the convergence coeﬃcient ρ is suﬃciently
high, it can lead to an insignificant or even negative sign for the coeﬃcient (b−cρ) in the Lucas-type regression
of per capita GDP growth on the accumulation of life expectancy. The fact that the negative correlation
ρ is large suggests that both the Lucas and the Nelson-Phelps approaches underestimate the eﬀects of
(improved) life expectancy on productivity growth, as both are contaminated by an omitted variable bias.

                                                        11
However, over the 1960-2000 period this bias turns out to be relatively smaller in the pure Nelson-Phelps
approach simply because of data statistical properties19 . Moving to the combined regression equation (4)
thus generates estimates that are greater than those obtained in pure Nelson-Phelps regressions, and it
restores the significance of life expectancy growth that was lost in the Lucas regressions. Overall, what
our discussion illustrates, is that ignoring either of the two (level or accumulation) eﬀects might generate
potentially misleading policy conclusions, especially when explanatory variables display significant degrees
of autocorrelation20 .
   On the other hand, including both the initial level and the growth of life expectancy in the regression
may raise a multicollinearity issue. As pointed out to us by Aart Kraay, this issue is particularly serious
when looking at the 1940-1980 period where the correlation between these two regressors is equal to -0.95.
One unpleasant and little-known consequence of multicollinearity is to magnify any endogeneity bias. Even
if each variable had a negligible impact on growth, a low level of endogeneity and a high correlation between
regressors could jointly create significant coeﬃcients. For that reason, any combined OLS or IV estimation
run over the 1940-1980 period, must be considered with suspicion. However, this multicollinearity issue is
not so serious over the 1960-2000 period where the correlation between the initial level and the growth of
life expectancy, is equal to -0.46. Put diﬀerently, the multicollinearity issue over that period, is no greater
than in most existing cross-country growth regressions (for example the correlation between the growth of
physical and in human capital has been of the same magnitude of 0.40 between 1960 and 2000).
   Overall, the above discussion argues in favor of including both the growth and initial levels in life ex-
pectancy as RHS regressors in order to avoid an omitted variable bias. However, we do it over the sole
1960-2000 period so as to avoid another econometric issue arising from multicollinearity.


4.2     Bayesian analysis of the endogeneity bias

An alternative way from the IV strategy to assess the influence of endogeneity issues in OLS regressions, is to
use Bayesian econometrics as suggested recently by Conley, Hansen and Rossi (2008) as well as Kraay (2008,
2010). The idea is to acknowledge the potential existence of an endogeneity bias by setting some prior on
the magnitude of this bias, and then to measure the influence of this prior on the estimates of the coeﬃcients
of interest. This method generalizes a pure OLS approach, which relies on the implicit (degenerate) prior
that the correlation between residuals and regressors is equal to zero with probability one.
   Consider again equation (4), and let us center all variables and standardize the two explanatory variables,
  1 9 From Table 2 one has b = 124.4, c = 4.15 and 1/ρ = 0.00645. This conveys a negative omitted variable bias in the Lucas

approach equal −cρ = −643.4, and a negative omitted variable bias in the Nelson-Phelps approach equal to −b/ρ = −0.80.
  2 0 In theory, one could make the same case for average years of schooling inside growth regressions. However, as shown by

Morrisson-Murtin (2009), convergence in education has been too weak over the 1960-2000 period to generate such a bias.



                                                            12
which results in estimating the linear model


                                                         y = Xβ + u


where X denotes the matrix containing normalized growth and initial level in life expectancy. Then, let
us assume joint normality for X and u, let us denote by ρ the 2x1 vector of correlations between the two
regressors and the residuals, by R the 2x2 covariance matrix of regressors, and by s2 the variance of residuals.
Assume also uninformative or diﬀuse prior distributions for β and s2 , but a non-degenerate prior for ρ.
    The magnitude and sign of the correlation between residuals and regressors are a priori ambiguous. For
example, unobserved factors that relate to health standards, may be positively correlated with both health
outcome variables and growth of per capita GDP, thereby producing a positive ρ. However, while unobserved
factors linked to technology (including health technology) or income standards may be positively correlated
with health outcome variables, they might be negatively correlated with per capita GDP growth as a result
of (cross-country) income convergence. This in turn will tend to generate a negative ρ. Overall, let us assume
in a first step that each component of ρ is uniformly and independently distributed on the interval [−r, r]
with r > 0. This generalizes the usual approach of assuming a mass point for each component of ρ at r = 0.
    The objective function for Bayesian estimation is the posterior distribution p((β, σ, ρ)/Z) set over pa-
rameters (β, σ, ρ) conditional upon the observations on Z = (y, X). Bayes rule implies that this posterior
distribution is proportional to the product of the likelihood with the prior distributions. In this applica-
tion, we are interested by the marginal posterior distribution for β, p(β/Z), which is equal to the posterior
distribution p((β, σ, ρ)/Z) averaged over σ and ρ. Because we did not select conjugate priors, the marginal
posterior distribution p(β/Z) has no closed-form expression. However, as in Kraay (2008, 2010), one can
compute its first two moments21 . Performing some rearrangements and making repeated use of the law of
iterated expectations, yields both the average and the variance of the posterior distribution p(β/Z), from
which one can compute a coeﬃcient of variation22 . Significance is then evaluated by comparing the coeﬃcient
of variation with some significance threshold. Noticing β̂ and ŝ2 for the OLS estimates, one has

                                                        r            Ã               !

  2 1 Kraay (2010) considers the case of IV estimation in which there are violations of the exclusion restriction. It is based on

Kraay (2008), which also discusses the OLS case where the regressor is correlated with the error term, as in the current section.
  2 2 We thank David Roodman and Aart Kraay for sharing these preliminary results from their ongoing work on the interactions

between multicollinearity and endogeneity.

Expectations can be evaluated by Monte-Carlo simulations. As a convenient threshold of significance, we
select a coeﬃcient of variation equal to 1/1.96=0.51 in analogy to the Gaussian case23 .
    Figure 3 describes the resulting coeﬃcient of variation for β with respect to r, the maximum level of the
endogenous correlation. We find that the coeﬃcient of initial life expectancy appears to be significant (and
positive) for the whole range of correlations between residuals and regressors. For growth of life expectancy,
the estimate becomes insignificant when the magnitude of endogeneity exceeds a level of correlation of about
0.17.

    Summing up, this analysis suggests that the initial level of life expectancy is a robust and positive
determinant of per capita GDP growth for a large range of potential endogeneity distortions. Growth of
life expectancy is a less robust determinant, as already suggested by IV estimates (Table 3 column V). Our
findings are unchanged when we consider other priors for the endogeneity bias24 .


4.3     Growth and life expectancy by age in OECD countries

In unreported regressions, we found that the correlations between productivity growth and the level and
growth rate in life expectancy in OECD are weak in the post-1960 period. This is not surprising: first,
cross-OECD diﬀerences in life expectancy are too small in 1960 to generate significant coeﬃcients when
regressing (per capita GDP) growth over the level and growth of life expectancy over the post-1960 period.
Indeed, in 1960, 24 OECD countries out of 28 would show a life expectancy at birth which lies between 67.6
and 73.4 years.25 Second, the coeﬃcient of life expectancy growth in the combined regression, was found to
be significant only at 10% over the 1960-1990 period, and it is insignificant over the period between 1960
and 2000 when controlling for initial log of per capita GDP. We interpret this finding as evidence that the
relationship between health and growth has weakened after 1960, and that not all of the post-1960 gains in
life expectancy have had a significant impact on productivity growth. More precisely, we hypothesize that
gains in life expectancy at young age and during active life matter more than gains in life expectancy at
old-age.
    To test this latter hypothesis, we use the OECD (2009) health database and exploit its panel dimension
to increase the sample size and thereby improve statistical robustness. This comes at the cost of losing the
   2 3 The marginal posterior distribution of β is not necessarily gaussian due to the non-degenerate prior set on ρ, but diﬀerences

with the gaussian case arising from skewness and excess kurtosis are deemed to be small. Also, the positivity of 1 − ρ0−1 ρ has
been checked empirically.
   2 4 For instance, results are qualitatively identical when assuming a single dimension of endogeneity rather than two. Also, we

used uniform distributions on [0, r], assuming strictly positive correlations and systematic overestimation of β. Again, initial
life expectancy was significant for r < 0.25, and growth in life expectancy was significant for r < 0.08.
   2 5 Diﬀerences were relatively much starker in 1940: within the set of 22 OECD countries available both in 1940 and 1960, the

coeﬃcient of variation of life expectancy was equal to 11.5% in 1940 versus 6.9% twenty years later.


                                                                14
former instrumentation procedure, as all of our instruments that are relevant over that period are time-
constant. However, all former IV estimates were relatively close to their OLS counterparts, which in turn
suggests that OLS regressions already reflect the causal eﬀects we are trying to uncover. Besides, we can
rely on GMM for an instrumentation with lagged explanatory variables.
    Thus, Table 4 regresses the log of per capita GDP on variables measuring life expectancy at various ages
(respectively at age 0, 40, 60 and 80). The retained time span is ten years and all regressions include time
eﬀects. As the results in Table 4 show, each explanatory variable in isolation comes out significant except
life expectancy at 80 years when introducing fixed-eﬀects. However, when regressing log per capita GDP on
all life expectancy variables simultaneously, we find that life expectancy at age equal or older than 40 years
is not significant. In other words, only gains in life expectancy below 40 years are significantly correlated
with per capita GDP growth.

    Finally, Table 5 replicates the former regressions using the SYS-GMM estimator as described by Blundell-
Bond (1998). In order to reduce the autocorrelation of residuals and eliminate potentially non-stationary
components, here we first-diﬀerentiate the dependent and explanatory variables, regressing decennial growth
of per capita GDP on growth of life expectancy over a ten years period26 , controlling for time dummies and
country fixed eﬀects. We still get the same conclusions, namely that reduced mortality between age zero
and forty has a positive and significant impact on per capita GDP growth27 . Our results are in line with the
empirical microeconomic literature showing that better health at young age has long-term consequences in
terms of workers productivity28 .

5     Conclusion

In this paper we argued that combining the Lucas (1988) and Nelson-Phelps (1966) approaches to human
capital improves our understanding of the relationship between health and growth. We first provided a
simple model where both the initial level and the accumulation of health matter for growth. Then, in
our empirical cross-country analysis over the period 1960-2000, using the same instruments for health as
  2 6 We use log life expectancy lagged 20, 30 and 40 years as instrumental variables. All results remain identical when using

variables in levels rather than in diﬀerence, but in the former case specification tests detect autocorrelation in residuals.
  2 7 The latter regression correctly rejects the null hypothesis of zero first-order correlation of first-diﬀerenced residuals, and

correctly accepts the null hypothesis of zero second-order autocorrelation. A Hansen test of overidentifying restrictions validates
the null hypothesis of joint exogeneity of instruments. As underlined by Roodman (2009), the number of instruments has been
reduced in order to avoid the instruments proliferation problem that leads to Hansen statistics overestimation.

Lorentzen-McMillan-Wacziarg (2008), we found that better life expectancy, in the sense of both a higher
initial level and faster growth, is growth-enhancing. However, a Bayesian robustness analysis suggests that
initial life expectancy is a more robust determinant than the growth of life expectancy. Then, looking more
closely at life expectancy at various ages in OECD countries, we found that reducing mortality below age
40 is particularly growth-enhancing.
   This research could be extended in several directions. One direction would be to look at the growth
eﬀects of particular diseases, thereby leading to a reassessment of the costs and benefits of curing those
diseases. Another extension would be to investigate the main channels through which health aﬀects growth.
These and other extensions of the analysis in this paper are left for future research.
