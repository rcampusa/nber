                    The Heights of Americans in Three Centuries:
                     Some Evidence and Demographic Implications

                                      ABSTRACT

          This paper discusses the potential usefulness of anthropometric

measurements in exploring the contributions of nutrition to American economic

growth and demographic change. It argues that although the value of height—

by—age data to economic historians will ultimately be resolved in the con-

text of investigating specific issues, the early results of the NBER Project

on Long—term Trends in Nutrition, Labor Productivity, and Labor Welfare have

been encouraging. Among the most significant findings to date are: (1)

that by the time of the Revolution, Americans had attained a mean final

height (and net nutritional status) that was very high, one that European

populations did not generally reach until the twentieth century; (2) that

the variation in stature across occupational classes was much less in the

U.S. than in Europe; (3) that natives of the South have been taller than

those from other regions of the U.S. since the middle of the eighteenth

century, and that their absolute height increased during the antebellum

period while mortality was declining there; and (4) that natives of large

antebellum cities were much shorter than their countrymen born in rural

areas or in small cities. The paper also examines, in a preliminary

fashion, how a newly available data set bears on the hypothesis that a cycle

in U.S. final heights began during the antebellum period. The theory might

continue to be sustained, but a sample of U.S. Army recruits from 1850 to

1855   does   not seem to provide much support for it.

     Over the last few years, the NBER Program in the Development of the American

Economy has been pursuing an exploratory study of the usefulness of anthro—

pometric measurements for the estimation and analysis of levels of nutrition,

labor productivity, and labor welfare in historical populations.   The Nutri-

tion Project, whose principal goal is to investigate the contribution of

nutrition (as a component of human capital) to mortality decline and economic

growth in the U.S., has in its initial stages devoted the bulk of its resources

to the retrieval of large bodies of anthropometric data and the linkage of them

to other sources of socioeconomic information. However, a set of papers based

on preliminary analysis of the data collected through 1981 has appeared

in a special issue of Social Science History)- This paper is intended to review

the methods and goals of the project, and to critically evaluate its major

findings to date. It will conclude with a discussion of how a newly available

body of evidence bears on some of the issues raised by the papers in the special

issue.


                                      II.

     The Project's reliance on height—by—age data as the principal means of

estimating levels of nutrition seems to have a solid basis in the physiological

literature. Many biologists, anthropologists, and physiologists have studied

the effects of nutritional deficiencies, disease, and other environmental con-

ditions on physical development through observational studies of human popula-

tions and laboratory experiments.2 Their work has led to the conclusion that

anthropometric measures provide reliable indexes of the extent of malnutrition

among sub—groups of particular populations that 'ref1ect accurately the state of

a nation's public health and the average nutritional status of its citizens."3
                                       —2—




     The construction of indexes of nutritional status from height—by—age data

rests on intensive study of the pattern of human growth between infancy and

maturity. Three statistics are particularly useful: the age at which the

adolescent growth spurt peaks, the age at which full height is attained, and

the final height achieved. Short periods of malnutrition or prolonged spells

of moderate malnutrition, during childhood, merely delay the onset of the ado-

lescent growth spurt. Severe, prolonged malnutrition may completely erode the

typical growth—spurt pattern and cause permanent stunting. If malnutrition

is sustained over an extended period, growth will continue beyond the age at

which it normally ceases in well—fed adolescents. Hence, the age at which growth

terminates can also be a valuable indicator of nutritional status. There is

a clear pattern of "catching—up't after periods of malnutrition; but the longer

the periods and the more severe the malnutrition, the more likely the terminal

height of an individual will fall below what it would have been under condi-

tions of good nutrition.4

     Nutritional conditions are not the only influences affecting height—by—age

profiles. The actual record of growth observed for any individual or population

reflects the interaction of genetic and environmental factors. On the level

of individuals, differences in genetic endowment account for most of the Variation in

stature across them (after allowing for age)-. Among most contemporary, well—fed

populations, however, there is no significant variation in mean final heights

that physiologists consider attributable to genetic factors. Although there

are a few ethnic groups whose genetic potential for final height seems to differ

significantly from the West European standard, they have historically repre-

sented an extremely small proportion of the U.S. population.
                                       —3—




     Other environmental conditions, besides nutrition, also play a role in

determining the pattern and record of physical growth. It is important, in

this regard, to emphasize that anthropometric measures of nutrition resemble

net rather than gross measures of nutrition. Height is influenced not only

by the gross intake of nutrients, but also by the claims of other metabolic

processes that compete with those of physical development for those nutrients

and the efficiency with which that gross intake is utilized. The amount of

nutrients that a body allocates to growth and development, from a given intake,

may vary with such conditions as climate, clothing and shelter, the

level of physical activity (i.e., work), and the incidence of

disease. How the body allocates nutrients among the competing

claims is complex and not well understood. Thus, while height—by—age data

might provide accurate indexes of the amount of nutrients made available for

sustaining or promoting physical growth, they do not alone indicate whether varia—

tion in net nutritional status is due to differences in the consumption of

food, in the claims on the food intake, or in the efficiency with which food

is converted into outputs.

     The general issue of whether indexes of net nutritional status are useful

for studies of the development of the American economy is a question that will

ultimately be resolved in the context of grappling with specific problems.

Granted that the opinion may be premature, however, there seem to be good rea—

Sons to be optimistic about the value of anthropometric measurements to economic

historians. Nutrition has figured prominently in many hypotheses concerning the

development of the American economy. It has been treated both as a component

of human capital, which generates increases in labor income through greater
                                      —4—

strength or vitality, better health and lower mortality, and as a component

of material welfare (or the standard of living). Despite the recognized un—

portance of nutrition as a variable, study of it has been hampered by the

difficulty of obtaining accurate measures.

     With anthropometric measurements providing indexes of nutritional status,

there are a number of ways in which the return to better nutrition can be

estimated. One approach is to estimate the relationships between height and

wage rates, height and slave prices, and height and income over cross—sectional

data. Bodies of evidence that contain the information necessary for this ap-

proach have been located and begun to be retrieved. Another method of esti-

mating the return is to link several sources of information on individuals, at

different points in their lives, making it possible to examine the relationship

between height and occupational mobility or height and accumulation of wealth,

after controlling for the other characteristics of the individuals. Still

another method of evaluating the return would involve estimating the relation-

ship between height and mortality or life expectancy.6

     Height—by—age data might also prove useful as indicators of standard of

living, particularly in underdeveloped economies for which per capita income

or real wage series are not available. In such economies, food consumption

and health are likely to be major components of the standard of living.7

Even for those historical populations where per capita income or real wage

series exist, the data are frequently not sufficiently rich to distinguish

the standard of living of one sub—group of the population from those of

others. Because military records that include height—by—age data and various

socioeconomic information typically encompass a significant proportion of a

society's population of young males, and extend back over several centuries

are available for a large number of countries, there would seem to be great

potential for employing anthropometric measurements as indicators of material

welfare.
                                       —5—


      The measure of nutritional status provided by height—by—age is not one

 of gross food intake (which is presumably what economic historians have pre-

 viously had in mind). It might be argued, however, that such a net index of

 nutrition should be preferred to a gross index in some cases because a popu-

 lation's requirements for nutrients and energy (a diet that would be nutri-

 tionally adequate) cannot be defined without reference to the population's

 level of physical activity, disease environment, etc.8 In general, neither

 type of index seems likely to dominate the other, and they will often supply

 complementary information. How valuable one is relative to the other will

vary with the problem and context being addressed. When comparing levels of

nutrition between two populations that have vast differences in disease environ-

ment, for example, net measures (which reflect the nutrients devoted to growth

after some have been consumed in fighting disease) might provide a better indi-

cator of the difference between populations in the amounts of human capital in

nutrition than gross measures. On the other hand, if one is studying the im-

portance of improvements in nutrition on the decline in some population's

mortality rate, a gross measure might be more useful than an index of net

nutrition. In any case, the use of indexes of net nutritional status based on

height—by—age data may lead to measures of the gross that are more accurate than

the conventionally employed alternatives .


                                       III.
     The initial stages of the Project have been devoted to the identifica-

tion and collection of bodies of evidence that bear on the issues of concern,

and the development of appropriate statistical procedures)0 Thirteen

samples of data containing information on height—by—age and various socio-

economic variables which cover the period from 1750 through 1937 for the

United States and several other countries have been located and retrieved (or

begun to be). Six of the samples are drawn from U.S. military records between
                                       —6—


 1750 and 1910, and some of these are in the process of being linked to addi-

 tional sources which contain information on the mortality experience, wealth

 holdings, etc. of individual recruits (or their families) at other points.in

 their lives. Investigation of many of the central aspects of the relationship

between height and economic behavior await the completion of this task. Never-

theless, preliminary analysis of the data in hand has already yielded striking

findings regarding secular trends and cross—sectional variation in heights,

and in the economic and demographic implications of these patterns.

      Perhaps the most interesting results to date concern the vast differences

between the patterns of variation in heights of native—born U.S. whites prior to

1910 and that of most European populations. Whereas the records of Britain and

other European countries seem to conform to the expectation of a positive secular

trend in stature, with possibly some cycles, extending back to the eighteenth

century, the heights of Americans exhibit virtually no trend between the American

Revolution and World War II. The lack of a secular trend in the stature of U.S.

whites is due to their early achievement of nearly modern heights (a mean of

68.1 inches) by the end of the colonial period. The Revolutionary War level

of 68.1 inches roughly approximates the 68.5 inch figure estimated for U.S.
                                                                   11
whites at the Civil War and the 68.2 figure during World War II.        It is also

one to four inches greater than the mean final height of males reported for

several European countries during the eighteenth century. Most of the European

countries seem not to have achieved the heights observed in the U.S. until the

twentieth century.

      The major differences in stature between the U.S. and European populations

give compelling testimony to the gap in net nutritional status of the average

man that existed between the two 'egions. These differences in stature pre-

sumably reflect disparities in income levels, but may also stem partially from
                                       —7—



discrepancies in relative prices, tastes, disease environment, the

level of energy—utilizing activities, and other factors. From a human capital

perspective, it is clear that Americans, on average, were able to accumulate

much higher levels of nutrition than were the Europeans. The contrast is

dramatized when one finds that the heights of the European working classes

of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries were roughly equal to,

or lower than, the levels prevailing in many developing countries today.'2

      Our analysis of the height—by—age data is supported by data on food con-

sumption in Massachusetts discovered by McMahon.3 Wills deposited in Middlesex

County between 1654 and 1830 indicate a sharp rise in the average amount of meat

annually allotted to widows for their personal consumption. Between 1675

and   1750, the average allotment increased from approximately 80 to approxi-

mately 165 pounds per annum. Such a level of average meat consumption (especially

important to nutrition because of it being rich in protein) appears not to have been

achieved in Europe until well into the twefltieth century.14

      One of the limitations of utilizing anthropometric measures as indicators

of standard of living is illustrated by the trend over time in U.S. heights.

As mentioned above, there was virtually no secular trend in mean final heights between

the Revolution and WW II, although there is some evidence of cycles in stature during

the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries and during the early nine—
                                                15
teenth century (perhaps confined to urban areas). If there were no genetically

imposed constraints (or plateaus) on the human potential for growth and physical

development, meaning that increases in the consumption of protein, calories,

vitamins, etc. would perpetually yield additional increments in stature, then

this result would yield the peculiar implication that there was no improvement in

the American standard of living over more than one and a half centuries. We
                                      —8—


know, however, that there are limits to how well nourished an individual can

be, and there may also be substantial plateaus over which additional gains in

nutritional status do not yield increases in physical stature. Such considera-

tions seem relevant to a consideration of the record over time of the heights

of U.S. native—born white, and imply that anthropometric measures will perform

better as indicators of standard of living in underdeveloped economies with

low per capita incomes or poor disease environments, in economies in which

protein and food in general is relatively costly, or in economies where in-

come is distributed in a very unequal fashion.

     None of this discussion is meant to suggest that further investigation

of the height—by—age data available for the U.S. would be uninformative about

variation in the standard of living. On the contrary, we have uncovered evi-

dence of a number of cases in which anthropometric measures may shed light on

issues concerned with the physical welfare of various segments of the U.S.

population. Included among these are instances of secular trends in the stature

of certain groups, of cycles in stature during this period of no long—term change

in U.S. mean final heights, and of significant variation over time in how sta-

ture was related to variables like occupational status and urbanization. The

possibility of cycles is particularly intriguing since the circumstances that

generated them would have had to have been quite severe. But the study of the

changing pattern of variation in height over socioeconomic variables is also of

great interest because it may contribute to our understanding of the environmental

costs associated with industrialization and urbanization, or of shifts in the

distribution of income and wealth.

     The increase in the gap between the heights of rural— and urban—born ob-

served in the first half of the nineteenth century is an example of such a change

over time in the relationship between height and socioeconomic variables. It

appears to have resulted primarily from a decline in the stature of natives of
                                        —9—


major urban centers, one that was of a substantial magnitude. During the

colonial period, natives of the relatively small cities that existed then were

marginally, if any, shorter than their rural—born countrymen.16 By the middle

of the nineteenth century, natives born in cities with populations of over 25,000

were 0.6 to 1.8 inches shorter than those born in rural areas (see Table 2 below).

The emergence of this discrepancy between rural and large urban centers is con-

sistent with the claims of some scholars that many antebellum cities suffered

from deteriorating environmental conditions (i.e., sanitation, housing, disease

pool) and rising mortality as they experienced rapid growth (or simply achieved

large city size).17 But the decline in urban heights may also reflect the influx

of foreign—born immigrants into those areas or the spread of a more energy—

intensive work regime associated with the factory system of production. Further

investigation of this very low level of stature (by U.S. standards) in large

cities may help to identify the chief sources of environmental stress.

     There   have also been significant shifts over time in the relationship be-
tween occupational status and stature. What had been minor differences in final
heights   between farmers and other occupational groups during the colonial period

widened to sizable disparities by the time of the Civil War)8 Utilizing a

sample of recruits from that conflict, Nargo and Steckel have recently estimated

that blue collar recruits were 0.5 to 1 inch shorter than farmers or white collar

workers, after adjusting for urban/rural status and region of birth)9 These

occupational differences in stature seem impressive when compared to those pre—

vailing in the colonial period, but are dwarfed by the 2 to 3 inch height dif-

ferentials that existed between the British white collar and manual classes during

the nineteenth century.2° This relative equality in American stature across oc-

cupational classes, as opposed to the European experience, may reflect
                                      —10--



both greater equality in the standards of living enjoyed by the lower and upper

classes in the U.S., as well as one of the conditions that worked to maintain

that relative equality. To the extent that occupational differences in sta-

ture represent disparities in human capital accumulation across classes, the

narrower American differentials would imply, if all other conditions were

equal, that greater income equality and social mobility would be observed in

the U.S. than in Britain (or Europe). Further investigation of the economic re-

turns to increments in height should help us to better understand the consequences

of the U.S. having a relatively equal distribution of the components of human

capital reflected in anthropometric measurements (as well as of the taller sta-

ture of Americans generally).

      Analysis of the variation in stature across place and time may also yield

substantial implications for the study of the secular and geographic patterns in

U.S. mortality rates. Nutrition has often been identified as a potentially im-

portant variable in accounting for eighteenth and nineteenth century declines in

death rates, and the evidently high level of nutrition in America may well pro-

vide a partial explanation of the low mortality rates which characterized the

U.S. during this period relative to Europe. However, nutrition may not play as

significant a role in accounting for the regional pattern of U.S. mortality during

the period, or the pre—1850 decline in national mortality rates. The late eight-

eenth and early nineteenth centuries were marked by the narrowing of interregional

differences in mortality rates between New England and the South, with the ini-

tially higher crude mortality rates in the latter region declining from about 50

per thousand to 25 per thousand, while the New England rate was roughly stable in

the 15 to 25 per thousand range.21 Southern stature has been found to have ex-

ceeded that of northerners throughout this period, suggesting that the higher

mortality rates in the South were not due to poorer levels of nutrition in that
                                          —11—


region. Instead, southerners appear to have enjoyed superior nutritional condi-

tions, which may have operated to close the gap between regional death rates by

counteracting factors that served to increase mortality in the South (climate,

disease pool, etc.).

                                           Iv.

         During the early stages of the Nutrition Project, investigators detected

evidence of several cycles in American final heights.       The first of these was

estimated to have occurred during the first half of the nineteenth century, by

examining the heights of the different birth cohorts represented among Civil

War recruits. This apparent rise through the early 1820s and the subsequent de-

cline in mean terminal height have been interpreted as perhaps indicating that a

decline in net nutritional status (or health) accompanied the rapid industrializa-

tion and urbanization of the second quarter of the century. The existence of the

cycle remains open to question, however. Questions have been raised as to whether

older recruits were likely to be representative, in regard to their physical con-

dition, of their birth cohorts, and whether the socioeconomic composition of the

Union Army deteriorated over the course of the Civil War, leading to an unrepre-

sentative (shorter) set of men serving near the end of that conflict.22

         A newly available, randomly—drawn sample of U.S. Army recruits who enlisted

between 1850 and 1855 makes it possible to independently test for the existence

of a cycle in mean final heights affecting the birth cohorts of the 1820s and
         23
1830s.        As shown in Table 1, the computation of a mean final height for white,

native—born males from the 1850—1855 data yields a figure of 68.3 inches, which

slightly exceeds the 68.1 inch estimates calculated for both the Revolutionary

War period and the years 1815—1820. The 1850—1855 figure suggests that Americans,

on average, experienced modest growth during the first half of the nineteenth

century. This view receives further support from the data on Civil War recruits

reported by Gould; regional mean final height estimates based on his information,

       The estimates for the period 1850—1855 and for the Civil War have been com-
 puted from the information contained in the samples of the muster rolls of the U.S.
 Army for 1850—1855, and in Benjamin Apthorp Gould, Investigations in the Military
 and Anthropological Statistics of American Soldiers (Cambridge, MA, 1869), p. 104.
 The other estimates are drawn from Kenneth L. Sokoloff and Georgia C. Villaflor,
 "The Early Achievement of Modern Stature in America," Social Science History 6
 (Fall 1982), and Robert W. Fogel, et al., "Changes in American and British Stature
 Since the Mid—Eighteenth Century: A Preliminary Report on the Usefulness of Data
 on Height for the Analysis of Secular Trends in Nutrition, Labor Productivity, and
 Labor Welfare," NBER Working Paper No. 890 (1982). The regional mean final height
 estimates, for the first four periods, have been computed by the Quantile Bend
 method to adjust for shortfall on the left tails of the distributions. For a
discussion of the Quantile Bend method, and alternative procedures for correcting
for shortfall on the left tails of distributions, see Kenneth W. Wachter and James
Trussell, "Estimating Historical Heights," Journal of the American Statistical
Association 77 (June 1982), pp. 279—293. The U.S. mean final height estimates for
the American Revolution, 1815—1820, 1850—1855, and the Civil War were calculated
by weighting the regional means by the shares of the white population residing in
the respective regions at the time of the most recent census. This procedure tends
to bias the estimates upward slightly, since the net migration of native—born was
from the regions with shorter stature to regions with taller stature. The numbers
of observations on which estimates are based appear with parentheses.

after weighting them by population shares so as to adjust for the underrepre—

sentation of southerners in the Union Army, yield a national estimate of 68.5

inches. The hypothesis of a cycle marked by declining heights during the late 1820s

and the 1830s seems contradicted by these estimates that the mean final height in

1861-1865 exceeded that prevailing in 1850_1855.24

       Of course, not all sub—groups of the American population had records over

time that conformed to the national average. The regional mean final height

estimates presented in Table 1, for example, reveal significant variation around

the U.S. trend. Southerners are a regional group whose record of growth seems

to correspond well with the national average. While the U.S. final height rose

from 68.1 inches at 1815—1820 (and at the Revolution) to 68.3 at 1850—1855, and

to 68.5 at the Civil War, the southerners grew at a slightly more rapid rate from

68.3 inches at 1815—1820 (and at the Revolution) to 68.9 at 1850—1855 (and main-

tained to the later date). New England also appears to have experienced net

growth in stature during the antebellum period, but the magnitude of the estimated

increase depends on the selection of the beginning year. Mean final height in

that region seems to have fluctuated in the 67.8 to 68.0 range between the Revolu-

tion and 1850—1855, before advancing to 68.2 inches at the Civil War. Registering

the same mean final height at the Revolution and the Civil War (68.0), the Middle

Atlantic appears to be the only major region that realized no increase in stature.

With the 67.6 mean final height estimate for 1850—1855, it is also the region that

seems most likely to have experienced a prolonged cycle in stature prior to the

Civil War, but one in which a decline in heights was followed by a recovery rather

than the reverse.25 The regions of the Middle West and the West, which have been

grouped together here, exhibit mean final heights nearly equal to those of the

South, but data for them do not extend back long enough to adequately assess their

record over the entire antebellum period.
                                      —14—


     One of the most interesting findings to emerge from Table 1 is that the

regional differential in height observed for the Revolutionary period, with

southerners being significantly taller than either natives of the Middle

Atlantic or New England, widened during the antebellum period. The difference

in stature thus moved in the opposite direction from that of the regional per

capita income differential between the Revolutionary and Civil Wars.26

the increase in the regional differential resulted from the more rapid growth

in southern heights, one plausible theory is that improvements in the southern

environment (whether man-made or otherwise) led to a decreased incidence of

disease and hence taller stature. This view is consistent with the

initial conditions of higher mortality and greater heights in the South than in

the Northeast, and with the evidence of a significant absolute decrease in mor-

tality in the former region during the period.    Another pos-

sible explanation is that Southern heights continued to increase with per capita

income (and associated gains in food intake and health), while the effects of

deterioration in in their physical environment, or of increases in the energy

intensity of their, daily activities worked to prevent the stature of natives of the

Northeast from rising much with per capita income. Such unfavorable developments

might have accompanied the rapid progress of industrialization and urbanization

in the Northeast during the period. This hypothesis receives support from the

finding that mean final heights in the Middle West/West were approximately equal

to those in the South at 1850—1855 and the Civil War. A third possibility is

that the estimated mean heights for the Middle Atlantic and New England were

depressed relative to those of other regions because a disproportionate number

of the children of foreign immigrants were born in those areas.27

     One way of further examining these theories of why the height differential

between the South and the Northeast widened during the early nineteenth century
                                      —15—


is to compute estimates for more narrowly—defined socioeconomic classes within

regions. Each of the hypotheses contains implications for the relative move-

ments in the mean final heights of these finer sub—groups. If,   for   example,

the increase in the southern—northeastern differential was due solely to exo-

genous improvements in the South's disease environment, then (if all else were

equal) one would expect to observe virtually no change in the mean final heights

of groups in other regions. On the other hand, to the extent that the failure

of stature to increase as much as in the Northeast as it did in the South was

attributable to the adverse effects of industrialization, one should find that

the heights of northeasterners born in rural areas or of non—industrial occupa-

tions rose significantly during the period (both absolutely and relative to those

of the urban—born or of industrial workers).

     Estimates of mean final heights for various socioeconomic classes within

regions in 1850—1855 are presented in Table 2. They suggest that the differences

in stature across occupational or urban—rural class, within regions, were gen-

erally larger than had been the case during the colonial period.28 However, these

discrepancies must be considered small when compared to the gap between the

Northeast and the rest of the country. That farmers and professionals in the

South are estimated to have been 1.6 inches taller than their counterparts in

the Middle Atlantic dramatizes how the regional differences in mean final height

cannot be accounted for by regional variation in occupational mix or urbanization.

     Perhaps it is no surprise that the estimates in Table 2 provide some sup-

port to each of the leading theories of the increase in the Northeast—South height

differential. The principal evidence suggesting the unfavorable conditions asso-

ciated with industrial development and urbanization were contributory factors

consists of the extremely low final heights (by American standards) of natives

of cities with populations greater than 25,000 (67.1 inches for such cities in

the Middle Atlantic), a slight widening of the height differential between farmers

and non—farmers, and the near equivalence of heights in the largely non—agricul-

tural Middle West/West with those in the South. This hypothesis, however, does

not seem consistent with the implication of the 1850—1855 data that the mean

terminal height of farmers in the Middle Atlantic had not increased since the

Revolutionary War. Since this group presumably experienced gains in per capita

income and was not substantially affected by environmental deterioration due to

industrialization or urbanization, the theory would have predicted the stature
                                     29
of such farmers to have increased.

     The findings that neither the heights of farmers in the Northeast nor the

occupational differentials increased much during the antebellum period seem to

correspond with the hypothesis that the principal source of the widening of the

gap between southern and northeastern mean final heights was whatever change led

to the substantial advance in Southern stature. Such a region—specific alteration

in conditions is made plausible by the dramatic decline in absolute and relative

levels of mortality in the South (which seems to have had higher mortality and

net nutritional status at the beginning of the period) during the first half of

the nineteenth century. Those conditions that initially accounted for the higher

mortality in the South, despite the region's evidently superior level of net nutri-

tional status, could have been alleviated, leading to decreases in the incidence

of disease and growth in heights. tn this view, stature may have remained roughly

stable in the Northeast because at the standard of living its population enjoyed,

heights might not have been sensitive to further increases in variables directy

related to per capita income. Not that industrial development and urbanization

can be rejected as contributors tc the increase in the height differential between

the Northeast and the South. If the relatively tall stature of southerners was

entirely due to southern—specific factors, why were recruits from the Middle West
                                      —18—


and West nearly as tall? Moreover, the very short stature of natives of large

cities, the emergence of which was closely related to the above—mentioned

processes, indicates that these developments did play some role.

      Although they may not play a major role in accounting for the regional dif-

 ferences in stature, the low heights observed among natives of large cities are

nevertheless of interest.     Economic historians have long speculated about the

 types and magnitude of environmental deterioration associated with rapid

industrial development and urbanization in nineteenth—century America, and the

small stature of the urban—born may be reflecting such non—pecuniary factors.

One possible explanation of this small stature in large cities is that the great

influx of both foreign and native migrants into these urban centers led to over-

crowding, significant declines in sanitary conditions, and a worsening of the

disease pool ——   environmental decay in general. This view posits that the phy-

sical growth of the urban population was stunted by an increased incidence of

disease, and is consistent with evidence that mortality in large urban areas rose

during the period.30 Another hypothesis concerns the inter—generational effects

of malnutrition. Although the magnitude of such effects may not be large, re-

searchers have determined that the malnutrition of mothers can adversely affect

the physical development of their future offspring. If a large fraction of
those born in the large American cities were children of foreign immigrants,

then the existence of such an effect could partially account for the short

stature observed. This biological mechanism could have been reinform

foreign immigrants earned low incomes and found it difficult to provide for

their native—born children. A third possibility is that males born in large

urban areas were more likely to enter the labor force at tender ages

than their peers born elsewhere. Hence, their short stature might re-

flect a higher level of energy—utilizing activities that they engaged in prior

to their reaching full maturity.
                                      —19—


    Although the short stature of the natives of large urban areas may not

indicate low levels of per capita food consumption, this possibility cannot

yet be ruled out. These rapidly growing cities may have attracted members of

the poorer classes who sought opportunities for advancement there, yet continued

to earn low incomes and provide their families with meager levels of food con-

sumption. The swift growth of these cities between 1820 and 1860 may have led

to severe shortages in urban housing, and accordingly to .a sharp rise in the cost

of shelter. It is thus conceivable that an index of consumer prices that in—

cluded the cost of shelter would show that the real wages of urban laborers in

these cities declined over part of the antebellum period. Moreover, if the

income and price elasticities of the demand for shelter by urban laborers were

sufficiently low, sharp rises in the cost of shelter could have led to decreases

in the amount of food consumed, particularly in the consumption of relatively

expensive and protein—rich foods such as meat.

     The mean final height estimates reported for various groups in Table 2

were computed in such a way as to adjust for a form of sample selection bias that

is frequently evident in military organizations (and particularly in peacetime

armies), and is so among the 1850—55 recruits. This sample selection bias is

primarily a result of a minimum height requirement being applied to potential

recruits. Thus, the distributions of the heights of the fully grown men who
                                                                  32
enter armies typically resemble truncated normal distributions.        This sort of

sample selection bias, if unadjusted for, leads to the mean heights calculated

from military data being upward—biased estimates of the true means of the under-

lying populations. For example, those recruits who were farmers will have a

higher mean height than that of farmers in general.   The problem also

tends to produce underestimates of the differences in mean final heights between

groups, since the bias associated with the sample means is greater for the
                                      —20—


shorter groups (because larger proportions of their distributions are subject

to truncation). In the context of regression analysis, coefficients will tend

to be biased toward zero. Alternative multivariate analysis procedures that

correct for this type of sample selection bias and are of low cost are in the

process of being developed for the Project, but are not yet available. Hence,

the multivariate procedures utilized in the remainder of this paper are confined

to regression analysis.

      In Tables 3 and 4, regressions estimated over the native—born white re—

cruits from 1850—1855 are reported. Although their usefulness is reduced by their

coefficients being biased toward zero, they do provide estimates of the differ-

ences in height between occupational classes, places of birth, etc. when all

other variables are controlled for (in contrast to the Table 2 estimates, which

control for only one additional variable). It is particularly desirable to uti-

lize such a multivariate approach with the 1850—1855 data because of the sub-

stantial overrepresentation of the lower occupational classes and the urban—born

in the recruits from those years and the high correlations between some of the

independent variables.
      Notice that while the differences in height between groups implied by the

regression coefficients in Table 3 are generally somewhat smaller than those

suggested by the estimates presented in Table 2, the qualitative results are quite

similar. Holding all other variables constant, the final heights of recruits

who were artisans, factory workers, and laborers are estimated to have been be-

tween 0.34 and 0.46 inches shorter, on average, than those of farmers. The

stature of professionals does not differ significantly from that of farmers,

and thus the difference in mean final height between the two groups of occupa-

tional classes estimated here is roughly equal to the 0.4 inches estimated in

Table 2 for the Middle Atlantic. Similarly, the regression results concerning

                                         —22—

the difference in final height associated with birth in small cities, as com-

pared to that in rural areas, correspond well with the figures in Table 2 sug-

gesting that there was no significant disparity (at least in the Middle Atlantic).

      Although the regression in Table 3 yields remarkably similar implications

about the effects of the above—mentioned variables, its coefficients lead to

much lower estimates of the differences in final height across regions of birth

or between natives of rural areas and those of large cities than those reported

in Table 2. The regression estimate that those born in large cities were 0.29

inches shorter than the rural—born, after controlling for the other variables,

is only one—half of the estimate appearing in Table 2 for the Middle Atlantic.

Part of the discrepancy is undoubtedly attributable to the regression controlling

for variation in the occupational composition across the two groups, and part may

be due to the large—city—rural discrepancy being smaller in regions other than

the Middle Atlantic, but much of it seems likely to be accounted for by the sample

selection bias afflicting the regression coefficients. Not only were the natives

of large cities particularly subject to shortfall on the left tail (because of

their shorter stature), but because the proportion of recruits who were farmers

or professionals did not vary much between the rural—born and the urban—born,

and because height did not vary substantially across occupational classes,

differences in occupational composition seem unlikely to explain much of the

discrepancy between the two estimates.

      There are also significant divergences between the estimates of the dif-

ferences in height associated with birth in the South, or in the Middle West/West,

as compared to that in one of the northeastern regions. The regional rankings

implied by the regression results are the same as in Table 2, with southerners

being tallest, natives of the Middle Atlantic shortest, etc.; but the estimates

of some of the differences in stature between the tall—stature regions and the
                                       —23--



 others are lower. Again, the discrepancies between the two sets of estimates

 are partially due to the regression holding all other variables constant while

 the approach employed in Table 2 adjusts for only one other variable besides re-

 gion of birth, and partially attributable to the regression coefficients being

 biased toward zero. In any case, these discrepancies between the estimates of

 the regional differentials are small, roughly on the order of 0.2 inches.

       The regression also includes a set of independent dummy variables de-

 noting types of migratory status. The estimated coefficients on them indicate

 that neither inter—state nor inter—regional migrants were generally taller than

 non—migrants, although northeastern—born recruits who had migrated out of that

 region seem to have been slightly taller than those who remained behind. This

pattern is quite different from that observed in the samples from the colonial

period, when inter—state migrants were of significantly greater stature than their

more sedentary neighbors. Among the many possible explanations of this apparent

shift in migratory patterns is a decrease in the cost of migrating or, more

generally, an increase in the return to long—distance migration by lower—class

individuals relative to that for individuals from more prosperous backgrounds.

      Several regressions that were estimated over data on recruits aged 21 are

reported in Table 4. The first of these was estimated with the specification

utilized by the regression appearing in Table 3, except that years of age was

omitted as an independent variable. The second regression excludes the dummy

variable for large urban areas, but includes four additional interaction variables

that were given values of zero for recruits whose cities of birth had populations

of under 15,000 in 1850. Recruits whose cities of birth had populations greater

than 15,000 had the variables set equal to the log of the population of the city

in 1850, the ratio of the city's population in 1850 to that in 1830, the propor-

tion of the city's population that was foreign—born in 1830, and the 1850 rate of

mortality in the county of birth.

Note:
The intercept represents the height of a farmer who was born, and remained, in a
rural area of a New England state. A number of statistically insignificant dummy
variables have been omitted from the table due to space constraints. These omitted
variables include a set referring to migratory status, all members of which proved
insignificant when tested separately or jointly. The "Growth of City Population"
interaction variable was defined as the ratio of the city's population in 1850 to
that of 1830. The mortality variable was defined as the ratio of one thousand times
the number of deaths in the county of birth during the year 1849—1850 (as contained
in the 1850 Census) to the population of the county in 1850. The "Percent. Foreign—
Born" variable was defined as the proportion of the city of birth's population that
was foreign—born in 1830 (as computed from information contained in the 1830 Census).
The t—statistics appear within parentheses after the respective coefficients.

 These variables were constructed in an attempt to identify which of the features

 of the large cities was most closely associated with the stature of recruits

 born in them. It was thought that such an approach might yield clues as to

 the basis for the short stature of natives of such cities.

      Replacing the dummy variable for large urban areas with a continuous

measure of city population increases marginally the explanatory significance

of the regression, but the other three variables, as apparent, fail to provide

any additional explanatory power. Why these latter variables perform so poorly

is not clear. It may be that stature was not systematically related to any of

these variables, after. controlling for city size, but the results could also

stem from the suspect quality of the information from which the variables were

constructed or from there being insufficient variation in the variables over

those cities for which non—zero values were computed. The four additional

variables were also included in regressions estimated over recruits aged 24 to

35, as well as over soliders of other ages, but these efforts yielded the same

qualitative findings.

      The estimates of occupational and regional differentials in height among

recruits aged 21 are generally consistent with those for the older age category

reported above. Recruits from the South continue to be taller than those from

either New England or the Middle Atlantic. The results contrast sharply from

the previous ones, however, in that there are no statistically significant dif-

ferences apparent between the heights of New Englanders and those of natives of

either the Middle Atlantic or the Middle West/West. The lack of a statistically

significant coefficient on the variable for birth in the latter region is par-

ticularly surprising since the coefficient was large and highly significant for

recruits aged 24 to 35.

     There is also a slight discrepancy between the two sets of recruits in the

results concerning occupational differentials. The factory workers among the
                                       —26—


younger recruits again emerge as the shortest of the occupational groups other

than seamen; however, the differences between their heights and those of artisans

or of laborers are now statistically significant. In the earlier regression,

the final heights of these three groups were estimated to have been roughly the

same, all significantly lower than that of farmers. The disparity in qualitative

results is puzzling, even if it is no surprise that factory workers were the

shortest group. One would expect that factory workers would have entered the

labor force at younger ages, and consequently had their physical development

stunted, either because children were more effectively utilized under the more

regimented organization of work typical of factories, or because, on average,

they came from less well—to—do families. Factory workers might also have been

shorter because labor in factories placed greater demands on the energy of workers

than did other sorts of manual work, or because they came from poorer households

and consumed less nutritious diets during their years of growth.

      This paper has discussed the potential usefulness of anthropometric measure-

ments in exploring the contributions of nutrition (or changes thereof) to

American economic growth and demographic change. It has been argued that al-

though the value of height—by—age data to economic historians will ultimately be

resolved in the context of investigating specific issues, the early results of

the NBER Nutrition Project have been very encouraging. Among the most signifi—

cant findings to date are:   (1) that by the time of the Revolution, Americans

had attained a mean final height (and net nutritional status) for males that was

very high, one that most European populations did not reach until the twentieth

century; (2) that the variation in stature across occupational classes was much

less in the U.S. than in Europe; (3) that natives of the South have been taller

than those from other regions of the U.S. since the middle of the eighteenth century,
                                          —27—


and that their absolute height and their advantage in stature over northeasterners

grew during the antebellum period while mortality was declining there; and (4)

that natives of large antebellum cities were much shorter than their countrymen

born in rural areas or in small cities.

      The paper also began, in a preliminary fashion, to evaluate how a newly

available data set bears on the hypothesis that a cycle in U.S. final heights oc-

curred during the antebellum period. The theory can continue to be sustained,

but samples of U.S. Army recruits from 1850 to 1855 do not seem to provide much

support for it. A comparison of regional mean final heights for recruits aged 24

to 35 between the 1850—1855 period and 1861—1865 seems to indicate that if any

change occurred during the decade, it was in the direction of further growth.

There are not enough recruits in the 1850—1855 sample from birth cohorts in the

late l830s or early 1840s, however, to examine whether heights began to turn down

with those cohorts. The only evidence yet uncovered from this new source of in—

formation that might seem to bolster the idea of an antebellum cycle is the

low stature associated with birth in large cities. As the process of   urbaniza-
tion advanced, more and more Americans were born in such cities and

exposed to conditions that could retard their growth; at some point, there may

have been a large enough increase in their numbers to pull down the national mean

heights.

4. Physiologists have not yet worked out a complete accounting of all the ef-
    fects and their magnitudes. The various effects are difficult to study,
    as well as to report, because of the interactions between the age of the
    insult, the severity of the malnutrition, the health of the subject, etc.

5. Among the bodies of evidence that have been located are cost of living
    surveys from 1934—1937, which contain information on height, age, occupation,
    wages, wealth, etc. for all members of families, and slave appraisal for
    Mississippi—born recruits in the Civil War, which contain information on
    height, age, weight, and value as a slave.

6. Friedman has already done this with his data on Trinidad slaves. See
    Friedman, "The Heights of Slaves in Trinidad."

7. The usefulness of height—by—age data as an indicator of standard of living
    should decline with the absolute level of the standard of living, both be-
    cause of the declining share of income devoted to food as income rises
    (Engel's Law) and because of the limited genetic potential for height.
 8. The basic argument here is that the contribution of a given food intake to
     an individual's health should be judged in the context of his total energy
     requirements. Thus, a worker performing arduous physical labor who re-
     ceives the same food intake as an ordinary cliotnetrician should be judged
     less well nourished.

 9. There exist modern data sets with precise information on the kinds and
     amounts of food consumed, but scholars who study historical populations
     have often had to turn to crude proxies for food consumption such as the
     price of a particular grain or food. See Andrew Appleby, "Nutrition and
     Disease: The Case of London, 1550—1750," Journal of Interdisciplinary
     History 8 (Summer 1975), pp. 1—22.

11.   The Revolutionary War figure is computed in Sokoloff and Villaflor, "The
      Early Achievement of Modern Stature in America." The World War II figure
      is computed in Fogel, et al., "Changes in American and British Stature Since
      the Mid—Eighteenth Century...". This latter source also reports estimates
      of the mean final height at the Civil War of 68.2 inches. The 68.5 figure
      for the Civil War reported below seems to differ from the previous esti-
      mates, because it is computed over a different age group (more comparable
      to the age groups referred to in other years) and an adjustment was made
      for the overrepresentation or underrepresentation of various regions. This
      latter procedure consisted of weighting the regional mean final height esti-
      mates by population shares in 1860.

15. The antebellum cycle was first estimated to have included a period of in-
     creasing final heights up to birth cohorts of the early 1820s, followed by
     a period of declining stature through cohorts born in the late 1830s. The
     discussion of the cycle in Fogel et al., "Changes in American and British
     Stature Since the Mid—Eighteenth Century... ," was based on this chronology.
     This paper also presents the evidence for the existence of a cycle in the
     late nineteenth and early twcrtieth centuries. More recent work has sug-
     gested that there was no significant decline in mean final heights until the
      birth cohorts of the late 1830s. Thus, the discussions in the Robert A.
      Margo and Richard H. Steckel, "Heights of Native—Born Northern Whites
      During the Antebellum Period," and Fogel, Engerman, and Trussell, "Ex-
      ploring the Uses of Data on Height... ," refer to this new dating of the
      cycle.

16.   Sokoloff and Villaflor, "The Early Achievement of Modern Stature in
      America...," find no statistically significant evidence that the urban—
      born were shorter than the rural—born during the colonial period. How-
      ever, they observe a significant differential by the second decade of
      the nineteenth century. See Margo and Steckel, "Heights of Native—Born
      Northern Whites During the Antebellum Period," for further discussion of
      the urban—rural differential estimated from data on Civil War recruits.

      during the antebellum period, see Yasukichi Yasuba, Birth Rate of the

      (Baltimore, 1962).

18.   Although there were some small occupational differences among recruits
      serving during the French and Indian War, no statistically significant
      differentials were found among Revolutionary soldiers. See Sokoloff and

22.   As discussed in footnote 15, the most recent study of the antebellum cycle
      in final heights (Margo and Steckel, "Heights of Native—Born Northern Whites
      During the Antebellum Period") found that a significant drop in stature did
      not begin until the birth cohorts of the late 1830s. As Margo and Steckel
      note, this finding might be an artifact due to a form of sample selection
      bias. Some contemporaries argued that during the final stages of the Civil
      War, the ranks of the Union Army were being filled by a lower class of re-
      cruit. Even after adjusting for occupational status, these recruits may
      have been shorter on average than earlier enlistees (who were from earlier
      birth cohorts).
23.   This new data set, collected by Georgia Villaflor, does not allow for a
      direct test of whether the birth cohorts from the late 1830s and early
      1840s were shorter than the preceding ones, because it does not contain
      information on many recruits from those birth cohorts. However, it does
      so indirectly, because it provides data on recruits from slightly earlier
      birth cohorts, and thus a reference group with which Civil War recruits
      of the same age, etc. can be compared.

24.   The word "contradicted" may be a bit strong here, as a record of increases
      over time (i.e., birth cohorts) in stature, followed by a period of de-
      creases beginning about 1840 could be consistent with the evidence pre-
      sented here. This point is strengthened when one considers that socio-
      economic classes with shorter heights were overrepresented among the 1850-
      1855 recruits, as compared to the soliders who served during the Civil War.

25.   This apparent cycle in Middle Atlantic heights might also be partially
      attributable to the overrepresentation of individuals born in large cities,
      or of non—agricultural occupations, among the 1850—1855 recruits.

26.   This claim is based on the implication of Alice Hanson Jones' work that
      southern per capita income at 1774 was equal to or greater than per capita
      income in the northern colonies. See her Wealth of a Nation to Be: The
      American Colonies on the Eve of the Revolution (New York, 1980). For com-
      parisons of regional per capita income during the late antebellum period,
      see Richard A. Easterlin, "Regional Income Trends, 1840—1950," in Robert
      W. Fogel and Stanley L. Engerman (eds.), The Reinterpretation of American
      Economic History (New York, 1971).

27.   Laboratory experiments with rats have suggested that offspring of poorly
      nourished parents might be smaller than offspring of well—nourished parents,
      even if both groups of offspring are raised under identical conditions. See

32.   Because enforcement of height restrictions seems to have seldom been en-
      forced strictly, the distribtions of the heights of recruits are charac-
      terized by "shortfall" at the lower heights, or fewer recruits than one
      would observe if the distribution of the heights of recruits were normal,
      rather than complete truncation at all heights below the intended minimum
      height.
