   The Changing Cyclical Behavior of Wages and Prices: 1890—1976


      The persistence of inflation during periods of high unemployment poses
the central problem for macroeconomic policy in coming years. The extent of
success in reducing both inflation and unemployment will depend strongly on
the short—run responsiveness of wage inflation to unemployment and excess
capacity. This paper studies changes in the cyclical responsiveness of
inflation from 1890—1976, and concludes that a given shortfall in production
relative to potential now "buys" a srnallev'reduction in the rate of inflation
than in the past. From 1890—1929, a one percent decline in industrial
production reduced inflation about .45%; for 1950—1976, the same output
decline is estimated to slow inflation only about .lX.
      The analysis makes use of two methods to study the changing cyclical
behavior of inflation. Following an innovative study by Cagan, calculations
are made for wage and price inflation before and after eighteen business
cycle peaks. While inflation slows in almost every recession, the declines
in inflation in recent years are less pronounced than earlier, even when
controlling for business cycle severity. In a second section of the study,
econometric evidence is provided that also strongly supports the hypothesis
of increasing rigidity of wage and price Inflation over the business cycle.
      In the last section of the paper, some possible reasons are cited
for the declining responsiveness of inflation to unemployment. Ironically,
successful macroeconomic policy might be in part responsible. To the extent
that activist macroeconomic policy breaks the link between current unemployment
and expectations of future unemployment, it is argued, unemployment today will
not induce wage cuts in contracts for future periods. Also, the tremendous
increase in duration and coverage of collective bargaining agreements is
suggested as an important force behind the shifting behavior of wages and
prices during the period of study.

                     THE CHANGING CYCLICAL BEHAVIOR

                          OF PRICES AND WAGES:

                               1890—1976


        The persistence of inflation during periods of high uneznployuent

poses the central problem for macroeconomic policy In the l970a.      The

forecasts   of major econometric niodcL ; I c)i th U.S. broadly ugree thaL a
sustained period of underemployment of resources will be required to

markedly    reduce the prevailing rate of inflation. Indeed, many economic

commentators have surmised that a given level of unemployment now "buys"

a smaller reduction in the rate of inflation than in the past. In

technical    terms, they suggest that the slope of the short—run Phillips
curve has declined over time.
           In the vast econometric   literature on the Phillips relationship,

surprisingly little formal analysis has been made of long—term changes

In the curve's parameters. Both methodological problems and data

limitations make a long—term analysis difficult. Two studies of the

secular trend in cyclical wage and price flexibility have recently

appeared. The studies use different analytic techniques and reach

opposing views on the changing inflation—unemployment tradeoff. In an

innovative study of wholesale price behavior in the 1920s and the post—

World War II period, Cagan [3] concludes that "wholesale prices show a

smaller decline in the recessions after 1948—49 than formerly," and that

"there has clearly been a gradual decline in price response to recessions

over the postwar period, except mainly for raw materials prices."1

Wachter [11, contrariwise, finds in a study of wages in the post-

 World War II
                                                                        2


period that, "a broad range of wage equations reveals the growing

cyclical responsiveness of wage inflation."2 The results of course

are not directly comparable, :For Cagan's focus is on prices while

Wachter's is on wages, and the time periods of analysis.are different.

The   discrepancy   in conclusions seems to flow, however, from more

fundamental   differences with the two analyses.
           In this paper, two approaches are employed to compare wage and
        macrodynamics in the periols 1890-1930 and 1947-1976.    Both
price
approaches strongly support the hypothesis of a decreasing responsiveness

of inflation to changes in aggregate demand. The approach in Section I

follows Cagan. in analyzing changes in the rates of wage and price

inflation from business cycle peaks to troughs. By comparing the

decelerations of inflation in pre- and post-World War II recessions

of nearly equal magnitude, a rough-and-ready measure of changing price

responsiveness is found. In Section II, econometric Phillips curve

estimates, akin to Wachter's, are presented. Attention is given to

 the problems of simultaneous equations bias in standard Phillips curve

 estimates. A new method of Phillips curve estimation is then described

 and tested. Not only does the new approach readily yield consistent

 estimates of the important parameters of the Phillips curve, but it

 also provides an easy framework for some problems of macroeconomic

 policy.
           In Section III, we speculate on the causes for the increase

 in cyclical wage and price rigidity. We suggest that two important

 aspects of the diminishing slope of the short-run Phillips curve

 are long-term wage agreements and the public's expectations after

 World War II that monetary and fiscal authorities will intervene

 to prevent price deflations and unemployment.      Theoretical support
                                                                 3



for these hypotheses is cited, though empirical testing must await

further research.


                                          I




        From 1890 to 1976, the American economy experienced 19 business

cycles, as measured by the N.B.E.R. From 1890 to 1945, 14 business

cycles occurred, and S complete business cycles have transpired since

the end of World War II. Following Cagan, simple calculations are

made in this section of the paper to gauge the responsiveness of wage

and price inflation to changes in aggregate economic activity, as

indicated by the N.B.E.R. cycles. A measure of business cycle

severity is used to relate the sizes of wage and price fluctuations

to the amplitudes of the cycles.

        Modern equations of inflation describe the rate of change of

wages and prices according to "equilibrium" and "disequilibrium"

components. For some parameter value, 4,, the postulated relation-

ship for wage change at time t is:


                                              4, > 0
                 (1) t 4, (L -   L)   +



where w = !, the time rate of proportional change of wages at time
          w dt
t, L and L are the demand and supply of labor, and w is the

expected rate of wage inflation. Typically, the excess demand for

 labor, L - L5, is measured by an adjusted rate of unemployment or

other index of aggregate activity. The mechanisms of price change

may similarly be specified as =S (y5 -         y) + p,   where   is


aggregate output.
                                                                                4

                   .e      .e
       Whenever w or p is fairly sluggish over a business cycle, a

comparison of inflation at the cyclical peak and trough allows us to

measure approximately the responsiveness of inflation to disequilibrium

market conditions. Simply put, for a constant s, the change in

inflation from peak to trough is given by



        (2)
               -        = 4) (Ld -   L8)   - 4) (Ld -   L8)t

(where the superscripts indicate peak and trough). If s1' —                 falls
over time through successive cycles we may conclude that there is an

increasing cyclical rigidity of inflation rates (i.e.          a   decreasing 4,),

when (1) the successive cycles are of similar amplitude, and (2) 4e is

Invariant over the cycle. When e varies over the cycle,                 —     will
measure changes both in equilibrium and disequilibrium components.

        We now turn to the historical evidence, using price and wage

indexes for 1890—1929 and l947—l976. Throughout this paper, the period

of the Great Depression and World War II are excluded from the analysis.

The period of the 1930s is skipped because of well—known perversities In

the wage and price dynamics of the period.3 The years of World War II

similarly must be eliminated because of the extensive administrative

control of wages and prices during the period. The empirical results

displayed in this section are for the wholesale price index (WPI) and

indexes of average hourly compensation. The calculations have also been

made for a number of other price and wage series, with very similar

results. For the sake of brevity, these additional results are not

reported, but are available from the author.

        Calculations of annual inflation rates are made for seventeen
                                                                       5

cycles. In Table 1, we report the rates of inflation before and after

business cycle peaks for the price and wage series. Under each index,

the third column is the difference of the inflation rates from peak to

trough of the cycle. The evidence strongly supports the role of aggregate

activity on price and wage change. For the WPI, the rate of inflation

declined during every downturn from 1890 to 1948, and for three of the

five recessions after 1948. Wages, similarly, decelerated during

every contraction from 1890 to 1961, excluding the 1895—1897 period.

        In complete accord with Cagan's results for the 1920s, the WPI

calculations support the hypothesis that prices have become more

cyclically rigid over time, (though of course we have as yet made no

attempt to control for cyclical severity). Almost every contraction

from 1890 to 1927 produced a sharper deceleration in price change than

did later recessions. Only the deceleration in 1949 is of similar

magnitude with the earlier cycles. It is plausible that changing weights

In the construction of the WPI might account for some of the apparent

increase in rigidity. Note, for example, that cyclically flexible

agriculture and food prices composed 43.06% of the WPI in 1926, and only

20.95% in 1970. Cagan,for a more limited time period, re—estimated

the shifts in cyclical inflation using a fixed weighting scheme, and

found very little change in the results.5 As a further check,

calculations (not shown) were made for the sub—index of industrial

goods, available from BLS since 1913. The same perceptible decline in

price flexibility is evident.

        In Table 1, there is also a discernible trend toward greater

cyclical inflexibility of wage change. While nominal wage growth

slowed in ten of the eleven cycles before 1930, wage change has in fact

accelerated in the last two downturns. Furthermore, the magnitudes

of deceleration before 1930 are in general far larger than the measures

for 1947—1960, where wage change did in fact slow down.

           It is important to compare cycles of similar magnitude for

testing changes in cyclical wage and price flexibility. Part of the

apparent increase in rigidity is due to the relative mildness of most

of the post—1945 recessions. NBER rankings of business cycle severity

exist for 1920 to 1976. We use these rankings as a "benchmark" for a

measure covering the entire 1890—1976 period.6 In particular, a

measure of severity is calculated from the percentage deviation of

industrial output from its trend value at business cycle peaks and

troughs.      The change in this output "gap" from peak to trough gauges

the amplitude of the cycle. For the years 1920 to 1976, the gap

measure and the NBER severity index yield almost Identical rank orderings.

           In Table 2, the cycles are arranged according to the gap

criteria. The precise classification method is described in the table.

The evidence is rather striking. For mild contractions, downward

price flexibility seems to have ended with the pre—World War II period.

For moderate and severe contractions, similarly, the response of wages

and prices has fallen significantly since 1950.

                                    II

           The methods of Section I, though convincing in their illustration

of a trend toward decreasing cyclical changes in inflation, fail to

Source:   Wage and price data from Table 1.

         The output gap variable is calculated by regressing Log (Industrial
Production Index) on time and the rate of unemployment. The rate of un-
employment is then set at its average value, and fitted values of Log
(Industrial Production Index) are interpreted as trend values. These trend
measures are subtracted from actual values, to obtain GAPt. The calculations
were performed separately for the pre- and post-WW II period.

         The cycles have been grouped by severity, according to j GAP,
where A GAP = GAPt_GAPP, the change in GAP from peak to succeeding trough.
The grouping is:

changes in the inflation-unemployment tradeoff may be flawed. In this

section, we describe a simple method for obtaining consistent estimates

of the Phillips curve coefficients. These estimates add further strong

support to the hypothesis of a decline in the short-run Phillips curve

slope.

           In the standard Phillips curve analysis, (1) is estimated in

the form


            ()   t   o   +
                             Bi RUt' +   2   y (L) i_l +   e
Here, y(L) denotes a polynomial of the lag operator, and RIJt1,         the
inverse of the unemployment rate, substitutes for L -          L   in (1). RtJ

is conventionally entered in inverse form as a reflection of the

assumption of a non-linear, decreasing response of inflation to

increasing levels of unemployment. Lagged values of the unemployment

rate may also be entered.        Expected inflation is measured by

y(L)t_i. The somewhat arbitrary nature of the specification

p=y(L)t_j is now well-known, after the justified criticism of rational-

expectations theorists.        However, for our purposes, the distributed

lag approach may be warranted. In an economy (e.g. pre-1930) where

the macroeconomic structure is not well understood, much less precisely

estimated in econometric work, it may be "economically rational"

(see Fiege and Pearce [4] )     to   use forecasts of future inflation based

upon lagged values of price change. Indeed, when parameter values of

structural equations are not known, adaptive or error-learning

procedures of forecasting inflation are often optimal forecasting

procedures.

           Direct estimates of (3) were made for the pre- and post-World

War II period, with varying assumptions about the unemployment variable

and the structure of y(L)t. All of the regressions reported in this

paper use the measure of output gap in industrial production as the

disequilibrium variable. For a number of reasons, it is believed that

output gap should be preferred to the Lebergott series for pre-1930

labor force unemployment. The Lebergott series is subject to large

errors. The only available benchmarks for pre-1930 unemployment are

the decennial census data of 1900, 1910, and 1920. All other years must

he interpolated. Random error in the unemployment rate series would

tend to bias toward zero the estimated coefficient on RUt. Indeed,

using an instrumental variable for Rut substantially increased the

magnitude of the unemployment rate coefficient, as would be predicted

with errors-in-variables. Importantly, in the regressions we analyzed,

the results for shifts in the Phillips curve hold for both Rut and

GAPt as explanatory variables. Various attempts were made to enter

lagged values of GAPt in regression estimates of (3). When. GAPt...l was

included along with GAPt, the coefficient of the lagged variable was

small and never statistically significant, while the current variable

remained significant. When GAPt       was entered instead of GAPt ,   the
                                  1

coefficient was almost always insignificant.

          The estimates for (3) are presented in Table 3. All estimates

show a large decline in     from the first to the second period, i.e.

the short-run Phillips curve is flatter in the second period, in

conformity with the findings of Section I. In all of the equations,

the short-run Phillips curve slope estimate is of the right sign and

is statistically significant. For the pre-World War II period,:         varies

between .4 and .53, while for the post-World War II era, l lies

between .07 and .12. The parameter of adaptive expectations in p, X, is

not well measured, and has the wrong sign in regression (3).

          Inhis recent analysis, Wachter [17] reached very different

conclusions regarding the change of 13i over time. Wachter concluded

that the short—run Phillips Curve has become increasingly steep. Wachter's

analysis concerns the 1954—1975 period, while the present paper compares

the pre—Worid War II and post—World War II periods, so that the results

are not strictly contradictory. Yet it is still worthwhile to ask

whether Wachter's methodology might explain the variance of the results.

Wachter estimates a modified form of (2):



                     $o + $   RU   + $2 y (L)     +   $     . TIME
Since
dt
jji= ($i + $           TIME), Wachter avers that a positive $ should
  -t

indicate a secularly increasing responsiveness of inflation to unemploy-

ment, while a negative $ should prompt the reverse conclusion. For

1954:1 to 1975:11, he finds $ > 0. Wachter errs, however, in 1eting

only the coefficienton RU-i change over tiie. If, in the true

model, either $o or $2 but not $i increases over time, then estimating

(-)    will   tend to give an upward biased estimate of $38 In fact, it is

far more likely that $2, the coefficient on the distributed lag on

prices, has been increasing while $i has been falling. I show below

the results of estimating Wachter's equation, without $,    for.different    terminal

dates. It seems clear that $ has not significantly increased, when

analyzed by a method that allows all parameters to change:9

        The estimates that we have so far examined in Table 3 and

Wachter's estimates may be marred by a bias introduced in regressing

wage changes on price changes. Most current econometric price equations

confirm that prices are well described as mark—ups over standard unit

labor costs. Price changes approximately equal wage changes less trend

productivity growth, .    Rewriting (3) with _1—       f'_1, we    have

(5)                                      Now, if the e is a

serially correlated process, y(L)1 will be correlated with                and

estimates of (5) will be biased. One standard method for dealing with

this problem is to assume a particular form for the process          and to

make maximum likelihood estimates for (5) using the process explicitly.

This approach is taken in equations (5)—(6) of Table 3,

where it is assumed that et —         1+u, and u is ii.d. Note that p
                                 pe
is statistically significant in both of theseLequations.        With the

auto—correlation correction,      remains larger in the earlier period.

        There is no particular reason, beyond convenience, to postulate

this specific autoregressive process. With three standard assumptions,

however, it is possible to skirt the statistical difficulties of the

usual analysis. The assumptions of 1) adaptive inflationary expectations,

2) no long—run inflation—unemployment tradeoff, and 3) prices as mark-

ups over standard unit labor costs, lead to the following simple model:
                                                                                     11

Through   a   transformation of (6) we have thus been able to eliminate              the
lagged wage terms from the estimated equation. Under the assumption

that GAPE is exogenous, the estimation of (           ) by      maximum liklihood or

ordinary least squares will give consistent estimates of the parameters.

Finally, note that we may find the "natural rate" of the output gap,

           How plausible are the assumptions underlying the present model?

We can see from (10) that (GAP_GAPi) >             (l—X)       (GAP_GAP1) implies
                                                                                      12

A and t     > 0.   Thus, whenever aggregate activity is rising (i.e.,

CAPt — GAPt_l >    0) and employment or output In period t—l is above the
equilibrium level, inflation should intensify ( >                 0).   By similar

argument, whenever output is below its long—run equilibrium level, and

output is falling, inflation should be decelerating. In eleven of the years

since 1893, the economy experienced increasing output relative to potential

during a period of already high employment (GAPt1 >                GAP).     In ten

of these years wage Inflation accelerated as predicted. In nine years of

the periods 1893—1929 and 1948—1975, the economy was characterized by low

and falling levels of aggregate activity. In aix years, wage Inflation

showed a declining rate. khe accelerationist property is justified.

         EquAtion (10) may be estimated by ordinary least squares (OLS)

or by a maximum liklihood procedure (non-linear squares). With OLS we

estimate:


          (11)             +          +              +
                               1GAP       2GAP   1


Using the estimates       and C2 we may obtain consistent estimates of the

underlying parameters       and A. Note that plIm (C2) —, and

(— A    ) — —plim (C2) / plim (C1)        A. In addition, since
                                                                               — (1—A) GAPNR
   C1                                                    NR
we can also obtain a consistent estimate of GAP               .   By use of the Fieller

Bound technique, confidence intervals may be calculated for the point esti-

mates of the underlying parameters , (see riliches [8] pp. 32-33). With

non-linear least squares (NLS), we may directly estimate the underlying

parameters of the model' Because (12) is exactly identified, i.e.,. there

is a one-to-one mapping from (C0, C1, C2) to (GAP,, A), the OLS and

NLS estimates of the underlying parameters are identical.

          In Table 5, we present a summary of estimates of the model.
                                                                             13



The results are encouraging. In all of the regressions, the co-

efficients are of expected sign, and are usually statistically

significant. In general, the estimates of are close to the estimates

shown in Table 3; again,      declines substantially from the first period

to the second. The estimation of Table 4 was made for additional time periods and

different wage and price indexes, with little change in the results.

For all of the regressions, we cannot reject the hypothesis that

GAPNR =   0.   This is an appealing result. Because GAPt is constructed

as a measure of the deviation of output from trend, the result suggests

that the long-run equilibrium value of output (GAPNR) is equal to its

trend value. On average, over extended periods, the economy is in

equilibrium. Note, finally, that there is a little evidence that A

has increased over time. If so, the mean lag of past inflation in

forecasts of future inflation,            ,   has also lengthened over time.
                                   1— A
While A is a crucial parameter for macroeconomic policy-making, as

we show below, it is not precisely estimated by the equations of

Table 4.

      If       and A can be considered as exogenous to the policy-maker

(the discussion of Section III indicates that            and A change with

varying macroeconomic policies), we can describe some effects of the

shifts of the Phillips curve for policy by a simple formula. Consider

a convenient (and highly stylized) one-parameter description of

policy. For any output GAPt in year t 0,
                           0
                                                   policy   makers choose

s.GAPt as their output target in year t1. Appropriate monetary and
fiscal policies are followed so that a constant proportion (1-6) of

the deviation of output from its equilibrium is removed each year.

                             12
Then it can be shown that:

                                     cGAP       —
         (12) P(steady state)= p +
                                         Al )
Thus, starting in a recession (GAPt<   0),   the following conditions imply a

high steady—state rate of inflation: (1) a rapid recovery (low 6); long

lags in expectations (h1gh); and (3) a low short—run Phillips curve

slope (small I). Given the estimates of falling     and rising X, we can

understand the policy difficulty of recovering from the 1974—1975 recession.

        Two further points are worthy of mention. First the path of

constant inflation is followed by setting 6 — A, as shown in equation (12).

The magnitude of the short—run Phillips curve slope is completely irrevelant

in determining this path, under assumptions of adaptive expectations Second

while a low Phillips curve slope and long lags in expectations are very

undesirable during recessions, these conditions are most desirable during

booms. A low slope and long mean lag permit an economy to operate with

output in excess of the natural rate for an extended period without a

serious acceleration of inflation. Wachter has offered evidence of

precisely this phenomenon. Since 1950, Wachter argues, there is a continuing

pattern of "smaller first—year upward responses of wages to tight market

conditions. "13

        In interpreting (1 it has been assumed that        is independent of

the policy parameter 6. In fact, changes in '5 over long periods of time

may be a major source of long—term movements of 4, as we now show in

Section III.
                                                                        16




                                      III


          We have thus far seen how the parameters of the Phillips

curve have changed over time, and how these changes have implications

for economic policy. Our understanding of inflation-unemployment

interactions would be considerably enhanced by a detailed historical

discussion of how and why these changes emerged. Unfortunately,

given the immense structural shifts that have characterized in U.S.

economy since 1900, the historical exegesis is a large task, and

one that is beyond the scope of this paper. Complex changes in

product and labor markets, such as increasing concentration, higher

ratios of value added per shipment, increased unionization, and the

large   increases   in investment in human capital, have all played a

role in the decreased cyclical response of wage and price inflation.

In this section I shall discuss two less analyzed, though probably

very important contributors to the Phillips curve shift.

        First, the emergence of countercyclical macroeconomic policy

since World War II has probably changed the cyclical behavior of

wage and price setters. Martin N. Baily [ ii has recently argued

that growing expectations of countercyclical macroeconomic policy

have smoothed the cyclical adjustments of production and employment

in the private sector. It is also likely that such expectations have

smoothed the cyclical movements of wages .and prices. I have dein-

onstrated this theoretically in Sachs [ii], and will outline the

main argument here.

        A second source of cyclical rigidity is probably the spread

of long-term explicit and implicit contracts. It is well-known

that union wages are less cyclically responsive than non-union wages
                                                                 17


(cf. Lewis [9], Flanagan[ 5]), and the usual explanation for this

points to the use of iong.-term wage agreements in the union sector.

Over our period of study, unionization has spread dramatically, as

has the average duration of collective bargaining agreements.         This

trend could well result in secular increases in aggregate wage

rigidity. Note that the      spread   of long-term contracts might itself

result from the stability engendered by active macroeconomic

policy.
        One explanation of the Phillips curve is that workers cut

wages when there is high unemployment because of the expectation

of contInued. low demand for labor, at given nominal wages, in the

future. To the extent that countercyclical policy breaks the link

between current unemployment and the expectation of continuing low

aggregate (nominal) demand, today's unemployment will not induce

wage cuts in contracts for succeeding periods.        In a model of

macroeconomic response to a supply shock, Phelps [10] has succinctly

stated this view:'4

        Suppose that wage setters expect the central bank to
        accommodate the supply shock by adjusting the money
        supply and thus the price level in such a way as to
        hold invariant the quantity of labor that will be
        demanded by firms at the pre.-existing money wage
        W ...    If
                  they know they hold these beliefs in
        c8mmon, then their "rational expectation" is that
        the pre-shock money wage will equilibrate the labor
        market as it did before the shock. Each firm will
         expect the other firms   to maintain their wages and
         it will do the same.

 In   Phelps'   case, the slope of the short-run Phillips curve is zero,
 for   unemployment does not induce any wage deflation.
                                                                   18



          In a more general model of wage-setting in the presence of activist

policy, I have shown that the slope of the statistical Phillips curve

depends on (1) the extent of countercyclical policy, and (2) the degree

to which unanticipated changes in the money stock are countered by the

monetary authority in succeeding periods.5 Simple regressions describing

money supply growth indicate that both supply characteristics have changed

in the direction tending to reduce the Phillips curve slope.16 In the

period 1895-1929 there is no evidence of a countercyclical response of

the money supply. For 1952-1975, the regression indicates that the

money stock is raised one percent above trend in the year following a

ten percent industrial output shortfall, and more in following years.

Moreover, there is evidence of significant negative serial correlation

in the residuals of the money supply equation for 1952-1975, suggesting

that monetary authorities now act to correct partially for unexpected

money movements.

          The presence of long-terni contracts fixing nominal wage

growth also reduces the short-run response of aggregate wages to

cyclical fluctuations, for two reasons. Most directly, wages fixed

by earlier contract may be unable to react at all in the short-term

to current, unexpected cyclical developments. This phenomenon is

clearly evident in Flanagan's [5] recent study of union - non-union

wage differentials. Comparing the contract (union) sector with the

non-contract sector, Flanagan writes:17
                                                            19



         That differences in the cyclical sensitivity of
         average union and non-union wage changes exist
         is clear in the postwar data. However, it is
         also clear that first year negotiated wage
         changes are almost as sensitive to labor market
         pressures as non-union wages. Most of the
         inertia in negotiated wages is a by-product of
         multi-year labor agreements. (imphasis added)

Second, we have shown in Sachs [ii] that wages determined in the

non-contract market (assumed to clear continuously) will show

smaller cyclical fluctuations the larger is the sector of labor

covered by long-term agreements. Basically, the larger is the

contract sector the smaller is the aggregate price disturbance

transmitted to the non-contract sector following an aggregate demand

shock. The disturbance is absorbed in output fluctuations in the

contract sector rather than in aggregate price fluctuations.

Assuming that the non-contract labor market is cleared at a given

real wage, the reduced aggregate price fluctuations result is smaller

wage fluctuations in that sector. These results depend on low

intersectoral mobility of labor over the cycle.

          Thus the tremendous increase in duration and coverage of

collective bargaining agreements are probably important forces

behind the Phillips curve shift between the two periods. As late

as 1948, the great majority of all wage agreements were of one

year duration; by 1972, most contracts were written for three years.18

And the contracts now cover a arger portionof the work force. In

the manufacturing sector, for instance, only 11.6% of production workers

were organized in 1910, while by 1973, approximately 49% of manufacturing

production employees were organized by labor unions. Economy-wide,

5.8% of the Civilian labor force belonged to unions in 1910, while

23.4% belonged in 1970.19

     The two explanations for increasing cyclical wage rigidity, ac-

tivist macroeconomic policy and long-term contracts, are complements

rather than strict alternatives. Indeed, when extensive empirical

tests of these and other hypotheses are carried out, a range of

explanations will surely be necessary to account for the important

changes in cycle behavior that we documented in Sections I and II

of this paper. Given the crucial importance of the Phillips curve

slope for macroeconomic policy, as suggested on p. 15, this research

should soon be undertaken.

Inflation," Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, 1976:1, p. 116.

      3With unemployment hovering above 20% in 1933, prices and wage
stopped a four-year fall, and actually began to rise at significant
rates. The Wholesale Price Index rose an average of 6.7% per year from
1933 to 1937 while the NIA wage measure for manufacturing workers in-
creased an average of 5.9% per year. Wachter [17] notes that

   there is evidence that governmont measures to spur recovery
   were behind the upward movement in wages. The spurt in the
   early 1930's is generally attributed to the National Industrial
   Relations Act, and Wagner Act and the subsequent growth of
   unions may have been responsible for that of the late 1930's (p. 155).

      Freedman and Schwartz [ 7] reach similar conclusions. In
accounting for the large rise in the WPI, they cite

   the explicit measures to raise wages and prices undertaken
   with government encouragement and assistance, notable,NIRA, the
   Guffey Coal Act, the agriculture price-support program, and the
   National Labor Relations Act. (p. 233)

      Because of these complex institutional changes, the Great
Depression is not in the interval of analysis.

      4Close comparability in wage data for the two periods requires
focusing on the manufacturing sector, given data limitations in the
earlier period. For the recent period, we have compared Phillips
curves estimated with manufacturing sector and economy-wide wages as
the dependent variable, finding very little difference in cyclical
responsiveness.

                            the multiple regression coefficient f
AP•TIME in a regression of TIME on GAP•TIME, y(L)t_i, and RU1. Thus,

           years 1894, 1896, 1900, 1921, 1960, 1961, 1971, 1974, and
1975,GAPt < GAP.,.1 < 0. In six of nine years wage inflation decelerated
as expected: l84, 1900, 1921, 1960, 1961, and 1971. In years 1902, 1906,
1910, 1913, 1916, 1926, 1929, 1951, 1953, 1966 and 1968, GAP.,. >

        '1Note that Ut in (11) is equal to et -                         et_,,        from (11).

        There is no more nor less reason to believe that Ut is i.i.d.
than to believe that et is i.i.d. The coefficient estimates from an
NLS (or OLS) regression of (12) will be consistent whether or not u
is i.i.d., though efficiency, and consistency of the estimates of
the standard errors require that Ut be i.i.d.

      12For a policy rate , we can easily calculate the steady-state
conditions for an initial GAP and rate of inflation. Since

      '5Condition (1) is the one described by Phelps. Conditiou (2)
results from the fact that any period's CAPt is in part due to un-
expected movements of the money stock, Mt. If Mt falls below anticipated
levels, output will drop. The decline in M4 reduces expectations of
future full-employment nominal wages only ir the shortfall is permanent
(i.e. as long as the central bank does not act to "correct" the
shortfall in Mt by reflating next period). To the extent that the
drop in money growth is not counteracted, CAPt < 0 will be followed by
a reduction in      -

         The Rees time series is expressed in constant 1957 dollars. To get
         nominal wages, the wage series was multiplied, by the CPI, Series
         E 135 in [14].

         1950-1976: Hourly compensation in Manufacturing, found in United
         States Department of Commerce, Bureau of Labor Statistics [16].

Comparisons of wage behavior were made for other series as well. In
particular, the results of the paper were consistently verified for:

    2. Average Hourly Earnings in Manufacturing

         1890-1926: Series D769-770 of Historical Statistics of the United
         States [13], developed by Douglas.

         Labor Statistics, 1977 (Washington: Government Printing Office,
         1977), p. 81.

Economy-wide wage behavior was studied in the current period using Series
745 in Business Conditions Digest [12]. This series, "Average Hourly
Compensation, All Employees in Private Nonform Economy," was found to behave
cyclically quite closely with the two recent series in manufacturing given
above.
