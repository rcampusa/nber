1      Introduction
The availability of administrative ﬁrm and establishment level datasets has spurred new research in
many areas of economics, spanning Labor, Industrial Organization and Trade. This work relies cru-
cially on following establishments or ﬁrms over time. Unfortunately longitudinal ﬁrm/establishment
identiﬁers (EID) often have problems: For example EIDs change spuriously due to changes of
ownership or legal form, due to restructuring of the ﬁrm, or coding errors. When not taken into
account a change of the EID will appear as a spurious establishment exit and a new entry. This is
particularly problematic in research projects that focus on entering and exiting ﬁrms, for example
analyzing the role of ﬁrm entries and exits for employment growth (and the lack thereof) during
the great recession.1
    A possible solution to this problem has gained popularity more recently (See for example
Benedetto, Haltiwanger, Lane, McKinney 2007 and Vilhuber 2009): If individual workers can be
linked to the EIDs and the individuals can also be followed over time, one can identify ID changes
as events where large groups of worker simultaneously leave an exiting EID and enter a new EID.
Thus using information on worker ﬂows offers a way to generate consistent EIDs over time and
correct for mistakes. While this method is quickly gaining popularity, it is not well known how big
the potential bias is from using uncorrected establishment IDs or how well the method works.
    In this paper we evaluate the method of using worker ﬂows to identify true establishment en-
tries and exits using German administrative data. We provide three separate ways to evaluate
whether the worker ﬂow method improves upon using simply uncorrected EIDs: First, we investi-
gate whether EID entries and exits that we identify as corresponding to establishment entries and
exits are more highly correlated with the business cycle, than EID entries and exits that we identify
as spurious. Second, we combine the administrative data with an establishment level survey to
compare establishment entry years derived using the worker ﬂow method with the establishment
entry year in the survey. And third, we analyze how establishment characteristics evolve around
entries of EIDs. All three methods show that establishment deaths and births identiﬁed using the
worker ﬂow method, clearly correspond to real economic events and improve upon the simple
measure of uncorrected establishment identiﬁers.
    This paper is related to a number of papers that have documented problems with and attempted
to correct longitudinal person identiﬁers. For example Abowd and Vilhuber (2005) describe the
method used by the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics Program (LEHD) at the U.S.
Census and Vilhuber (2009) provides a broader overview. On the ﬁrm or establishment level,
the problems are in some ways more difﬁcult: while for person identiﬁers at least it is clear that
the underlying unit of observation remains the same over time, ﬁrms and establishments change
    1 For   examples, see Foster, Grim and Haltiwanger (2013), or Fort, Haltiwanger, Jarmin and Miranda (2012).



                                                           1
ownership, are restructured, break-up or relocate in ways that make it ambiguous what exactly the
underlying unit of observation is that is to be tracked over time.
   However a consensus has emerged that it is useful for economic research to distinguish cases
where identiﬁers change due to a change in ownership, the legal form of the ﬁrm or simply a change
of accountants. In this case the change of a ﬁrm identiﬁer should not be counted as a ﬁrm exit in one
and an entry in the next period. Furthermore it is generally thought that ﬁrm restructuring events
such as merger, acquisitions and outsourcing should generally not be considered as components of
job creation and destruction (For a discussion see Persson 1999; Baldwin et al. 2002; Benedetto,
Haltiwanger, Lane and McKinney 2007; Vilhuber 2009; Geurts, Ramioul and Vets 2009; Abowd
and Vilhuber 2011).
   To deal with problems of longitudinal linkages, researchers and statistical agencies have em-
ployed probabilistic matching methods based on similarities in partial ﬁrm identiﬁers as well as
information about name, location and economic activity (Eurostat/OECD 2007; Vilhuber 2009).
More recently information on worker ﬂows between employers has been used, since it is usually
presumed that if the work force is identical in two consecutive years, then there is a high proba-
bility that these records relate to the same ﬁrm or establishment. This approach has been used for
administrative datasets, among others, in Italy (Revelli 1996, Contini 2007), Finland (Vartiainen
2004), the U.S. (Benedetto et. al. 2007), and Belgium (Geurts et. al 2009). This study follows
most closely the approach taken by Benedetto et. al. (2007). Our main contribution relative to this
literature is that rather than just using the worker ﬂow methodology to correct for problems in the
EIDs, we document how successful this approach is with ﬁxing these identiﬁers.
    As an illustration for the importance of the bias from not using corrected EIDs, we investigate
the role of establishment turnover for job creation and destruction using corrected and uncorrected
identiﬁers. The notion that producer entry and exit is an important form of reallocation of produc-
tion factors and thus contributing to aggregate growth has inspired a long line of theoretical and
empirical research. One aspect of this reallocation mechanism that has been particularly promi-
nent in the political sphere is the role of this churning process in the creation and destruction of
jobs. New and small producers are often referred to as an important job growth engine, while
the demise of a plant is usually lamented for the number of jobs it destroys.2 For this reason job
creation and destruction has long been studied by economists to enhance the understanding of the
business cycle and the adjustment processes in the economy (David, Haltiwanger and Schuh 1996;
Bartelsman, Scarpetta and Schivardi 2005; Brown, Haltiwanger and Lane 2008). These studies
typically decompose net job creation into the contributions of entering and exiting ﬁrms in addi-
tion to reallocation between existing ﬁrms. We demonstrate that in the German administrative data,
   2 The  impact of job destruction due to plant closings on the displaced workers has also received a lot of attention in
the literature, see for example Jacobson, Lalonde, and Sullivan (1993) and von Wachter, Song and Manchester (2009).

using only EID entries and exits may dramatically overstate, by as much as 100 percent, the role
of establishment turnover for job creation and destruction. Correcting for spurious EID entries and
exits reduces the absolute measures for job creation and destruction by up to 13 percent and aligns
them closer with the business cycle.
   This paper continues as follows: Section 2 discusses the data we are using and describes our
methodology, in particular our system to classify appearances and disappearances of EIDs. Sec-
tion 3 takes this classiﬁcation system to the data and evaluates how well the worker ﬂow method
does in identifying true economic events. In Section 4 we discuss the robustness of our results to
choosing different cutoffs for classifying entries and exits and provide some evdience in support of
the chosen thresholds. Section 5 provides the application to job creation and destruction measures,
by showing the bias that arises from using uncorrected EIDs. Section 6 concludes.


2      Data and the Worker Flow Method

2.1     Data
The establishment history panel (BHP) is created from German social security records. Employers
are required to ﬁle a report for all employees who are employed during a year. This report con-
tains information on the duration of employment, the total pay over that period and a number of
demographic variables (such as education, nationality, gender, and age). The pay information is
generally very accurate (since it determines the social security contributions) but top coded. There
is also information on industry, occupation and work status (full-time, part-time, apprentice) avail-
able. Since employers and individuals are uniquely identiﬁed through establishment and person
IDs, it is possible to construct complete job histories for individual workers, and to follow estab-
lishments over time. The data covers all employment subject to social security contributions, but
excludes certain types of government employees and the self-employed.3 Overall about 80 percent
of the working population in Germany is in the dataset. While this is a large part of the population,
it is clear that for the study of establishment turnover this dataset omits establishments that consist
only of workers not covered by social security (mainly government agencies and institutions such
as schools) or only of self-employed such as law ﬁrms who only have partners - though in most
cases there would at least be some staff who is employed and liable to social security contributions.
     Establishments are identiﬁed on the basis of establishment identiﬁcation numbers (EID). Those
numbers are allocated to each organizational unit in a speciﬁc region and industry consisting of
at least one worker liable to social insurance.4 The deﬁnition of an establishment in this data
    3 Alsomarginal part-time employment had been exempt from social security until 1999, so that up to this date it is
not included in this data.
   4 Since 1999 establishments with at least one marginal part-time worker are also assigned an EID.

does not necessarily correspond exactly to a meaningful economic unit like a ﬁrm or a plant.
An establishment may consist of one or more branches. As long as they all belong to the same
industry and authority district (Kreis) they might all be covered under the same EID. Once an
establishment is assigned an EID this number remains constant over time. This holds especially if
the establishment moves to another region or is temporarily closed. The latter prevents classifying
a reopened establishment as a true entry. On the other hand, an ownership or industry change
triggers the assignment of a new EID to an establishment, despite not being a truly new opening.
    The BHP is created by collapsing social security records data on the establishment year level.5
Only employment spells that cover June 30th are used so that for each establishment and year
there is a record with information on characteristics and size of the employees on this date. The
resulting data is a panel comprising the universe of German social security liable employment since
the year 1975. Our analysis is based on BHP data for the time period 1975-2004. The strength
of this data is clearly its large scope (about 2 million observations per year covering about 25
million jobs) and time span. One important weakness, and the motivation for this paper, is that it
is difﬁcult to identify establishment entry and exit in the BHP. While for each EID it can be easily
determined when it appears for the ﬁrst and last time, it is not clear that these dates correspond to
true entries and exits. An important concern is that if an EID changes for other reasons, this would
appear as an exit and an entry without any corresponding economic event. That this can happen is
acknowledged in the documentation of the BHP (Dundler et al. 2006), but it is hard to judge how
often this actually happens and whether this biases empirical work that ignores the issue.

Establishments and Firms

It is helpful to clarify what we mean by establishment entry and exit before discussing how to
identify these events. We understand an establishment to be a local economic unit consisting of
workers and capital, and producing some sort of goods or services. Examples are a manufacturing
plant, a restaurant, a local branch of a bank, or a gas station. This is different from the ﬁrm as an
economic unit, which may consist of several establishments, which may create new or destroy old
establishments, and which may buy or sell them. It can be the case that a ﬁrm disappears but an
establishment belonging to the ﬁrm continues to exist (e.g. after being taken over by a competitor)
and vice versa.
     It is not completely clear under which conditions one would consider an establishment in year
t to be the same establishment in year t + 1. If all workers are still employed at the same location
but possibly by a different owner or as part of a different company, one would probably consider
this a continuing establishment that experienced an ownership change. On the other hand if only
   5 The social security data is available to the scientiﬁc community in several different forms,
                                                                                          ranging from individual
level panel data (the IABS) to linked employer-employee data (the LIAB). For more information see http://fdz.iab.de.


                                                            4
the location is the same and the new owner replaced all old workers with new ones, one would
likely consider this a new establishment. In between these two extremes the distinction becomes
fuzzy and in practice somewhat arbitrary deﬁnitions will have to be made. In addition to ID
Changes, which allow following an establishment from one year to another, and clear creations or
destructions of establishments, it is also possible for establishments to break up into several units
or for several establishments to merge.
   For this paper we completely ignore the capital aspect of establishments (for data reason) and
focus on the employee side. We therefore deﬁne a new establishment to be an establishment where
a new group of workers get together and start producing something, and we deﬁne a continuing es-
tablishment to be an establishment where a large part of the workforce has been employed together
in the previous year. We will also take care to classify break ups and spin-offs appropriately. Since
we do not have direct information on ownership structure or ﬁrm identities, it should be kept in
mind that we are limited in that dimension.


2.2     The Worker Flow Method for Correcting Establishment IDs
In this paper we directly address the problem of spurious EID entries and exits by providing and
evaluating a new way to identify establishment entry and exit based on worker ﬂows. Having
access to the underlying social security records of the BHP we observe directly how many workers
move between each establishment pair between two consecutive years. We will call all workers
who move from an establishment A to an establishment B, a cluster of workers. Such a cluster will
represent an inﬂow in establishment B and an outﬂow in establishment A. Using the individual
level social security data, we created a dataset on all worker ﬂows, where a unit of observation is
one clustered ﬂow. Of all the clustered inﬂows to an EID, we call the largest one (most number
of workers) in a given year the maximum clustered inﬂow (MCI). Similarly we deﬁne the largest
ﬂow of all the clustered outﬂows in a year the maximum clustered outﬂow (MCO).6
    Our strategy to classify new EIDs into new establishments, Spin-Offs, and id changes is based
on whether the workers in a new establishment all come from the same EID or not. In practice
this is done by looking whether not more than a certain percentage of the current work force at an
entering EID was employed together in the previous year. To check this it is sufﬁcient to know
the total number of workers currently employed, and the maximum clustered inﬂow to the EID.
Similarly, in order to classify exiting EIDs it is enough to have information on the maximum
    6 In addition to inﬂows from other establishments, there are also workers that were not employed in a social security

liable job on June 30th of the previous year. In our ﬂow data we cannot distinguish between whether these workers
were unemployed at that time or worked in a job not covered by our data (self-employed, government or jobs below
the earnings threshold for social security). The MCI (and similarly the MCO) is the maximum of all inﬂows from
other establishments, so if no workers come from other establishments the MCI would be 0.



                                                           5
clustered outﬂow. We therefore restrict our ﬂow data to the MCI and MCO and merge those to
each establishment year observation in the BHP.

Classifying Entering Establishment IDs

Not all new EIDs are also new establishments since an EID can change for a number of reasons.
However it is true that the way EIDs are assigned in Germany implies that almost all new estab-
lishments will receive a new unique EID.7 This allows us to focus on new EIDs to identify new
establishments. Based on the previous discussion a new EID can correspond to either a new es-
tablishment or a continuing establishment. A new establishment is an establishment where the
workforce consists largely of workers that have newly come together to the production process
(either be as a new ﬁrm or as part of an existing ﬁrm).
    Continuing establishments correspond to the case where a large fraction of the workforce at
the new establishment was employed together in the year before. We will call the EID where the
largest cluster of workers has been employed together in the prior year the predecessor. If the
workers at the new EID that were employed together in the year before also constituted most of
the predecessor’s employment, then the new EID and the predecessor correspond to very similar
working arrangements and we will thus call them the same establishment, that underwent a change
of the establishment identiﬁer.
   The other possibility for a continuing establishment is that a large fraction of the workers
have been employed together in the previous year, but that they did not actually represent a large
fraction of the workforce of the predecessor. We call this case a Spin-Off or break up, since a part
of the predecessor is spun-off to create a new production unit. This can be further distinguished in
whether or not the predecessor continues to exist or not. If not, we refer to a Spin-Off as pushed,
since the group of workers is pushed out by the closing/disappearance of the larger unit. If the
predecessor continues to exist we label the Spin-Off as pulled. While we use the label ’spin-off’
here, it is important to note that without more context or information, this may encompass a number
of different economic events. For example if an existing ﬁrm creates a new branch or plant (which
for industry code or accounting reasons is assigned a new EID), this may be associated with a ﬂow
of workers from existing plants. Since such a new EID would still be part of the same company,
calling this spin-off may be a bit misleading. Exploring the economic signiﬁcance of these spin-off
events is a particularly interesting avenue for future research. Also note that some new EIDs do
not ﬁt any of these patterns very well. We will come back to those later. From this discussion we
can classify new EIDs into the following ﬁve broad categories:
   7 Except for the qualiﬁcations in the data section of how an establishment is deﬁned in the BHP, there is only one
qualiﬁcation: If a business owner essentially shuts down his business for a number of years and then reopens it, she
may use the same EID again even though this may reasonably referred to as a new establishment by our deﬁnition.


                                                         6
   • New establishments:
      A group of workers who come together to form a new production unit

   • Continuing establishments: Spin-Off / Break Up pushed

   • Continuing establishments: Spin-Off / Break Up pulled

   • ID Change (because of ownership change, take over, change of legal form, restructuring)

   • Other / Not classiﬁable / Unclear

   In order to apply these classiﬁcations to the data it is necessary to deﬁne cutoffs for what it
means that most workers did not work together in the previous year etc. Our cutoffs and clas-
siﬁcation system follow Benedetto et. al. (2007) and are displayed in Table 1. For very small
establishments the ratio of MCI to employment is not a very meaningful statistic (since for exam-
ple for an establishment with exactly one worker in its ﬁrst year this ratio can only be 0 or 1). We
therefore put all establishments with less than 4 workers in the ﬁrst year into an extra category
which we call New Establishments (small). For the establishments with more than 3 employees
we use the MCI to categorize them. If the MCI is less than 30 percent of all inﬂows in the ﬁrst
year of an EID, we call this a medium or big New Establishment (med & big). For 30 to 80
percent of MCI/inﬂows and less than 80 percent MCI/predecessor employment we put the new
EID into a category which we call New Establishment (fuzzy) to indicate that these are likely new
establishments but that there is some possibility of misclassiﬁcation.
    Most establishments with a higher than 80 percent MCI/inﬂow ratio can be considered to be
continuing establishments. To distinguish between the different continuing establishment cate-
gories it is necessary to look at the predecessor. If the MCI corresponds to less than 80 percent of
the predecessor’s total employment (in the previous year), we call the continuing establishment a
Spin-Off, if it is more than 80 percent and the predecessor exits we call it an ID-change. If the pre-
decessor exits from the previous to the current year, we call the Spin-Off pushed, otherwise pulled.
The remaining ﬁelds seem odd combinations for various reasons and are thus labeled Unclear (we
come back to this in the results section).

Classifying Exiting Establishment IDs

Our method for classifying exiting establishments follows the same principle. All exiting estab-
lishments with less than 4 workers are classiﬁed as small establishment deaths, since for those the
ratio of MCO to employment in the last year is not a meaningful statistic. All establishments where
the ratio of MCO to employment in the year before the exit is less than 30 percent are classiﬁed as
atomized deaths. Exiting establishment IDs where the MCO/last employment ratio is between 30

                                                  7
and 80 percent are classiﬁed as fuzzy deaths. It is certainly debatable what the best classiﬁcation
for this group is. One could both imagine that establishments of this kind are true exits, where a
relatively large chunk of workers happens to end up at the same establishment, or some kind of
spin-offs or takeovers that only take a relatively small fraction of workers. Since we think that any
cutoff is ultimately arbitrary we put them in a separate category, which allows us later to see the
importance of this group. For symmetry with the entry classiﬁcation we label establishments with
less than 80 percent MCO/outﬂow ratio and more than 80 percent MCO/successor employment
ratio Spin-Offs (in this cased pushed, since the predecessor exits).
   Exiting EIDs where a very large fraction – we take 80 percent as the cutoff – of workers stay
together indicate that these are not true exits. If these worker go to a new EID in the following
year and this group makes up most of the workers at the new establishment ID, then we take this
as a strong indication that this is actually simply a change of the EID and we classify this as an ID
change. If the workers enter an existing EID and make up less than 80 percent of the workforce at
this EID, this may correspond to a takeover of the exiting establishment and we label this takeover
/ restructuring. The remaining categories are labelled unclear again.


2.3   Applying the Worker Flows Method to German Establishments
Table 2 Panel A shows the total number of establishments in each of our seven entry categories,
pooling all establishment entries from 1976 to 2003. The vast majority (83 percent) of all new
EIDs are New Establishments (small), with the two second largest groups being the other two New
Establishment classes, accounting for 6 percent each. The other categories account for far fewer
establishments: ID-changes for about 0.8 percent and Spin-Offs (pulled) and Spin-Offs (pushed)
for 1.7 and 1.1 percent respectively. About 0.9 percent are classiﬁed as Unclear. While thus 95
percent of all new EIDs appear to be truly new establishments (excluding the fuzzy category),
and Spin-Offs and ID-changes appear to be pretty rare, this masks the fact that most of these new
establishments are very small. The table therefore also shows total employment in each of these
establishment classes (in the year the EID appears). This changes the relative importance of these
categories substantially. ID Changes and Unclear entries now account for nearly 10 percent of
employees in new EIDs. Spin-Offs combined have about 3 million employees in their ﬁrst year
out of a total of 17 million in new EIDs. New establishments still account for most employees
(about 73 percent), but the group of small establishments is now much less important (though
still the largest) while the fuzzy and med & big groups account for 4 and 3 million employees
each. Given the ambiguity of the fuzzy new establishment category, the group of unambiguous
establishment entries is thus signiﬁcantly reduced when either considering employment weighted
number (accounting for only 50 percent of all employment) or when considering only EIDs with


                                                 8
more than 3 employees (accounting for only 37 percent of all new EIDs).
   The impression that spurious entries, due to the non-new establishment categories, are more
important among large new EIDs, is conﬁrmed further when we break up the entry classiﬁcations
by employment size in the ﬁrst year (See Appendix Table A-2). By deﬁnition New Establishments
(small) only appear in the smallest size class. Among the larger establishments it is apparent that
the two new establishment categories become relatively less important as employment increases.
It is probably not surprising that there are few truly new establishments that start out very big and
those that do would often be new establishments set up by large multi-establishment ﬁrms or some
kind of outsourcing of parts of an establishment, both of which may show up us Spin-Offs (pulled).
   The total number of establishments in each exit category is reported in Table 2 Panel B. The
Small Deaths account for the vast majority of exits, with nearly 83 percent. Among the exit-
ing EIDs with more than 3 employees, the Atomized and Fuzzy Death categories are clearly the
largest with 290,000 and 240,000 establishments respectively. Establishment deaths that are asso-
ciated with a Spin-Off occurring, are less frequent, with a total of 86,000 establishments. Exiting
EIDs that probably do not correspond to an actual dissolution of the establishment – Takeovers and
ID Changes – make up about 37,000 establishments each. Finally about 0.7 percent of all estab-
lishments are classiﬁed as Unclear. Again these raw numbers overstate the importance of the Small
Death category for employment. The numbers on employment in each of the categories reveal that
the Small Death category, while still the largest, only accounts for about 30 percent of employment
in exiting EIDs. The other two death categories are relatively more important for employment,
having a share of about 23 percent each. Finally takeovers, ID Changes and Unclear exits do rep-
resent a sizable fraction of the workforce in exiting EID, representing a combined total of about
13 percent. This is again reinvorced when when we break up the exit types by establishment size
in the year prior to exit (Appendix Table A-3): Among the smaller size classes the atomized and
fuzzy death classes clearly dominate, accounting for most of the exits. However, these categories
become less important among the larger establishments, where ID Changes and Takeovers are rel-
atively more important. It is particularly interesting that among large establishment exits with 100
workers or more, less than one in four exits fall into the atomized death category. This clearly
highlights the importance of controlling for spurious exits in studies of job-displacement.
     To summarize, while spurious entries and exits are less important among smaller establish-
ments, they become signiﬁcantly more important when establishments are employment weighted
or similarly when looking at larger establishments. While this supports the notion that it is poten-
tially important to apply the worker ﬂow method to control for spurious entries and exits, based
on this categorization alone it is unclear whether the worker ﬂow method does in fact improve in
identifying exits and entries that correspond to real economic events.

3     Evaluating the Worker Flow Method
In this section we evaluate the performance of the worker ﬂow categorization of establishment
entries and exits using three independent methods, that allow us to judge whether the categories of
entries and exits correspond closer to the economic events that we want to capture.


3.1     Cross Validation with Survey Data
As a ﬁrst way to gauge whether the worker ﬂow method is able to distinguish between real estab-
lishment entries and spurious entries, we compare the entry years that are implied by our method
with the years of the foundation of the establishment according to a survey based self-assessment
of the establishments. If the categorization of entering EIDs in the administrative data is mean-
ingful, then for categories capturing true entries, the correlation between survey based foundation
year of an establishment with the administrative birth year (based on the ﬁrst appearance of the
EID), should be signiﬁcantly higher than for the other categories.
    We derive the year of establishment foundation from the Establishment Panel (EP), a large,
representative survey of German establishments.8 The Establishment Panel is a panel of establish-
ments that are interviewed yearly starting in 1993. The size of the panel varies over time but in
recent years about 15,000 establishments are interviewed every year. The Establishment Panel can
be linked on the establishment level to the establishment identiﬁers in the Establishment History
Panel. We deﬁne as the birth year in the BHP, the year in which the EID ﬁrst appeared. In the EP
the birth year is the answer to the question when the establishment was founded. Establishments
are also asked whether the foundation was a) a new ﬁrm or branch, b) a new establishment, or c)
neither of these.
    Table 3 shows the correlation coefﬁcients between the birth years in the BHP and EP for the
three EP establishment categories and the seven BHP establishment entry categories based on
worker ﬂows. Column (1) shows the correlation between survey birth year and administrative
birth year in the ’new ﬁrm or branch’ category of the EP. The correlation is highest in the New
establishment small and med & big categories, providing support for our classiﬁcation of these
establishments as true entries. The correlation is weaker for the other categories, though also not
zero. It is interesting that the correlation is still about 0.49 for ID-Changes. This might be because
ID-changes could be associated with ownership changes and that survey respondents interpret
’founding year of the establishment’ to be the year when ownership changed.
    Column (2) shows the same correlations for the ’new establishment’ category in the survey,
again the correlation between birth years is highest for the New estab (med & big) category, close
    8 More   information regarding the EP can be found at: http://fdz.iab.de



                                                            10
to 0.9. Strikingly the correlation between birth years is negative for the ID changes in this column
and pretty low for the New Establishment (fuzzy) category, supporting our suspicion that this
category may contain many spurious entries. Finally Column (3) provides correlations for the other
category, which are generally weaker, as would be expected given that in this case the foundation
year in the survey data may be spurious.
   Overall the comparison with the survey based in formation supports our categorization in so far
as that the correlations between birth years tend to be higher in the establishments categories that
we would expect to correspond to true entries in both datasets. Notice that both datasets capture
slightly different concepts. E.g. in the survey respondents may well state the age of the mother-
ﬁrm rather than the establishment in a multi-level ﬁrm, thus measuring something different than
the administrative establishment unit. Similarly respondents to the survey may or may not view an
ownership change as a new ’foundation-year’ of an establishment. So while the patterns seem to
support our categorization, the imperfect correlations may not be surprising.


3.2        The Cyclicality of Entries and Exits
Economic upswings are usually associated with an increase in the formation of new establishments
and ﬁrms, while recessions tend to be associated with plant closures and job destruction. If our
entry and exit classiﬁcation system does indeed capture differences in underlying economic events,
then we should expect that the entry of EIDs classiﬁed as new establishments goes up in a boom
and down in a recession, while the reverse should hold for EID exits classiﬁed as establishment
exits. On the other hand the spurious entry and exit categories should be less correlated with the
business cycle.
    Figure 1 (a) shows the number of entering EIDs by entry category and year for West Germany.9
On average there are about 120,000 new EIDs per year, with a slight increase to about 130-140,000
after 1990. 1999 (and to a lesser extent the following 2 years) is a clear outlier with a sharp
spike in the New Establishment (small) category. In this year the reporting requirements for the
social security system were changed to cover marginally employed workers. While we attempted
to correct for this by dropping these employment relationships, the underlying structure of the
reporting rules make it impossible to correct for this perfectly which almost certainly explains the
spike.10
   9 For  East Germany the data starts in 1991 and by focusing on 1992 and later we should not pick up establishments
which are simply covered by the social security system for the ﬁrst time. Nevertheless, as we show in the Web
Appendix we still ﬁnd a very large number of new establishments, more than 160,000, in 1992. Nearly all of them
fall in the new establishment categories. The number of new EIDs drops sharply in 1993 and then shows a declining
pattern, though with some outliers, across all categories until 2004.
   10 Apart from this outlier the number of EIDs in the New Establishment (small) category shows essentially no time

trend. This is markedly different from all other categories which show fairly strong increases over time. Perhaps



                                                         11
    The corresponding establishment exits are shown in Figure 1 (b). Again there appears to be
an overall trend towards more establishment turnover throughout the 90s and early 2000s. The
various true exit categories seem to increase similarly as the spurious exits, such as ID Changes.
    In Figures 1 (a) and (b), recessions (1982, 1993 and 2003) are indicated by vertical bars. These
ﬁgures give a visual impression of the cyclicality (and acyclicality) of the different time series:
it appears that establishment entries in the medium/big category and small category are markedly
lower in recessions, while the corresponding establishment exit categories increase in downturns.
   We assess this more carefully by computing correlation coefﬁcients between the time series of
the different entry and exit categories and business cycle indicators. As business cycle indicators
we use the growth rate of real GDP, as well as the year to year change in the unemployment
rate measured in percentage points. Table 4 Panel A displays the correlation between number
of establishments and number of employees in each of the seven entry categories with the two
business cycle indicators. Since the change in the unemployment rate and GDP growth are quite
highly negatively correlated (as one might expect from Okun’s law), the patterns emerging from
the two measures are pretty similar. Since several categories show strong increases over time, the
raw correlation between such categories and the business cycle indicators (which are essentially
trendless) will be highly affected by the long term trends and is thus not very informative. For
this reason we detrend the establishment and employment time series using the Hodrick-Prescott
ﬁlter.11
    ID Changes and Spin-Offs Pulled are not strongly correlated with the business cycle and only
the detrended time series show a weak (and statistically insigniﬁcant) counter cyclical correlation.
For the Spin-Off Pushed category the correlation is very strongly counter-cyclical once the long
term trend is taken out (correlation of 0.7 with the change in the UR). Since we think of these
as spin-off which are forced by plant closings it makes sense that these are more common dur-
ing downturns. On the other hand the New Establishment (med & big) and New Establishment
(small) time series appear to follow the business cycle quite closely, showing clear and statistically
signiﬁcant correlations of around 0.4 to 0.6 with the business cycle measures.
    The fact that only those entry categories which we consider to be relatively unambiguously new
establishments are strongly procyclical indicates that our classiﬁcation corresponds to real eco-
nomically different events and we ﬁnd this reassuring. Furthermore the ambiguity of the Unclear
and New Establishment (fuzzy) categories is reﬂected in the weaker correlation with the business
most striking is the fact that ID-Changes are more than three times as common towards the end of our sample period
compared to the beginning. Similarly there is a very strong increase of both Spin-Off categories. There is also a
pronounced increase in the Unclear and Fuzzy New Establishment categories, while the New Establishment (med &
big) category shows only a moderate increase over time which reverts back to its starting value in the last 2 years.
   11 We use a smoothing parameter value of 1600, which is commonly used for quarterly data, since we found that the

more standard values for annual data take out too much of the cyclical variation. The results are very similar if instead
of HP ﬁltering, we simply take out a linear time trend.


                                                          12
cycle, which points towards our suspicion that these categories correspond to true establishment
entries as well as spin-offs and restructuring events.
    For the exits in Table 4 Panel B, Atomized Deaths and Spin-Offs Pushed (which we argued
should also be considered true exits) show nearly the same pattern of a very robust positive cor-
relation with the change in the unemployment rate (about 0.7) and a weaker negative correlation
with GDP growth. Interestingly the Small Death category is nearly uncorrelated with the business
cycle, and thus shows a markedly different pattern than the New Small category. Also quite differ-
ent from the respective entry categories, both the Fuzzy Death and the Unclear categories appear
to be somewhat procyclical (although only marginally statistically signiﬁcant), which may indicate
that there are relatively few true exits in these categories and instead that they involve a signiﬁcant
amount of restructuring. The Takeover/Restructuring category is nearly acyclical as well as the ID
Change category, which exhibits the same pattern as the corresponding entry category.
   This evidence supports the common practice in displacement studies of the Jacobson, Lalonde
and Sullivan (1993) type to view only worker separations from disappearing establishments that
are large and atomized (in our parleance) as true displacements. The strong correlation of these
establishment exits (in particular compared to the other EID exit categories) with economic down-
turns clearly indicates that these are more likely to correspond to real establishment closings and
lumping all EID exits together may severely downward bias our displacement effects in the absence
of such corrections.


3.3    The Evolution of Establishment Characteristics around Establishment
       Events
We now turn to how characteristics of establishments evolve around establishment events. We
investigate the evolution of new EIDs over time depending on their entry type. There are two
simple descriptive ways to achieve this. On the one hand one can pick a cohort of entering EIDs
and follow them over time. On the other hand one can pick a year and analyze establishments
of different ages in that year. The former approach has the problem that the variation with age
is confounded by overall time trends, while the latter has the disadvantage that age is possibly
confounded by differences of establishments across cohorts. We show results based on the latter
approach.
    Table 5 shows characteristics in establishments of different age in 2000 by their entry category.
The ﬁrst Panel shows how employment varies with establishment age (we speak of establishment
age here even though we really mean the age of the EID, i.e. time since the ﬁrst appearance of the
EID). New establishments small and med & big show fairly strong employment growth over the
ﬁrst few years. For example New Establishments (small) have on average only 1 employee in their


                                                  13
ﬁrst year, but nearly 4 in their fourth year. New establishments (med & big) start out larger with
about 12 employees, but this also quickly increases to 19 by age 4 and continues to rise afterwards.
Since we would probably expect new establishments to grow this provides some support for our
deﬁnition of new establishments. The New Establishments (fuzzy) category also shows increasing
employment with age, but the relationship is not quite monotone. Also consistent with the fact that
the other categories do not represent true establishment entries, they show no clear relationship
between time since entry and employment.
   The correlation between employment and establishment age can of course be driven by selec-
tion. This possibility is particularly important since new establishments have a very high proba-
bility of exiting again, so that the increase in average employment may be a simple composition
effect. For this reason Table 5 Panel B shows how employment growth varies with establishment
age. Here growth is computed on the establishment level (Employment current year minus em-
ployment last year divided by employment last year) and then averaged over the establishments.
It is clear that the increase in employment in Panel A is not just driven by selection and instead
all three new establishment categories show strong growth over the ﬁrst couple of years, while the
other categories show little growth.12


4      Sensitivity: What are the Correct Cutoffs for Deﬁning En-
       tries and Exits?
There is necessarily some arbitrariness in picking cutoffs for classifying establishment entries and
exits. There is an inherent trade-off similar to the standard econometric trade-off between bias
and efﬁciency. If the cutoff for the ratio of the maximum concentrated inﬂow to employment is
very low, then the new establishment deﬁnition is most likely to correspond to only true entries.
However in this case the number of observations is also quite low and a potentially large number of
true new establishments are not captured by the deﬁnition. If the cutoff is increased, the deﬁnition
will likely cover a larger share of real establishment entries, but will also include more ’false
positives’. While the right deﬁnition depends on the research question at hand, in this section we
present some evidence that the chosen cutoffs for establishment entries (MCI/inﬂows < 30%) and
exits (MCO/outﬂows < 30%) may infact represent a reasonable choice for many applications.
    In order to investigate the role of different inﬂow cutoffs for deﬁning establishment entries, we
divided all new EIDs into bins of the ratio of the MCI and the employment in the ﬁrst year. We
use 10 bins for MCI/inﬂow ratios between 0 to 1, where the bandwidth of each bin is 0.1. We
    12 Schmieder
               (2013) investigates how these high growth rates in new establishments are associated with wages,
showing a negative relationship between establishment age and wages within establishments.



                                                      14
then compute the number of EID entries per year in each of those bins and compute the correlation
coefﬁcient between the number of EIDs and the change in the unemployment rate in the same way
as we did for Table 4.
    Figure 2 shows the correlation coefﬁcients for the 10 bins (along with conﬁdence intervals), as
well as the average number of new EIDs per year in each of the bins. The top ﬁgure uses all new
EIDs with more than 3 employees in the ﬁrst year, while the bottom restricts the sample to EIDs that
start out with at least 10 employees. Both ﬁgures show that the correlation between entries and the
change in the unemployment rate is clearly negative (i.e. entries increase in good labor markets) for
small cutoffs, as we would expect. As the cutoffs become larger the negative correlation becomes
insigniﬁcant and eventually is reversed for the last two bins (MCI/inﬂows>80%), providing strong
support that EID entries with high MCI/inﬂow ratios are unlikely to be new establishments.
   Turning to the number of establishments in each bin, the top ﬁgure is somewhat jagged with
a spike in the 3rd bin. This is due to the fact that inﬂows are a discrete number of employees and
most EID entries are very small. E.g. establishments where all workers come from different EIDs
in the prior year, still have an MCI/inﬂow ratio of 0.2 or 0.25 if employment in the ﬁrst year is
only 5 or 4 employees respectively. This explains why there are so few establishments in the ﬁrst
bin, since only EIDs with at least 10 employees could even show up in this bin. In the bottom
ﬁgure, where we only look at EIDs with at least 10 employees in the ﬁrst year, we do not have
this issue due to the integer nature of inﬂows. Here we have a clear U-shaped pattern, with many
new EIDs in the ﬁrst bin, as well as for high MCI/inﬂow ratios. This ﬁgure strongly suggests that
new EIDs are indeed divided into a large number of truly new establishments, but also a signiﬁcant
number of ID changes in the higher bins. Note that cutoff of MCI/inﬂows < 30% can be viewed
as a sweet-spot, since it is roughly the turning point when the number of EIDs increases again and
when the correlation coefﬁcient is starting to not be signiﬁcant anymore.
    Figure 3 represents a parallel analysis for exiting EIDs. Since exits tend to be larger than
entries in any case and many papers are interested in closings of larger plants, we show the re-
sults for EIDs with at least 10 (top ﬁgure) and 50 (bottom ﬁgure) employees.13 The results are
similar across both ﬁgures. The correlation between establishment exits and the change in the un-
employment rate is, as expected, positive and highly statistically signiﬁcant, for the ﬁrst 3-4 bins
but falls rapidly thereafter indicating that indeed only the lower bins correspond to true establish-
ment deaths. Furthermore there is again a low point in the number of EIDs in the 3rd and 4th
bin. Overall this indicates that the cutoff for deﬁning atomized deaths, or true establishment exits,
of MCO/outﬂows < 30% is a reasonable trade-off, providing a large number of observations that
  13 See Web Appendix for samples with EIDs with at least 4 and 30 employees. While the employee threshold of 4

and larger again displays the jaggedness in the number of EIDs per year due to the discrete nature of outﬂows, the 30
employee sample looks very similar to Figure 3



                                                         15
likely correspond to true exits.
   We also conducted a careful sensitivity analysis of our other results where we varied the thresh-
olds for inﬂows and outﬂows by values of 0.1 around the main threshold (e.g. deﬁning new estab-
lishments to be EIDs where MCI/inﬂows < 20% or MCI/inﬂows < 40%). As one might expect
from the low mass of EIDs in these ranges in Figures 2 and 3, this has only a relatively small im-
pact on the number of observations in each entry and exit classiﬁcation. Furthermore it has almost
no impact on the correlations in Tables 3 to 5. This is again not surprising, given the results in
Figures 2 and 3, since there the correlations are quite stable around smaller changes of the inﬂow
and outﬂow cutoffs.


5    Application: Correcting Measures of Job Creation and Job
     Destruction
New establishments are often considered to be important contributors to overall job growth. How-
ever, as discussed before, spurious entries and ID Changes can signiﬁcantly overstate the contri-
bution by new entries. In order to assess the magnitude of this problem Figure 4 (a) shows job
creation over time by new EIDs. The solid black line represents the uncorrected measure which
corresponds simply to total employment in new EIDs in their ﬁrst year of appearance. In a typical
year, there are about 300,000 - 400,000 jobs in new EIDs, which represents about 25 percent of
total job creation in the economy, or about 2 percent of all jobs. It is not completely clear, which of
the entry categories should be considered new entries, or corresponding to true job creation. If we
apply the most conservative measure and use only the New Small and New (med & big) category,
the job creation number by new establishments is nearly cut in half and new establishments ac-
count for only about 13 percent of overall job creation. Furthermore the strong increase over time
disappears and job creation by new establishments appears quite stable (though procyclical) in the
long run. The ﬁgure also shows corrected measures which are less conservative and for example
include the Fuzzy entries and Spin-Offs.
    Figure 4 (b) shows the same for job destruction. Again the most conservative correction mea-
sure, shows a much smaller contribution of establishment exits to overall job destruction (about 15
rather than 25 percent) and decreases the long term time trend, although there is still a signiﬁcant
increase over time. Unsurprisingly our corrected measures for job creation and job destruction by
entries and exits are also closer correlated with the business cycle.
    We also analyzed total job creation and job destruction after taking out the creation and de-
struction by spurious entries and exits (Correcting in the same way as in Figures 4 (a) and (b)).
Using the most conservative measure, it appears that the uncorrected overall job creation measure


                                                  16
is about 13 percent higher (increasing in recent years) than our corrected measure, a quite signiﬁ-
cant upward bias.14 Similarly the uncorrected total job destruction time series is about 11 percent
higher than the corrected one. For less conservative corrections, the difference is smaller but still
appears to be economically signiﬁcant.
    The impact of these corrections is strongest when we consider net job creation (deﬁned as job
creation minus job destruction) and destruction measures uncorrected and corrected for spurious
entries and exits. In absolute numbers, the correction for net-job creation measures has a smaller
impact, since the biases tend to cancel each other out. However since net job creation has a lower
level (on average around 0), the relative bias (the ratio of spurious net-job creation to total net-job
creation) in any particular year can be large and ranges from -60 to +30 percent in years where net
job creation is close to zero. On average (over all years) the relative bias is about 16 percent, a
quite signiﬁcant number in economic terms.


6       Conclusion
Every year there is a large number of newly appearing and disappearing establishment identiﬁers
in the data. In this paper we provide a way of classifying these events in order to distinguish true
establishment entries and exits from ID changes and restructuring events. We ﬁnd that clear cut
establishment entries and exits account only for roughly half of the employment in entering and
exiting EIDs. There is a large number of establishments which come out of Spin-Off events or
some sort of ﬁrm restructuring. There is also a sizable number of establishment identiﬁers, which
disappear or appear in ways which are not easily classiﬁed. Finally there are sizable numbers of
pure ID changes, particularly important among larger establishments.
    Our rules to identify true entries and exits create time series that closely line up with the busi-
ness cycle, while the other categories appear relatively acyclical. Across the board there are in-
teresting time patterns which warrant further investigation. For example there has been a strong
increase in establishment restructuring events in West Germany, while East Germany experienced
a decline over the same time period.
    Correcting job creation and destruction measures for spurious ID Changes and Restructuring
events has very sizable effects on the overall numbers. Not correcting for such events overesti-
mates the contribution of entries and exits to job creation and destruction by a factor of around 2.
Furthermore overall job creation and destruction rates are severely biased and about 5 percent (for
moderate corrections) to 10-13 percent (for more conservative corrections) lower when correcting

   The bias created by time inconsistent establishment identiﬁers and ﬁrm restructuring events
appears to be quite signiﬁcant and may be even more problematic within particular industries,
regions, or establishment size classes. It is hard to know exactly how big this problem is for the
interpretation of previous studies which identiﬁed establishment turnover solely using the EID
entries and exits (sometimes in conjunction with arbitrary size cutoffs), but it seems important to
take the potential biases into account.
    Fortunately our study indicates that using worker ﬂows will allow for signiﬁcant improvements
of the ﬁrm linkages and thus improve the overall data quality of the BHP. Working together with
the Research Data Center of the IAB, we have made the 6 crucial variables, on which all our def-
initions are based, available to users of the BHP, thus allowing researchers to either replicate our
entry and exit categories, or create their own classiﬁcation system. Several papers have already
made use of our approach to study entries and exits. For example Fackler, Schnabel and Wagner
(2012) study the role of establishment size and age for establishment exit patterns using the BHP
in combination with the extension ﬁles containing the ﬂow variables created by us. In addition
to classifying entries and exits, these variables should also be useful for other purposes. For ex-
ample Schmieder, von Wachter and Bender (2010) use the same information on worker ﬂows to
distinguish true Mass-Layoffs from spurious exits and spin-off events to study earnings losses of
displaced workers. Similarly Fackler and Schnabel (2013) use our spin-off deﬁnitions to study the
survival dynamics of spin-offs and start-ups in Germany. We expect researchers to come up with
many more interesting research projects where this approach will be fruitful.

Notes: MCI stands for Maximum Clustered Inﬂow: the size of the largest cluster of inﬂowing current workers. Inﬂows stands for all the
total number of workers that arrived since the previous year at an EID, which for a new EID is the same as total current employment.
MCO stands for Maximum Clustered Outﬂows: the size of the largest cluster of outﬂowing current workers. Outﬂows are all workers that
leave the EID until the next year.

      Notes: The ﬁgures show how the correlation between the number of new establishments
      per year and the change in the unemployment rate is affected by different thresholds for
      what constitutes an establishment entry. For each point, all new establishment where the
      share of the maximum concentrated inﬂow of entry year employment falls into the given
      cutoff range (e.g. [0 - 0.1] for the ﬁrst bin) are calculated by year. Then the correlation
      between the (Hodrick-Prescott ﬁltered) time series of establishment births and the year to
      year change in the unemployment rate is calculated. The left axis shows the correlation
      coefﬁcient, while the right axis shows the average number of establishment births per year
      in the cutoff bin. The bands are 95% conﬁdence intervals.

Notes: The ﬁrst row in each cell shows the number of establishments, the second row the percentage of the
total (among entries and exits). MCI stands for Maximum Clustered Inﬂow: the size of the largest cluster of
inﬂowing current workers. Inﬂows stands for all the total number of workers that arrived since the previous year
at an EID, which for a new EID is the same as total current employment. MCO stands for Maximum Clustered
Outﬂows: the size of the largest cluster of outﬂowing current workers. Outﬂows are all workers that leave the
EID until the next year.

      Notes: The ﬁgures show how the correlation between the number of establishment deaths
      per year and the change in the unemployment rate is affected by different thresholds for
      what constitutes an establishment death. For each point, all establishment deaths where
      the share of the maximum concentrated outﬂow of pre-exit employment falls into the given
      cutoff range (e.g. [0 - 0.1] for the ﬁrst bin) are calculated by year. Then the correlation
      between the (Hodrick-Prescott ﬁltered) time series of establishment deaths and the year to
      year change in the unemployment rate is calculated. The left axis shows the correlation
      coefﬁcient, while the right axis shows the average number of establishment deaths per year
      in the cutoff bin. The bands are 95% conﬁdence intervals.
