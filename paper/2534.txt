                   Credit,   Money, and Aggregate Demand




                                  ABSTRACT

     Standard models of aggregate demand treat money and credit
asymmetrically; money is given a special status, while loans,
bonds, and other debt instruments are lumped together in a "bond market"
and suppressed by Walras' Law. This makes bank liabilities central to
the monetary transmission mechanism, while giving no role to bank assets.

     We show how to modify a textbook IS-UI model so as to permit a more
balanced treatment. As in Tobin (1969) and Brunner-Meltzer (1972), the
key assumption is that loans and bonds are imperfect substitutes. In the
modified model, credit supply and demand shocks have independent effects
on aggregate demand; the nature of the monetary transmission mechanism is
also somewhat different. The main policy implication is that the
relative value of money and credit as policy indicators depends on the
variances of shocks to money and credit demand. We present some evidence
that money-demand shocks have become more important relative to
credit-demand shocks during the 1980s.

     Whether or not they use the name, most macroeconomists use something

like IS/LM to organize their thinking about how various events affect

aggregate demand. No one boasts about the microfoundations of this simple

model, no one Interprets it literally, and no one thinks It directly suitable

for econometric estimation. But its utility for telling simple yet coherent

stories about the transmission of monetary, fiscal, and other shocks is

evident. Furthermore, IS/LN analysis often does seem to describe what happens

to the economy, at least In a rough way.

     Of course, any simple model may sometimes be too simple. A case in

point is the IS/LM model's asyninetric treatment of money and credit. The LM

curve treats money as a special asset while assuming that all debt

instruments can be lumped together in a "bond market,N which Is conveniently

suppressed by Wairas' Law. This approach makes bank liabilities central to

the monetary transmission mechanism, while giving no role to bank assets.

     There are both theoretical and empirical reasons to question this

asyninetric treatment. A growing theoretical literature stresses the

importance of intermediaries In the provision of credit. According to this

alternative view, banks and other credit-granting institutions specialize in

gathering Information and monitoring the performance of borrowers In ways

that elude the anonymous auction market. Because they can finance activities

that cannot be financed in the bond market, loans by banks and other

Intermediaries acquire a special status. If financial Intermediation Is

reduced, either by rationing or by price, aggregate supply and demand may be

affected.1 Empirically, the well—documented instability of econometric

money-demand equations, itself probably a product of deregulation and

innovation by financial intermediaries, has reduced the utility of money as a




                                       1
measure of and guide to central bank policy. Finally, a series of papers by

Benjamin Friedman has argued that a particular measure of credit correlates

with nominal GNP as well -—   or   as badly -- as money does. All of this

suggests that the traditional focus on money may be inappropriate.

     However, credit will not mount a serious challenge to money as a

transmission mechanism until we have a simple macro model    that does for the

"credit view" what IS/LM does for the prevailing "money-only"    view, that Is,

provides a framework for thinking through how various shocks affect the

economy. We have developed several such models, of varying complexity, In our

research to date, but discuss only the demand side of the simplest one here.

Though It has a simple graphical representation like IS/IM, the model permits

us to pose a richer array of questions than the traditional money-only

framework.



 I. The Model

     The LM curve Is a portfolio—balance condition for a two—asset world:

 asset—holders choose between money and bonds. Tacitly,    loans and other forms

 of customer-market credit are viewed as perfect substitutes for

 auction-market credit ("bonds"), and financial markets clear only by price.

 Models with a distinct role for credit arise when either of these assumptions

 is abandoned.
                                                                   but it Is not
      Credit rationing may or may not be important empirically;

 necessary to rationalize a credit channel for monetary transmission and is

 not considered further here.2 We base our model Instead on the notion that
                                                                  because of
 customer- and auction—market credit are imperfect substitutes

 Informational   problems, differences   in liquidity, or the high transactions
 costs of raising funds in the open market. (One factor does not preclude the


                                            2
others.) In some cases, there may be no substitute for customer-market

credit. But to minimize the departure from IS/IN, we deal with the

Intermediate case of Imperfect substitutability. In this regard, we follow

in the tradition of Tobin (1969) and Brunner and Meltzer (1972).

       Our model has three assets: money, bonds, and loans. Only the loan

market needs explanation. We assume that both borrowers and lenders choose

between bonds and loans according to the Interest rates on the two credit

instruments. If p is the interest rate on loans and i Is the interest rate on

bonds, then loan demand is: Ld —       L(p,                 The dependence on GNP (y)
                                            -   4+
                                                1, y) .

captures   the transactions demand for credit, which might arise, for example,

from working capital or liquidity considerations.3

       To understand the genesis of loan supply, consider the following

simplified bank balance sheet (which Ignores net worth):

                     assets             liabilities
                  reserves, R          deposIts, 0
                  bonds, B°
                  loans, IS

Since reserves consist of required reserves tO, plus excess reserves, E, the

banks' adding-up constraint is: Bb +                + E — O(1—r).   Assuming that desired

portfolio proportions depend on rates of return on the available assets (zero

for excess reserves), we have:

                     —   A(p,   1)D(1—r),
                           +    -
with   similar equations for the shares of Bb and E. Thus the condition for

clearing the loan market is:

                 (1) L(p, i, y) —     A(p,      i)D(1—t).

       The money market is described by a conventional IN curve. Suppose banks

hold excess reserves equal to e(i)O(1-t).4 Then the supply of deposits (we

ignore cash) is equal to bank reserves, R, times the money multiplier, m(1) —


                                                3
            + r)r1.      The demand for deposits arises from the transactions

motive and depends on the interest rate, income, and total wealth, which Is

constant and therefore suppressed: O(1,y). Equating the two gives:

                 (2) D(l,y) —     m(i)R.
                                   +


Implicitly,   D(f,y) and L(p, 1, y) define the nonbank public's demand function

for bonds since money demand      plus   bond demand minus loan demand must equal

total financial wealth.

     The remaining market Is the goods market, which we suninarize in a

conventional IS curve, written generically as:5

                 (3) y • Y(1, p)




II. Graphical Representation

     Use (2) to replace D(1-w) on the righthand side of (1) by (1-r)m(1)R.

Then (1) can be solved for p as a function of 1, y, and R:6

                         — •(i,   y, R)
                 (4) p
                              +   +-
Finally,   substitute (4) Into (3) to get:

                 (5) y —   Y(1, •(f, y, R)),
which, In deference to Don Patinkin (1956), we call the CC curve (for

'coninodIt1es and creditTM). It is easy to see that the CC curve is negatively

sloped like an IS curve, and for much the same reasons. However, it Is

shifted by monetary policy (R) and by credit-market shocks that affect either

the L(.) or x(.)   functions,     while the IS curve is not. The CC and LN curves

are shown together in Figure 1.

     Our CC curve   reduces to the IS      curve if loans and bonds are assumed to

be perfect substitutes either to borrowers (Lp-—*) or to lenders (Ap-...), or

if commodity demand        is   insensitive to the loan rate (Yp—O) --        which would

make the loan market irrelevant to IS/1.M.7 This clarifies the special

'assumptions implicit in the money-only view.

        The opposite extreme, or Hcredjt_onlyN view, would arise if money and

bonds were perfect substitutes (°i-'—) which would make the LM curve

horizontal. Keynes' explanation for the liquidity trap is, of course, well

known. We think of high substitutability as more likely to arise from

financial innovations which create new money substitutes. However, even with

a liquidity trap, monetary policy still matters because It influences the CC

curve.

        Now   let   us turn to the intermediate cases represented by Figure 1.



III. Comparative Statics8

        Most conventional shocks work in our model just as they do in IS/LM. For

example, an expenditure shock shifts the CC curve along a fixed LM curve, and

a money-demand shock shifts the LM curve along a fixed                 CC curve. The effects

 are familiar and       need not be   discussed. The only noteworthy difference is
 that   a rise In bank reserves might conceivably raise the rate of Interest In

 the credit model.9 Graphically, the autigulty arises because an Increase in R

 shifts both the CC and U4 curves outward. Economically, the credit channel

 makes monetary policy more expansionary than In IS/LM and                therefore raises
 the transactions deaand for money by more           than   In   the   conventional model.

        Greater Interest attaches       to   issues that elude the IS/IN model. An

 upward shift in the credit supply           function, x(.) (which might correspond, for
 example, to a decrease in the perceived riskiness of loans) shifts the CC
 curve outward along a fixed LM curve, thereby raising I and y. The                 Interest

 rate on loans, p, falls, however. An upward shift In the credit demand



                                                 5
function, L(.),whlch might correspond to a greater need for working capital,

has precisely the opposite effects.

     We find It difficult to think of or identify major shocks to credit

demand, that is, sharp increases or decreases in the demand   for   loans at

given interest rates and GNP. But shocks to credit supply are easy to

conceptualize and to find in actual history. For example, Bernanke's (1983)

explanation for the length of the Great Depression can be thought of as a

downward shock to credit supply stemeing from the increased riskiness of

loans and banks concern for liquidity In the face of possible runs.

According to the model, such a shock should reduce credit, GNP, and the

interest rate on government bonds while raising the interest rate on loans.

Another notable example with the same predicted effects is the credit

controls of March—July 1980. In this instance Ntight moneys should, and

apparently did, reduce Interest rates on government bonds.



IV. Implications for Monetary Policy

     We turn next to the traditional target and Indicator issues of monetary

policy. The so—called monetary indicator problem arises If the central bank

sees its Impact on aggregate demand   only with a lag but sees its impacts on
financial-sector   variables like interest rates, money, and credit more

promptly. What does our model say about the suitability of money or credit As

indicators?

     Table 1 shows the qualitative responses of GNP, money, credit, and bond

interest rates to a wide variety of shocks, assuming that bank reserves is

the policy instrument.10 Columns (1) and (2) display a conclusion familiar

from IS/LM: money is a good qualitative indicator of future GNP movements

except when money demand shocks are empirically important. Columns (1) and

(3) offer the càrresponding conclusion for credit: credit Is a good

qualitative   indicator except when there are    important   shocks to credit

demand.   As we just indicated, money demand    shocks   appear to have been very
Important in the 1980s while it is hard to think of major credit demand
shocks. If this empirical judgment Is correct, credit may be a better
indicator than money.
      What about the target question, i.e., about the choice between

stabilizing   money versus stabilizing credit? Rather than try to conduct a

complete Poole (1970) style analysis, we simply ask whether pollcymakers

would respond NcorrectlyN (i.e.,   In   a stabilizing way) to various shocks if

they were targeting money or targeting credit.

      Consider first an expansionary IS shock. Table 1 (row 5) shows that bot

money and credit would rise If bank reserves were unchanged. Hence a central

bank trying to stabilize either money or credit would contract bank reserves

which Is the correct stabilizing response. Either policy works, at least

qualitatively. A similar analysis applies to shocks to the supply of credit

or to the money *iltiplier.

      But suppose the demand for money increases (row 2), which sends a

contractionary Impulse to GNP. Since this shock raises N, a monetarist

central bank would contract reserves in an effort to stabilize money, which

would destabilize GNP. This, of course, is the familiar Achilles heel of

monetarism. Notice, however, that this same shock would make credit contraC

So a central bank trying to stabilize credit would expand reserves. In this

case, a credit—based policy is superior to a money-based        policy
      The opposite is true, however, when      there are   credit demand   shocks. Ro
                                                                                the
4   tells us that a contractionary (for Gt4P) credit demand shock lowers

money supply but raises credit. Hence a monetarist central bank would turn



                                           7
expansionary, as it should, while a creditist central bank would turn

contractionary, which it should not.

       We therefore reach a conclusion similar to that reached in discussing

indicators: If money demand shocks are more Important that credit demand

shocks, then a policy of targeting credit is probably better than a policy of

targeting money.



V. Empirical Evidence

       The foregoing discussion suggests that the case for credit turns on

whether credit demand Is, or is becoming, relatively more stable than money

demand. We conclude with some evidence that this is true, at least since

1979.11

       Table   2 shows the simple correlations between GNP growth and growth of
the   two financial   aggregates during three periods. Money was obviously much
more highly correlated with income than was credit during the period of

stable money demand, 1953-1973. But the two financial aggregates were on a

more equal footing during 1974:1-1979:3. Further changes came during the

period of unstable money demand, 1979:4—1985:4; money-GNP correlations

dropped sharply while money-credit correlations fell only slightly, giving a

clear edge to credit.12

       More direct evidence on the relative magnitudes of money-demand and

credit-demand shocks was obtained by comparing the residuals from estimated

structural money      demand and credit demand functions like D(.) and L(.) in our

model. We used the logarithmic partial adjustment model, with adjustment In

nominal terms, which we are not eager to defend but which was designed to fit

money demand. Hence, our procedure seems clearly biased toward finding

relatively larger credit shocks than money shocks.

parameter stability across a 1973:4/1974:1 break, so we concentrated on the

Here y Is real GNP, P is the GNP deflator, p Is the bank prime rate, and i is

the three-month Treasury bill rate. Although the Interest rate coefficients

in the credit equation are individually insignificant, they are jointly

significant, have the correct signs, and are almost equal            in   absolute value

-—                a specification In which the spread between p and I determines
     suggesting
credit demand. Notice that the residual variances in the two equations are

about equal.

       Since the sample was too short to test reliably for parameter stabIlity,

we examined the residuals from the two equations over two subperlods with

these results:

                       variance of          variance of
     period           money residual      credit residual

1979:4-1985:4           .888 x               .435 x



The differences are striking. By this crude measure, the variance of money

demand shocks was much smaller than that of credit demand shocks during the


                                              9
first subperiod but much larger during the second.
       The evidence thus supports the idea that money-demand shocks became much
more Important relative to credit-demand shocks In the 1980s. But that does
not   mean we should start ignoring money and focusing on credit. After all, it

is perfectly conceivable that the relative sizes of money-demand and

credit-demand shocks will revert once again to what they were earlier.

Rather, the message of this paper   Is that   a more syninetric treatment of money

and credit is feasible and appears warranted.

2Bllnder (1987) offers a model In which there Is rationing and no substitute

for bank credit.

3Regarding the latter, Mishkin (1976) argues that, if a large part of wealth

is Illiquid, consumers may want to borrow against this Illiquld wealth In

order to maintain an adequate buffer stock of liquid financial assets.

4For simplicity we assume that only 1, not p, influences the demand for

excess reserves.

5The Interest rates in (3) should be real rates. But a model of aggregate

demand takes both the price level and inflation as given; so we take the

expected inflation rate to be constant and suppress it.

6p Is an Increasing function of I as long as the interest elasticity of the

money multiplier is not too large.

7The loan market might still affect aggregate supply, however. See Blinder

we have already made. But, in a few cases, we encounter theoretical

ambiguities that do not arise in IS/tM. Virtually all of these are of the

following type: some comparative-statics derivative Is the sum of several

terms, one of which has the Hwrongs sign. Every such case can be resolved by

Invoking one of the following three plausible assumptions:




                                       11
            1. The Income elasticities of the demand functions for money and

loans are not too different.

            2. The absolute elasticities of loan supply and loan demand with

respect to the two interest rates, p and i, are not too different, I.e., It

is mostly the differential, p—i, that matters.

            3. The Interest elasticity of the money multiplier is not too

large.

If output is fixed on the supply side, y would be replaced by P in Figure 1

and in the text discussion that follows.

9This cannot happen if assumptions 1 and 3 In footnote 8 hold.

10And that the aggregate supply curve Is not vertical. If It is, replace y by

P.

111n what   follows,   wmoneyu is Ml, HcreditN Is an aggregate Invented by one of

us: the sum of intermediated borrowing by households and businesses (derived

from Flow-of-Funds data). For details and analysis of the latter, see Blinder

(1985).

12Similar   findings emerged when we controlled for many variables via a

vector-autoregression and looked at correlations between VAR residuals.

13Estlmation was by instrtental variables. Instruments were current, once,

and twice lagged logs of real government purchases, real exports, bank

reserves, and a supply shock variable which is a weighted average of the

relative prices of energy and agricultural products.
