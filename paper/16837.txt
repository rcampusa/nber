Why World Exports are so Susceptible to the Economic Crisis--The Prevailing "Export Overshooting"
Phenomenon

                                             ABSTRACT

This paper provides some evidence of the “export overshooting” phenomenon, i.e., the unusually large
deviation of exports from their long-run level. We study the export trends of a sample of 37 countries
including both OECD and non-OECD countries over the period of 1994-2009. We find that exports
overshot their equilibrium value during economic crises and that the tendency to overshoot was a worldwide
phenomenon. The bullwhip effect was the driving force behind such a phenomenon. Moreover, the
extent of export overshooting was increasing in more recent crisis, which can be attributed to an increase
in cross-border vertical specialization over time.

1. Introduction

     In the years leading up to the summer of 2007 when the U.S. subprime crisis

began to unfold, the world saw a period of relative calm and prosperity after the

recovery from the dot-com bubble-burst in the early 2000s. While the major

industrialized nations grew at a modest pace of 1 to 3 percent per annum, the rise of

the BRIC and other emerging markets gave great impetus to the world’s economic

progress and spurred high growth in world trade. But the subprime loan problem gave

way quickly to a broad global crisis marked by slowing economies and dried-up

liquidity with unprecedented reach. The scope and devastating impacts of the global

financial crisis were greater than anyone had anticipated. Like a game of dominos, the

financial crisis started in the United States and spread to the rest of the world. It first

lacerated the world’s financial systems, then jolted and knocked out the real economy.

No country was immune to it. Not the “Wealthy Country Club” with member

countries such as the United States, Germany, and Japan. Not the usually resilient East

Asian NICs. Not even the up-and-coming powerful BRIC group. Among all these,

countries with a strong export orientation and opened up most to the world, especially

Japan and the East Asian NICs, were hit the hardest.

     Unlike the 2008 global financial crisis where the impacts were industry- and

world-wide, the internet crisis, a speculative bubble covering roughly the period

1998-2001, originated from the accelerated growth in internet related industries and

therefore tended to be sector-specific in nature. Because of the “get-big-fast” strategy

adopted by the new internet-based companies and the market confidence on the

profitable future of these companies, the internet bubble saw rapid run-ups in market

valuations on these companies (Valliere and Peterson, 2004). When the bubble burst

in 2000, it was followed by an equally rapid collapse of the markets and led to

                                            2
bankruptcy of many internet firms and huge losses in stock markets. The United

States, Canada, Asia and Europe all suffered from the sharp drop in stock prices

during 2000 and 2002. Countries with a heavy reliance on the exports of high-tech

products such as Japan, South Korea and Taiwan saw the global demand for ICT

products slowing in a weak economic outlook.

     The Asian crisis was somewhat different. It was triggered by the financial crisis

in a relatively small country (Thailand), where speculation caused funds to drain out

of Thai currency and stock market.1 The crisis was then spread to a wide set of

economies. It crippled East Asian economies throughout the following two years,

which surprised many due to its rapidity and pervasiveness (Yang & Lim, 2004). By

mid-1998, most of the economies in Asia were in a crisis of a similar nature. The

turbulence had also spread beyond the Asian region. Countries such as Russia and

Brazil showed signs of contagion in 1998; even the U.S. suffered from the collapse of

some hedge funds,2 which was once described as the most serious financial situation

since the post-war-period by the Clinton administration. However, because of the

intervention by the US Federal Reserve Board, the contagion effects were rather

limited in scope.

     The above three crises, although different in nature, had all caused the world

economy to fall. But the extent and the scope of the impacts varied across different

crises. For the Asian financial crisis, the non-OECD countries, especially Asia, were

the most negatively affected (Table 1). The GDP growth rates of NICs and ASEAN

slowed down in 1998 and turned negative in 1999. In the 2001 internet crisis, on the

other hand, the OECD countries (mainly the advanced industrialized countries) in

which bank lending was biased toward internet related industries were hit harder than

non-OECD countries. Despite the economic downturn in the two crises, the world still

grew upward but only at a slow motion. The 2008 global financial crisis, however,

was quite different; the world GDP growth rate had already turned negative in 2009, a

year after the crisis broke out in 2008.

     The three crises also caused the world exports to contract. Figure 1 and Figure 2

display the monthly export growth rates for the 27 OECD countries (OECD27) and

the 6 Asian countries (Asia6) during 1995 to 2009, respectively.3 As the figures show,

among the three crises, the 2008 crisis had the most severe impact on the world trade.

The exports began to fall in the second half of 2008 and quickly rebounded towards

the end of the first half of 2009, forming a narrow V-shaped pattern of growth

trajectory. The similar V-shaped pattern was also observed during the internet crisis

around 2001 and in the Asian financial crisis, where in the latter the V-shaped export

growth pattern seems to be limited to the Asian region. Moreover, world exports had

become more volatile with each shock; this is made clear with the V-shaped pattern

appearing much deeper and narrower in the more recent crisis.

     It is worth noting that during the economic downturns discussed above, the

contraction in world exports was far greater than that of world GDP, as revealed in

Table 1 and Table 2. In 1998 and 2001, while real world GDP still grew positively at

2.35% and 1.65%, respectively, the growth of total exports for the countries such as

Indonesia, Taiwan, the United Kingdom, and the United States had already turned

negative. The overall export performance was much worse in the recent economic

Kingdom and United States. Asia6 includes China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Korea and Taiwan; other
Asian countries such as Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand are not included because some

downturn, with almost all countries studied here experiencing negative export growth.

The total exports for countries such as Germany, Italy, Japan, and Taiwan, even shrank

at an astounding rate of more than 20% a year after the crisis broke out in 2008.

Meanwhile real world GDP suffered only a mild decline and growth slowed down to

-1.86% in 2009.

     A number of papers have identified that fluctuations in exports are highly

correlated with the changes in worldwide demand, effective exchange rates, the

volatility of exchange rates (see for example, Boug and Fagereng, 2010; Sapir and

Sekka, 1995), and FDI (e.g., Zhang and Song, 2000). These determinants (hereafter

referred to as the fundamental factors) have been shown to govern adequately the

behavior of the export growth performance of a country in the long run. The fact that

the decline in world exports was much greater than the decline in world GDP during

the economic crises suggests that the force causing exports to deviate from their

long-run trend may have been further magnified by some other factors not accounted

for in the literature. In other words, the surprisingly large declines in exports may not

be predicted fully by the conventional relationships linking exports to the fundamental

factors. Such an unusually large deviation of exports from their long-run level is

referred to as the “export overshooting phenomenon” hereafter, the main subject of

this study.

     Based on what we have observed, several testing hypotheses are formulated in

the paper. Specifically, we look for evidence that addresses the “export overshooting

phenomenon” during times of economic duress. We also offer some explanations for

why world exports are so susceptible to economic crises.

     We investigate the export patterns of 37 countries, including 10 Asian countries



                                           5
and 27 OECD countries.4 The time span being studied covers the period from 1994 to

2009, in which the world had experienced three economic crises, i.e., the Asian

financial crisis in 1997, the internet bubble bursting in 2001, and the global financial

crisis in 2008. These crises, though different in nature and origin, had all led to similar

V-shaped contraction patterns of world export. It is therefore interesting to examine

how exports adjusted to these economic shocks and discuss some of the factors that

may have caused exports to overshoot in each of these downturns.

      The structure of the paper is as follows. We begin with a comparison in terms of

causes and economic impacts of the three economic crises in Section 2. We then

derive several testable hypotheses based on the revealed trends and patterns of exports

during the crisis periods. These hypotheses are then tested in Section 3 using an error

correction panel regression model. In a dynamic setting, we show how and why the

response of exports to adverse external shocks may vary across different groups of

countries and industries. Some explanations as to why, when facing economic crises,

exports overshot its long-run trend are provided in Section 5. The last section

summarizes the findings and offers conclusions.

2. Impact of Economic Crisis on Exports

      Although the three economic crises were triggered by different events such as the

capital flight out of East Asia, the internet bubble busting, and the subprime crisis,

they did share some features in common. That is, they all experienced financial

contagion and had effects on both financial and real sectors.



4
  The 10 Asian countries are China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore,
Thailand, and Taiwan. In 2008, the export share of 10 Asian countries and 27 OECD countries accounts
for about 80% of the world’s total exports. An earlier version of this paper by Liu (2010) which studies
a smaller sample (9 Asian countries, the U.S. and the EU) and for a shorter time span (2000-2009) will
be included in the book “The Impact of the Economic Crisis on East Asia” edited by Daigee Shaw and
Bih Jane Liu, Edward Elgar Publishing LTD., London (forthcoming).

                                                   6
     Financial crisis often starts as a series of malfunctions in the financial markets,

leading to credit, exchange, and liquidity crises in a country or a region. Asian

financial crisis is no exception. Due to the rapid growth of real GDP, the ASEAN

countries, mainly Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand, experienced

credit boom in the early 1990s. The overextension of credit, which concentrated on

the areas of real estate and equities, left the Southeast Asian economies vulnerable to a

shift in credit and cyclical conditions (Goldstein, 1998). As a result, almost all Asian

currencies confronted various degree of speculative attack after the occurrence of the Thai

baht crisis in July 1997.5 When international investors rushed their capital out of the

Asian markets, the asset prices and currencies fell almost simultaneously. This had led to

acute economic recession and export contractions in several Asian countries. The

preponderance of intra-Asia trade link (59.1% in 1997), which had been an important

driving force behind the rapid regional growth in the first half of the 1990s, became a

liability as they provided a perfect channel for the contagion to spread swiftly throughout

Asia (Das, 1999). After the crisis, a large number of Asian banks were weighed down

because of having massive bad debts and could not make further loans as they were

not able to meet the 8 percent capital-adequacy ratio stipulated by the IMF. Trade

credit therefore became one of the biggest supply-side constraints for the exporters in

Asia. Meanwhile, the extraordinarily large extent of depreciation for many of the

Asian currencies6 did not help improve export performance as the traditional wisdom

suggests. This is because the import content of the Asian exports was inordinately

high, especially in industries such as electronics and autos. But the volatility of


5
  The fact that quite a few Asian countries such as Indonesia, Philippines, and Malaysia, had weakness
similar to Thailand may help explain this contagion: large currency account deficits, deteriorating
quality of investment, appreciating real exchange rates, a marked export slowdown in 1996, and
overexpansion in certain key industries. Even Japan and Korea also faced with massive bad loans and
serious weakness in its financial sector and in prudential oversight of banks (Goldstein, 1998).
6
  For example, between June 1997 and August 1998 the Indonesian rupiah, Malaysian ringgit and Thai
baht depreciated by 82.9%, 40.9% and 39.7% against the US dollar, respectively.

                                                  7
exchange rates had been shown to be a significant factor negatively affecting exports

of the Asian economies during the Asian financial crisis. The exports of countries

outside Asia, however, were less affected by the Asian crisis due possibly to the

relatively smaller financial contagion and trade linkages and hence small GDP

contraction as shown in Table 1 and 2. For example, although the U.S. suffered from

the collapse of hedge funds, the bailout intervention by the Federal Reserve Board did

prevent a systemic failure of the banking and financial system in the U.S. The

contractionary impact of the Asian crisis was therefore more subdued.

      The internet bubble (also known as dot-com bubble) was sector-specific in nature.

It originated from the accelerated growth in internet sectors, which led to the rapid

run-up in market valuations on the internet related industries. When the bubble burst

in 2000, it was followed by an equally rapid collapse of the markets and led to

bankruptcy of many internet firms and huge losses in stock markets. The bubble had

an important impact on the wealth and the spending habits of consumers, especially

those in the developed countries. People spent more because they felt richer with their

overvalued assets; but when their wealth was suddenly reduced once the bubble burst,

they scaled back on discretionary spending. Changes in discretionary spending are a

result of the so-called “wealth effect”, which turns out to have important implications

for the growth of international trade and the global economy. For many

export-oriented countries, this surge in discretionary spending in developed countries,

especially in high-tech products, was for a long time a major source of global demand

for their exports.7 After the internet bubble bursting and the 9/11 attacks, countries

with a heavy reliance on the exports of high-tech products such as Japan, Singapore,


7
   The export structure in Asia had changed dramatically, from resource-intensive and labor-intensive
industries to more skilled and more capital-intensive industries. This together with strong intraregional
links exposed Asian economies to greater risks of external shocks.

                                                   8
South Korea and Taiwan saw the global demand for Information, Communication and

Technology (ICT) products slowing in a weak economic outlook. Similarly, the

exports of other Asian countries such as Malaysia and the Philippines, which are part

of the integrated ICT supply chain in the region, were also negatively affected. China,

meanwhile, still managed to experience positive growth in exports as the volume of

Chinese high-tech exports constituted only a small part of its external trade at that

time and hence the impacts were limited.

     Unlike the export contractions seen in 1997 and 2001, which were limited mainly

to certain region (Asia) or certain industries (high-tech), a shrunken export demand in

2008 was truly global as a result of a great economic recession unlike any seen since

the early 1930s. In varying degrees, this great economic recession affected virtually

every industry and business sector. The reason why the recent economic downturn has

had far-reaching consequences lies in the rapid proliferation of speculative financial

innovations fuelled by a torrent of cross-board capital flows that further quickened the

speed of contagion worldwide (Hu, 2009). As a consequence, the economic impacts

of a lowered level of world income were felt around the globe, and a collapse in

export demand across the board quickly followed. This included a plunge in global

demand for Chinese output.

     In general, exports contracted largely due to the declines in worldwide demand,

an important growth predictor that has been identified in the trade literature to be one

of the most significant fundamental factors underlying exports. However, as shown in

Tables 1 and 2, world trade fell more rapidly than output in varying degrees across

nations when a crisis occurred. In the 2008 crisis, for example, world GDP fell -1.86%

from the previous year but exports fell more rapidly, with -18.52% and -22.18% for

Asia5 and OECD countries, respectively. Similarly, large declines in exports also took

                                           9
place in the two previous crises. With these observations and the distinct V-shaped

patterns in exports as shown in Figure 1 and 2, we suspect that exports may have

fallen much more rapidly to an extent far exceeding what can be entirely attributed to

the changes in fundamental factors. Thus, we have the following hypothesis:

Hypothesis 1: During crisis, exports overshoot the deviation bands allowed by the

long run equilibrium relationship governed by the fundamental factors.

     In the three episodes of fast falling export demand, the impacts in the 2008 crisis

were the largest, for the contagion was more severe and truly global, leading to a

much weaker global demand (Sun, 2009). The drying up of trade credit and traders’

overreaction to a possible collapse in demand made the situation even more serious in

the 2008 crisis (Athukorala and Kohpaiboon, 2009). However, a variety of economic

stimulus packages were put in place in a timely manner to lessen the negative impact

thanks to the quick and coordinated responses from the world’s governments in

containing the spread and further worsening of the crisis. It is therefore reasonable to

believe that exports would rebound more quickly in the 2008 crisis than in the other

crises. The export impacts were much greater in the 2001 crisis than in the 1997 crisis.

The fact that both the extent of the impacts and the speed of rebound increased over

time can also be observed in Figure 1 and 2, where the V-shaped pattern of the export

contractions became much narrower in the more recent crisis. Thus, we have:

Hypothesis 2: Although the degree of export contractions was much sharper in the

more recent crisis, exports also bottomed out much quicker.

     Moreover, because industries were affected to varying degrees by the three crises

and their recovery dynamics were also different, we examine how exports were

impacted at the industry level by classifying a country’s manufacturing industries into



                                          10
two groups, Group A and Group B, based on their industry characteristics. Group A

consists of industries whose production activities tend to be capital- or

technology-intensive in nature. Specifically, Group A includes electronics, machinery,

electrical    equipment,      ICT     (information,      communications         and     technology),

transportation, and precision instruments. The demand for Group A is highly income

elastic, and consumer spending on such products tends to follow the ebb and flow of

the economy. Spending decreases during economic downturns and increases when the

economy expands. Notice that developed countries are the major buyers of Group A.

On the other hand, Group B, consisting of all remaining industries,8 tends to be

labor-intensive and of necessity in nature. While developing countries are the major

consumers of Group B, developed countries may reduce their consumption as a result

of an increase in income. With this in mind, we postulate:


Hypothesis 3: Group A’s capital- or technological-intensive exports tend to increase

with the levels of OECD income, while Group B’s labor-intensive exports tend to

increase with the levels of Non-OECD income.


3. Empirical Model

     To examine how exports adjust to shocks, we need to explicitly model their

adjustment by introducing an a-priori long-run equilibrium relationship, with the

hypothesis that there exists an error correction mechanism that makes the short-run

deviations to converge on a long-run trend. Therefore, modeling a long-run export

performance in the context of adjustment to external shocks is inherently dynamic.

     Assume export performance Eit is affected by a set of fundamental factors Z it



8
  They are textiles, apparel, plywood, paper, furniture, rubbers and plastics, metal products, nonmetal
products, basic metal, printing, chemical materials, chemical products, and petroleum.

                                                  11
and some global shocks (denoted as Crisis). Let the short-run relationship among

EX it , Z it and Crisis follow an autoregressive-distributed lag model:


      EX it   0  1Zi ,t   2 Z it 1   3 EX it 1   4Crisist   i ,t                (1)


where EX it (i=1, …N, t=1, …, T) is country i’s exports in log form at time t. Crisis,

which includes 1997Crisis, 2001Crisis, and 2008Crisis, is a period dummy used to

capture the common shocks from the 1997, 2001 and 2008 crises.  it ( vi  u it )

includes country-specific variables vi and the stochastic error term uit , where the

former is to reflect country-specific effect stemming from cross-country differences in

endowment, technology, and so on.

      Two problems may arise when using panel data regression techniques to

determine the dynamic relationships between of EX it and Z it as indicated in

Equation (1).9 First, we run into the endogeneity problem caused by the difficulty of

identifying the unobserved country-specific effects such as technological progress in a

dynamic setting, in which case the right-hand-side variables are not orthogonal to

each other. Second, the problem of persistence occurs because EX it and Z it tend to

be highly persistent over time with their respective lagged values and are often jointly

determined, which is often the case for economic research using time series of

macroeconomic variables.10

      An error correction model is therefore adopted, which can be used to solve for

these two problems. Most importantly, it has the advantage of allowing us to examine

the short-run and long-run dynamics of the relationship between EX it and Z it , and



9
  SeeYasar et al. (2006).
10
   The Durbin-Watson statistic, which is 0.35 for regression (1), suggests the existence of
autocorrelation.

                                                        12
this feature becomes very useful, especially in the context of examining how exports

behave when an external shock is present.

      EX it  1Z it   ERRORit 1   4Crisist   it                               (2)


where  indicates first difference, ERRORit 1 ( EX it 1  0  1Z it 1 ) is the error

correction term, 0   0 /(1   3 ) , 1  (1   2 ) /(1   3 ) , and   (1   3 ) . In

equation (2), Z it captures the short-run effects while ERRORit 1 describes the

long-run dynamics. Exports could deviate from the long-run equilibrium relationship

owing to random shocks in the short run, but eventually converge to the equilibrium

when shocks are absent. The error correction coefficient  , which is negative for

such a convergence to occur, therefore measures the speed of adjustment toward the

long-run equilibrium.

     Crisis is used to see whether there exists excessive adjustment in exports that

cannot be explained by the effects of short-run and long-run dynamics. If the

coefficient of Crisis is significantly different from zero, then there exists the so-called

“export overshooting” phenomenon. We indicate the beginning of a crisis using the

timing of export growth once it turns negative. That is, a crisis begins once negative

export growth is present in any of the countries in our sample. For example in the

2001 crisis, Taiwan was the country whose exports fell earlier than those of the others,

so the month when Taiwan’s export growth first turned negative is defined as the

starting month of the downturn, which was January 2001. The subsequent months of

the crisis period are defined as follows: Crisis2001= 2 if February 2001, Crisis2001=

3 if March 2001…., and Crisis2001=18 if June 2002, when the U.S. was the last

country to resume positive growth in exports. By adding Crisis and its square term

(Crisis_SQ), we are able to figure out, on average, how many months it took to reach

                                                13
the trough of the contraction in growth. Crisis1997 and Crisis2008 can be similarly

defined (see Table 3).11

     The set of fundamental factors Z it affecting a country’s export performance

includes world demand, effective exchange rate, volatility of exchange rate and FDI

flows. Here, world GDP is used to measure world demand. As a larger world GDP is

expected to boost a country’s exports, we expect a positive relationship between the

two variables. The effective exchange rates, which are trade-weight-based measures

with weights being time-varying, are obtained from the Bank for International

Settlements. Since the appreciation of a country’s currency lowers the competitiveness

of its exports, export volume falls as a result. However, currency appreciation also

raises export prices. The effect of an increase in EER on export values therefore

depends on the price elasticity. The effect is positive if products are highly elastic (e.g.,

ICT); but it is negative if products are less elastic (e.g., necessities).

     The volatility of effective exchange rates  is used to capture the impact of

exchange-rate uncertainty, where  is constructed as the moving average of the

deviation of EER from its mean over the last 12 months:

            1 12
       [    
           12 j 1
                   ( EERt  j  EERt ) 2 ]0.5                                           (3)


Theoretically, the impact of exchange rate volatility on exports may be positive or

negative depending on the assumption made with respect to risk preference (De

Grauwe, 1988). For risk-averse exporters, higher exchange rate volatility increases the

extent of uncertainty and thus negatively impacts exports. On the contrary, for those

   Crisis1997= 1 if November 1997 when Japan was the first country among Asia whose export growth
turned negative, …, and Crisis1997=18 if April 1999, when Korea was the last country to resume
positive growth in exports. Similarly, Crisis2008= 1 if September 2008 when Taiwan was the first
country among Asia whose export growth turned negative, …, and Crisis2008=20 if April 2010, when
Korea was the last country to resume positive growth in exports

                                                14
who are risk-loving, higher exchange rate volatility is often associated with higher

exports. Moreover, when exports are considered as an option by exporters, exports

may increase with exchange rate volatility (Boug and Fagereng, 2010). Since

exporters may be able to reduce or hedge against exchange rate uncertainty, the

linkage between exchange rate volatility and exports may be insignificant (Solakoglu,

2008).

     FDI is another factor affecting exports. Whether or not FDI contributes to the

export performance depends on the motive of FDI. Tariff-jumping FDI, which aims at

host market, may not help the host country to expand exports. Export-oriented FDI,

on the other hand, uses a host country as an export platform and may contribute to the

exports of host countries. Since aggregate FDI is used, of which motivations cannot

be identified, we have no prior expectation of the sign of FDI.

     We first run the long-run regression EX it  0  1Z it   it to derive the error

                                            
correction term ( ERRORit 1  EX it 1  (0  1Z it 1 ) ), which is then used to run

Equation (2). The definition and descriptive statistics of the variables are summarized

in Table 3, while the Error Correction Model results for Regression (2) are reported in

Table 4.

4. Regression Results

     Two specifications are reported in Table 4 for the full sample. Specification (1)

uses world GDP as a measure of world demand, while Specification (2) uses OECD

and non-OECD GDP, instead. It shows that while non-OECD GDP had positive

effects on world exports as expected, OECD GDP had negative impacts on exports.

This suggests that the demand from the non-OECD countries was the driving force

behind the growth of world exports for the last fifteen years or so. And since OECD


                                          15
and non-OECD GDP have opposite effects on world exports, their sum (i.e., world

GDP) may not be a good measure of demand for exports; we therefore discuss the

regression results with OECD and non-OECD GDP as demand-side variables in the

following.

     Specification (2) in Table 4 shows that the volatility of effective exchange rate,

which has mixed results in the literature (De Grauwe, 1988), is shown to have

negative impacts on exports. The real effective exchange rate (EER) is positive but

FDI inflows are insignificant in the full sample. The error correction term (ERROR) is

negative and statistically significant, suggesting that there exists a long-run

relationship between export performance (EX) and fundamental factors (Z), and that

the gap between EX and those explained by Z can be closed through the error

correction mechanism. The speed of the short-run correction ( ) is -0.14, indicating,

on average, about 14% of the gap is corrected in each month.

     The signs of 2001Crisis and 2008Crisis are negative but the signs of their square

terms are positive, indicating that there exist remarkable effects of the two crises on

exports, manifested in striking V-shaped growth patterns. This supports Hypothesis 1

that exports had contracted excessively during the economic downturns such that

shrinkage in world demand and changes in other fundamental factors were insufficient

to explain the fluctuations in exports. For the 1997 crisis, however, the V-shaped

growth patterns did not occur in the full sample. In fact, the export growth rate even

increased but at a decreasing rate (as shown by the positive sign of Crisis1997 and the

negative sign of Crisis1997_SQ), indicating an inversed V-shaped pattern in export

growth (Specification (2) in Table 4). This confirms the observation that the Asian

financial crisis did not spread across wide regions of the world and that world exports,

on average, were still slowly growing in the midst of a crisis.

                                           16
       Moreover, Table 4 shows that the V-shaped pattern is significantly deeper and

narrower in the 2008 crisis than in the 2001 crisis. That is to say, not only did exports

contract more rapidly, they also rebounded more quickly in the recent crisis. Using the

coefficients for the crisis variable and its square term, we can calculate the number of

months for the economies to reach the trough of the economic recession. It shows that

the 2008 financial crisis bottomed out more quickly than the previous crisis in 2001

(i.e. 8.24 vs. 9.96 months) for Specification (2). This supports Hypothesis 2 as

discussed in Section 2.

       The unusual reversed V-shaped export growth pattern, which occurred in the

1997 crisis for the full sample, may no longer hold when a smaller group of sample is

used. Four subgroups are considered here, i.e., OECD_DC, OECD_LDC, Asia_DC,

and Asia_LDC, depending upon whether a country belongs to OECD or Asia, and is

advanced economy or not as defined by IMF.12 The results show that while OECD

subgroups displayed reversed V-shaped pattern in export growth (Table 5), Asian

countries did experience export overshooting in the 1997 financial crisis (Table 6).

The results that the exports of Asian countries had fallen excessively but those of

OECD countries had increased excessively (i.e., the phenomenon of reversed

overshooting) may be explained by the facts that the 1997 Asian financial crisis was a

regional shock in nature. The large GDP contraction in Asia and the increasing

importance of intra-regional trade within Asia significantly contributed to the export

overshooting. For the 2001 and 2008 crises, export overshooting, however, occurred

for both OECD and Asian subgroups and was increasing over time, as seen by the

declining magnitude of the negative estimators associated with the crisis variables.

Exports also bounced back more quickly over time. For the OECD countries, the

                                                17
number of months it took for the export contraction to bottom out was improving, i.e.,

10.74 and 8.37 months for the 2001 and 2008 crises, respectively; for the Asian

countries the corresponding figures are 11.71, 9.07, and 7.69 months for the 1997,

2001, and 2008 crises, respectively (Table 8). These figures reveal an interesting

conclusion that the Asian economies bounced back more quickly from the crises than

the OECD countries, a phenomena that deserves further explanation.

     When the Asian sample is further divided into two industry groups, Group A and

Group B, according to whether the industry is high-tech, more insights emerge (Table

7). The export overshooting seen for Asian countries in the 1997 crisis was mainly

due to the excessive fall in exports for Group B rather than for Group A; indeed, the

exports of Group A did not even fall when controlling for other variables, as indicated

by the positive (but not significant) sign of Crisis1997. The result is consistent with

the fact that developed countries, which are the major source of demand for the

high-tech products, were less affected by the Asian crisis.

     In addition to export overshooting, Group A and Group B also differ in income

elasticity of exports. Most of income elasticity was positive, consistent with the

normality assumption of goods. But, exports of Group B, which tend to be of

necessity in nature, were negatively (although insignificantly) affected by OECD GDP,

implying that Group B may not be normal goods. Moreover, Group A is more

sensitive to the OECD’s GDP while Group B is more responsive to the non-OECD’s

GDP, conforming to Hypothesis 3 discussed in Section 2. The effect of real effective

exchange rate (EER) is positive for Group A but negative for Group B. This suggests

that Group B may be more sensitive to price competition than Group A, and the

depreciation of EER is effective in expanding the exports of Group B.

     The adjustment speed  associated with the error correction term is also

                                           18
different across different industry groups; it is much faster for Group B (-0.24) than

that for Group A (-0.10). This implies that Group B is more stable than Group A in its

long-run-export trend, which is consistent with the fact that Group A is highly income

elastic and tend to have large oscillations around the trend.

     While the exports were hit harder for Group A (mainly the high-tech products)

than for Group B in the 2001 crisis, the opposite was true in the 2008 crisis. This may

be due to the fact that compared to the internet bubble around 2001 where the

high-tech industries were the target of the crisis, the global financial crisis in 2008

was more widespread such that it affected almost every industry and every country in

the world. But in both crises, Group A bottomed out more quickly than Group B

(Table 8).

5. Some Possible Explanations

     The discussions in Section 4 suggest that export overshooting did occur in the

2001 and 2008 crises. This holds for the full sample, advanced countries, Asian

economies, as well as emerging markets, and for the high-tech (Group A) and

low-tech (Group B) products. Given the fact that the export share of full sample

studied here accounts for about 80% of world exports in 2008, the above results

suggest that export overshooting was a world-wide phenomenon when the crises

occurred. However, the Asian financial crisis in 1997 was a regional event and had

rather limited impact outside Asia, export overshooting therefore occurred only within

the Asian region.

     Why did the export contraction significantly overshoot its long-run trend when

an economic crisis occurred in 2001 and 2008? Why did exports fall much deeper and

yet bounce back much more quickly in the 2008 crisis than in the 2001 crisis? All



                                           19
these questions may be partially explained by the so-called Forrester effect on demand

variability, a phenomenon well known in the optimization of supply chain and

inventory control systems.

     The Forrester effect suggests that demand variability increases as one moves up a

supply chain. It is a feedback mechanism set forth by external shocks to the supply

chain where small fluctuations in demand at the retailer end are dramatically

amplified as they proceed up the chain. Such an effect may be caused by the demand

forecast updating that reflects not only the need to replenish the stocks to meet the

requirements for future demands but also the need for safety stocks which are

considered necessary because of the large demand uncertainty and fluctuation (Lee et

al., 1997). As a result, the readjustment of demand forecast by the upstream manager

is often greater than the change of demand in the downstream. Similarly, periodic

ordering (which makes suppliers face a highly erratic stream of orders), special sales

promotion (which triggers irregular buying pattern of customers) and rationing (which

occurs when demands exceed supply) may all distort demand information (Lee et al.,

1997). Inaccuracies and volatility of orders from the retailer to the primary suppliers

therefore cause relatively greater readjustments at each point of the chain. Apparently,

the amount of safety stock contributes significantly to the Forrester effect. As in the

visual metaphor of cracking a bullwhip, demand in the chain fluctuates in a

continuous and long lasting oscillatory movement upstream; therefore, it is also

labeled the bullwhip effect.

     To make things clear, consider a 10% drop in retail sales. In order to deplete the

surplus stocks and reduce inventory, given that there is now a weaker sales outlook,

orders placed by retailers to wholesalers one step upstream in the chain will thus

decrease by more than 10%, say 15%. The decrease in demand amplifies and

                                          20
propagates through the chain as upstream firms react in much the same way as

downstream firms do, trying to adjust their stock level and empty the pipeline. Hence

the longer the supply chain is, the more pronounced the upstream demand

amplification (or the larger the oscillatory movement) will become. This will result in

an even greater decrease, say 20%, in purchase orders to the suppliers further

upstream in our example.

     The “export overshooting” phenomenon as seen in OECD and Asian economies

in the 2001 and 2008 crises, in essence, captures the bullwhip effect. While the real

world GDP fell only mildly in 2001 and 2009, exporting countries, constituting the

upper stream end of the global supply chain, had experienced a much greater fall in

exports which cannot be fully explained by the changes in consumer demand as well

as other fundamental factors such as exchange rates, the volatility of exchange rates

and FDI (Table 4 to Table 7). The adjustment of inventory and the overcorrection of

the demand forecast by every entity in the global supply chain was indeed the force at

work that caused manufacturing orders (exports) to fall more than the decline in

demand at the retailer end of the chain. Table 9 provides some evidence from Taiwan

to support this argument. It summarizes the growth rates of export orders and

inventory for the upstream (electronic parts and components) and the downstream

(computers, electronic and optical products) in Taiwan. It shows that when the crisis

occurred in the late 2008 and exerted its negative impact throughout 2009, the

downstream industry reacted to demand contraction by depleting its inventory first, as

indicated by the quickly fall in the growth rate of its inventory in the late 2008. Thus,

while the orders placed by foreign buyers on both the upstream and downstream

industries were contracted, the orders on the upstream fell more than those on the




                                           21
downstream. 13 Similar results can also be observed during 2001-2002 when the

internet bubble took effect.

     When the economy recovered, the bullwhip effect also worked in much the same

way but in the opposite direction; exports bounced back by a much larger extent than

the actual increase in demand as every entity of the supply chain increased its safety

stocks to meet unexpected increase in future demand. This can also be observed from

Table 9: the extent of rebound in export orders received by the Taiwanese firm was

larger for the upstream than for the downstream in 2003-2004 and in the late 2009

when economy showed signs of recovery after 2001 and 2008 crises.

     The reason why the extent of export overshooting increased over time as shown

in the previous section may be explained by an increasing specialization of production

vertically over time. Generally, when production becomes more specialized vertically

around the world, the length of a supply chain increases, and so does the extent of the

bullwhip effect (or the extent of overshooting). As already discussed earlier, bullwhip

effect causes modest changes at one end of the chain to be magnified with a

fast-cascading impact when reaching the other end. This means literally that the

longer the supply chain, the larger the demand swings for the upstream end of the

chain. Therefore, as the degree of cross-border vertical specialization increases over

time, the demand variability is also increased in an elongated chain, and thus

enhancing the global supply system’s tendency to overcorrect. This helps explain why

the overshooting phenomenon was more pronounced in the 2008 crisis than in the

2001 crisis. The findings from Vlasenko (2009) that firms’ inventory levels were

quickly deteriorating in the 2008 crisis at a faster speed than the average rate in the


13
   Note that due to the lack of foreign data, we assume the downstream industry in foreign country
adjusts its inventory in much the same way as that in Taiwanese. This assumption is plausible as
Taiwan is the major supplier of electronics and ICT products.

                                               22
previous recessions provide some evidence of an increasing overcorrection in the

supply system. This in turn, we believe, had led to an increase in the extent of

overshooting (bullwhip effect), supporting our argument that the recent financial crisis

was worse than the previous crisis in terms of the rates of decline in world exports.

     The above bullwhip effect can be used to explain why high-tech industries

(Group A) bottomed out more quickly than low-tech industries (Group B). Since

high-tech industries tend to be more sophisticated and have a supply chain longer than

low-tech industries, the economic crisis will have a bigger export impact on high-tech

than on low-tech in terms of the speed of fall and the pace of rebound according to the

above discussion. This also helps explain why Asian exports bounced back more

quickly than the crisis than OECD countries as shown by the regressions in Section 4,

as Asian countries are the major high-tech exporters.14

6. Concluding Remark

     This paper provides some evidence of the “export overshooting” phenomenon,

i.e. the unusually large deviation of exports from their long-run level, which can not

be fully explained by the fundamental factors such as the changes in worldwide

demand, effective exchange rates, the volatility of exchange rates and FDI. We show

that export overshooting that had occurred in the 2001 and 2008 economic crises was

a world-wide phenomenon. In fact, it prevailed in all of the 37 countries in our sample

that represent different income groups: developed countries, Asian NICs, and

emerging market countries. But for the 1997 crisis which was a regional financial

crisis in nature, export overshooting only occurred within the Asian region and did not

spread beyond Asia.


14
   While the high-tech export share for EU and US were 49% and 55% during 2000-2007, respectively,
the corresponding figure for the Asian economies studied in this paper was 58%.

                                               23
     We argue that the bullwhip effect was indeed a driving force behind the “export

overshooting” phenomenon. Because of the adjustment in inventory and

overcorrection in demand forecast by every entity of the supply chain when facing a

shock (economic crisis), exporting countries, which were at the upstream end of the

supply chain, faced a much greater demand oscillation than the demand at the retailer

end. As a result, exports fell more than demand at the retail end; but when the

economy recovered exports also bounced back by a larger extent than the change in

final demand. The export overshooting phenomenon discussed in this paper may

therefore be regarded as a magnified version of the bullwhip effect in world exports,

which was triggered by the large negative aggregate demand shocks resulting from

the global economic crises.

     The extent of overshooting, however, changes overtime and differs across

industries. As production becomes more vertically specialized across countries over

time (Hummels et al., 1998), the supply chain becomes longer accordingly. A longer

supply chain implies larger demand variability and bigger export fluctuations when

economic crisis occurs. This helps explain why the extent of export overshooting was

greater and the rebound of exports was also quicker in the 2008 crisis as compared to

the 2001 crisis. Moreover, high-tech industries tend to have longer supply chain and

hence face larger demand variability. The speed of fall and the pace of rebound in

exports were therefore faster in the high-tech industries than in the low-tech industries.

As Asian countries were the major high-tech exporters, this also helps explain why

Asian exports bounced back more quickly than OECD exports.
