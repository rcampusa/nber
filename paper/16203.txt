                                              ABSTRACT

The paper provides an integrated framework to assess water markets in terms of their institutional
underpinnings and the three ‘pillars’ of integrated water resource management: economic efficiency,
equity and environmental sustainability. This framework can be used: (1) to benchmark different water
markets; (2) to track performance over time; and (3) to identify ways in which water markets might
be adjusted by informed policy makers to achieve desired goals. The framework is used to identify
strengths and limitations of water markets in: (1) Australia’s Murray-Darling Basin; (2) Chile (in particular
the Limarí Valley); (3) China (in particular, the North); (4) South Africa; and (5) the western United
States. It identifies what water markets are currently able to contribute to integrated water resource
management, what criteria underpin these markets, and which components of their performance may
require further development.

Introduction

Many parts of the world’s arid and semi-arid regions face the dilemmas of reduced water

supplies (Ludwig and Moench 2009) and an increasing demand for water resources due

to population and income growth (Falkenmark 1999). In water scarce and low-income

countries, especially those with high population growth rates, the effects on the

livelihoods of the poor will be dire without comprehensive efforts to address water

scarcity. In rich and dry regions, such as Australia or in the US West, the challenge will

be to balance competing demands such as between irrigated agriculture and the

environment (Grafton et al 2010).



To address these global water challenges, there is a need for effective institutional

arrangements and allocation mechanisms among competing users to mitigate and manage

water scarcity. Our contribution is to develop, for the first time, a comprehensive and

integrated framework to benchmark water markets, one of the most important allocation

mechanisms. The framework is used to identify strengths and limitations in five water

markets: Australia’s Murray-Darling Basin, Chile (in particular the Limarí Valley), China

(in particular, the North), South Africa, and the western United States. All these locations

are semi-arid and face, to a greater or lesser extent, an expectation of reduced water

availability associated with climate change. Two are in rich countries (Australia and the

United States), two are in low to middle-income countries (Chile and South Africa), and

one is in a poor, but rapidly developing country (China).




                                                                                          2
To provide the comparisons across different water markets we use both a qualitative and

quantitative framework that provides an assessment over 26 criteria in four key

categories: institutional underpinnings (eight criteria), economic efficiency (eight

criteria), equity (five criteria) and environmental sustainability (five criteria). The

framework allows us to identify what water markets are currently able to contribute to

integrated water resource management, what criteria underpin these markets, and which

components of their performance may require further development.



In the following section we describe the integrated framework and provide an overview

of the five water markets. Sections three, four, five and six separately evaluate the five

water markets, respectively, in terms of their institutional underpinnings, economic

efficiency, equity, and environmental sustainability. In section seven we draw together

key and general insights from the integrated assessment.



An Integrated Water Markets Framework

Several indicators of water scarcity, water withdrawals, water poverty or ‘peak’ water

have been developed (Palaniappan and Gleick 2009; Postel, Daily and Ehrlich 1996;

Shiklomanov 2003; Sullivan 2002). Most of these measures are based on physical

quantities of water and are not indicators of the quality of water institutions. A notable

exception is a Water Institutions Health Index (WIHI) developed by Dinar and Saleth

(2005) and Saleth and Dinar (2004) that uses 16 variables of institutional quality in three

broad categories: law-related, policy-related, and organization or administration-related

variables. While the WIHI is useful for broad comparisons it was not designed to be an




                                                                                         3
assessment of water markets and, as Dinar and Saleth observe, generates some perverse

rankings.2



Previous reviews of water markets include Easter, Rosegrant and Dinar (1998; 1999),

Howe, Schurmeier and Shaw (1986), Rosegrant and Binswanger (1994), among others.

These studies focus on the benefits of water markets and provide guidance as to how they

may be improved, typically from an economic efficiency perspective. Our goal is more

modest, namely, to show how water markets can, and do, function in very different legal

and institutional frameworks and what this implies in terms of efficiency, equity and

sustainability. We do not provide specific advice about how to ‘improve’ water markets

and neither do we discuss best practices in terms of water institutions (Saleth and Dinar

2000). Instead, we develop a comprehensive and integrated framework to generate an

ordinal rank of the institutional underpinnings of water markets and their performance in

terms of integrated water resource management.



Our approach is ‘institutional’ (Livingston 1993) because it recognizes that objectives,

capacities and institutional constraints differ such that there cannot be a single set of

recommendations universally applicable for all water markets.                    For example, South

Africa’s National Water Act 1998 explicitly places equity considerations as a top priority,

putting this goal ahead of economic efficiency in terms of how its water markets have

2
  The WIHI has only one variable directly related to water markets. This variable evaluates water rights
and varies from 0 to 7, where 0 indicates no water rights, 1 unclear/unauthorized/scattered rights, 2
common/state rights, 3 multiple rights, 4 riparian system, 5 appropriative systems, 6 proportional sharing
system and 7 indicates the existence of water licenses/permits. It is not clear why a riparian system
should receive a higher rank than multiple rights or why appropriative rights are necessarily superior to
riparian rights. The WIHI also suffers from perverse overall rankings with Myanmar ranking higher than
Australia.


                                                                                                        4
developed (Muller 2009). Consequently, recommendations to improve the economic

efficiency of water markets without sufficient regard for their equity implications are

unlikely to be fully supported within South Africa.



The integrated water markets framework (IWMF) uses a four-point scale in four

categories: institutional underpinnings, economic efficiency, equity, and environmental

sustainability. It allows for an understanding of the institutional constraints and

challenges of implementing water markets, and explicitly considers the ‘three pillars’ of

integrated water resource management developed at the 1992 Dublin International

Conference on Water and Environment: equity, economic efficiency and environmental

sustainability (Lenton and Muller 2009).



Many of the criteria we use are qualitative measures that are derived from primary or

secondary data, but some economic efficiency criteria are quantitative. The qualitative

scores provide four ordinal rankings: the highest (three drops) indicates the criterion is

nearly or fully operational; two drops indicates the criterion is mostly satisfied but some

further development is required; one drop means the criterion is partly satisfied and

substantial development is required, while the lowest ranking (X) specifies that the

criterion is not operational or is missing. For some criteria, in some water markets,

insufficient data or information is available to provide a ranking. The contribution of the

integrated framework is that it can be used: (1) to benchmark different water markets; (2)

to track performance over time; and (3) to identify ways in which water markets might be

adjusted by informed policy makers to achieve desired goals.




                                                                                         5
We apply the integrated framework to five water markets: Australia’s Murray-Darling

Basin, Chile (in particular the Limarí Valley), China, South Africa, and the western

United States. In the case of the US limited, local water markets have existed since the

nineteenth century, while in China they are still very much in their infancy. Chilean water

rights of the Limarí Valley are, arguably, the most entrenched in terms of legal rights, but

this market is small in size compared to water markets in Australia’s Murray-Darling

Basin that were first established in the early 1980s.



In all countries we use secondary data sources that have been supplemented by data, first-

hand knowledge and experience with three of these markets (Australia, South Africa and

US). The difference in the ranking across the water markets shows that, depending on

the goals of policy makers and underlying institutions, markets can deliver very different

outcomes. In all cases, even in the most developed water markets, the framework shows

that further development of robust water rights and governance are possible, should

policy makers wish to undertake the necessary reforms.



Institutional Underpinnings

The IWMF uses eight criteria to assess the institutional underpinnings of water markets,

namely: (1) Recognition of the public interest (legal and practical recognition of multiple

interests in water resources and measures to reconcile conflicts); (2) Administrative

capacity (sufficient administrative authority, resources and information to manage water

resources effectively); (3) Well-developed horizontal linkages (robust and clear




                                                                                          6
institutional relationships at a given level of governance); (4) Well-developed vertical

linkages (robust and clear institutional relationships between different levels of

governance); (5) Legal/administrative clarity (definitional clarity, particularly in relation

to water rights, as well as transparent administrative actions); (6) Conflict resolution

mechanisms (appropriate and robust mechanisms for resolving conflict between water

users and uses where it arises); (7) Adaptive management of institutions (capacity for

institutional adaptation); and (8) Registration/titling (sufficient processes for ensuring

accurate and updated registration/titling of water rights). A summary of the comparisons

of the five markets in terms of these criteria is provided in Table 1.



Recognition of Public Interest

The public interest includes beneficiaries from water resources other than direct water users.

This broad conception of the public interest is most developed in Australia, the Colorado Basin

and South Africa. In the case of Australia, water resource plans are obliged to “…establish the

intended balance between environmental and consumptive use outcomes, as well as setting out

terms and conditions for water access” (National Water Commission 2009a, p. 14). In practice,

wider interests are not necessarily put into operation (Connell and Grafton 2008). In the US,

western states own water in trust for their citizens. Individuals hold usufruct rights to the water,

subject to the requirement that the use is beneficial and reasonable and is subject to oversight by

the state in monitoring applications and water transfers to ensure that they are consistent with the

public interest (Gould, 1995, 94). The notion of ‘public interest’, however, is sufficiently vague

and potentially expansive in justifying state intervention with the effect that uncertainty

regarding water rights and markets is increased. The South African approach is similar to



                                                                                           7
Australia with the public interest in water resources defined under its National Water Act 1998

and the national government held as the custodian of the public interest (Nieuwoudt and

Armitage 2004, p. 2). In practice, however, the national government has failed to prevent major

pollution problems, such as acid mine drainage (Water Research Commission 2009, pp. 14-17),

that generate substantial external costs.




The divergence between theory and practice is most evident in Chile and China. In Chile, the

1981 Water Code specifies “…water is a natural resource for public use” (Hearne 1998: 142),

but there appears to be little supporting regulation in place to protect the public interest (Bauer

2004:, p. 33). China’s Constitution provides that water resources are owned by the state on

behalf of the people (Speed 2010a, p. 207), and its 2002 Water Law provides a framework for

integrated water resource management and includes sections dealing with planning, conservation

and pollution control (Khan and Liu 2008, p. 14). Despite the good intentions, however, Chinese

water resource planning is still in a ‘developmental phase’ (Liu and Speed 2010, p. 12) and

water plans tend to focus solely on allocation and utilization of basin water resources (Zhou

2006, p. 6).




Administrative Capacity

Unsurprisingly, administrative capacity is most developed in the high–income countries:

Australia and the US. In both cases, much of this capacity resides at a state level, but in the case

of Australia this capacity is rapidly being developed at a federal level consistent with changes in

the legal governance of the Murray-Darling Basin following passage of the Water Act 2007. In




                                                                                           8
the US, each state has a regulatory agency to monitor whether water is held, used, and

transferred consistent with the notions of beneficial use and the public interest. These agencies

vary from the State Engineer in New Mexico and Utah, to the Department of Water Resources in

Arizona, and to the Department of Natural Resources and special water courts in Colorado.




In South Africa, capacity in the water sector is much more limited, to the extent that the ability

of the state to effectively manage and control water resources remains problematic (Malzbender

et al. 2005, p. 2). This is evidenced by the continuing failure to effectively implement catchment

management authorities, despite more than a decade of trying. A similar problem exists in

China, where there are “serious questions about the state’s capacity to tackle water problems”

(Lee 2006, p. 10), and although several river basin commissions have been established they have

“no effective tools to monitor and supervise water development and use” (Zhou 2006, p. 4). By

contrast, the problem in Chile is not so much one of capacity to implement, but rather inadequate

regulatory authority. This is because the government’s water rights agency, Direccion General

de Aguas (DGA), “…has very little regulatory authority over private water use”, and “cannot

cancel or restrict water rights once they have been granted” (Bauer 2004, p. 33).




Horizontal Linkages

Well-developed linkages across governments and agencies are fundamental to ensuring effective

water governance where responsibilities are shared. In Australia, cross-government agreements

as part of the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) have formed the basis of water

reform since the mid 1990s. A willingness to cooperate and cede authority to the federal




                                                                                         9
government in return for financial benefits has also been critical to the water reform process. The

substantial inter-basin transfers within South Africa, and also across borders, have necessitated

functioning horizontal cooperation and numerous water agreements have been implemented

(Turton, Patrick and Rascher 2008, p. 326).




The US federal government has not had the same degree of action in water reform, where water

management is left to the states, as in Australia or South Africa. Consequently, institutional

relationships are less than clear, with multiple conflicting, overlapping or sequential jurisdictions

within states. For example, proposed water trades may have to be approved initially by the

irrigation district board within which the water is currently located; the county where the district

is found; the state regulatory body; and potentially, federal agencies, such as the Bureau of

Reclamation (BOR), if BOR water is involved. Consequently, agency actions may not be

consistent. In Chile, while relationships are transparent at lower levels of governance (e.g.

between irrigation organizations), significant problems exist at upper levels, particularly between

the DGA and the court system in dealing with water conflicts (Bauer 2004, p. 98-9). China has

the most fragmented horizontal linkages of the five countries in this study, which has

undermined administrative authority and caused confusion (Lee 2006, p. 10; Liu and Speed

2010, p. 17). In addition to the Ministry of Water Resources, there are eight other bureaus with

interests in water policy, known collectively as the ‘nine dragons’ of Chinese water policy (Lee

2006, p. 10).




Vertical Linkages




                                                                                          10
Well-developed vertical linkages allow for effective implementation of water policy. Australia,

until its Water Act 2007, lacked any formal linkages across multi-levels of governance except

those between catchment authorities and state governments and agencies. Such processes may be

effective at a local, catchment level but have proved ineffective when faced with Basin-wide

challenges.   The US is also characterized by relatively weak vertical linkages.         Interstate

compacts, where applicable, divide surface waters among the states; state regulatory agencies

rule on water transfers involving changes in the timing, nature, and place of diversion; county

regulations may restrict water exports; and local water supply bodies, such as irrigation districts

with different decision rules and water rights arrangements among their members may have a

separate role in approving water transactions (Thompson 1993).




At a much more restricted spatial scale, Chile appears to have the most developed vertical

linkages. The inter-connected nature of the Limarí Valley’s water infrastructure means that

water supply decisions must be closely coordinated between officials and irrigation

organizations (Zegarra 2008, p. 40). The top-down nature of water governance in South Africa

since the National Water Act 1998 has generated many challenges, even though in principle the

lines of authority are clearly defined. In reality, however, water planning has been rendered

ineffective at a catchment level (Farolfi and Perret 2002, p. 3) until capacity and authority are

developed in the (still-planned) catchment management authorities. China also has its difficulties

with institutional relationships between different levels of government unclear, with confusion

and conflict a frequent result (Zhou 2006, p. 5). Fragmented water management systems have

been identified by the World Bank (2002, p. 5) as “…the critical unsolved problem” for China’s

water resources.



                                                                                         11
Legal/administrative clarity

Legal clarity over water rights, including what they can be used for and the rules of water trade,

is a cornerstone of functioning water markets. In Australia, surface water rights are statutory

rights that are separated from land rights. In some circumstances they can be attenuated or even

acquired without compensation. Chile has the strongest and most broadly-defined water rights

(Bauer 1997, p. 13), although there is confusion about the priority of consumptive

(predominantly irrigation) and non-consumptive (hydropower) rights (Brehm and Quiroz 1995,

p. 15).




In the US West, water rights are typically based on prior appropriation and diversion (Johnson,

Gisser and Werner 1981), with diversions prioritized based on the date of the right. In certain

areas, however, water rights are not well defined, while in others over allocation of the available

water undermines the assurance of receiving water for junior rights. Water rights are, therefore,

not always fully quantified. In addition, rights are conditional upon meeting public interest and

beneficial use standards, which can be loosely-defined concepts that depend on administrative

judgements.




In the case of South Africa, correcting previous injustices – including through water

management — remains the chief national priority, relegating the trading of water rights

between relatively privileged farmers to a low-order priority.        Registration, licensing and

recognition of existing water uses are also required at a catchment level to provide clarity over



                                                                                         12
use rights before trade can occur. Delays in registration have, in many catchments, prevented

water users from being assured of their existing rights and impeded trade. Unclear property

rights in China continue to cause significant problems for the management of China’s water

resources (Speed 2010b, p. 88). There remains a lack of transparency surrounding water

allocation decisions (Lee 2006, p. 17; Zhou 2006, p. 6), and the opaque legal status of water

allocation has led to inconsistencies and implementation difficulties (Shen and Speed 2010, p.

33).




Conflict Resolution

Conflict resolution mechanisms provide a way to overcome disputes that could compromise the

functioning of water markets. In Australia, conflicts over water use and tradeoffs are resolved

primarily in the water planning framework at both a basin and catchment level. Provided the

planning processes are effective, conflicts can be resolved in timely and effective ways. Where

there have been difficult tradeoffs, for example between water allocations to the environment to

the detriment of irrigators, the federal government has provided substantial funding, worth some

$8 billion, to smooth the transition (Crase and O’Keefe 2009).3




The approach to conflicts in both Chile and the US has primarily been one of litigation. In Chile,

conflicts that cannot be solved through private bargaining have gone to the court system which,

to date, “has not demonstrated the institutional capacity to resolve water conflicts” (Hearne

1998, p. 146). In the US, state regulatory agencies have a review process for water trades to


3

                                                                                           13
determine whether they meet the no harm requirement and are in the public interest. If opposed,

trades can be modified or halted. A source of potential judicial action is the Public Trust

Doctrine, a common law notion that emphasizes the public nature of water and other natural

resources (Sax, 1970; Brewer and Libecap, 2009). Because there is no compensation for rights

holders who lose water under the doctrine, conflicts over water reallocation can be long lasting

(Libecap, 2007, 148-51).




In South Africa conflicts are on-going. Until and unless there are effective catchment

management authorities that encompass all stakeholders these difficulties are unlikely to be

resolved. In China, the 2002 Water Law contains provisions relating to dispute settlement (Liu

and Speed 2010, p. 9). However, shortcomings in the water planning framework have allowed

inconsistencies to emerge between regional and local water plans, increasing the potential for

conflict in times of water shortage (Liu and Speed 2010, p. 18).




Adaptive Institutions

Australia’s Water Act 2007 was a radical shift in responsibility of water planning and

management and was agreed to by all levels of government and with bi-partisan support. This

suggests that, at least at the present time, Australia has the most adaptable institutions of the

countries in this study. This adaptability is, undoubtedly, linked to what has been perceived as a

national water crisis that has provided a motivation to political leaders to resolve the problems.

By contrast, in Chile there have been numerous attempts since 1990 to reform Chilean water

law, but these have been blocked by minority parties (Bauer 1997, p. 13; Zegarra 2008, p. 29).




                                                                                        14
In the US, institutional heterogeneity within and across states provides opportunities for learning

and innovation. For instance, many water supply organizations have historically resisted water

transfers (Thompson, 1993), but as the potential gain from exchange rises, some irrigation

districts have become more responsive (Eden et al. 2008). Additionally, water trading for

environmental purposes has been enacted within the Central Valley Project in California

(Brewer, Fleishman, Glennon, Ker, and Libecap 2008). Other examples of institutional

adaptation include: voluntary settlement agreements in New Mexico, whereby claimants in over-

allocated and un-adjudicated systems have agreed to assign water rights outside traditional prior

appropriation (Richards 2008); and the unitization of groundwater, where pumpers in the

Escalante Valley pool their interests and manage the pumping of the reservoir.4




South Africa radically changed its water institutional framework with its National Water Act

1998 that provides for centralized control of water resources. Since its passage, the focus has

been to implement the various reforms rather than embark on further institutional change.

China’s recent development of river commissions for its seven major basins is illustrative of

adaptability, as is the Water Law 2002 which, on paper, contains many provisions conducive to

sound water management. The ability of institutions to adapt in practice, however, has lagged

significantly   behind     the   ideals    espoused     in   official   laws    and    regulations,   and

enforcement/compliance remains debilitating (Liu and Speed 2010, p. 17).

Registration/Title of Water Rights

The registration of water titles is a necessary first step to ensure comprehensive water trading in

formal water markets. Currently, Australia has the most complete system of registration of water

rights and titles, but further development is required to develop a national and compatible

register ─ a stated goal of the federal government. At present, titles are set at a state level and

there are substantial differences that impede inter-state water trade (National Water Commission

2009a, p. 120). In the US, there is no single or central water title office. Existing surface water

rights have their priority date and allotments of water set, but quantification of water that accrues

to these rights is not quantified in some Basins. In Chile, China and South Africa there are on-

going centralized processes to register titles to water rights.




Economic Efficiency

One of the key attributes of water markets is their ability to transfer water from lower to higher

value uses. In this section we provide three ways of quantifying the efficiency of water markets:

(1) Size of the market (volume of water traded of permanent and temporary water rights as a

percentage of total water rights); (2) Estimates of the annual gains ($) from water trade; and (3)

Size of storages (that allows for trades over a longer duration and trades upriver). In addition, we

present qualitative measures of economic efficiency: (1) Nature of water rights (the extent to

which they are unbundled); (2) Quality of title (extent to which rights are recognized in law and

in practice); (3) Breadth of market (capacity for water trading between catchments, including

upstream trades, as well as inter-sectoral trading); (4) Stability of price formation (predictability

of prices given changing water availability); and (5) Availability of market price information

(accessibility and reliability of price information). These criteria are summarized in Table 2.


                                                                                          16
Size of Water Market

Chile’s Limarí Valley (Hadjigeorgalis and Lillywhite 2004, p. 9) and Australia’s Murray-

Darling Basin (National Water Commission 2009b, p. 5) have well developed water markets in

terms of the amount traded as a proportion of the entitlements available. The amount traded is

some 30% in both locations, including permanent and temporary water rights, which is

extraordinarily high. Data is not available across all the US West to make a similar calculation,

but the amount of water traded as a proportion of total water use appears to be an order of

magnitude smaller. Nevertheless, substantial volumes of water are traded in US water markets,

as is demonstrated by the following figures, by state, between 1987 and 2008: Texas (38,700

GL); Arizona (27,500 GL); and California (24,500 GL).5 These amounts are based on committed

volumes where the annual amounts are projected forward for the term of the contract and

discounted back at 5% (Brewer, Glennon, Ker, and Libecap 2008, p. 99). In terms of the total

value of trades from 1987-2008, the leading states are California ($1.33 billion); Texas ($0.86

billion); Arizona ($0.84 billion); Colorado ($0.82 billion); and Nevada ($0.73 billion).6 As of

2010, there have been only limited transfers of water rights in South Africa, although this may

change after all rights are registered (expected by the end of 2011). Similarly, in China there are

only ad hoc transfers that may amount to less than 0.1% of the total volumes used (derived from

Speed 2010b, p. 85 and Liu and Speed 2010, p. 15).

Gains from Trade

To be able to calculate gains from trade requires data on actual transactions. These data, at best,

are only partially available for China and South Africa. Calculations of the gains from trade in

Chile indicate that the benefits of water markets are substantial and amount to between 8 and 32

per cent of agricultural contribution to regional GDP (Hadjigeorgalis and Lillywhite 2004, p. 9),

or some $22 million annually. Australian water markets are much larger, with the total volume

of trade in the Murray-Darling Basin worth over $1.8 billion in 2009 (National Water

Commission 2009b) and estimated gains from trade in a dry year around $495 million (Peterson

et al. 2004, p. 43). In the USWest, the average annual value of water trading between1987-2008

was about $400 million.7 Annually, the value of water transactions for all contract types and

sectors varies from under $1 million in Montana and Wyoming, the two least urban western

states, to near $40 million in Arizona, Colorado, Nevada, and Texas; and over $223 million in

California. The high turnover in California is driven by one-year leases within agriculture and a

few large multi-year leases from agriculture to urban use.




Nature of Water Rights

In the past 15 years water rights in Australia have, more or less, been separated from land rights.

Although some riparian rights (stock and domestic use by farmers) still exist, essentially water

rights can, in principle, be traded across catchments without also acquiring the land where the

water rights were originally located (National Water Commission 2009a, pp. 140-2). These

water rights include high reliability entitlements where, in most years, holders of these rights

would expect to receive their full allocation, and low reliability rights where in dry years there

may be zero allocations of water. In addition, the water market includes two types of trade: a

permanent market for the water right and its allocation in per perpetuity, and a seasonal market

for the actual allocations of water assigned each year to the permanent water right.




Chile has a similar system to Australia that features both permanent and contingent rights where

the latter provide allocations when availability is above-average. In the Limarí Valley there are

also both permanent (title) and seasonal trade, with the latter typically more prevalent (Zegarra

2008, p. 5; Hadjigeorgalis and Lillywhite 2004, p. 9). In the US western states, surface water

rights are based on the prior appropriation doctrine that allows water to be separated from the

land and moved via canals and ditches to new locations (Getches 1997, p. 74-189; Kanazawa

1998; Johnson, Gisser and Werner 1981). Appropriative rights with the earliest water claims are

the most secure because they have the highest priority claim on water during drought.




Water rights have been unbundled from land in South Africa since the passage of National

Water Act 1998 (Pott et al. 2009, p. 2) and both temporary and permanent water trading have

been observed (Nieuwoudt, Gillet and Backeberg 2005, p. 1). In China, despite the 2002 Water

Law, water rights remain poorly defined at either the regional, irrigation district or farmer level

(Speed 2010b, p 88). Water remains an ‘open access resource’ within the Chinese Constitution

(Lee 2006, p. 15) and where rights have been established, allocations have generally not been

granted at the farmer level (Shen and Speed 2010, p. 32), with land area often used as a proxy to

calculate water charges (World Bank 2002, p. 12).


                                                                                         19
Quality of Title

The most developed/protected title for water rights is in Chile where it is not possible to modify

rights without full compensation (Bauer 1997, p. 13). This provides security to existing rights

holders, but has created conflicts where existing uses imposes external costs on others. In

Australia, water rights are statutory rights that could, in principle, be revoked or modified

without compensation. In practice, however, both state governments and the federal government

have sought to protect the existing rights holders by purchasing water rights at the market price

when seeking to reduce water diversions and increase environmental flows (Connell and Grafton

2008).

Appropriative water rights in the US West are usufruct rights, conditional upon varying state

regulations for beneficial use, preferred uses, area of origin restrictions, and public

interest/public trust doctrine mandates (Getches 1997, p.128-9).8 Regulatory mandates vary

across states and can raise the transaction costs of transfers and lower the value of water rights.

For instance, high conveyance losses and risks associated with environmental mandates result in

low levels of reliability for surface water transferred through the Sacramento Delta.

Consequently, buyers pay a 20-25 per cent premium for water originating south of the Delta

(Hollinshead 2008). The ‘use it or lose it’ requirement of appropriative rights has also motivated

rights holders to place water into low-valued applications rather than forgo their water rights. In

China the quality of title is not well defined nor necessarily protected in the rule of law. In the

case of South Africa, water rights are formally recognized and registered by the Department of


8
 Wetter western states also allow for some riparian water rights—Washington, Oregon, California, the
Dakotas, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas


                                                                                                       20
Water and Environmental Affairs, but as rights are renewable every five years this restricts the

security of tenure (Pott et al. 2009, p. 9).




Breadth of Market

The breadth of water markets is defined spatially as well as by trades across competing uses.

While Australia has well developed water markets over a very large spatial area within irrigated

agriculture, there have been relatively few agricultural-urban trades. This is not because of legal

restrictions, but has arisen because state governments that control urban water supplies have

eschewed, at least until very recently, the purchase of water from rural areas so as to protect

rural livelihoods and communities. As in Australia, the agricultural sector dominates Chile’s

water markets (Bauer 2004, p. 88). In the Limarí Valley, there has been limited trade activity by

the urban sector because of adequate urban supplies (Easter et al. 1999, p. 14). Importantly, the

government has intervened in several inter-sectoral applications for water rather than leave it to

markets to resolve (Bauer 1997, p. 11).




In the US West, with the exception of a few locations, the majority of water markets are

localized with trading limited to within river basins or sub-basins. Regulatory restrictions and

limited conveyance infrastructure are the primary reasons markets have largely emerged at these

levels. Nearly every western state has laws which protect basins of origin that make it difficult

to export water from one basin to another. Consequently, there is virtually no private water

trading across states. The lack of conveyance infrastructure and the high capital costs of moving

water also limit the geographic scope of water markets. Most short-term trades are within sector,




                                                                                         21
especially within agriculture. Agriculture-to-urban transactions are dominated by longer term

leases and sales, but patterns vary across the states. In South Africa the vast majority of water

trading has been within the agricultural sector (Pott et al., pp. 25-6), despite demands for extra

water by industry. While inter-sectoral transfers from agriculture to mining would be beneficial

for both parties in South Africa it could also “challenge the [equity] objectives of government”

(Farolfi and Perret 2002, p. 8) and the priority of providing water to previously disadvantaged

individuals (PDIs). Any inter-sectoral water trading must also wait for initial allocation of

licenses to be completed (Pott et al. 2009, p. 9). China stands out as the one country where there

has been substantial transfer of water from agricultural to industrial and domestic uses.

However, this has occurred via water efficiency measures such as lining irrigation channels

rather than through a fully operational water market (Speed 2010b, pp. 85-9).




Stability of Price Formation

Smooth price formation, and the avoidance of inexplicable price spikes, is an indicator of a

competitive and mature water market. In Australia, water prices are remarkably consistent across

catchments in the southern Murray-Darling Basin (National Water Commission 2009b, p. 26-9).

Where substantial differences exist it is because of differences in reliability of the water rights or

whether they are permanent or seasonal water rights. South Africa’s Lower Orange River, where

there is data available (1997-2003), is also characterized by stable price formation (Gillet et al.

2005, p. 10), but with substantial variation in prices associated with changes in water availability

(Nieuwoudt and Armitage 2004, p. 3).




                                                                                           22
In Chile’s Limarí Valley, prices of water shares have increased rapidly due to economic

development across the mining, industrial and agricultural sectors (Zegarra 2008: 46). Spot

prices have, on occasions of low water availability, been very high because irrigators with

perennial crops are prepared to pay substantially more than the value of the marginal product if

the alternative is the loss of their trees (Zegarra 2008, p.117). In the US West, markets are both

local and ‘thin’ such that there is considerable annual fluctuation in prices across time, across

jurisdictions, and among sectors. As well as reflecting limited market integration, differences in

price across sectors reflect the opportunity cost of water, adjusted for water quality, conveyance,

and the priority of the water right. Price differentials can be considerable. For example, median

state prices for one-year leases between 1987 and 2008, ranged from $6.50/ML in Idaho to

$71/ML in Arizona and median sales prices ranged from $92/ML in Idaho to $5,344/ML in

Colorado.9 There are also significant price differences in three local markets. Median prices for

agriculture-to-urban and agriculture-to-agriculture transactions in the South Platte region of

Colorado were $6,600/ML and $5,093/ML respectively; in the Truckee Basin of Nevada,

$15,792/ML and $2,366/ML; and in the Central Valley of California, $138/ML and $140/ML.10

The outlier in terms of price formation is China where water prices are regulated by the

government (Liao et al. 2008, p. vi). Consequently, water prices are stable, but they do not

reflect changing environmental or economic conditions. Prices for water transfers, for instance

between regional governments, are determined through direct negotiation.

Market price information is not readily available for all five water markets. The most developed

price data is in Australia where state registers are accessible and some water brokers provide

information on water prices, sometimes on a commercial basis. In Chile, there is an uneven

spread of pricing information in the market that particularly disadvantages market participants

with the least resources and also increases transaction costs (Zegarra 2008: 120). In the US

West, markets are generally informal and segmented. Consequently, it is often difficult for

buyers and sellers to locate one another. Although brokers are emerging to help create water

markets there are no general water rights registries across the US states and accessible price

information is restricted to water trade journals. In China, there is no accessible water price

information while in South Africa price information is spread from word of mouth (Gillet,

Nieuwoudt and Backeberg 2005, p. 10) with no central notice board of pricing. This has led to

asymmetries in terms of price information between buyers and sellers (Nieuwoudt and Armitage

2004, p. 3).




Water Storages

In semi-arid climates where rainfall is not evenly spread throughout the year, water storages

provide a valuable smoothing function in terms of water availability. The more variable is the

climate, the larger are the required storages. In terms of water markets, storages also provide an

opportunity for trade over longer periods of time and enable trades upstream provided the

transaction takes place before the water is released from upriver storages.



In all five water markets there are substantial water storages that facilitate water trade. The ratios

of total capacity of water storages to average water use range from more than two in Australia’s



                                                                                           24
Murray-Darling Basin to about three in Chile’s Limarí Valley. The ratios vary substantially for

the US West, but in Colorado the ratio is 2.3



Equity

Equity can be defined as who gets what water, and when? It is a key component to the successful

operation of water markets because perceived unfairness in initial allocations of water can

undermine the legitimacy of trades. Inequities may also compromise the overall market if it

contributes to water ‘poaching’ or contravention of water regulations. An assessment of equity is

provided below using five criteria: (1) Beneficial use of water extractions; (2) Provision of basic

human needs; (3) Limits on market power; (4) Recognition of third-party impacts; and (5) Initial

allocation mechanisms that include equity considerations.



Beneficial Use

Beneficial use refers to how the water is used, and whether it is used. In underutilized systems

the greater is the beneficial use, the larger are the potential benefits of water diversions.

Conversely, in overused systems the imposition of beneficial use for diversions may be

inequitable to the extent it limits the rights of users, can be subject to administrative intervention

and may contribute to conflicts among users.




Neither Australia nor Chile has explicit provisions for beneficial use although an effectively

functioning market provides strong incentives to trade allocations when water is not needed. By

contrast, in the US appropriative water rights are conditional upon placing the water in beneficial

use. Most western states define beneficial use in terms of the benefit for the appropriator, other


                                                                                           25
persons, or the public with corresponding lists of what is considered beneficial use. Although

irrigation was the dominant initial basis for diversion, the set of beneficial uses can be expanded

or contracted based on changing public values, judicial interpretations, and constituent group

politics. For example, leaving water in stream for habitat has recently been accepted as a

beneficial use across US states although its exact definition differs among them (Anderson and

Johnson, 1986; Getches, 1997, p.113-4).




South Africa has an explicit consideration of beneficial use that it defines as “…conferring a

benefit on the whole population, not just the user” (Pott et al., p. 12). Beneficial use is taken into

account when licences are reviewed (Nieuwoudt 2000, p. 2) although there appears to be little

transparency around what this means in practice. China, because of its centrally administered

nature of water allocation, presumably also incorporates beneficial use in water planning, but

again there is no transparency as to what guides actual decisions




Basic Human Needs

Basic human needs can be interpreted in various ways, but is typically defined as meeting the

immediate requirements of households in terms of drinking water and sanitation. In both China

and South Africa provisions for basic needs are an important part of water planning. In South

Africa’s case the National Water Act 1998 aims to ensure adequate water for basic human needs,

ecological and development purposes (Farolfi and Perret 2002, p. 3). As a result, the provision of

basic water services in townships has been a major priority of the South African government in

terms of its water policies. Basic human needs for water appears to be relatively well-provided

for in China despite an absence of provisions within water planning (Speed 2010b, p. 214).


                                                                                           26
In Australia, basic human needs are defined in terms of water supplies for communities that

depend on rivers for their water supplies. Such communities have the highest order priority of

access. In Chile there is a general deference to the urban water supply (Hearne 1998, p. 154), as

in the case of Australia, but water scarcity is such that the provision of basic human needs does

not currently compromise existing water markets and allocations. This is also true in the US, but

should there be extreme water shortages domestic and municipal uses would be preferred over

agricultural, industrial and in-stream uses (Trelease 1955, p. 134).




Limits on Market Power

Controls that limit how many water rights one individual can own or hold may be implemented

to address perceived abuses of market power, especially in ‘thin’ water markets. In the case of

Australia, concerns over market power have been primarily directed towards the Federal

Government that has become the largest purchaser of water rights in the past two years in its

attempt to acquire water rights from willing sellers for the environment. A separate arm of the

Australian government is charged with ensuring a competitive water market – including

addressing potential issues of market power – and its advice will be incorporated into water

market rules that will be implemented in 2011 in the Murray-Darling Basin.




In Chile, speculation and hoarding have been significant problems, especially in non-

consumptive rights, although these effects have also flowed through to consumptive rights

(Bauer 2004, p. 122-3). The purpose of hoarding, however, seems to be a way for holders of




                                                                                       27
water rights to insure themselves against reductions in water availability rather than to exercise

market power. In large part, this stems from the fact that reductions in allowable water use are

proportionate across all users when water availability declines. In the US, because water markets

are local with few traders and trading options, there are potential problems of bilateral monopoly

and bargaining problems such as between the Imperial Irrigation District and the City of San

Diego (Haddad 2000; Glennon 2009, pp. 258-9) However, because western water markets are so

fragmented there is little likelihood of broad market power emerging. Limited trading in both

China and South Africa currently makes the exercise of market power a remote possibility, at

least until their water markets develop more fully.




Third-party Impacts

Third-party impacts can arise when water trades impose cost on others not accounted for in the

transaction by buyers and sellers. In Australia water markets have been constrained and limits

imposed on the quantity of sales so as to protect communities from reduced water diversions.

These controls have had a negative effect on water transactions and the efficient functioning of

water markets (Productivity Commission 2010). Chile’s 1981 Water Code does not specifically

address third-party effects or environmental impacts. The World Bank considers externalities in

Chile’s water sector to be pervasive and likely to “become more important in coming decades”

(Briscoe, Salas and Peña 1998, p. 15). Externalities as a result of water trading, however, may

not yet be a major problem due to the low volume of trade (Bauer 2004, p. 84).




In the US water trades are regulated by states to meet beneficial use and no harm or no injury

requirements when they involve changes in location, timing and nature of use that could affect


                                                                                        28
other rights holders (Getches 1997, p. 161). There can also be restrictions to limit negative

pecuniary impacts of trades. Despite these equity concerns, most studies suggest that third-party

pecuniary effects are small (Hanak 2003, p. 81; Howitt 1994). Overall, ‘no injury’ requirements

can be sufficiently vague so as to add uncertainty and raise regulatory costs. Additionally, states

generally require that transfers be for consumed, rather than diverted, water to mitigate third-

party effects.




Nieuwoudt (2000, p. 8) reports that the South African National Water Act               1998 “gives

prominence to third party (environment and human) issues”, although it is difficult to assess how

effective these protections are in practice in the absence of significant levels of water trading. In

China, water transfers as a result of water ‘savings’ through lining of irrigation channels is likely

to produce third-party effects which, to date, have not been adequately considered (Speed 2010b,

p. 89), including in terms of surface-groundwater linkages and wetlands (Xie 2008, p. 76).

Importantly, the third-part effects of large inter-basin transfers from South to the North

(Ghassemi and White 2007, pp. 307-316) have not been fully compensated.




Initial Allocation Mechanisms

Initial allocations of water rights can be contentious, especially if prior users of water are

excluded or provided with a lower share than they had historically. Such allocations may be

viewed as inequitable and can contribute to water conflicts that can jeopardize the efficient

functioning of water markets.




                                                                                          29
The challenge in Australia has been to reallocate water rights from existing users to the

environment in ways that are equitable and meet societal goals. To date, this has been

accomplished with the purchase by the Federal Government of water rights from willing sellers

funded from general tax revenues (Connell and Grafton 2008). In the US, water rights in western

states are largely based on the prior appropriation doctrine or ‘first possession’ (Getches 1997,

p.74-189; Kanazawa 1998; Johnson, Gisser and Werner 1981). Appropriative rights are based

on timing of claim, measured in terms of water diversion, and held conditional on beneficial use.

Senior rights have first claim to water and junior rights holders bear more risk during drought.




Since the passage of its National Water Act 1998, South Africa has been undergoing a process of

compulsory licensing, following which an ‘initial allocation’ of water licences will occur (Water

Research Commission 2009, p. 9). This process may reallocate water to other purposes, such as

to previously disadvantaged individuals, without compensation, as way of correcting past

inequities. China’s 11th five-year plan (2006-10) requires the development of a national initial

allocation system (Sun 2010, p. 1), but no clear interpretation of this requirement has been

provided to date. Large inter-basin transfers from the South to the North indicate that past water

use does not ensure current access. In Chile’s 1981 Water Code prior users, primarily in

agriculture, were allocated consumptive water rights, but also included were non-consumptive

rights such as for hydro-electric power generation. Disputes over the priority of water rights

(consumptive versus non-consumptive) have led to legal challenges (Bauer 2004, p. 103-111).

Allocation of return flows to holders of water rights, as part of the 1981 Water Code, has also

disadvantaged the customary practice of using such flows by downstream users.




                                                                                         30
Environmental Sustainability

Water markets provide a mechanism for the allocation of water between competing water users

and market-based consumptive uses. However, unless there is explicit consideration given to

non-market uses or set asides/reserves for the public good, markets may not deliver on broader

societal goals.



There are several preconditions for meeting environmental sustainability in water management,

including adequate information of environmental needs, delivery of water to meet these needs,

and an adaptive process to manage these requirements with changing conditions and

circumstances. These preconditions are captured in the criteria presented in Table 4, namely: (1)

Adequate scientific data to determine hydrological requirements of water-based environmental

resources; (2) Adequate provisions for environmental flows; (3) Adaptive management of

environmental needs, including the capacity to monitor the environment; (4) Water quality

considerations in water planning and markets; and (5) Complementary catchment and Basin-

wide planning and trading.



Adequate Scientific Data

Adequate scientific data is required for effective water resource planning that underpins formal

water markets. The best available data are in Australia, the US and South Africa. In the case of

Australia, much of this data has been developed in the past decade in response to government

programs such as the Living Murray First Step (Grafton and Hussey 2007), initiated to increase

environmental flows. The data are ‘patchy’ depending on the catchment and are not always

accessible even to academic researchers, but are used by water agencies for planning purposes.



                                                                                       31
In the US, state and federal agencies gather and provide information regarding hydrological data

on stream flows, water use, and environmental demands.          Environmental requirements are

project and river specific and there is no central clearinghouse. South Africa has well developed

hydrological models of its major catchments and is developing ‘ecological reserves’ as part of its

National Water Act 1998 that has forced water planners to improve data collection and

monitoring. Neither Chile (Brehm and Quiroz 1995) nor China (Shen and Speed 2010, p. 33)

has adequate water data for environmental purposes.




Provisions for Environmental Flows

In the US all western states recognize that environmental flows are consistent with beneficial

use. Quasi-government agencies and private organizations, such as Oregon Water Trust, engage

in water leasing or rights acquisition for in-stream flow maintenance (Neuman 2004;

Scarborough 2010). However, there is considerable debate about how much water is needed to

achieve specific environmental objectives. Cost-benefit analysis is not expressly required under

the Endangered Species Act 1973 or the Clean Water Acts of 1972, 1977, or 1987 so that a

weighing of opportunity costs generally does not take place in determining environmental flows.

Absent these data as well as scientific consensus, there are debates as to whether there is

sufficient water or too much water devoted to maintaining flows.




In Australia, Chile and South Africa there is federal legislation mandating provision of water for

environmental and public good purposes. In the case of Australia’s Murray-Darling Basin this

will be implemented via a Basin-wide plan that will determine sustainable diversion limits for




                                                                                        32
each catchment beginning 2011. At present, water is provided for the environment through water

resource planning processes and also through the purchase of water rights by governments from

willing sellers. South Africa is also developing ecological reserves of water for public good

purposes that include basic human needs as well as for the environment (Farolfi and Perret 2002,

p. 3), although progress to date has been slow (Pollard, Toit and Skukuza 2009, p. 2). In China,

“…water is generally not allocated to the environment in any meaningful way” (Shen and Speed

2010, p. 33), however, China is in the process of amending water basin plans to account for

environmental flows in at least seven of its major river basins (Speed 2010b, p. 211).




Adaptive Management

Adaptive management is an important way of responding to unexpected changes and coping

with management surprises. One of the key uncertainties in surface water management is climate

variability, especially unexpected and prolonged periods of below-average inflows.



All water markets, to some extent, have some elements of adaptive management. Indeed, water

markets themselves are an instrument that can facilitate adaptive responses to change, such as

drought, by allowing high-value uses to access water that would otherwise have been denied to

them. The challenge is to ensure water markets and water planning can flexibly respond and

sustain the desired public good benefits of water, such as for environmental flows. In Australia,

water resource plans disproportionately favor water diversions that, typically, decline by a lesser

amount than inflows in dry periods (CSIRO 2008, p. 43). As a result, in extended droughts,

environmental flows can become negligible and this can generate widespread environmental

degradation (The Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport


                                                                                         33
2008; Wentworth Group of Concerned Scientists 2010). A Basin Plan for the Murray-Darling

Basin, due for implementation in 2011, will attempt to correct this fundamental failing in water

planning. South Africa has also recognized the importance of adaptively managing its water

resources and ecological reserves of water are being determined to meet environmental needs

(e.g. Pollard, Toit and Skukuza 2009, p. 17).



In the US West there is capacity for adaptive management under state and federal environmental

legislation. The absence of cost-benefit analysis and reliance upon judicial injunctions under

federal endangered species and water quality legislation, however, can result in protracted legal

disputes. Consequently, there is potential for greater reliance upon water markets where rights

holders are compensated for environmental diversions.         In the case of Chile, adaptive

management is in the form of proportional allocation adjustments across all water rights in

response to variability of inflows. China’s water adaptive water planning is presently in a state

such that “…current approaches to defining environmental flows do not adequately account for

complex relationships between flow regimes and ecosystems” (Liu and Speed 2010, p. 17).




Water Quality Considerations

Water quality is related to flows and how water is diverted and used. In all water markets some

consideration is given to water quality. In the Murray-Darling Basin of Australia there are some

restrictions on trade to avoid worsening salinity and the Basin Plan due for implementation in

2011 will include a water quality and salinity management plan to safeguard water quality

(Murray-Darling Basin Authority 2009, p. 14). In the US, water quality is regulated by state and

federal legislation. Water trades can be restricted by quality concerns. This has been the case,



                                                                                       34
for example, in the Sacramento Delta where rising salinity levels contribute to reduced exports of

water through the State Water Project.




In Chile, China and South Africa there is evidence of major water quality problems, at least in

some rivers. In the case of Chile, the most developed water market is in the Limarí Valley and

this region does not appear to have major water quality problems, but this may be more by

chance than good water management (Hearne 1998, p. 145). In South Africa, the most damaging

water quality issue is acid mine drainage that comes from both active and abandoned mines.

Despite the fact that these problems have existed for many decades, they remain a major concern

in key catchments. China has a daunting challenge to mitigate severe water quality problems,

and although it is taking steps to resolve water pollution, enforcement remains weak and the

problems are “…grave and deteriorating” (Lee 2006, p. 7).




Basin and Catchment-level Water Planning

Interlinked and compatible Basin and catchment water planning is necessary for integrated

catchment management to address downstream externalities. In Australia, there will be a

comprehensive Basin Plan for the Murray-Darling Basin in 2011 that will specify environmental

water requirements and sustainable diversions for each catchment (Murray-Darling Basin

Authority 2009, p. 19). However, the actual catchment water resource plans will be developed

by state governments and these do not need to be consistent with the Basin Plan until current

plans expire, which in some cases does not occur until 2019.




                                                                                       35
Chile has a decentralized planning system and there is a tightly circumscribed role for the

relevant Water Ministry. The absence of river basin institutions also prevents any administrative

engagement with water planning, including in the Limarí Valley (Bauer 2004, pp. 96-7). Instead,

irrigation associations and officials in the Irrigation Bureau effectively manage Limarí’s water

supply on a year-to-year basis (Zegarra 2008, p. 41). In the US there is partial basin-wide water

management regarding environmental flows. Basins often cross multiple political jurisdictions

so that differing regulations and agencies are involved, although federal quality regulations

generally apply. The 18 interstate water basin compacts have had limited coordinated

environmental roles, and in California the Integrated Regional Water Management Plan Program

(IRWMP) has been expanded to promote water planning outside traditional political boundaries.




South Africa’s National Water Act 1998 provides for catchment-level planning for

environmental and human needs through reserves. However, slow progress in creating

catchment management authorities has meant that water planning remains in its infancy in most

catchments. China’s seven major river basins all have comprehensive water plans, but these

focus solely on allocation and utilization and do not necessarily incorporate more holistic

objectives such as water quality, environmental protection and human needs (Zhou 2006, p. 6).




Water Markets: An Overview

The five markets assessed under the integrated framework is by no means an exhaustive list.

Informal markets exist in many other countries such as India and Pakistan, as well as more

formal water markets, such as in Mexico (Easter, Rosegrant and Diner 1998). Benchmarking

across water markets would assist informed policy makers to make judgments about how they


                                                                                       36
can be further developed to achieve particular goals. We contend that our integrated framework

shows the important linkages between water market development, institutional constraints, and

management goals. Understanding these connections is crucial to good water governance and,

thus, recommendations about what criteria should be further developed is contingent on the

espoused goals, institutions and capacity where water markets are located. The integrated

framework, thus, should be viewed as a road map or guide that offers multiple routes and options

about how to move from points A to B, or points A to C, depending on what the ‘driver’ wants

and what ‘vehicle’ is available, rather than a single pathway to a unique destination.



In closing, we provide ten key insights from the application of the integrated framework to five

water markets. First, institutions matter. Thus, what may work in one water market may not

necessarily be as successful in another with different institutions. This also implies an important

role for water regulators or governments to support water markets to ensure that they are

delivering the desired societal benefits. Second, some water markets have developed and evolved

for purposes other than economic efficiency. Trade-offs between equity and efficiency exist in

water market design and operation, even if these trade-offs are not always as transparent as they

are in South Africa. Third, Australia shows that markets can be adapted to account for

environmental sustainability without necessarily compromising economic efficiency. Fourth,

markets can successfully work in small catchments, such as Chile’s Limarí Valley, as well as in

large basins, such as the Murray-Darling in Australia. Fifth, water markets can generate

substantial gains for buyers and sellers that would not otherwise occur, and these gains increase

as water availability declines. Sixth, there is a need for flexibility in water markets so that they

can change as the benefits of water use and in situ use change over time, as has happened in the




                                                                                         37
US West and Australia. Seventh, there must be a close connection between water markets and

water planning to provide surety to holders of water rights while also sustaining the public good

aspects of water. Eighth, history matters. For instance, the path dependence of the US with its

appropriative rights is likely to be different to that of Australia that has statutory rights. Ninth,

differences in regulatory capacity (human and financial) to support water markets help to explain

some of the variation in the performance of water markets, such as between China and the US.

Tenth, performance must match goals. Thus, if equity is the primary goal, such as in South

Africa, then water markets should be judged on this priority rather than objectives that may

dominate in other jurisdictions, such as economic efficiency.
