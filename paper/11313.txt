                                          ABSTRACT

We analyze probabilistic expectations of equity returns elicited in the Survey of Economic

Expectations in 1999     2001 and in the Michigan Survey of Consumers in 2002           2004. Our

empirical findings suggest that individuals use interpersonally variable but intrapersonally stable

processes to form their expectations. We therefore propose to think of the population as a mixture

of expectations types, each forming expectations in a stable but different way. We use our

expectations data to learn about the prevalence of several specific types suggested by research in

conventional and behavioral finance, but conclude that these types do not adequately explain the

diverse expectations held by the population.

        Expectations of equity returns are widely thought to be central determinants of investment in equities

and other assets. However, researchers studying asset markets have only recently begun to measure the

expectations that potential investors hold. In the absence of data, basic questions about the nature of

expectations have remained open.

        There has been particular disagreement about the extent and nature of heterogeneity in beliefs about

returns. Much of the finance literature has regarded heterogeneity in beliefs as either non-existent or

unimportant. The original formulation of the capital asset price model assumed that all persons hold the

same expectations for asset returns (Sharpe, 1964; Lintner, 1965) and subsequent discussions asserted that

heterogeneity in expectations would not affect the basic conclusions of that model (Lintner, 1969; Sharpe,

1970). Adherents of the efficient markets hypothesis have contended that prices reveal all privately held

information and have concluded that expectations must be homogeneous ex post, even if they are

heterogeneous ex ante (Fama, 1970).

        Other researchers have argued that heterogeneity in expectations is critical to the functioning of asset

markets. This was true of Keynes (1937) and Williams (1938) almost seventy years ago and of Miller (1977)

and Mayshar (1983) over twenty years ago. These authors, as well as Harris and Raviv (1993), Kandel and

Pearson (1995), and Morris (1995) explicitly reject the core tenet of the efficient market hypothesis that

persons begin with common prior beliefs and develop heterogeneous beliefs only because they receive

private signals. Instead, they stress that persons may hold divergent opinions even when all information is

public, the reason being that they process this information differently. Heterogeneity in the processing of

information is also a central theme of recent research in behavioral finance; Daniel, Hirshleifer, and Teoh

(2002) review this literature.

        To provide an empirical foundation for study of expectations, we have undertaken survey research

measuring in probabilistic terms the beliefs that Americans hold about equity returns in the year ahead. Since
                                                     2

the early 1990s, economists engaged in survey research have increasingly asked respondents to report

probabilistic expectations of significant personal events. Manski (2004) reviews the development and current

state of the literature.

         We originally posed a series of questions on our Survey of Economic Expectations (SEE) in July

1999–March 2001 and later placed one of these on the Michigan Survey of Consumers beginning in June

2002. The question posed in both surveys asks respondents to state the percent chance that a diversified

mutual fund will have a positive nominal return in the year ahead. The wording in the Michigan survey is

as follows:



Positive NominalReturn (PNR): The next question is about investing in the stock market. Please think about
the type of mutual fund known as a diversified stock fund. This type of mutual fund holds stock in many
different companies engaged in a wide variety of business activities. Suppose that tomorrow someone were
to invest one thousand dollars in such a mutual fund. Please think about how much money this investment
would be worth one year from now. What do you think is the percent chance that this one thousand dollar
investment will increase in value in the year ahead, so that it is worth more than one thousand dollars one
year from now?



The SEE instrument posed this question within a sequence of questions asking for the percent chance that

the mutual fund will increase or decrease in value by specified amounts. From June 2003 through August

2004, the Michigan survey contained an additional question asking for the percent chance that the mutual

fund would have a positive real return.

         Dominitz and Manski (2003, 2004) described the responses to the Michigan survey in June 2002-

May 2003. We reported that expectations of a positive nominal equity return varied substantially across

persons and systematically with sex, age, and schooling. We also reported that individual beliefs exhibited

considerable stability over time. The latter finding emerged from the longitudinal feature of the Michigan

survey, which provides two interviews for most respondents, spaced six months apart.
                                                      3

        This paper presents a broader and deeper analysis of the Michigan and SEE data. The broadening

occurs in Section 2 where we extend our earlier description of the survey responses to encompass the

Michigan respondents interviewed in June 2002–August 2004 and the SEE respondents interviewed in July

1999–March 2001. The deepening occurs in Section 3, where we attempt to shed light on the processes of

expectations formation underlying the survey responses.

        The analysis in Section 2 strengthens the major descriptive conclusions of Dominitz and Manski

(2003, 2004). We find that expectations of equity returns vary considerably across persons who are

interviewed contemporaneously; moreover, the patterns of variation are similar within the Michigan and SEE

samples. We also find that Michigan respondents who are interviewed twice tend to give similar responses

at six-month intervals. Taken together, these empirical findings suggest that individuals use interpersonally

variable but intrapersonally stable processes to form their expectations. We therefore propose in Section 3

that it is reasonable to think of the population as a mixture of expectations types, each forming expectations

in a stable but different way.

        In Section 3, we attempt to use the Michigan and SEE data to learn about the prevalence of different

types. We focus on three types that are suggested by thinking in conventional and behavioral finance. One

is a random-walk (RW) type, who believes that equity returns are independent and identically distributed over

time and who, given this belief, uses the long-run historical record of returns to predict future returns.

Another is a persistence (P) type, who believes that recent stock market performance will persist into the near

future. The third is a mean-reversion (MR) type, who believes that recent stock market performance will be

reversed in the near future.

        If one examines informally the central tendency of the expectations data, one may obtain the

impression that the population believes in some form of persistence. Mean expectations of equity returns

were much higher at the end of the boom period when the SEE data were collected (Jul-99 to Mar-01) than

during the less robust period of the Michigan data (Jun-02 to Aug-04). Moreover, both realized returns and
                                                       4

expectations tended to rise during the course of the latter period. However, when we confront formally the

problem of inference on the distribution of types, we find that the heterogeneity of expectations overwhelms

whatever regularity is apparent in the central tendency.

        Very few persons have expectations near those of the RW, P, and MR types, as we define them. It

may be that other definitions of these types could improve matters to some extent. However, we do not think

that any parsimonious specification of types can adequately explain the diverse expectations of the Michigan

and SEE respondents. We conclude, in Section 4, that progress in understanding how people form their

expectations of equity returns will require much more extensive data than we now have.

        Our past and present research contributes to a small but growing literature using various types of

questions to elicit expectations of equity returns and related quantities from diverse populations. The

distinguishing feature of our data collection and analysis is its use of probabilistic questions to learn the

beliefs of the general population of adult Americans. Manski (2004) discusses in depth the reasons why we

favor probabilistic questioning rather than elicitation of point forecasts or verbal measurement of uncertainty.

We think it important to learn the beliefs of the general population because Americans are increasingly being

called upon to participate actively in the stock market through management of defined-contribution pension

plans and, potentially, through partial privatization of Social Security.

        Other work to date differs from ours in various respects. Kandel and Pearson (1995) analyzed the

point predictions of financial analysts for the earnings of specific firms. Welch (2000) elicited point

predictions of the equity premium from financial economists. Benartzi (2001) questioned employees about

the future performance of the stocks of their own firms relative to that of the aggregate market. These and

similar contributions are remote from ours.

        Research by Graham and Harvey (2001) and Vissing-Jorgensen (2004) is closer in spirit to our work

in some respects, but still different in others. Graham and Harvey analyzed responses to these questions

posed to the Chief Financial Officers (CFOs) of certain corporations:
                                                      5

a) Over the next 10 years, I expect the S&P 500 will average a ______% annual return
b) During the next year, I expect the S&P to return _______%
c) During the next year, there is a 1-in-10 chance the S&P 500 return will be higher than _____%
d) During the next year, there is a 1-in-10 chance the S&P 500 return will be lower than ______%



Observe that questions (a) and (b) seek point forecasts but questions (c) and (d) are probabilistic in nature.

        Vissing-Jorgensen (2004) analyzed responses to questions on equity returns administered by the UBS

and Gallup firms in 1998–2002 to respondents in American households possessing at least $10,000 in

financial assets. The questions are



UBS/Gallup: “Thinking about the stock market more generally, what overall rate of return do you think the
stock market will provide investors during the coming twelve months?” “And, what annual rate of return
do you think the stock market will provide investors over the next ten years?”



These questions differ from those administered in SEE and the Michigan survey primarily in that they seek

point predictions of equity returns rather than probabilistic expectations.




2. Measuring Expectations



2.1. Michigan Survey of Consumers: June 2002 – August 2004



        Each month, the Michigan Survey of Consumers is completed by telephone by approximately 500

adult men and women who live in the coterminous United States. The survey has a rotating panel design,

in which the majority of individuals (approximately 300) are first time respondents and the remainder

(approximately 200) are persons who were first interviewed six months earlier; see Curtin (1982).
                                                       6

Temporal Variation in Responses

        We analyze data collected in the 27-month period June 2002–August 2004. Table 1 gives summary

statistics on the distribution of responses to the positive-returns question, month by month. The table shows

that expectations of a positive nominal equity return tended to rise over the sample period. The mean

monthly responses were in the low 40s early on (Jun-02–Apr-03), in the upper 40s in the middle of the period

(May-03–Oct-03), and in the low 50s thereafter (Nov-03–Aug-04).

        Anyone familiar with the performance of the American stock market in 2002–2004 will recall that

realized nominal equity returns also tended to rise during our sample period. The last column of Table 1

shows that the realized one-year return on the Standard & Poor 500 (S&P 500) Index was negative in every

month from June 2002 through June 2003 and positive in every month from July 2003 through August 2004.

This suggests that at least part of the population believed recent stock market performance would persist into

the near future. We will return to this topic in Section 3.

        Although responses to the positive-returns question tended to rise over the sample period, individual

beliefs nevertheless exhibited considerable temporal stability. The sample contains 3885 persons who

responded to question PNR twice, in interviews spaced six months apart. Of these persons, 0.184 gave

exactly the same response in both interviews and 0.425 give pairs of responses that were the same or differed

by no more than 10 percent.

        Table 2 cross-tabulates the responses of the persons who were interviewed twice. Considered in the

large, the table shows that responses on the two interviews tend to remain on the same side of the value “50

percent;” the upper right and lower left parts of the table contain relatively few persons. Among those who

report less (more) than a 50 percent chance on their first interview, only 0.216 (0.177) subsequently report

more (less) than a 50 percent chance. Considered in the small, the table shows certain diagonal elements to

be particularly prominent. In particular, the cells (50, 50), (71-80, 71-80), and (0-9, 0-9) respectively contain

0.071, 0.042, and 0.037 of all respondents.
                                                      7

Cross-Sectional Distribution of Responses

        Table 1 shows that, each month, responses to the positive-returns question varied considerably

among the persons interviewed by the Michigan survey. Table 3 aggregates over time in order to examine

more closely the cross-sectional distribution of responses. This table pools the 27 monthly samples of first-

time respondents, yielding a total sample size of 8020 separate persons. In these interviews, there were 7411

responses to question PNR, giving an item response rate of 0.92.

        The top row of the table shows that the mean response was 46.4 percent and the standard deviation

was 29.4. The lower rows of the table show that some of the heterogeneity in responses is systematic, in the

sense that persons with different demographic attributes have different distributions of expectations.

Focusing on the group means, we find that males tended to be more optimistic than females (mean 50.2

percent versus 43.2 percent) and non-Hispanic whites tended to be more optimistic than other ethnic/racial

groups. Optimism about equity returns increased with schooling, from a mean response of 40.1 percent for

those with no postsecondary education to 51.6 for those with a bachelor’s degree. Younger persons were

more optimistic than older ones, with the mean response falling from 51.0 percent for respondents under age

35 to 36.1 percent for those 65 and older; most of this decline occurred at the highest age group. Finally, we

find that nonresponse was highest in the parts of the population that tend to be least optimistic. For example,

13 percent of the persons with no postsecondary education did not respond versus 3 percent of those with

a bachelor’s degree.

        Although Table 3 shows systematic variation in expectations across groups, it also shows that

population-wide heterogeneity occurs mainly within each group rather than between the groups. The within-

group standard deviation of responses to question PNR is remarkably similar across the groups, in all cases

being at least 26.7 and no more than 31.7. One might conjecture that members of groups who tend to have

enough financial assets to be able to invest in equities would have reason to think about equity returns

carefully and, as a consequence, would have relatively homogeneous beliefs. Such persons may think about
                                                      8

equity returns carefully, but care in thought apparently does not translate into homogeneity of beliefs.

Consider in particular the group of respondents with a bachelor’s degrees. Their within-group standard

deviation of responses is 29.2, essentially the same as that of persons with no postsecondary schooling.

        To describe how expectations vary with multiple personal attributes and over time, Table 4 presents

best linear predictors under square loss of the responses to question PNR. All of the univariate patterns

evident in Table 3 recur here. Moreover, the month-specific coefficients closely follow the time trends in

mean expectations and S&P 500 return realizations shown in Table 1.



Expectations of Positive Real Returns

        Question PNR elicits expectations that equities will have a positive nominal return in the year ahead.

In the period June 2003–August 2004, the Michigan survey posed an additional question eliciting

expectations of a positive real return. The wording of this question was:



Positive Real Return (PRR): And thinking again about the one thousand dollar investment in a mutual fund,
what do you think is the percent chance that this one thousand dollar investment will increase in value in the
year ahead by more than prices will go up?



        Comparison of the responses to questions PNR and PRR shows that, even in the low inflation

environment of 2003-2004, most respondents were cognizant that the nominal return on equities exceeds the

real return. Let ) denote the difference between a person’s responses to questions PNR and PRR. In the

period when both questions were asked, the mean value of ) was 9.9 percent. The 0.25, 0.5 and 0.75-

quantiles of ) were 0, 5, and 20 percent respectively.
                                                      9

2.2. Survey of Economic Expectations: July 1999 – March 2001



        Question PNR was posed to 1651 SEE respondents in the three waves of the survey conducted in

the period July 1999–March 2001. SEE, like the Michigan survey, was conducted by telephone with a

national sample of respondents; Dominitz and Manski (1997a) describe the basic features of the survey. The

item nonresponse rate to the SEE administration of question PNR was 0.27, considerably higher than the 0.07

experienced when the same question has subsequently been administered on the Michigan Survey. 1 For this

reason, the SEE findings should be interpreted with more caution than the Michigan ones.

        Table 1 gives summary statistics on the distribution of SEE responses, wave by wave. Comparison

of these results with those for the Michigan survey indicates that expectations of positive equity returns in

the period July 1999–March 2001 tended to be sharply higher than in the period June 2002–August 2004.

Whereas the mean responses ranged from 66.1 to 70.8 percent in the three waves of SEE, they ranged from

39.3 to 53.7 percent in the 27 months of the Michigan survey. This large temporal difference in expectations

accords with the conventional view of the turn of the century as the tail end of a long stock-market boom

period that was expected to persist at the time, but that eventually did run its course.

        Table 3 describes the cross-sectional distribution of the responses. The SEE respondents exhibited

less of the systematic sex variation in expectations that we found among the Michigan respondents; the mean

responses of males and females were 68.6 and 67.3 percent respectively. In other respects, the SEE variation

in expectations across demographic groups was similar to the Michigan sample. Non-Hispanic whites tended

to be more optimistic than non-Hispanic blacks (mean 68.8 versus 64.7). Optimism about equity returns

increased with schooling, from a mean of 59.1 for those with no postsecondary education to 70.5 for those


1
  The variation in response rates is due in part to a skip-sequencing feature of the SEE questionnaire.
Respondents were first asked to state the minimum and maximum values they believe the mutual fund
investment may have a year after the interview. Many respondents did not answer these questions and,
hence, were not asked question PNR. The Michigan survey did not contain the preliminary questions asking
for minimum and maximum values.
                                                     10

with a bachelor’s degree. Persons under age 65 tended to be significantly more optimistic about equity

returns than did persons of age 65 and above. As in the Michigan sample, SEE nonresponse was highest in

the parts of the population that tend to be least optimistic; for example, 48 percent of those with no

postsecondary education did not respond versus 18 percent of those with a bachelor’s degree.

        To describe how expectations vary with multiple personal attributes and over time, Table 4 presents

best linear predictors under square loss. The univariate patterns in Table 3 recur and the wave-specific

coefficients follow the time trend in mean expectations shown in Table 1. Moreover, the variation of

expectations with personal attributes resembles the variation in the Michigan sample.



Fitting Subjective Distributions

        The positive-returns question was one of a sequence of SEE questions asking for the percent chance

that a mutual fund would be worth more than several specified thresholds in the year ahead. The questions

in the sequence had this form: 2



What do you think is the percent chance that, one year from now, this investment would be worth over $Y?



        The responses to this sequence of questions can be used to fit person-specific subjective distributions



2
  Four thresholds Y were determined by the respondent’s answer to preliminary questions asking for the
lowest and highest possible future values of the investment. The midpoint of the reported lowest and highest
values was used to determine the thresholds according to this algorithm:

                      Midpoint        Y1       Y2        Y3          Y4
                      0 to 899       500      900       1000        1100
                     900 to 999      800      900       1000        1100
                    1000 to 1099     900      1000      1100        1200
                    1100 to 1299     1000     1100      1200        1500
                    1300 or more     1000     1200      1500        2000

Observe that $1000 is always one of the four thresholds; hence, all persons were asked question PNR.
                                                        11

for equity returns in the year ahead. To fit these distributions, we assume that person j interviewed at time

t has a normal subjective distribution N(:jt, Fjt2 ) and we use a least-squares criterion to find the value of (:jt,

Fjt) that best fits the person’s responses. We have previously used this approach to fit person-specific

subjective income distributions (Dominitz and Manski, 1997b), except that we assumed subjective

distributions of income are log-normal rather than normal.

        Table 5 describes the cross-sectional distribution of the values of (:, F) fitted for the 986 respondents

who answered all of the questions and whose responses yielded a unique fitted value for (:, F).3 When

examining the findings, it is helpful to keep in mind the historical mean and standard deviation of one-year

equity returns in the United States. According to Mehra and Prescott (2003), the historical mean real return

on equities has been about 0.07 and the standard deviation has been near 0.20. Moreover, the inflation rate

has remained low and non-volatile in recent years, generally being between 0.02 and 0.03.

        The cross-sectional distributions of (:, F) are better summarized through the quantiles shown in the

table than by the means and standard deviations, which are heavily influenced by a few very large outliers.

The (0.25, 0.50, 0.75)-quantiles of : were (0.04, 0.20, 0.50) respectively. This indicates that most SEE

respondents expected equity returns in the year ahead to be considerably higher than the historical average

return. The (0.25, 0.50, 0.75)-quantiles of F were (0.19, 0.39, 0.74). This indicates that most SEE

respondents perceived equity returns in the year ahead to be substantially more volatile than one-year returns

have been in the past.




3
  1189 persons answered all four questions. For various reasons, we could not fit a subjective distribution
to the responses of 203 of these persons. For example, a distribution cannot be fit if the person gives the
same response to all four questions.

3. Interpreting the Measured Expectations



        The Michigan and SEE data show that expectations of equity returns vary considerably across

persons who are interviewed contemporaneously (see Table 1). We have also found that Michigan

respondents who are interviewed twice tend to give similar responses at six-month intervals (see Table 2).

In conjunction, these empirical findings suggest that individuals use interpersonally variable but

intrapersonally stable processes to form their expectations. It therefore seems reasonable to think of the

population as a mixture of expectations types, each forming expectations in a stable but different way.

        In this section, we use the Michigan and SEE data to learn about the prevalence of different types.

Section 3.1 defines some types that are suggested by thinking in conventional and behavioral finance.

Section 3.2 explains how we approach the problem of inference on the distribution of types in the population.

Section 3.3 presents empirical findings.



3.1. Expectations Types



General Considerations

        There are many reasons why persons may differ in their responses to the Michigan and SEE

questions. First, persons may differ in the way they interpret the mutual fund described in the questions.

The questions characterize a diversified stock fund as one that “holds stock in many different companies

engaged in a wide variety of business activities” and ask respondents to “suppose that tomorrow someone

were to invest one thousand dollars in such a mutual fund.” This wording aims to be informative, but we

cannot be certain that it means the same thing to all respondents. For example, it may be that respondents

who currently hold mutual funds report expectations for the performance of their own investments.

        Second, persons may differ in their expectations because they possess private information about the
                                                      13

operation of the stock market. The idea that persons possess private information has been central to much

research in economic theory and seems credible in many empirical settings. However, we doubt that many

people have meaningful private information relevant to prediction of mutual fund returns. Persons may vary

in the attention that they give to the information that is publicly available, but that is another matter.

        Third, persons may differ in the way that they use available information to form expectations of

future equity returns. This idea has been central to the body of research on asset markets, cited in the

Introduction, which stresses that persons may hold divergent opinions even when all information is public.

We think that differences in the way people use public information must underlie much of the variation in

expectations that we observe.



Three Specific Types

        Conventional and behavioral finance suggest a number of ways that persons may use public

information to form expectations for future returns. For specificity, we focus on types that have normal

subjective distributions for equity returns and use the time series of past values of the S&P 500 index to form

the mean and variance of their subjective distributions. Within this setting, we consider three ways in which

persons may use the S&P time series, as follows:



Random Walk (RW) Type: A person subscribing to a random-walk theory of the stock market might use the

long-run historical record of equity returns to predict future returns. As mentioned earlier, the historical

mean real return on equities has been 0.07 and the standard deviation has been near 0.20. The inflation rate

has remained low and non-volatile in recent years, generally being between 0.02 and 0.03. Based on this

evidence, we take the subjective distribution of one-year-ahead returns of a random-walk type to be N(m, s2 ),
                                                       14

where m = 0.095 and s = 0.18. The implied chance of a positive nominal return is 70.1 percent.4



Persistence (P) Type: A common conjecture in behavioral finance has been that persons believe recent stock

market performance will persist into the near future. The descriptive empirical findings of Section 2 give

credence to this conjecture. We found that expectations of equity returns tended to be much higher at the

end of the boom period when the SEE data were collected (Jul-99 to Mar-01) than during the less robust

period of the Michigan data (Jun-02 to Aug-04). Moreover, both realized returns and expectations rose

during the course of the latter period. These patterns suggest that at least part of the population believe in

some form of persistence.

        Let xt be the realized one-year equity return for the year ending at date t; that is, xt is the value at t

of a dollar invested a year earlier. For specificity, we measure xt by the realized return to the S&P 500 index

during the past year, given in the last column of Table 1. We take xt to be the subjective mean one-year-

ahead return of a persistence type.

        The idea that recent experience will persist into the near future also suggests that the recent volatility

of equity returns will persist. We take the subjective standard deviation of a persistence type to be the

realized standard deviation of returns in the past five years, denoted wt. Thus, the subjective distribution of

one-year-ahead returns of a persistence type is N(xt, w2t ).



Mean Reversion (MR) Type: Another common conjecture in behavioral finance has been that persons believe

recent stock market performance will be reversed in the near future. The idea is that if equity returns have



4
 When considering responses to the positive-returns question, one may alternatively think of a random-walk
type as someone who observes the historical frequency with which the one-year nominal return on equities
was positive and uses this as his subjective probability that the return will be positive in the year ahead. This
nonparametric approach avoids the normality assumption made in our definition. Inspection of the S & P
500 time series for each calendar year of the 15 year period 1990–2004 reveals that the index rose in 10 out
of the 15 years, or 66.7 percent of the time.
                                                      15

recently been high relative to the historical average, then future returns will tend to be correspondingly low.

To formalize this, we take 2m ! xt to be the subjective mean one-year-ahead return of a mean reversion type.

The idea of mean reversion does not suggest a particular way to form expectations for future volatility. We

take the subjective standard deviation of a mean-reversion type to be the historical standard deviation. Thus,

the subjective distribution of one-year-ahead returns of a mean reversion type is N(2m ! xt, s2 ).



Other Types

        The types defined above give specific form to broad ideas about expectations formation evident in

finance research. There are, of course, other specific ways to express these broad ideas. We have already

mentioned an alternative version of the random-walk type, who uses historical data nonparametrically rather

than through the filter of a normal distribution (see footnote 3). When defining a persistence or mean-

reversion type, one might use something other than last year’s return on the S&P 500 Index to measure recent

stock market performance. One might also change the specifications of subjective volatility that we have

made when defining these types. Varying the definitions of types in these ways would retain their qualitative

features but would yield quantitatively different subjective distributions for equity returns and, hence, would

affect the empirical findings that we report in Section 3.3.

        One might also contemplate types that combine the ideas of a random walk, persistence, and mean

reversion. For example, Barberis, Shleifer, and Vishny (1998) define a type who believes that the stock

market alternates between regimes of persistence and mean reversion. As new information arrives, this type

uses Bayes rule to update his beliefs about the nature of the current regime.

        Another direction for definition of other types is to drop the assumption that persons use only past

market performance to form their expectations. An enormous variety of economic, political, and other news

becomes publicly available each day. There are many ways in which someone might think this news relevant

to prediction of future equity returns.

3.2. The Inferential Problem



        This section considers what the Michigan, SEE, or similar data can reveal about the prevalence of

different types in the population. We treat the inferential problem in generality, and so do not mention

specific types by name.

        Our approach to inference is simple. Considering any given type, we ask whether the expectations

responses provided by a person are consistent with those that would be provided by this type. If the

responses are not consistent, the person is not of this type. If they are consistent, then the person may be of

this type. Thus, the data provide an upper bound on the prevalence of the type in the population. We place

no restrictions on the space of feasible types. Hence, we cannot provide a lower bound on the prevalence

of any type.

        Our approach to inference presumes that type is a temporally stable trait. Hence, a person may be

of a given type only if all his responses are consistent with this type. One might alternatively think of a type

as an unstable trait that can vary as a person responds to different questions. The latter conceptualization

of types is much weaker than what we have in mind and seems to us much less useful.

        Our approach differs from other work that attempts to infer a distribution of latent types in a

population. El-Gamal and Grether (1995) use experimental data to infer the distribution of belief-updating

rules used by subjects who are given new information. Houser, Keane, and McCabe (2004) use experimental

data to infer the distribution of decision rules used by subjects facing dynamic choice problems. Although

these articles differ from one another, they both maintain assumptions about the space of feasible types that

are strong enough to identify the distribution of types in the population of interest.



Upper Bound on the Prevalence of a Specified Type

        To begin, let k denote a specified type. At date t, let Pkt denote the subjective probability distribution
                                                         17

that someone of type k places on the nominal equity return r in the year ahead. Let pkty / Pkt(r > y).

         Suppose that person j is asked at date t to state his subjective probability that r will exceed y and

responds with the value qjty. Suppose, for the moment, that qjty precisely expresses the person’s subjective

probability. Then comparison of qjty with pkty reveals whether person j may be of type k. Person j is not of

type k if qjty   pkty and may be of type k if qjty = pkty. Observe that the equality qjty = pkty is a necessary

condition for j to be of type k, but not a sufficient one. There may exist other types with subjective

probability pkty.

         We think it too strong to suppose that responses to survey questions measure subjective probabilities

precisely. Our experience in many studies measuring expectations has been that persons asked “percent

chance” questions tend to give precise answers only at the extremes, where they may respond 1, 2, 98, or 99

percent. Otherwise, persons tend to round their responses to the nearest 5 or 10, with further rounding in the

vicinity of 50. Such rounding is evident in Table 6, which gives the frequency distributions of Michigan and

SEE responses to question PNR.

         The pervasiveness of rounding suggests that we should interpret qjty as providing an interval rather

than point measure of person j’s subjective probability, the interval depending on the response given. Let

[q0jty, q1jty] denote the interval induced by observation of qjty. Then comparison of [q0jty, q1jty] with pkty reveals

whether person j may be of type k. Person j is not of type k if pkty ó [q0jty, q1jty] for any of the questions that

person j is asked. Person j may be of type k if pkty 0 [q0jty, q1jty] for all of the questions asked.

         It remains to define the intervals [q0jty, q1jty]. We have no direct knowledge of the amount of rounding

performed by any respondent. However, we think it reasonable to assume that persons reporting a value of

qjty that ends in a 0 other than 50 are rounding no more than to the nearest 10, those reporting a value ending

in a 5 are rounding to no more than the nearest 5, and those reporting other values are rounding to no more

than the nearest 1. Implementing these assumptions and permitting further rounding when the response is
                                                            18

50, we use these intervals in our empirical analysis:5

        qjty = 0 Y [q0jty, q1jty] = [0, 5];

        qjty = 50 Y [q0jty, q1jty] = [40, 60];

        qjty = 100 Y [q0jty, q1jty] = [95, 100];

        qjty ends in a 0 but qjty   0, 50, 100 Y [q0jty, q1jty] = [qjty ! 5, qjty + 5];

        qjty ends in a 5 Y [q0jty, q1jty] = [qjty ! 3, qjty + 3];

        otherwise, [q0jty, q1jty] = [qjty ! 1, qjty + 1].



        Whether the intervals [q0jty, q1jty] are defined as above or otherwise, the Michigan and SEE responses

place an upper bound on the prevalence of type k in the population. The data per se do not place a lower

bound on the prevalence of this type. The reason is that multiple types may give the same responses to the

questions posed.



Upper Bound on the Prevalence of a Specified Set of Types

        The foregoing discussion has considered inference on the prevalence of a specified type in the

population. An obvious generalization is inference on the prevalence of a specified set of types. Let K

denote these types. Once again, suppose that person j is asked at date t to state his subjective probability that

r will exceed y. Person j does not have a type in set K if phty ó [q0jty, q1jty] for all h , K. This person may have


5
  Although we think that these intervals are reasonable, we cannot be certain that they accurately describe
the rounding performed by all respondents. Perhaps most questionable is the [40, 60] interval placed around
responses of 50 percent. Bruine de Bruin et al. (2000) conjecture that some persons answer 50 percent when
they are unable to make any reasoned probability assessment but nevertheless want to respond to the
interviewer. If so, the responses of 50 percent that we observe are some mixture of rounded subjective
probabilities and expressions of what Bruine de Bruin et al. call epistemic uncertainty.
         Our data for Michigan respondents who are interviewed twice enable us to conclude that at most one-
third of the persons who state 50 percent are expressing epistemic uncertainty. Table 2 shows that 0.23 of
all persons respond 50 percent on their first interview and 0.22 respond 50 percent on their second interview.
However, only 0.07 of all persons respond 50 percent on both interviews. Hence, we conclude that at most
0.07 of all persons use the value 50 percent to express epistemic uncertainty.
                                                         19

a type in set K if phty 0 [q0jty, q1jty] for some h 0 K. Hence, the Michigan and SEE responses place an upper

bound on the prevalence of the set K in the population.



Near Types

         For practical purposes, it may be overly stringent to ask whether a person forms expectations in

exactly the manner of a specified type. It may be more interesting to inquire whether someone is near type

k, given a sensible definition of “near.” In our empirical analysis, we define someone to be near type k if

his subjective distribution of returns is uniformly within .05 of the distribution held by type k. Thus, we

judge person to be not near type k if [pkty ! .05, pkty + .05] 1 [q0jty, q1jty] is null for any of the questions asked

and possibly near type k if [pkty ! .05, pkty + .05] 1 [q0jty, q1jty] is non-null for all of the questions asked.



3.3. Findings



Michigan Data

         Table 7 shows the responses to the positive-returns question that the random-walk, persistence, and

mean-reversion types would give in each month for which we have Michigan data. The three types have

substantially different expectations in most months. Exceptions are Jul-03, Aug-03, and Aug-04, when all

three would give essentially the same response.

         Table 8 reports upper bounds on the prevalence of the three types among the Michigan respondents.

The table separately reports findings for persons with one and two interviews, and also for the full sample

that pools all respondents. The bounds labeled “Exact” uses the exact type-specific responses to question

PNR, shown in Table 7, to judge whether a respondent is possibly of each type. Those labeled “Near” use

a .05 band around these responses, as explained at the end of Section 3.2. We focus our discussion on the

Near findings because we think the Exact criterion to be overly stringent for practical purposes.
                                                     20

Persons with One Interview: Table 8 shows that, among persons who are interviewed once, at most 0.180

are near type RW, at most 0.196 are near type P, and at most 0.142 are near type MR. At most 0.434 are near

the set of three types. There are several ways to view these findings, which emphasize different features of

the empirical evidence.

        Someone who favors a particular hypothesis about expectations formation, say persistence, might

emphasize that a sizeable fraction of the population (0.196 in the case of persistence) potentially form their

beliefs in this manner. Someone who does not favor a particular hypothesis but who seeks a parsimonious

interpretation of observed expectations of equity returns might emphasize that a model positing only types

near RW, P, and MR suffices to “explain” the expectations held by close to half (0.434) of the population.

On the other hand, someone who thinks that persons vary widely in the way they form their expectations

might emphasize that a model supposing that all persons are near these three types cannot explain the beliefs

of over half the population.



Persons with Two Interviews: Consistency with the expectations of a particular type on two interviews is

more difficult to achieve than consistency on one interview. Hence, we anticipated that the upper bounds

for persons interviewed twice would lie below those for persons interviewed once.6 The open question was

how much lower they would be.

        Among persons who are interviewed twice, at most 0.076 are near type RW, at most 0.045 are near

type P, and at most 0.028 are near type MR. At most 0.144 are near one of the three types. These findings

are much less favorable to the first two perspectives described above. Someone favoring the persistence



6
  Nesting of the bounds is necessary as a matter of logic if one consider only persons who are interviewed
twice and computes two sets of bounds for these persons, one using their responses in a single interview and
the other using both responses. Nesting is not logically necessary in our analysis because the persons who
are interviewed twice are distinct from those who are interviewed once. The former are persons who agreed
to be interviewed twice. The latter are a mixture of persons who refused to be interviewed a second time and
ones whom we observe only on one of their two interviews.
                                                     21

hypothesis can at most assert that 0.045 of the population form beliefs in a manner similar to type P.

Someone seeking a parsimonious model can explain the expectations of only 0.144 of the population through

types near RW, P, and MR.

        Our findings for persons with two interviews show that persons near types RW, P, and MR cannot

be very prevalent in the population. However, the evidence in Table 8 leaves open the possibility that

persons form expectations in other ways that express the broad ideas of a random walk, persistence, and/or

mean reversion. To investigate this, one may define other specific types that embody these broad ideas and

perform analysis analogous to what we have carried out here.



SEE Data

        The SEE questionnaire asked persons to answer four questions; hence, consistency with a given type

requires that all four responses be near those that would be given by this type. Among the 1189 persons who

answered all four questions, we find that at most 0.021 are near type RW, at most 0.008 are near type P, and

at most 0.014 are near type MR. At most 0.038 are near one of the three types. Thus, our conclusions from

analysis of the Michigan respondents with two interviews are amplified in the SEE data.




4. Conclusion



        The empirical analysis of Section 3.3 showed that few Michigan and SEE respondents have

expectations of equity returns near those of the random-walk, persistence, and mean-reversion types, as we

have defined them. It may be that more can be done to explain the observed expectations by adopting other

formal definitions of these types, by loosening the criterion we use to define near types, or by investigating

the prevalence of some of the other types mentioned in Section 3.1. Nevertheless, we do not think that any
                                                     22

parsimonious specification of types can adequately explain the diverse expectations that we observe. The

descriptive analysis of Section 2 made plain that Americans vary enormously in the expectations that they

hold for equity returns. Heterogeneity across persons is the overwhelming message of Tables 1 through 6,

each of which demonstrates the phenomenon in its own way.

        Yet interpersonal heterogeneity in expectations does not imply intrapersonal instability. Recall that,

of the Michigan respondents who were interviewed twice, 0.184 gave exactly the same response in both

interviews and 0.425 gave pairs of responses that were the same or differed by no more than 10 percent. This

suggests that persons tend to use temporally stable processes to form their expectations. The large open

question is why these processes vary so much across persons.

        We think that progress in understanding how people form expectations of equity returns will require

much more extensive data than we now have. As a start, it would be helpful to combine the best elements

of the SEE and Michigan surveys. SEE yielded data that enable estimation of a complete subjective

distribution for each person, but had no longitudinal aspect. The Michigan survey has a limited longitudinal

aspect, but only asks for expectations of positive equity returns. A potentially useful longitudinal

implementation of SEE-type questions has begun recently in the Health and Retirement Study (HRS).

However, the HRS is fielded only every two years and, with occasional spousal exceptions, only interviews

persons over age 50.

        We think that even rich longitudinal data measuring expectations in detail will not suffice to

understand expectations formation fully. Considering the general problem, without specific reference to

equity expectations, Manski (2004) argues that understanding expectations formation will also require

intensive probing of persons to learn how they perceive their environments and how they process such new

information as they may receive. In the present case, it seems particularly important to determine what

people know about historical equity returns and how they use this information to form their expectations for

future returns. Large-scale population surveys such as the Michigan Survey or SEE are not amenable to
                                                     23

investigations of this type––the time available to query respondents is too limited and the standardized

question-response format of interviews is too confining. To learn how people process information and form

expectations, economists may need to engage small samples of respondents in lengthy interviews.

        It also is important to learn how expectations of equity returns affect the decisions that people make

regarding asset holdings, savings, and so on. The Michigan Survey and SEE do not ask respondents for asset

or saving data and so cannot be used to address this question. The HRS does provide such data and, hence,

is a potentially valuable resource for future research.

 In SEE wave Jul-99–Nov-99, the realized one-year S&P 500 return is the change in the index from
September 1998 to August 1999. In Michigan month Jun-02, the return is the change in the index from
July 2001 to June 2002. We compute the index for each month as the average closing value of the index
across the days of the month. Returns are computed correspondingly in other waves and months.
