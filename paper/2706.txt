                                   ABSTRACT



     The post-war United States exhibits two rather strong politico-economic

regularities.   The political regularity is that the party of the President
has always lost votes in aid-term Congressional elections, relative to its
Congressional vote in the previous elections; the economic regularity is that
Republican administrations exhibit below average economic growth in the first
half of each term and Democratic      administrations   are    associated with above

average growth in their first half.   In the second halves economic growth is
similar under the two  administrations.   We provide a rational expectations
model which can explain these two regularities.     In Presidential elections
voters have to choose between two polarized candidates; mid-term elections
are used to counterbalance the President's policies by strenghtening the

opposition in Congress. Since presidents of different parties are associated
with different economic policies, our model predicts a (spurious) correlation
between the state of the economy and elections. The predictions of our model
are in sharp contrast with those of traditional retrospective voting models
in which voters simply reward the incumbent if the economy is doing well
immediately before the election.    Our empirical results suggest that our

model performs at least as well and often better than alternative models. In
addition, we question previous     claias   that   voters     are short   sighted   and

naively backward looking.

1.     Introduction

        There     is   increasing awareness         of     a high degree of       interdependence

between aacroeconomics and macropolitics.'                  In the years since the conclusion

of the Second World War in the United States there have been some strong

empirical        regularities     in both the economic and political areas.            A political

regularity,        the midterm Congressional          cycle,     is well known.      As shown     in

Figure      1,   the party holding the White House has lost vote share                 in mid-term

elections        both in the        House     and in the     Senate.    The   figure    shows   the

Republican percent of the two party vote.                  For the intervals between "on" and

"off" years        (43-50, 52-54, ecc.), the curves always slope               downwards   with a

Republican in office and upwards                  with a Democratic     president.       The    same

regularity holds for seats in the House of Representatives.
        A   macroeconomic        regularity   was first noted by Hibbs        (1977) , who showed

that    unemployment tended to fall when the Democrats occupied the White House
and rose on a Republican watch.2                 Alesina and Sachs     (1988), Alesina (l988a)

and Chapell-Keech          (1988) refined this observation, by showing             that real CNP

tends to increase at above average rates in the firsc two years of Democratic

administrations         and increases at below average rates in the first two years

of     Republican        administrations,        while     the   second halves     of    the    two

administrations         show very little difference, if any (see Table 1).                 Similar

results       hold for unemployment.           In particular,     five of the seven postwar

recessions        have started        soon after a Republican President            was elected.

Complementing these results on output and unemployment,                  several researchers,

including        Beck (1982, l984a), Hibbs (1987), Havrilesky (1987), Alesins end

Sachs       (1988);    Alesina     (l988a),    Tabellini   and La Via (1986), Chappell          and

Keech       (1988),    find that monetary policy has been                "looser",      thus more
inflationary,         when a Democratic,              rather   than Republican,          was    in the    hite
House.

        In this essay, we present                   a model    that    is consistent       with these       two

regularities.          Individual          agents    in both the economy and the electorate                 are

fully rational and forward-looking.3                          "Frictions"      in the     economy and the

political process generate                  the     obaerved cyclical behavior.                The political

"friction"      is that candidates            have polarized policy preferences.'                 Democrats,

for example, have a higher tolerance for inflation                            and a lower      tolerance    for

unemployment than do Republicans.                     Because the outcome of elections             cannot be

fully     anticipated,            these       policy preferences          will lead to           expectation

uncertainty.          The economic "friction"            is that plans and contracts              made prior

to elections          cat)not    be immediately         revised    once the winner is known.                 In

addition,      in the model, economic agents cannot enter into state contingent

contracts      that provide insurance against electoral risk,                                              some
                                                                                     Specifically,

wage contracts are signed before it is known which inflation rate will occur

after the election,              since      there    is electoral       umcertainty.           Thus,    even a

rational public cannot predict                      with certainty      the    post-election       inflation

rate:         this    generates        a    short-run       Phillips    curve,     even in a           rational

expectations         model.      However,      since contracts         and plans   can be reformulated

after    the    election,        the   real effects           diminish over time,          and eventually

disappear.       This is consistent with the observation that the real effects on

output and unemployment are largely concentrated at the beginning of each

administration.

        The    inability        to anticipate         elections       also affects       the    behavior of

pivotal voters,          that in our model, are moderate                  relative       to either party.

They would           like   policies         in between        those    pursued     by    Democratic and



                                                        2
Republican presidents.            Since we assume that actual policy is unidimensional

and a function of the preferences                    of    the     executive    and of the relative

strength     of the     two     parties    in tongress,            pivotal     voters can use           their

Congressional votes to moderate the outcomes of Presidential elections.

      Some of this moderating behavior may take place in Presidential years,

consistent with the empirical             observation        of massive split-ticket voting in

the American electorate.6               In mid-term elections,              additional moderation of

the President should take place,               Thus,       there will be a shift in allegiance

of some voters who supported              the President's           party during the Preaidential

election.       This   shift     generates     the        midterm electoral          cycle.     Thus,    our

model does not consider "coattails" and other explanations                               of the midterm

tycle.      Instead,    the purpose       of this paper is to present a model                     that is

consistent with both this                regularity        and     the    regularity concerning          the

macroeconomy.

      We eliminate      other      potential      "frictions"            in order    to make the model

tractable.      Specifically,          we assume that        (a)   there are no lagged effects             in

the policy or the economy,              and (b)   voters are perfectly               informed   about    the

preferences     of the policvmakers          and about       the state of the economy.              These

assumptions      eliminates        any     incumbency            effect.        In    addition,     since

macroeconomic     variables        depend only upon current                   government policy and

agents'     expectations      of those policies,            there        is no carry over from past

policies.7      Consequently,       we can examine each Presidential election and the

ensuing Congressional           election as a two-period             game, isolated from past and

future history.

      Matters    are further       simplified- -both for tractability                 and to highlight

the   key    elements      of    our    model- -by        assuming        that the     only source        of



                                                     3
uncertainty is sbout the distribution of voter preferences.                        Thus,       we have

eliminated several important sources of uncertainty.                   For one, preferences         of

Presidential candidates are assumed known prior to an election.                        For another,

there are no exogenous         shocks    to the economy.        As a result, voters do not

need to learn anything about            the preferences       or competence of politicians

from observing the atate of the economy.6              If learning takes place, we would

find retrospective      as well as moderating        voting.     In addition to restricting

the form of uncertainty,          we alao later make further simplifying aaaumptions

for technical       reasons.      We conjecture      that   the qualitative        nature of our

results holds in more general specifications.

     The predictions          of our model       contrast    sharply    with those         of other

politico-economic       models.       Mordhaua    (1975)    suggested    that adminiatrations

faced non-rational agents and could therefore create an expansion immediately

before elections.         This    "electoralist"      policy would be followed by both

parties,     since they both care only about reelection.                Mctallum (1978), (and
several     others after him) provided a substantial
                                                                 body of empirical             results

rejecting the Mordhaua model.9             An alternative      to Nordhaus        is provided by

Hibbs'     "partisan"    cycle.       The Hibbs work,        however,        remains    similar     to
Nordhaus'     in the    assumption of non-rational           economic                  since     it is
                                                                         agents,
based upon a traditional Phillips curve.

     On the       political    side     the   major alternative         to    our model is         the

retrospective      voting formulatiom introduced by Kramer                   (1971).      [See    also

Fiorina     (l98l)7j.   In retrospective         models,    voters   vote for the         incumbent

president's party in good times and go against it in bad times.                        Moreover,    as

argued in most detail by Fair (1978, 1982, 1987), the data would suggest that

voters have short memories.           Only the state of the economy in the six months



                                                 4
prior to the election has any bearing on the election results.                               In contrast,

in the model we present here, voters vote solely to influence the future of

the     economy.      Past    performance         is irrelevant.          Since              voters seek
                                                                                  pivotal

moderation and since the first two years of administrations                                 will lead to

fluctuations        in output,       our    model     does    point to an expected correlation
between past economic performance                    and     voting behavior.         In     "off"   years,

voting for the Democraca             should be negatively          correlated with the deviation

from the longcerm growth rate of the economy.                          The reason is that years of.

above average growth will occur                    under     a Democratic     president.          When the

electorate         votes     to     moderate        Democratic     presidents,         the       Democratic

Congressional       vote will decline.             In years when the Democrats hold the White

House,      the    prediction of            our    model      contrasts                 with      that   of
                                                                            sharply

Kramer-Fair.          In years       of     below average        growth- -produced         by Republican
presidents--the two models agree in predicting the Democrats will do well.

        Because    our model leads to different predictions                       than the literature,

Section     3     of this     paper presents some              empirical     analysis       of   aggregate
election     results       since    World    War    II.      We find that much previous              work,

particularly Kramer's,             fails    to replicate       on this period whereas our model

tests    out rather well.            Our results       covet    both the Senate as well as the
House of Representatives.              The empirical         section    is preceded,       in Section    2,

by a formal presentation of our theoretical model.                           Concluding remarks are
contained       in Section   4.




2. The Model

      As in Alesina (1987) the economy is described by a nominal
                                                                 wage contract
model, based upon Fischer              (1977).       In this model wage setters                          to
                                                                                              attempt



                                                      5
maintain the real wage at the level compatible                                                 with the natural            rate    of

unemployment.                Labor contraots last one period and are signed at the end of,

say,    period (t-l)                  for period t.                These        oontracta          are    non-contingent;          in

particular,         full indexation is excluded.                                Thus, wage setters set the nominal

wage growth equal to expected inflation:

                                                wt —         t     —
                                                                            E(orII
                                                                               I     1—1




where     w       — nominal wage growth;                           or       —   rate        of inflation;         E()      is     the

mathematical expectation                        operator;          I         is the information              set available         in

period (t-l).                 The     superscript             e indicates             rationally expected variables.
Given (I) the supply function for this economy can be written as follows:


                             y1
                                  —        (    -        )    +y                           > 0;    y     0


where    y       is the rate of growth of output and y is the                                             rate   of growth of

output compatible                 with the natural rate of unemployment.                                      Throughout thia

paper we assume that the rate of inflation can be controlled directly by the
                        10

        Electoral competition has the following structure.                                                Every two periods,

aay in periods t —                    0,   2,   4                Presidential               elections     are held; in these

elections         a President and Congress are elected: we refer to "Congress"                                              as the

unique legislative body.                        In non-Presidential                        elections     years   (i.e. ,   t — 1,
3, 5,    .   .   .) a    new Congress is elected. The two candidates for President are

labelled D and               R,   and since we do not distinguish                                 between "candidates" and

"parties"         the two terms are used interchangeably.                                      The objective functions of

the     candidates,               defined           on       output and              inflation         are    given    by       (the

The difference in the objectives                   of the two parties can be captured by the

following    inequalities:


                                xx

The two parties are not identical                   if at least one of the three                    inequalities

in (5) holds strictly.            The first one highlights                       a difference in the desired

inflation    rate, which tan be related to a different                                   need for the inflation

                                                                           of
tax, for instance because the two parties disagree about the optimal level

government       spending.      The second and third inequalities                           capture a different

evaluation of the costs on inflation and unemployment.                                      In order to simplify      -




the exposition as much as             possible,             we restritt the differente               between   the

two parties' objectives to the first inequality                              (which we assume strict) and

we impose b0 — b5 — 0.           There is no loss of generality in this simplification

because     if    we     substitute    (2)         into      (3)    and      (4)         we would still   obtain

unidimensional objective functions on inflation, with different                                      optimal   and

time tonsistent policies for the two parties.'1                              Thus the objective functions

 inflation    and know the preferences                    of the two parties,                 i.e.,   they know (6)
 and (7).     We assume a continuum of voters where the distribution of voters'

bliss points      (xt),   with i denoting the generic voter, is uniform.                                    Without
 further    loss of generality,                 this      distribution                is   of unit length.        Its
extremes are given by:


                                                       1 +
                                                [a,                a]
where   a is a random variable with zero mean distributed on
                                                                                                   [ammm,amah}.   We
also impose the following inequalities:

                                amax   < —R
                                         x            <   —D
                                                          x             <l+amit
which imply that for any realization of voters' preferences, there are voters

with bliss points on both sides of ;5and x?                                    The distribution of a and the

unit length of the voter distribution are "commOn
                                                  knowledge".                                         Since voters'

preferences   are random, the electoral results are probabilistic even if there

is no uncertainty about the policies followed
                                              by the two parties if elected.
     As a benchmark, consider the case in which
                                                 "Congiess" has no impact on
the inflation policy (or, assume that "Congress"                                  does not exist).         In this
case, presidents follow these policies:

                            R    —
                                       —R
                                       x    ,
                                                 D
                                                      —
                                                          —D
                                                          x    ,    j    —   t, t+l
Voters rationally expect these policies and vote
                                                 accordingly. In particular,
each voter votes for the party with the bliss point closest to his own.
                                                                          The

probability   of electing the D is then given by the
                                                     probability that the
realization of the random variable a is such that more than 50

       Note that in this model the candidates do not convergence                                    fully as in

standard median voter models, nor do they partially converge as in the case

of ideologically            motivated candidates                studied by Wittman (1977, 1983), and

Calverc     (1985) .        In    fact,          as shown   in Alesina (1988b)         ,    the   two presidents

cannot commit to any platform ocher chan (10).                                  For instance,     if candidate D

could precommit             to a preelectoral               platform he would choose a convergent

policy,     lower than his bliss                   point, in order to capture               (probabilistically)

middle-of-the-roadvoters.                        However,   if precommitments          are ruled out, voters

know that when in office, the presidents would follow their mdst preferred

polities.           Thus,    latking             a precommitment        technology there          cannot be any
                             12
policy convergence.

       Expected inflation is given by:

                                     — P          + (l-P)x5       t even                                   (11)

                            —                                 t odd,    R in office                       (l2b)

Equations       (11)    and (12)              underscore        that   in the       first period of a new

administrationthere is expectation uncertainty because contracts have to be

signed before the elections.                        In the second period expectations               are correct

since the public has                 learned        the identity       and thus the preferences          of the

policymaker         in office;           thus      there   is no uncertainty.              The implications   of

(12)   for the output equation are as follows:

            C                   —D       —R        —             .            .
          y     —   y(l-P)(x         -   x   )   + y             if 0 elected in period t                 (13a)

                              —       y                               if   D or R elected in period t        (l3c)

Thus, a recession occurs in the first half of a Republican administrationand

an expansion in the first half of a Democratic                                    administration.    There   is no

difference    in output in the second halves of the two administrations.

        These sre the empirical                   implications successfully tested by Alesina and

Sachs    (1988) and Alesina (l988a).                            We now proceed to consider the role of

"Congress'    in this model, by assuming that in the second period of his term

of office, the President is constrained in policymaking by the composition of

Congress.         Thus,   voters use                  the   midterm election to counterbalance                 the

President in office:                  in every mid-term election the party of the President

in office loses votes relative to the preceding election.

        We assume that if an R President is in office in period t+l (assuming

that Presidential elections took place in period                                    t)   the inflation policy is

given by:

where        is the share                 of votes received by party D in the Congressional

elections    held at the beginning of period t+1.                                  If President D is in office

in period t+l the inflation policy is given by:

                                            —0-             .50

where    V50 is the share                 of votes received by party D in the Congressional

endogenously.         For simplicity and with no loss of generality we also assume

The linearity of the functions               (14) and (15) helps     in solving the model but

it is not crucial            for the qualitative       features   of the results.     In other

words,   the results derived below are not of the "knife edge"                   type; namely,

they hold for other specifications               of relationships     between       and   W°°    and

       and    ltD     in which the curvature          of the function is not too far from
 t+i           t+1

linearity.          Finally,    for expositional      purposes    we assume,   for the moment,

that in the first period of his term of office the President is unconstrained

by the composition of Congress.'3

       The model is solved by backward induction, in order to insure dynamic

consistency;        thus, we start     from the mid-term elections       which take place in

period t÷1.         Consider first the case in which an R President is in office in

period   t.     We want to find             under the sssumption that the voters know the
effect of the composition of Congress on policymaking,                 namely they know (14).
We make use of the following notion of equilibrium:



       Definition:       A     voter equilibrium occurs if and only if no voter would

       prefer a decrease in the expected vote for the party he voted for.



Since voters have single peaked preferences,                there exists s cutpoint in the

distribution of voters' bliss points, labeled x*, such that every voter with

s bliss point higher than x* votes               for party D and vice versa.         Given the
uniform distribution (8), x* satisfies:


                                      VDR      l+sx*                                            (17)

It is immediate to show (by contradiction)                               that x              is such that x    >   x   > x

           The expected utility (when the President                            R     is in office) of voter i with

a bliss point       xt,       such that              >    x   >         can be written, using (14) and (17)
      14
as:

           We can then establish the following result:



Proposition 1:        The unique cutpoint x* is given by:                                     x* — x5



Proof:         Given our definition of equilibrium,                                      a necessary    and sufficient

condition to identify the bliss point of the pivotal voter is the following:

                                                                                     *
                                                                   ifx1<
                                           3x

Thus:

                                       f            [?'

                                                                                 x)kf(a)da
                                                                                                                        (20)



                               a ax

Remembering that                      af(a) —       0,    (20) implies that:




                                           Ox
                                                               if x      ;     l+k
                          -                           -       *—
Therefore       the unique cut poLnt is x
                                                                       1 + k



Thus, using (14), (17) and the result of proposition 1 we obtain:

      cJenow turn to the Presidential
                                       election of period t. (Recall that
                                                                           we

                                         information necessary to know
                                                                        which
policy would be followed by the two

                                                        using (21) and (24).
Thus in period t voter i with

 which R wins the Presidential electiona.                              —R

 [from (21)}.         This implies that a larger fraction of voters
                                                                    switches                               from
party R to party 0 in sid-term elections.

       The same qualitative                            for the mid-term electoral

if Congress is elected every period,                  i.e.   ,   in   Presidential       election years as
well   as     in off years.              In    this                   the
                                                       case,                 voters can      achieve       some
counterbalancing        effect in the first period too.                       The complete solution          of
this   case    is presented more

Here we simply sketch the solution of the
                                          first period problem,    in order to
show that the mid-term electoral cycle survives this

The intuition                 of this result is straightforward.                              If, say,       c x* then the

voters with bliss points xi such that                                       <   xt < x*        act as follows:           in the

first period, under uncertainty                            about      the President's              identity,     they vote 0

for       Congress:               this   implies       that they would want to counterbalance                             an R


                                                                    16

 office,    they switch to voting R for Congress, reducing the counterbalancing
 effect.        This behavior cannot be rational,                    thus
                                                                             At

 3.   Azarezate     Results    £     Congressional       Elections 1950-1984

         Our empirical    analysis        focuses    on House      and Senate elections             from 1950
to 1984.                        some previous
                Undoubtedly,                         investigators had shied away from Senate

data because only two-thirds of the states hold Senate elections in a
                                                                      given
election year. In fact, results for the Senate are               similar to qualitatively
those     for    the   House.        Testing      for    "class"     effects      by       including     duassy

variables       generally proved negative.16

Incumbency Models
      We begin our data analysis by considering                      the simplified             model of the
political process        developed        in the preceding           section.          In the model,        we
assumed a perfectly stable environment except for the stochastic variation in

the   distribution of voter ideal                   points;     conaequently,          no variation is
predicted in the Presidential vote other than that induced by the stochastic

process.     Thus, the simple model does not suggest any
                                                         systematic variation in
either the Presidential            vote or the Congressional              vote   itt   "on" years.17        In
"off" years,       in contrast,     the model predicts an increase in the vote for the

Republicans      when the Democrats hold the White House and vice-versa.                                 Given
the small number of data points,                 we assume the two balancing                   effects   to be

equal.     Thus, we have the following specification:

                                      V         -j3+flM+e
                                          5,1     0  1 1  t                                               (32)
where V          Republican Percentage of Two Party vote in year                       t.




                                                    17
                 +1, if Oem. Incumbent Pres. and t is "off' year


                 -I,     if Rep. Incumbent Pres. and t ia "off" year.

                     0, otherwise

and       satisfiea the standard OLS assumptions              (consistent with our model.)

        As to the coefficients, we hypothesize $,                 >   0.     As shown in Column

1 of Tables 2A and 2B,               the simple model is supported            by the data, with

conventional          significance   levels at 0.05 or better.         The model predicts that

the                     vote will split near its long-term            average    in Presidential
      two-party

         and favor the "outs" by 3.2% in the Senate and 1.8% in the House                        in
years

midterm elections.

        Our simple model captures part of the aggregate fluctuations,                 but lesves

much unexplained variante.                   An alternative   model emphasizes      a systematic

                                                                           We thus define
incumbency effect pertaining to both on and off years.
                +1, if Democrat Incumbent President

                -1,    if Republican Incumbent President

        This incumbency variable was included in the specifications of Kramer

                                                        As seen in Column 2 of Table              the
(1971) and Fair (1978,               1982,    1987).                                        2,


standard incumbency             variable,     by itself, does not furnish explanatory           power


beyond that available in the midterm model.

        In addition to the standard incumbency variable, Fair has considered an

additional incumbency measure.                 He defines

        DEP?.    —      +1,     if Democrat Incumbent President runs for
             t                  reelection in an "on" year.
                         -1,    if Republican Incumbent President runs for
                                reelection in an "on" year.
                         0,     otherwise

                         Fair    (1987), Gerald Ford is treated            as a non-incumbent     in
         Following

 1976.         As shown in Column 3 of Table 2, inclusion of DEPR by itself leavea

 our estimate of the midterm effect virtually unaffected, although the fit for

 the Senate is improved substantially.                             However,      when H,   I,    snd DEPR are all

 included in the model,                   there     is a strong increase                in fit and the midterm
 effect becomes unimportant (Column 4).                               Indeed,     of the various incumbency

 models,        the best, in terms of the cx post estimated                              standard       error,    model

 includes only              I    and DEPR, shown in Column            (5)   of Table 2.

             With respect to the results in Column (5), note that a midterm effect is

still maintained.                    It is given by the coefficient                 on I and is 2.1% in the
House and 3.3% in the Senate,
                              quite close to the original estimates                                        in Column
(1).  On the other hand, Column (5) contrsdicts the
                                                    simple model's hypothesis
of only random variation in Presidential years. When the incumbent runs
                                                                           for

reelection,                his     Congressional      party         reaps     benefits                   to      the   I
                                                                                               (equal
coefficient            -    the DEPR    coefficient).              This incumbency       bonus     is 1.1%       in the
House and 3.2% in the Senate.

          The DEPR results need, however, to be viewed with caution.                                    If we let 1*
                                                *
—    I   -
             H, then regressing on I                and   H   is
                                         equivalent to regressing on I and H.
In turn, DEPR differs from 1* only in its treatment of 4
                                                         observations, one of
which involves the dubious coding of Ford. As Fair (1987) also noted for the

Presidency,            changing the           Ford coding decision substantially                        alters the
results.         The column          (4) R2   values drop from 0.546 to 0.400 for the House and
from 0.796 to 0.678 for the Senate.                           The OEPR coefficient          is not significant

at       the    0.05        level     in either Column                      or
                                                                     (4)          (5)    for    the House. Mote

fundamentally,              DEPR is not entirely a variable that is
                                                                    predetermined before
the electoral              period.     Truman in 1952 and Johnson in 1968 were both
                                                                                     eligible
for reelection.                  In both casee, their decision not to pursue another term
                                                                                          may



                                                              19
have reflected their and their party's temporary unpopularity as s result of

prolonged    military conflicts           in Asia.         Consequently,           DEPR might well be

regarded as an endogenous              variable,      and columns      (3)    -
                                                                                    (5)   are subject   to

simultaneous    equations bias.'8

        What is truly predetermined             is whether     the chief          executive     is a lame

duck.    Only two observations          in our sample, 1960 and 1976, are in this lame

duck situation.         If 0EPR is recoded to differentiate                  lame ducks from others,

there is a further drop in R2,             to 0.363 for Column (4) for the House and to

0.526    for the House,        while   the lesser improvement           afforded over Column            (2)

now depends solely on two observations, 1960 and 1976.                            All in all, there is

reason to regard the DEPR effects with skepticism.                       Nonetheless,          the results

suggest that Presidential          election years contain important lagged incumbency

effects     that are not captured in our simple model, which treats each four

year term as an independent event.

Economic Influences Models

        Another set of alternatives             to our      simple model is posed by various

models of economic influences               on voting behavior.                   The essence      of the

Krsmer-Fair    models is that the incumbent                does well    ingood        times.     Growth in

real per capita GNP, real per capita income, unemployment,                            and the inflation

rate have been used as indicators of performance.                       Fair and Kramer find the

strongest     effects    for    the first       two   indicators    and Bloom and Price             (1975)

consider only the second.              Consequently,       we restrict ourselves            to the first

two     measures denoted by g             and    i    respectively.'9             Because   we have few

observations,     and in order to avoid collinearity, we use these measures one

st a time.      Kramer (1971), Fair (1978), and Zloom and Price (1975) all use

annual data for the year of the election.                    Fair (1987) concludes             in favor of



                                                      20
even shorter voter horizons and used data for the second and third
                                                                   quarters

preceding     the election.      We consider both variants.

       There are several possible models.20                  One, noted by Kramer for historical

reasons, but not investigated,           is that the Republicans                 do well in good times.

From the viewpoint of our theoretical model, this "traditional"                                  lore is in

fact plausible, since "good times", defined in terms of high GNP growth, but

with inflation,        should tend to occur                 in the      first    half of a Oemocrstic

Presidency.      The regressor     for this model, when GNP is the indicator,                         would

simply be g.       In the Kramer-Fair models, good times favor the incumbent so

the regressor     is   -gI.    Bloom and Price adapt the Kramer model to allow for a

"switching" regression.          In recessions             (g < 0) ,    voters       react   to performance

more than in expansions.         The Bloom-Price model can be written:

                   V     —                        +                              +
                              $+ $[-ggl]                                             Ct                   (33)

               where   g—  1 if g > 0
                         — 0 otherwise.

       The hypothesis of the model is that                    >
       In contrast to these            models,    our        simple     approach suggests          that   if
economic factors        relate    to    voting at            all   it    will only be a           spurious
correlation     produced by the expectation uncertainty                         of economic agents end
the moderating behavior of voters.               The relevant economic variable should be

deviation    from trend.       We consider       (g    -
                                                           m)2I,   where a is a target level for

the economy.     As in the other models, the coefficient on this variable should

be positive.     We either set m equal to the average
                                                      growth rate of the economy
over   the   time period of our data set or treat a as a
                                                                parameter to be
estimated by non-linear least squares,                     Another interpretation            of this model
is that voters are       retrospective      but more          "sophisticated"             than the "naive"


                                                  21
voters of Kramer,          Fair,   and Bloom and Price.             Sophiaticated            voters do not

view too high growth in the short run as desirable.                        Such growth may be seen

as potentially inflationary or, more generally, voters prefer a stable growth

path rather than fluctuations of growth.21

        Note that not all observations                discriminate        among    the       models.     Our

                                                                    model                                 as
squared deviation model will look much like a Republican prosperity

long as prosperity occurs when the Democrats                      are in office and recessions

                                                                                                 deviations
occur     during Republican administrations.                     Similarly,       squared

parallel Bloom and Price in calling for recessions                        to be severely punished.


Squared    deviations      and Kramer-Fair basically              agree   for g<m.           Consequently,

with only 18 observations               it is difficult           to discriminate             between the

models

        We begin our discussion of "economic" models by considering simple GNP

models, using growth rates             from the year of election, as shown in Table                        3.


An immediate observation is that none of the models substantially                                outperform

any     of the     incumbency      models,     including    the    very simple midterm effects

model.     The Kramer-Fair model             does particularly poorly,            and the Bloom-Price

model also does not do very well.                     None of these           "naive"         retrospective

regressions passes the standard 0.05 level. In terms of the standard error of

the     estimate (SE) both are               dominated     by the     "Prosperity"            and "Squared

Deviation"       models.    The negative results           for    the Kramer-Fair            and Bloom and

Price     models    are    important    when viewed in the context of these                          authors'

results.     In Kramer's original paper, a simple economic model, based on real

income,     was    highly significant.            As he added        variables          to    this   initial

regression,        the economic growth variable remained the driving variable.                             In

the case      of Bloom       and Price,        the   simple      model was        the    only one they



                                                     22
presented.          Our results     indicate that these           earlier     retrospective         voting
models are not robust to alterations               in the time period and data series.

        The    "Prosperity" model does poorly for the House but quite well for the

Senate.       The     "Squared    Deviation"     model    with fixed a is more stable.                 The

squared       deviation    variable is          significant      for   both houses.           The    slope

estimates      for the House and Senate are quite similar.                   Estimating the "target"

parameter a improves the fit slightly in the House and substantially                                in the

Senate.       The data, however, do not permit obtaining precise estimates of both

a and the coefficient            on the squared deviation.             We thus cannot reject the

null hypothesis that a — 2.959, the average GNP growth rate in the 1950-84

period.        On the whole,        the   evidence in Tables           2     and 3 is at least          as

supportive of our balancing           model than of retrospective             voting models.
        Result   1.     Simple retrospective            voting models do not outperform               the

alternative model that Republicans do well under prosperity.

        Result 2.       Simple retrospective            voting models do not outperform the
alternative model that incumbents are punished for deviations from a target

level of growth.

        Result   3.    None of the models based on GNP growth rates for the year of

the   election fits the data substantially                    better   than    the   simple    midterm
effect model [Column        (1)    of Table 2.]

        One important claim of proponents of retrospective
                                                                             voting models is that
the horizon employed by the voters is
                                      very short.                      However,      our theoretical

model    would suggest       that two years,            rather   than one year,       prior to the
election would be relevant.               The    reason    is that     the    spurious   correlation

between voters' moderating behavior and the partisan business cycle is
                                                                       likely
to be improved by the             averaging     implied by including          data for both years



                                                   23
prior    to an election.              Consequently,      we reestimated all the models shown in

Table    3 by also             including    all relevant variables    lagged one year.         Results

are   shown in Table 4.                    To save space, we group     the    g variables      for   the

various    models         in a block of lines.            The variables and their order are as

shown in Table            3.

        Our hypothesis concerning                  the squared deviation     models   is    confirmed.

For fixed m, both lagged coefficients are significant.23                       Consistent with the

averaging we expected, we cannot reject the hypothesis                       that the coefficients

on the squared deviation variables are equal                     When a is estimated, there is a

significant          improvement         in the log-likelihood    for both houses.         At the same

time, the retrospective               voting models are "improved" for the Senate (but not

the     House)   .        The     F-test     for   Kramer-Fair   is significant.       The     driving

variable,    with the wrong sign, is lagged GNP.                      Bloom    and Price's      lagged
recession variable is also significant.                     Their model shows at least as large

an effect from negative growth one year prior to the election as in the year

of the election.                Although the coefficients are not estimated precisely,               the

House runs are similar-              -
                                         retrospective   voting models show larger effects from
the lagged data.

        Result 4.          The data do not support the claims of voter myopia found in

the retrospective               voting literature.
        Result 5.              The squared deviation models are significantly              improved by

including CliP data for the year preceding the election year.
        To address the emphasis found in Krsmer and Bloom and Price, we redid

all the regressions               in Tables 3 and 4 using i in place of g.         For brevity, we

summarize    the results in the following statement.

        Result       6.    The income measure is not a good candidate for an explanatory



                                                       24
variable    in simple economic models of aggregate Congressional                    voting.      The

fits are generally worse than those for the CNP variable; when the fits are

better, coefficient          values are not as hypothesized by the naive retrospective

voting models.

        In his series of studies on Presidential voting, Fair has also focused

on teal CNP       as the main predictor.                Fair (1987) claims         (at   least   fot

Presidential      elections) that it is mainly per capita growth in the second and

third    quarters    of an election year that matters.                  Consequently,      we also

estimated the models of Table 3 and the no lags columns of Table 3 with g

redefined to be the annualized per capita growth in quarters 2 and 3 of year

        Again the results are negative.            The Prosperity       and Kramer-Fair      models

are always worse for the two-period              growth rate than for the growth rate for

all   of the election year.            The   squared    deviation    model    is better for the

House, with incumbency and trend, worse elsewhere.                   The Bloom and Price model

does better in the House            run (R2 — 0.292 vs. 0.184) but worse           in the Senate

(0.087 vs 0.213).

        Our comparisons       of the various models of economic influences                on voting

behavior have been limited to simple linear regressions including an economic

variable and its lag or, in the case of Bloom and Price, a piecewise linear

regression.         The     literature,      however,    includes     variables    that    measure

non-economic influences.            Specifically, both Kramer and Fair included I and t

(time    trend)     as    additional regressors.          Results,     presented    in Table     5,

comparing the Kramer-Fair model and the Squared Deviation model when I and t

are included, are quite instructive.

        All the results in Table 5 must be viewed with caution,                given the number

of coefficients          relative   to degrees of freedom.          Indeed,   only two of the      8




                                                  25
F-tests     (testing          the    null hypothesis       that all         coefficients,       save     the

constant,    are zero)         for    the overall regression are significant                at the 0.05

level.      Neither      of the two models dominates.               Without the lagged variable,

the Kramer-Fair model always has a better fit than the squared                               deviation.

Indeed,     the lagged variable does not noticeably improve                        the fit      for    this

specification,           in    line    with the     previous        restroapective      voting         lore.

However,    the Squared Deviation           model, with the lag, is nearly as good as the

Kramer-Fair model for the House and substantially better for the Senate.

        Result    7.     In a specification         including      an Incumbency variable             and a

time trend, there is no clear case for a Kramer-Fair retrospective                                 voting
model based on short memory vs. a Squared Deviation Model in which lags are

important.

        What is most interesting about Table                5, however,       is the pattern of the

coefficients.            Introducing     incumbency      into     the   Kramer-Fair    model makes         a

dramatic     difference in fit.               (Compare      Table       5   with Tables     3    and    4).

Incumbency       costs    the "ins" about 2.2% of the vote in the House                     and 3.5% in

the Senate.        These      figures are quite close           to our original       estimate    of the

midterm effect.          While GNP growth now has the correct sign, it clearly has a

subsidiary role to incumbency and has a significant coefficient only in the

House runs.            For GNP growth to have an effect roughly                   equal     to that of

incumbency,      growth would have to fall from its average level of around 3% to

about     -2%- -a major recession           level   attained by only 1982 in the data or

accelerate    to 8%- -a boom level that occurred only before the 1950 election.

        In contrast to the              Kramer-Fair      model,     the     Squared Deviation model
estimates     never show a significant              incumbency effect.            The estimates         are

never as much as one-third those in the corresponding                         Kramer-Fair model;         the



                                                    26
estimates    for incumbency       are actually negative             in the lagged model.               Adding

incumbency helps the overall fit of the original simple model only slightly.
The GNP coefficient estimates retain the signs found in Tables                               3   and 4 but

are significant       only in the lsgged model              for the Senate.         What has happenad

is that the        coefficients    are       not    precisely      estimated      as a result of the

predicted colinearity between            I   and (go)2I.

     When we run a full (less the weak, non-significant                            inflation     variable)

Fair (1987) model by including DEPR, we obtain results similar to the simple

regression shown in Table          2.        Just as the     11    coefficient was near zero when

both I and DEPR were included,                the Squared Deviation            coefficients       are near

zero when DEPR is          added    to        the   model     of    Table    5.      While       the   naive

retrospective      & variable is slightly more successful                   in this context (again a

lagged version        is   more favorable            to   Squared     Deviations)          the    critical

variables    in Fair's specifications               are   non-economic.           In both houses,        the

change     in GNP growth from the average would have to be over 10% for the

estimated    impact to equal that of I.               Such a change is beyond all the sample

values of    g.    Similarly, according to the DEPR model, a party will gain more

from getting its incumbent              to stand for         another    term than it could ever

possibly achieve by successful management of the economy.                           Although the DEPR

model puts a twist on Presidential                   factors not captured in our model,                  the

basic empirical results square with the thrust of our model                           --   elections     are

not driven by economic performance but by forces internal to the political

process.

     Our simple theory, of course, also predicts that the Squared Deviation

model will not        improve     on the        simple      midterm effect variable M.                  This

observation       brings us directly to our empirical                  punch line.           Neither GNP



                                                     27
variable improves on our simple midterm effect model.                      We show this in Table

6,   where the I dummy variable in Table 5 has simply been replaced by H (The I

variable still          appears   in the    g variables.)            Substituting    H for I in a

classical Kramer model is something of a draw- the House results are worse
                                                                 -


and the Senate results are better.              In both cases, however, CNP growth has a

negligible effect.            The only significant       coefficient      appears     in the lagged

Senate model, but there           the lagged coefficient         has the wrong sign while         the

sum of the       two     coefficients    is roughly      zero.       A similar      story   holds for

Squared Deviations.           Here the        is better than with I for both Senate and

House.       No coefficients      are    significant     in the House run whereas            they are

significant when H and Squared Deviations                 are run separately.           The lack of

significance in Table 6 reflects the anticipated colinearity between the two

variables.        One    lagged   coefficient      is significant        in the Senate, but,       no

surprise at this point, the unlagged coefficient has the wrong sign.

         Result 8.      Simple models of economic influences            add little, if anything,

to the basic midterm effects model.




4.   -
         Conclusion
         We have presented a very simple but internally consistent macro model of

an economic and political           system.        The model is obviously very crude, and

further theoretical work is in order, on both bringing in dynamice that would

enrich the two period focus of the current model and on relaxing simplifying

technical      assumptions.       The model we have presented             does, however,      capture
some critical features of some modern political systems.

         The economic side of the model accounts                 for   the notion that       economic

agents       cannot     be   routinely    fooled    by   the     government.         With rational



                                                   28
expectations,       anticipated        efforts at manipulating the economy should have no

effect on the real level of output.                       On the other hand, agents enter into

contracts     that are sufficiently                  long-term   such       that       they can only attempt

more or less        successfully        to hedge          against      the       uncertainty       generated       by

politics.

      In addition to the assumption of voters' rationality, the political side

of   the    model     has    three     key features            (1)     a    two-party          system     in    which

politicians     are    polarized;        (2)     policy reflects            the    influence       of both the

executive    and the legislature;              (3)    an institutional structure where there are

legislative     elections       while the executive                  remains       in power.            The    United

States and France are the two nations                        thst are reasonably good fits to our

stylized environment.
     The     upshot of         our     stylized "political                 economy"       is    that     political

polarization and uncertainty generates economic fluctuations and that voters
use the legislative           elections        to attenuate          the policy swings            engendered by

polarization.       Within the context of our model, these concurrent economic and

political events            generate    a purely spurious                  correlation         between current

economic conditions and voting behavior in the legislative elections.

     In the empirical section of the paper, we saw evidence of the spurious

correlation.          The     midterm     effect portrayed                 by    our    model     was     strongly

supported by the data, while various "economic"                                 models of voting behavior

failed to generate much additional explanatory power.

     Our empirical           results help to reconcile                 the findings            from survey data

that individual voting behavior is not responsive                                to changes       in individual

economic outcomes (Kinder and Kiewiet, 1979; Kiewiet,                              1981) and the supposed

regularity that aggregate               voting behavior responds                   to aggregate           economic



                                                        29
conditions.          While   Kramer    (1979)        provided an     elegant    methodological
reconciliationbased on the observation                that the survey questions        failed to

differentiate     overall     individual     changes        in economic    fortunes    from the

portion of the change the individual attributed                  to government,    our findings

question the existence        of the     regularity     for the postwar period,         at least

insofar as Congressional       elections are concerned.

     The      near    zero   correlations       we     have     obtained    between     standard

"retrospective"       regressors   and Conaressional        outcomes contrasts with the very

high B. values Fair (1987) has obtained for Presidential elections.                       t4arkus

(1988), using survey data, also finds strong support for retrospective                    voting

using survey data for the 1956-84 period.25                  It is thus quite possible that

both retrospective and moderating influences are present.                   In voting for the

Presidency,    voters use the past to evaluate              the current Presidential party,

but, having selected the chief executive, invariably choose moderation in the

off year elections.

     Our model has also not considered many other                                 influences   on
                                                                    important

voting behavior,       most notably the incentive           that each voter has to feather

his constituency's       Congressional     nest by continuing        to reelect      the current

incumbent.      The    incumbency     incentives      are    probably the             factor in
                                                                             major

limiting the midterm effect to only about 2.5% of the electorate.                      That the
midterm effect exists at all responds to the fact that open seats arise and

to the   possibility      that many individuals                           who participate      in
                                                            (professors

national labor markets,        retirees)    are more responsive           to the direction of

national economy policy than to increments to local pork.

'See the seminal works by Kramer (1971), Nordhaus   (1975), and   Hibbs   (1977).
2See, however, the controversy between Beck (1982, l984b) and Hibbs (1983).
Hibbs (1987) has recently showed additional empirical evidence in favor of
his view. For empirical evidence in European countries see Alt (1985)
3Chappell (1983) and Chappell and Keech (1985) also developed macro political
economy models from this perspective.
'We treat these preferences as exogenous and do not model them. The presence
of polarization during the postwar period is supported not only by casual
observation . but also by empirical      studies  of voter evaluations    of
Presidential   candidates  (Poole and Rosenthal,   l984a) of interest group
evaluations  of members of Congress (Poole and Daniels, 1985, Poole and
Rosenthal, l984b) and of roll call voting patterns (Poole and Rosenthal,
1985a, l985b)
5Note that labor contracts may last one, or even two years; thus even though
some elections may not be very uncertain say two or three months before
November, the electoral uncertainty relevant to these economic decisions is
present say 12 or even 18 months before the election.
6Split-ticket voting undoubtedly also responds to many other influences, such
as incumbency advantage and ethnic preference.
'See Alesina and Tabellini (1987) and McKibbin, Roubini and Sachs (1987) for
two party models with state variables which link each administrationwith its
successors.
5For models with learning and asymmetric information, see Cukierman and
Meltzer (1986), Alesina and Cukierman (1987), Rogoff and Sibert (1988) and
Rogoff (1987)
5For some results more favorable to Nordhaus see Naynes and Stone (1987) and
Crier (1987).
'°Alternatively, the model could be closed by a quantity theory equation such
      —    +     where
as   m                 m   is the rate of money growth; in this case one could
assume that the policymakers control money growth rather than inflation. The
shortcut adopted in the text simplifies the notation without affecting in any
way the results.    In this paper, we disregard the issue of the partial
independence of the Federal Reserve.   See Alesina (1988a) on this issue in a
related context.
"This simplification eliminates the issue of time inconsistency of optimal
monetary policy in rational expectations models pointed out by Kydland and
Prescott (1977) and Barro and Gordon (1983). The time inconsistency arises
if the unexpected inflation term enters the utility functions of the two
parties.  By not including output in the objective functions such a term does
not appear.    Alesina (1987, 1988a) and Alesina and Sachs (1988) show
extensivelyhow to deal with this problem in two-party models.

'2Policy convergence can be achieved only if che electoral game is modelled as
a repeated gsme, so that reputational mechanisms can be accounted for. See
Alesina (1988b), Alesina and Cukierman (1987), Alesina and Spear (1987) for
repeated electoral gaines with ideologically motivated politicians         and
Ferejohn (1986) and Rogoff and Sibert (1988) for repeated electoral games
with purely office motivated politicians.    In this paper we do not consider
reputational mechanisms; i.e. , we consider every election as a one-shot game.
tSThe specification adopted for the effect of Congress on policymaking is
perhaps more appropriate for the case of proportional representation, which
does not apply to the United States Congress.
t4Note that (18) would not   represent the correct expected utility for the
voters with bliss points x such that x < amn or      x > 1 +        In fact by
knowing their preferences, and that the preference distribution is uniform,
these voters can infer something about the realization of the random variable
a.   Thus their expected utility is      given by (18).    Since, however, the
cut point voter x* has to lie in between    and Zr', given condition (9), this
consideration does not affect the proof of Proposition 1.
'5Note that in the model with Congress, the realization of the random
variable a tan generate unexpected inflation or deflation even in the second
period of any administration.
'6Like Fair (1987), we report results based on the latest revisions of the
data, which in the case of GNP, have been quite substantial.   However, such a
choice is problematic.    Kramer (1979) argues that one should model voters as
basing their decisions not on changes in their total income but on changes in
income that they attribute to governmental activity. However, one may argue
that voters' assessments reflect the "real" economy rather than the
"unrevised"   announcements  made by the government in the period before
election.   We have checked our analysis with respect to CNP data by using the
CITIBASE series prior to the 1986 revisions.       The results from the oldec
series are somewhat more favorable to the argument advanced in this
paper.
"We do not intlude Presidential voting in this paper. We completely agree
with Fair (1978), who, citing work by Lepper (1974), argues that it was
unreasonable for Kramer (1971) to have estimated a model in which
Presidential and House elections were considered in a single model with
constrained coefficients.
'80f course, it might well make sense, in the spirit of Fair's research, to
include DEPR in a short-term (Truman announced his withdrawal on March 12,
1952 and Johnson on March 30, 1968) forecasting model.
t9Our work uses real GNP (net per capita).    Results      for annual per   capita
growth rates are very similar to those presented here.
20See also Arcelus and Meltzer   (1975) and Tufte (1975)
2This view of the model is congruent with the approach of Chappell (1986) and
Chappell and Keech (1986).      The model with squared deviation also is
congruent with Lepper's (1974) finding that incumbents lose votes when either
unemployment or inflation is high.

221n order to gain degrems of freedom, observations from the interwar period
could be used. In this case, however, one has to make more and more heroic
assumptions about the stability of the politico-economic environment and thus
about the stability of coefficients.      In addition, if one excludes the
observations affected by the two World Wars and by the Great Depression,
there are very few useful observations can be obtained for years prior to
1950 in this century.
23For the House, the F-test, which is equivalent to a two-tailed t-test here,
is not significant whereas the one-tailed t-test on the lagged variable is.
24Like Fair (1987), we used               real GNP for              q in year t from

If   q —    k,       (16) implies the following inequalities:

                                                                    D—R

           Condition            (9)       implies             0    <              C     1,   which          implies         >   -ic.
Consequently,               (A-6) implies                 (A-5). Thus (A-6) holds.                         By repeating the same
