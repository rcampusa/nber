Schooling, Inequality, and the Impact of Government

NBER Working Paper No. 7450
December 1999


                                          ABSTRACT

     Analyses of income inequality have identified the importance of increased demand for worker
skills, but characterizations of worker skills by the amount of schooling attained do not capture
important aspects of the widening income distribution and of the stagnating relative wages of
black workers. This paper is motivated by the possibility that schooling quality is an important
component of the changing income distribution. The central analysis focuses on how
governmental schooling policies – particularly those related to the level and distribution of school
spending – affect the distribution of worker quality and of income. The substantial differences in
spending across states are not significantly related to the variations in achievement growth across
states. Further, the three decade old movement toward reducing the variation in school spending
within states appears to have done nothing to reduce subsequent income variations of workers.
Thus, the direct government policies toward school spending, as carried out in the past, have not
ameliorated inequalities in incomes.

                   Schooling, Inequality, and the Impact of Government

                                by Eric A. Hanushek and Julie A. Somers

        Much is expected of our schooling system. Schools are expected to provide the preparation

that students need for successful entry into the labor market. In the aggregate, schooling is seen as

contributing to the growth of the economy and the overall rise in real incomes of workers. Moreover,

the school system has become a generally accepted policy instrument to alter the distribution of income

in society and to bring about more equality. But the traditional focus – both in research and policy –

on the quantity of schooling neglects the rising importance of quality of schooling. Moreover,

expansion to consider spending on schools, the most common operational surrogate for quality, does

not remedy the distortions in focus. Thus, when specifically considering recent governmental actions

that are most related to quality issues, there is little evidence that the direct interventions of

government have had much effect on the distribution of outcomes.

        Over the course of much of the 20th century, concentration on the quantity of schooling has

been reasonable. The central role of government in providing access to schools has ensured a high

level of schooling in the population. All states provide for universal and free public schools through

grade twelve and most require school attendance at least through age 16.1 Moreover, states are the

primary provider of higher education, covering some 77 percent of all students in higher education

with tuitions subsidized by general revenues so that they remain considerably below costs. As a result,

the adult population with at least a high school education grew from less than 15 percent in 1910 to

over 80 percent in 1990. Virtually all of the this growth, however, occurred before the mid1970s,

leading to consideration of other aspects of governmental involvement in education.

        The quantity aspects of education are fairly well understood. They are, for example, featured

in most standard decompositions of income inequality. In sorting through the effects of education,

however, it has become clear that quality factors may be relevant in explaining the data. The rise of

income inequality within schooling groups and the stagnation of black-white relative earnings each

open the possibility of important effects of school quality.

        This paper focuses on the distributional aspects of the quality of schools. Much of the existing

discussion of school policy begins with a statement about the returns to quantity of schooling, notes

that these returns are large and growing, and then moves to discussions about quality (Hanushek

1996). One obvious issue is whether quality has the same returns as quantity, but this immediately

leads to questions about how to measure quality. In the context of government interventions, it is

natural to concentrate on governmental spending as the measure of quality. Nonetheless, past work

has suggested that governmental spending is not very closely related to quality (Hanushek 1986, 1997).

Indeed, while many are generally satisfied when talking about quantity, there is fairly broad

dissatisfaction with U.S. schools, perhaps resulting from their expense but more likely flowing from a

general feeling that our schools are not living up to expectations. This paper revisits that question with

particular emphasis on the distributional aspects of spending.

Dimensions of inequality

        Recent analyses have documented the widening of income distributions. Part of this has

flowed from the almost two decade long growth in education premia, i.e., the return to quantity of

schooling. The relative earnings of college graduates has moved upwards quite steadily (Murphy and

Welch, 1989; Pierce and Welch, 1996). This movement has pushed the distribution of incomes apart,

with high school graduates seeing no real growth in earnings over an extended period of time while

college graduates have been able to increase their earnings (Levy and Murnane, 1992).



                                                    -2-
        But more than just this divergence has occurred. Within education groups, the distribution of

incomes has also expanded (e.g., Levy and Murnane, 1992; Juhn, Murphy, and Pierce, 1991, 1992).

Further, the pattern of this within group growth in the variance of income roughly follows the same

time pattern as the returns to schooling levels (Juhn, Murphy, and Pierce, 1992; Murphy and Welch,

1992; Katz and Murphy, 1992).

        Another dimension of these distributional changes has received societal attention. The

distribution of income by race has been a common barometer of equity in society. While there is

ambiguity about what is the “right” amount of inequality in the entire population – because of issues

about the underlying ability distribution, about the incentive effects, and about other fundamental

issues – there is less ambiguity about racial differences. The variations in inequality by racial group

over time offer a perspective on changes in equity that is in some ways a cleaner view.

        The incomes of blacks relative to whites have changed through time in ways not entirely

dissimilar to the changes identified in incomes within and between schooling groups. Relative black-

white earnings converged rather steadily from World War II through the 1970s (Smith and Welch,

1989), both because of convergence in schooling levels and because of other factors. But this

convergence stopped in roughly 1980, and the earnings gap stood steady through the 1980s (Juhn,

Murphy, and Pierce, 1992). Thus, with the growth in educational returns and with the other widening

in the income distribution, Blacks found relative progress halted.

Some explanations

        While there is controversy about the details (cf Welch 1999), the common interpretation of

much of the movement in the various dimensions of inequality relates to an increased demand by the

economy for skilled workers. This increased demand has driven the increasing returns to quantity of

college education (and to additions of schooling at lower levels). As the return to skill rises, the



                                                    -3-
income gaps between people of differing schooling levels naturally widens. The movements in black-

white earnings also appear closely related to these changes. Throughout the post-World War II period

there has been convergence in the quantity of schooling of blacks and whites. For example, while

young whites were three times as likely as young black males to complete high school in 1940, the gap

was just 93 to 86 percent in 1996.2 This convergence of schooling levels, with blacks catching up to

whites, naturally leads to a convergence in earnings. The rapidly increasing returns to more

schooling, however, works in the opposite direction, because whites still retain a clear advantage in

overall levels of schooling. Thus, a portion of the overall trend in relative earnings represents the

competing forces of converging schooling levels and diverging earnings by school level. But there has

also been an increase in the portion of income disparity that is unexplained by schooling. Is this

related?

           As mentioned before, the income inequality within schooling categories has also been

expanding. One possible explanation of at least a portion of the “unexplained” part of the overall

income distribution and of the Black-white patterns involves school quality. Over some period of

time, there has been a recognition of the heterogeneity of schools. It seems unassailable to assert that

not all schools are alike. Simply put, few believe that every year of school – the basic building block

of human capital and labor force quality – has the same skill content, regardless of which of the 85,000

elementary and secondary schools or 3,000 colleges produced it. While measurement of quality

differences is controversial (and the subject of the subsequent discussion), an expansion in the returns

to quality that mirrored the increased returns to quantity could partially explain each of the stylized

facts about the changing distribution that were described earlier. If the distribution of quality, as



           2
         In 1940, 41 percent of whites age 25-29 had completed at least high school education, while
the similar figure for Blacks was 12 percent. The closing of the gap to the 1996 amount was quite
steady over the postwar period.

                                                    -4-
relevant to the labor market, remained constant, a growing return on quality would lead to an

expanded variance of earnings.3 A movement toward improving the relative quality of schooling will

push relative black-white earnings closer, while an increase in the returns to quality will lead to

divergences when whites begin with higher quality (cf. O’Neill 1990).

        We do not have precise measures of quality, but measured cognitive ability provides insights

into at least one dimension of quality. The most consistent data on cognitive skills comes from the

Scholastic Aptitude, or SAT, tests given to high school juniors and seniors. Figure 1 presents a time

series of overall scores and of scores for Blacks and whites. Average test scores declined sharply from

1966 through the 1970s, recovered some in the early 1980s and remained stagnant through the

mid1990s. The second element of the figure is the noticeable narrowing of the black-white differential

during the early 1980s that essentially stopped in the mid1980s. This pattern of scores has a clear

similarity to the changes in earnings inequality, particularly if the returns to skill have risen in recent

periods. There is, however, a significant problem with these data. The SAT is voluntarily taken by a

select group of students – those wishing to attend highly ranked colleges – and this pattern has been

changing over time. Varying numbers of students have taken the exam. The percentage of high

school seniors taking the SAT between 1972 and 1995 has varied between 31.0 and 42.4 percent, and,

while it has generally risen over the period, it has not been a monotonic increase (U.S. Department of

Education, 1966). By common analysis, this increased participation could cause score declines and

could distort the Black-white comparisons. It appears that the decline in SAT scores through the 1970s

was a combination of changing selection and real performance declines, but it is difficult to be certain

about the magnitudes (Congressional Budget Office, 1986).



        3
        This prediction is complicated, however, if school completion is growing, because the
achievement or ability of people defined in terms of completed schooling will tend to be falling (see
Welch 1999).

         The National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) provides a shorter picture of

achievement (beginning in the early 1970s) but a picture that is uncontaminated by student selection.

NAEP has periodically collected data for a random selection of students in differing subjects. Figure 2

displays the achievement patterns across subjects for 17-year-olds. It also divides performance by

race. The patterns of performance mirror that displayed earlier on SAT performance. With the

exception of reading performance, aggregate performance dips in the 1970s, recovers in the early

1980s, and then turns flat. For reading, aggregate performance is essentially flat for the entire period.

There was also a consistent narrowing of performance between whites and Blacks or Hispanics in the

early 1980s, only to stop in the late 1980s. The similarity of the NAEP and SAT trends after 1970

suggests that the precipitous fall in SAT performance during the 1960s may carry over to a

representative sample, implying student achievement in the 1990s that is significantly below that in the

1960s.

         This paper pursues issues of quality as a complementary element to quantity of schooling. The

important matter for the discussion here is the extent of governmental influence on quality movements.

Government Interventions

         The federal and state governments have long been involved in education, in part because of its

perceived importance in affecting the distribution of income both across individuals and

intergenerationally. The clearest statement of governmental motives and involvement is probably that

of the War on Poverty, where President Lyndon Johnson highlighted the importance of human capital,

broadly defined, in affecting the bottom of the income distribution. Affecting the income distribution

and poverty levels through providing increased skills had and has broad appeal, because it offers long

term improvement in the opportunities of the poor without excessive intrusion on natural labor market

and work incentives.

        This paper concentrates on the role of skill building that takes place in elementary and

secondary schools. A central focus is policy actions that have direct distributional objectives, although

this is clearly too narrow. The natural operations of schools, coupled with choice of schools by

families, have significant, albeit not necessarily intended, distributional implications. Thus, it will be

necessary to decompose the effects of schooling into those affecting the level of skills and those

affecting the distribution of skills.

        The actual policy interventions have been quite varied. At the federal level, two main features

have dominated. First, in the federal courts, the moves to desegregate schools and to promote equal

opportunity by race has probably been the largest and most consistent intervention of the past half

century. Beginning with Brown v. Board of Education in 1954, the federal courts have been important

actors in the organization and operation of public schools (Welch and Light 1987; Armor 1995). They

have clearly influenced the amount of racial mixing within and across school districts. It also appears

that they have directly affected the resources available to Blacks and whites (see Boozer, Krueger, and

Wolkon 1992). Little evidence is available to indicate any consistent effects of desegregation programs

on student performance or other outcomes (Armor 1995). The evaluation is complicated, however, by

the nature of the programs that affects both student distributions and a variety of school resources.4

        Second, the federal government has funded compensatory programs for schools. These

programs include Head Start pre-school programs, Title I compensatory education programs, and

special education funding. Table 1 provides some idea of the funding levels that have been involved in

the various federal programs. These spending numbers provide information on the real aggregate



        4
         Desegregation programs have a variety of effects including changing the racial composition in
individual schools, altering the distribution of teachers and resources across schools, and affecting the
choice of districts by students. The complex patterns of impact make identification of the impacts on
student outcomes difficult. The available studies concentrate on specific aspects but are unable to
capture larger effects (cf. Hanushek 1972; Armor 1995).

funds available.5 Understanding the impact of these programs is complicated because it is difficult to

tell who is receiving services. They are not entitlement programs and do not cover the entire eligible

population. Moreover, the numbers of students served by the programs is difficult to measure, in part

because of changes in programs. For example, the Title 1 compensatory programs recently changed

from being targeted to individual eligible students to being available for entire schools that had

concentrations of eligible students – leading to a large jump in the reported numbers of students being

served by the program.6

        Evaluations of the effectiveness of federal programs in improving student performance do not

suggest much overall success. Title 1, which has changed form repeatedly over its history, has never

indicated success in boosting general performance of disadvantaged students (see, for example, Farkas

and Hall, forthcoming). Headstart has historically been dubbed as having limited effectiveness, with

any gains in early performance eroding over time (see Barnett 1992). Special education programs have

never received any overall evaluation.7 In sum, there is little reason that federal actions as a whole

have had much effect on student achievement.

        Schools are, nonetheless, the primary responsibility of the states, so the lack of systematic

federal impact might not be altogether surprising. The states have pursued a variety of programs that

affect equality in schools. Most significantly, states operate independently, implying substantial

spending has some equalizing effect, it is small relative to the overall disparities in funding. Figure 3

shows the distribution of mean expenditure across states. The spending data, while unadjusted for any

cost of education differences, show a remarkable spread.

              The difference in mean spending across states is the largest component of inequality in

resources available to students. Murray, Evans, and Schwab (1998) employ various approaches to

decompose variations in spending across schools into that lying within states and that which comes

from overall spending differences across states. While varying slightly depending upon the measures

employed, the general finding is that two-thirds of the differences in school spending come from

between state differences.

        Figure 4 shows how the portion added by the federal government is related to state and local

spending. It is interesting that, while federal spending has focused on purely distributional issues in

terms of disadvantaged (low-come) populations, there is little equalization of overall spending across

states. Federal spending has done little to disturb existing spending differentials across states, even

though this large variation in spending is negatively related to the education and income of the state.

        A variety of other programs and financing incentives is designed to promote more equality in

schools. Part of this can be seen in Table 2, which charts the financing of schools by the various

levels of government. States have increased their share of spending, while local shares have declined.

After early growth in programs, the federal share has been virtually flat.8 The growth in state shares

is at least partially related to school funding court cases or attempts of legislatures to deal

independently with the issues raised in those cases.

        Beginning in the late 1960s, a wave of school finance cases have swept the nation. The origins

of these cases are typically traced to the California case of Seranno v. Priest. The underlying legal

theory was that children in property poor school districts with their commensurately limited taxing

power were being discriminated against, because the ability of the school to raise funds depended on

through schools (U.S. Department of Education, 1997).

the wealth of the students’ neighbors.9 This suit, originally brought under both state and U.S.

constitutions, became the model for similar suits in a majority of the states. While the U.S. Supreme

Court ruled that existing state school financing plans did not violate the equal protection clause of the

14th Amendment, most state constitutions explicitly define a state role in the provision of elementary

and secondary schooling, and they have been the focus of suits.

         State courts have split on whether or not their financing arrangements violate the state

constitution, but one overall effect of the court action has been the relative increase in state funding

that has come from the state. The general thrust of these suits has been that states should take a larger

responsibility in school funding so as to ameliorate if not eliminate the funding advantages that certain

districts have. This by itself leads to an increase in state share. Moreover, since there is frequently a

significant amount of redistribution of funding called for by court orders and by legislative “equity”

initiatives, it appears frequently to be more feasible to increase the total spending while changing the

pattern; i.e., it is easier to redistribute a larger pie than a constant pie. Considerable heterogeneity

exists across states, however, and such generalizations fit the aggregate better than individual states.




         9
         The underlying academic arguments that were important in the development of these cases are
found in Coons, Clune, and Sugerman (1970).

                                                    -15-
        The primary focus of the court cases has been equity (although it may be changing recently).10

If there is a wide disparity in the funding and quality of schools, the argument goes, there will be

subsequent disparities in earnings and other outcomes. And, while quality is the general rubric of

concern, most of the court cases have focused a majority of attention on purely fiscal and expenditure

aspects of schools.

        The prevailing evidenced suggests that court cases have tended to promote a more even

distribution of spending across districts. Wykoff (1992) analyzed measures of dispersion of spending

across states. This work was extended by Murray, Evans, and Schwab (1998). Evans, Murray, and

Schwab show that states under court order have moved more toward equality that those not under

order, although most states have not made dramatic changes.

        The slow changes in the state share should not obscure the fact that overall spending grew

dramatically over the past three decades. Table 3 shows the overall growth in spending and in the

underlying components of spending. Overall real spending per pupil more than doubled between 1965

and 1995. During the same period pupil-teacher ratios declined dramatically, and the percentage of

teachers with a master’s degree or more more than doubled so that a majority of teachers in 1995 had

graduate degrees. The growth in spending has also been larger in states with court judgments (Downes

and Shah 1995). Thus, movements toward equality have also contributed to overall growth (with some

potential effects on variations in spending across states).

        The important point throughout this discussion is that there has been a consistent push to bring

about more equality in the provision of schooling. The federal government has concentrated almost all

of its effort on supporting disadvantaged students with supplementary funds and programs. The states


        10
           The new version of state school finance cases has focused on “adequacy,” or whether state
funding is sufficient to meet state educational goals. While ambiguity exists in the exact definition,
this set of school finance cases appears to address both the distribution and level of spending across
districts.

provide broader support for schools, but much of it is designed to bring about greater in-state equality

in school resources.

        Does this movement by governments have a discernible effect on student performance and on

subsequent inequality in earnings and well-being? That issue, of course, is central to any assessment

of government’s contribution to ameliorating societal inequalities.



New Evidence on Government Interventions and Outcomes

        The importance of states and localities, plus differences in the availability of data, lead to

separate consideration of between state effects and within state effects of government spending and

policy. In both between and within analyses, we also consider effects on not only the overall variation

in outcomes but also the differences in black and white outcomes. Unfortunately, much of the past

evidence relates only tangentially to the kinds of policies that appear directly related to inequality. The

past evidence that resources are not closely related to mean student performance suggests that actions

aimed at the distribution of resources will also meet with limited success in terms of outcomes.

Nonetheless, estimation of the effects of differences in levels of spending across states has been flawed

by misspecification problems. And, the effects of changes in the within-state distribution of resources

have not been adequately traced to the distribution of student outcomes, the presumed object of

equalization policies.

Between state evidence

        The between state differences in school quality and student outcomes can be thought of as an

extension of existing analyses of educational production functions. In the production function

analyses, resources usage (and other factors) are related to student performance. It is easy then to see

that these provide some direct information about how resource differences across states would be



                                                   -18-
expected to affect the overall state distribution of state performance. If the educational production

function were known, it would be possible to estimate directly how differences in mean spending

translated into marginal differences in mean student performance.

        The overall assessment of the findings of educational production function estimation has been

presented elsewhere (Hanushek 1986, 1997). The summary in those articles, which collect and

tabulate the existing production function estimates of resource effects, is that there does not appear to

be a strong or systematic relationship between resources and student performance. This evidence

combines the estimated effects of real resources and of spending differences, which both point in the

same direction.11   The estimated effects of variations in resources on student performance are

distributed around zero with only a small portion indicating a positive and statistically significant effect

of resources on performance. Therefore, the existing econometric studies give little reason to expect

that more resources will be translated into outcomes, at least within the current organizational

environment. This evidence thus presents a prima facie case that efforts to equalize funding and

resources will have little effect on the equality of outcomes.




        11
          Teacher salaries are closely related to teacher experience and to teacher degree levels, and
variations in pupil-teacher ratios indicate how salaries are distributed across students. Thus, these
measures are a good indication of variations in instructional spending per student. Because these real
resource measures are more frequently available than spending measures and because they can be taken
down to the classroom level, the real resources are overall better indicators of the effects of resources
than spending.

        This work is not without controversy, however, and part of the debate relates directly to the

discussions here. Card and Krueger (1992) concentrate on how historic differences across states in

resources and spending relate to differences in worker earnings.12 They conclude that interstate

differences in spending are directly related to subsequent labor market earnings. Thus, this analysis by

Card and Krueger both contradicts the overall findings of the production function analysis and raises

the suggestion here that the large interstate differences in school spending directly relate to current

issues of income inequality.

        The extensive discussions aimed at resolving the differences between the overall production

function estimates and the Card-Krueger estimation point to important considerations for this analysis.

While the differences have been approached from a variety of perspectives,13 the key for this work

relates to differences in state education policies. No studies have adequately characterized or measured

how state policies (other than spending) influence student performance. This omission has clear

implications for bias in the estimation of educational production functions across states. Hanushek,

Rivkin, and Taylor (1997) note that aggregation of data to the state level will work to exacerbate any

regression bias that comes from omitted state-level variables. The theoretical sign for any bias

depends on the correlation of state policies and spending and is unknown a priori. They provide

evidence that demonstrates an aggregation bias that pushes estimated expenditure effects toward

showing positive impact on student performance. Specifically, a review of past analyses, reproduced


        12
          Their approach, described more below, uses census data for workers at the given census year
(1970 or 1980) to derive the labor market earnings of workers along with schooling levels and age.
They estimate earnings generating functions where the estimated return to schooling varies by workers’
state of birth and birth cohort. These returns to schooling are then related to characteristics of
schooling systems in each state of birth and time period.
        13
          A range of analyses is found in Burtless (1996). The most direct analysis of the Card and
Krueger approach is found in Heckman, Layne-Farrar, and Todd (1996a, 1996b). They highlight
issues of selective migration of workers across states, functional form of the estimated earnings
models, and sensitivity of results to the particular samples.

                                                   -21-
in Table 4, shows that studies within single states (where any state policies are held constant) find less

support for any spending effects than studies that go across states. Moreover, this bias toward positive

spending effects is more significant when the across-state analyses rely upon state aggregate data.14

The essential aspect of this evidence is the strong indication that differences in state policies are

important in determining student performance, but these studies offer little guidance about how to

specify or measure the key aspects of state differences.

          The systematic effects of aggregation could come either from omitted variables bias or from
errors in variables. In the later case, aggregation would improve the results, and the stronger effects
in the aggregate data would be more accurate. Hanushek, Rivkin, and Taylor (1996) test these
alternative explanations and find that misspecification bias and not errors in variables explains the
pattern of results.

                                                     -22-
        To consider the impact of between state differences in spending, we begin with consideration

of the potential biases from different state policies in the context of a simplified production function:

(1)     Ost = f ( X st , ρ s Rst )

where Ost is aggregate student outcomes in state s in time t; Xst is a vector of current and past family

and other exogenous factors affecting performance; and, DsRst is the effective school resources in state

s cumulative to time t. The effective school resources are written as spending in the state (R) that is

augmented by state policies (Ds) which imply that any spending is more or less effective depending

upon prior policy choices.15 Then consider directly estimating an operational version of this such as:


        Ost = At X stβ ( ρ s Rst ) ε st
                                  γ
(2)


where ,st is an i.i.d. error term and $ and ( are production parameters. Here the problem of state

differences in the effectiveness of resources (Ds) becomes apparent. In estimation form, we have:

(3)     ost = at + β xst + γ rst + (γ ln ρ s + ln ε st )

where small letters denote logarithms of the previously defined variables. If Ds is not measured but

included in the composite error term, the parameters of interest will be biased when this omitted

variable is correlated either with resources or other determinants of performance. Now consider the

situation if student performance and its determinants can be observed at some previous time J for the

same set of students. If state policies (i.e., Ds for each state) are constant over time, we can estimate:

(4)     ∆ os = a * + β ∆ x s + γ ∆ rs + (ln ε st − ln ε sτ )
        τ→t




        15
         The state factor incorporates both cost differences across states and policies that affect how
resources are translated into student performance. We do not emphasize cost differences here,
although they obviously complicate any direct analyses of interstate spending differences.

                                                     -23-
        Estimation of this model with aggregate data, while subject to considerable uncertainty, can

provide some clues to how government policy influences student performance. In particular, during

the 1990s, the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) has provided state data on student

performance at different grades. The key element of the NAEP testing is that the same cohort of

students is tested over time so that estimation of Equation 4 is feasible. In mathematics, state

performance for fourth graders in 1992 can be matched with this cohort’s eighth grade scores in 1996.

Similarly, in reading, state performance for fourth graders in 1994 can be matched with this cohort’s

eighth grade scores in 1998.16

        Table 5 presents basic estimates for between-state differences in NAEP performance. These

simple models provide no reason to believe that the very large state differences in resources lead to

differences in average achievement across states. The estimates of the resource parameter (() are

significant and negative. State differences in adult education levels do on the other hand significantly

affect the growth in student performance.

        It is possible, however, that these aggregate performance measures mask an underlying

structure of differences. Most importantly, the aggregate performance presented earlier on NAEP over

time shows a narrowing of the racial gap, particularly during the 1980s. Grissmer, Flanagan, and

Williamson (1998) suggest that this narrowing was largely a function of added resources to the

educational system, either reflecting total spending or reductions in pupil-teacher ratios. Cook and

Evans (1996) on the other hand find that the narrowing of NAEP scores between blacks and whites

cannot be a reflection of school funding levels. Thus, if resources were to be a prime factor behind the




        16
          The NAEP is not a longitudinal design with respect to individual students but it includes
random samples of the same cohorts in these different time periods. This set of matched cross-
sections, when employed in the value-added form of Equation 4, introduces some measurement in
background factors, but any bias is proportional to the sampling error to total variance ratio.

                                                  -24-
narrowing of test score differences by race, it must be the case that minorities are more sensitive to

resource differences than white students.

        To test for differential sensitivity of minorities to spending, we consider the race-specific value

added of schools across states. The same state NAEP data are disaggregated into white, black, and

Hispanic scores, and the same log growth models are estimated separately for each group. The results

of this estimation are displayed in Table 6. Again, as can be easily seen, state differences in resources

have no more effect on black or Hispanic scores than on white scores. These results also hold when

(not shown) the racial distribution of students in each state is included in the models.

        In sum, the between-state differences in resources appear to have little to do with the

distribution of student outcomes. This reinforces the overall findings of the production function

analyses, but it also adds important new information. The previous evidence of state differences in

spending is confounded with an omitted variables problem. This evidence–which deals with the

omitted variables problem through estimation of state value added models–adds further insight into the

role of states in affecting inequality. This finding is also important because approximately two-thirds

of the variation in school spending is found in variations in mean spending across states (Murray,

Evans, and Schwab, 1998).

Within state evidence

        The previous evidence on how variations in spending across states are unrelated to student

performance fails to address two significant issues. First, the measure of student performance is eighth

grade test scores, but these may not be a good reflection of outcomes. Second, much of the policy

attention given to distributional issues, both in judicial and legislative arenas, has focused on the within

state variation in spending, an issue that is ignored in the between state analysis. This section

addresses both of these issues.

        Test performance of students has been used frequently as a surrogate for longer term outcomes

such as labor market success, although there are questions about this. The primary argument for



                                                         -26-
employing test score measures is that student performance can be related to the specific teachers and

programs of students in ways that are generally impossible if one must wait for students to enter the

labor market. This approach presumes that test scores are a reasonable index for skill dimensions that

ultimately show up in longer term outcomes. While there is evidence that this is the case, it is also

clear that much of labor market outcomes is not explained by variations in measured test scores –

suggesting the possibility that school resources could still influence students’ long run performance.17

For example, Card and Krueger (1996) suggest that one reason for the divergence of results between

the general findings of production function studies of education and their analysis of census earnings

patterns is simply the superior measures of long run outcomes that are found in labor market data. By

concentrating on labor market outcomes, they assert, a truer picture of the relationship between school

resources and student performance can be observed.

        The Card-Krueger approach is useful to consider here. They begin with data from the

decennial censuses which gives earnings of individuals of varying ages and schooling levels. They

then use information about state of birth and age to estimate the average state school spending when

each individual was attending schooling. Thus, for example, a 35 year old high school graduate in

1980 who was born in Ohio would be estimated to have the average Ohio school spending between

1951 and 1963. They then relate variations in the estimated return to varying quantity of schooling to

school spending for each individual.18 While their approach was directly related to between-state


        17
          Early analyses of labor market outcomes tended to show positive but relatively weak
relationships between earnings and test scores. More recent analyses, however, have indicated an
increased relationship (e.g., O'Neill, 1990; Bishop, 1991; Grogger and Eide, 1993; Murnane, Willett,
and Levy, 1995; Neal and Johnson, 1996). The exact reason for the increased relationship is not
entirely clear, because more recent studies have improved data sets and analytical methods and because
the nature of the labor market itself may have changed. Nonetheless, at least for more recent periods,
the two stage model suggested in common production function estimation seems justified.
        18
        This description is highly simplified, and the details prove to be important. See Heckman,
Layne-Farrar, and Todd (1996b) and other discussions in Burtless (1996).

                                                   -27-
differences in school resources and earnings, it seems better suited to consideration of within-state

differences.

        Consider earnings for an individual i that are consistent with equation 2:




(5)     osti = at + β xsti + γ rsti + (γ ln ρ s + ln ε sti )

Within a state, Ds is constant, so the variance in (log) earnings would be:


(6)     var(ost ) = β 2 var( xst ) + γ         2
                                                   var(rst ) + var(ln(ε st )) + 2 β γ cov( xst , rst )

under the assumption that the errors (,) are uncorrelated with the exogenous variables. In the

subsequent empirical analysis, we do not explicitly measure cov(x,r) but include it as part of the

composite error term. This approach presents problems only if there is a systematic relationship

across states between the within state variance in resources and family background and the within state

covariance of these. We know of no evidence on this.

        The empirical analysis matches variations in earnings to variations in family education and

state school resources. We concentrate on workers who are age 25-37 in 1990. The bottom end of the

range is chosen to begin with a period when most individuals have left school and are in the labor

force. The top end of the range reflects availability of school spending data across districts within each

state. The Census of Government School System Finance (F33) File provides annual data on current

expenditures per pupil from 1968-96.19 Someone who is 37 in 1990 would have been in the ninth

grade in 1968. Thus, by beginning with this group, we can calculate the relevant average high school

spending (grade 9-12) for each state for the workers in the sample.




        19
         In some years there is a full census of districts; in other years there is a sample of districts
within each state. We combine these to obtain annual estimates of spending variation.

                                                         -28-
        We divide the age range into four separate cohorts (age 25-27, 28-30, 31-33, and 34-37). For

each region of worker residence, we can calculate variations in earnings by cohort, race, gender, years

of schooling, and birth state. We then merge information on school spending variations (from the F33

data) and on variations in family characteristics (from the Current Population Survey) within birth state

for the relevant cohorts.20

        We estimate different variants of equation 6 using the combined data set with separate

observations for the various groups.21 Table 7 presents basic estimates for the combined cohorts.

These estimates are separately provided by race and gender. While other work (Somers 1998) presents

a variety of variants on the basic estimation, here we concentrate simply on the overall patterns.22

        The key result for the purposes of this investigation is that variations in spending have a

significant negative relationship to variations in earnings for whites. For black males there is an

insignificant positive relationship, while only for black females does a significant positive relationship

appear. In other words, except for black females, reduced variation in spending – the object of judicial

and legislative policies in many states – is actually associated with higher variation in ultimate labor

market outcomes.




        20
          The quality of family background data from the CPS differs across time, because the specific
age of children in families was unavailable before 1967. Here we combine evidence across the
different CPS years, but separation does not change the results.
        21
          The actual estimation relies upon coefficient of variations for earnings, family background,
and spending. Because we use linear rather than logarithmic variances, this approach eliminate
differences in cost of living across areas and focuses on the underlying distributions.
        22
          Variations include different measures of family background, different sample definitions by
cohort and employment status, and different specific empirical specifications that incorporate degree
level indicators or not.

        When other measures of family background are employed, similar results hold. Additionally,

because of possible endogeneity concerns, the occurrence of a state court judgment requiring more

equalized funding is used as an instrument for spending in years after the judgment. This also fails to

change the overall finding of unintended perverse effects of expenditure equalization.

        The important aspect of this estimation is that it provides a general way of assessing the impact

of variations in within state spending on performance. Even though the modern wave of school

finance reform, largely propelled by state actions, has lasted over three decades, little analysis has been

done of the impact of these actions.23 This analysis generalizes the results to incorporate both

interstate and intertemporal variations in state spending inequality, and finds that the intended

consequences of finance reform have not been realized.




        23
          Downes (1992) is an exception. Looking at reform in California following the Seranno case,
he finds little reduction in the variation of student performance.

Conclusions

        Much of the explicit rational for government educational policies has to do with equalizing

opportunities for citizens. This rational is clearest at the federal government level but also holds for

state governments.

        The focus of policy actions toward schools is most often the level of spending in schools. A

long history of past analyses of spending variations suggests that spending is a clumsy instrument for

changing student performance. So there is question about whether redistributive spending policies

translate into more equality of outcomes.

        The explicit analysis here concentrates on the two basic components of governmental spending

policies. First, wide variation in spending per student exists across states. Past investigation of

interstate differences in spending have been confused by misspecification problems and the

implications of unmeasured differences in general state schooling policies. Here variations in state

spending are related to value-added in student achievement across states. This approach circumvents

the most serious biases from state policy differences. The results of between state differences in

spending indicate no relationship with student performance on math and reading tests.

        Second, variations in spending within states are related to variations in labor market outcomes.

This added analysis both relates directly to current judicial and legislative interventions in schools and

provides a conceptually superior measure of student outcomes. This analysis provides little

confirmation of a powerful equalizing role for states. For both white males and white females, there is

a negative relationship between spending variations and variations in ultimate labor market outcomes.

Only for black females is there confirmation of an hypothesized positive relationship between

variations in school resources and subsequent equality of outcomes.




                                                   -31-
        The results here confirm previous analyses of the determinants of student performance.

Resource variations, the most common metric for considering governmental school policies, are not

related to the level or variation in student performance.
