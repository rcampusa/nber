           The improvement in the health of the elderly in the United States during the twentieth

century has been remarkable. Costa (1998) finds that in the 1930s rates of blindness among those

aged 65 to 84 were four times as high as in the 1990s. Fogel and Costa (1997) find that men

older than 64 in 1910 were much more likely to suffer from heart, respiratory, musculoskeletal,

and digestive disorders than their counterparts today. Costa and Steckel (1997) document the

increase in weight adjusted for height for older men from dangerously low levels at the turn of

the century. This improvement in health has not necessarily been continuous. Costa and Steckel

(1997) report that chronic disease rates at older ages were higher for cohorts born between 1840

and 1849 than for those born between 1820 and 1829. There may be cycles in more recent

years as well. Although clinician reports document continuous improvements in health since the

1970s (Waidmann, Bound, and Schoebaum 1995), self-reported health declined during the 1970s

but increased during the 1980s (Verbrugge 1984; Crimmins 1990; Colvez and Blanchet 1981;

Chirikos 1986; Poterba and Summers 1987; Cutler and Richardson, forthcoming).1 Nonetheless,

the overall trend appears to be one of improving health.

           Several environmental factors may account for the long-term decline in chronic disease

rates among older Americans and for cycles in health. Although the increased efficacy of medical

procedures may improve health, it may do so only for those who would have survived in any event

while simultaneously keeping alive those who would have died in a poor state of health. The latter

effect may even offset or overwhelm the former effect. Life style changes such as the cessation of

smoking or the switch to a low fat diet may account for some of the recent improvements; however,

the initial increase in smoking probably contributed to increased morbidity rates. Other factors

that could explain the long-run decline include reductions in occupational injuries, a decline in


   1
    Self-reported health measures may be misleading because they depend upon public and private efforts at disease
prevention and upon the availability of disability insurance. However, clinician reports may fail to capture the
functional implications of many health conditions.

atherogenic viruses in the food supply, increases in nutritional intake during the growing years,

and declines in childhood infectious diseases. As pointed out by Preston (1993) those who

reached ninety in 1992 were born in 1902 when life expectancy at birth was only 49 years and

the burden of infectious disease was exceptionally heavy. An ongoing series of studies by Barker

and his colleagues (Barker 1992, 1994) linking many of the degenerative conditions of old age

to exposure to infectious disease, malnutrition, and other types of biomedical and socioeconomic

stress in utero and in the first year of life argues that the focus of research should be shifted

from an emphasis on such adult risk factors as obesity, smoking, and lack of exercise to early

childhood factors. These studies, however, have been criticized on several grounds, including the

confounding of stress at birth and in early infancy with stress at young and late adult ages because

of the persistence of biomedical and socioeconomic risk factors (Paneth and Susser 1995).

          This paper investigates the risk factors of heart disease, respiratory disorders, and

musculoskeletal problems among the first cohort to reach age 65 in the twentieth century by using

a longitudinal data set on Union Army veterans. In many ways the data are ideally suited to a study

of the impact of environmental stress throughout life. Because infant mortality varied greatly

across United States counties during the early childhood of this cohort, this variation allows me

to investigate the impact of the disease environment in the county of enlistment. Because these

men were exposed to a variety of stresses while in the army as young adults, particularly from

infectious diseases, I can investigate the impact of exposure to disease at young adult ages on

later life outcomes. I can also investigate the impact of socioeconomic factors at young adult

and older ages on chronic disease rates at older ages. Because medical care in the past was

ineffective at best, I will be able to examine whether there is any evidence that in the past marginal

survivors who may be kept alive today died and that men with specific chronic conditions were

less disabled than their counterparts today. Riley (1989) has argued that while incidence rates for

specific conditions may have fallen, conditional on having a disease those with the disease may


                                                  2
now be more disabled than they were one hundred years ago. In contrast, Cutler and Richardson

(forthcoming) find that since the late 1970s self-reported health of those with specific chronic

conditions has improved.

          The findings will help us understand why the health of different cohorts has been

changing in the United States and therefore improve our forecasts of health trends. These

forecasts will permit us to assess policies to postpone the normal age of retirement for Social

Security and to reduce the fiscal deficits in Medicare and Medicaid. The findings will also help us

formulate public policies for countries undergoing an epidemiological transition. The infectious

diseases that were prevalent in the United States in the nineteenth century are still common, and

as deadly, in many developing countries today. Controlling infectious disease may therefore be

the appropriate health response to lower chronic disease rates. Furthermore, if ill-health among

older populations arises from their experiences in early childhood or as young adults, then these

years may the appropriate ages at which to target health interventions.

          The findings also have implications for theories of the epidemiological transition (Omran

1971; Fries 1980). If infectious diseases contribute to chronic disease then the link between

infectious and chronic diseases may be much closer than previously thought. Although life style

changes and improved medical care allow for the compression of morbidity in these theories,

chronic diseases are generally viewed as part of the natural process of aging and thus as limits

to life expectancy, a limit which is now generally set at age 85 (Fries 1989). Recent research,

however, finds little evidence for a genetically endowed life span, or, at the very least, suggests

that such a limit would be well above age 85 (McGue, Vaupel, and Holm 1993; Wilmoth and

Lundström 1995). Manton, Stallard, and Tolley’s (1991) predictions suggest that if people

changed their health behaviors in optimal ways then life expectancies might reach the 90s or the

100s. Reductions in other risk factors for chronic disease, such as exposure to infectious disease,

may therefore play a role in extending life expectancy and may explain the declines in older age


                                                3
mortality observed since the 1970s.

              The paper begins with a discussion of the relationship between early life conditions and

chronic disease. It then proceeds to describe the data and to present some results on trends in

chronic conditions. The paper then examines the relationship between early life conditions and

the probabilty of chronic disease, how life expectancy for individuals with particular diseases

has changed over the course of the century, and whether there is any evidence that those with a

given chronic condition are now more disabled than they were in the past. The paper ends with a

discussion of the implications of the findings.



1 Early Life Conditions and Chronic Disease

The medical and epidemiological literature provides many examples of the possible linkages

between early life conditions and the three major chronic disease categories examined in this

paper – heart, respiratory, and musculoskeletal disorders. These are briefly reviewed in this

section.2

              The link between infectious disease and rheumatic heart disease, a form of heart disease

common in most developing countries and in the United States at the beginning of the century,

is particularly well-established. Acute rheumatic fever involves the joints and the heart and

subcutaneous tissue and results in damage to the heart valves. Today acute rheumatic fever most

frequently occurs in children 6-15 years of age following group A streptococcal upper respiratory

tract infection whereas in the nineteenth century it occurred more frequently among older persons,

with 25 percent of first attacks occuring between ages 20-25 and 49 percent between ages 30-39

(Kiple 1993: 971). Individuals who have had acute rheumatic fever become particularly likely to


   2
       See Elo and Preston (1992) and (Stein et al. 1990) for more thorough discussions.



                                                          4
experience recurrences of attacks following the streptococcal infection. Crowding associated with

poor living conditions is the major predisposing condition for the increased risk of streptococcal

infection and acute rheumatic fever.

          Other infectious diseases that can affect cardiac functioning include late stage syphilis,

measles, and typhoid fever. In a sample of typhoid patients, electrocardiogram assessments

showed that 12 percent had cardiac involvement (Khosla 1981). Electocardiogram assessments

of Nigerian children with measles showed that 35 percent had some electrocardiogram abnormality

(Olowu and Taiwo 1990).

          The link between infectious disease and atherosclerosis is less well-established. Buck

and Simpson (1982) found a high correlation in the United States between atherosclerotic heart dis-

ease at older ages and diarrheal deaths from birth to age 20 and speculated that infection facilitates

the production of autoimmune complexes that promote the later development of atherosclerotic

lesions. The fatty streaks that are the precursors of these lesions may already be present in children

by age 10.

          Infectious disease is not the only early life factor that may affect heart functioning.

Barker (1992, 1994) finds in longitudinal data that undernutrition in utero and in the first year of

life, as proxied by anthropometric measures of the child, increase risk of coronary heart disease

and stroke.

          Chronic obstructive lung disease is another important cause of adult morbidity and

mortality in developing countries. Researchers have hypothesized that lower respiratory tract

infections in childhood may aid in the development of chronic obstructive lung disease in later

life, particularly during early infancy when childrens’ lungs are undergoing developmental change.

In a longitudinal study of British men, Barker (1992, 1994) found that bronchitis, pneumonia,

and whooping cough before age 5 are associated with reduced lung function at ages 59 to 70.

Follow-ups of disadvantaged children in South Africa revealed that lung function abnormalities


                                                  5
persisted years after the contraction of pneumonia (Wesley 1991). In this group of children,

and in most developing countries, measles is a major cause of acute lower respiratory infection

(Markowitz and Nieburg 1991). Autopsies and radiographs show that measles bronchopneumonia

results in bronchiolar obstruction, airways distension, and a thickening of the peri-bronchial walls

(Jean et al 1981). Among Civil War soldiers measles was followed by such complications as

chronic bronchitis, pneumonia, pleurisy, chronic diarrhea, and general debility (Cliff, Haggett,

and Smallman-Raynor 1993: 105). Previous tuberculous disease may also lead to respiratory

abnormalities from cavities. One third of typhoid fever patients also suffer from cough, suggesting

that typhoid fever may also be a likely candidate for respiratory distress problems in later life.

Other viral infections, such as pulmonary syphilis, might also play a role.

          Lung diseases and respiratory symptoms resulting from occupational exposure to dust,

fumes, or gases include asthma, chronic bronchitis, chronic airflow limitation, and tuberculosis.

Workers in mining, steel foundries, tool grinding, glass making, metal casting, and stone polishing

are particularly prone to occupational lung disease. Farmers are also affected because of inhalation

of organic dust from moldy plant materials and animal waste, hair, and feathers.

          Joint and back pains remain common afflictions in developed countries and are increas-

ingly being recognized as substantial burdens in developing countries (Muirden 1995). Although

rheumatic fever, particularly in adults, is often accompanied by arthritis, this manifestation is

generally considered to be of relatively short duration, benign in children, but painful in adults.

However in rare instances a residual nonprogressive athropathy develops (Katz 1977). Muscu-

loskeletal symptoms are common with many viral infections, as well as syphilis and malaria.

Although in most cases these symptoms fade away after a short period, permanent joint damage

can occur for a series of diseases such as tuberculosis, vaccinia, and gonorrhea, among others

(Hartmann 1974). In addition to disease, occupational stress is another important determinant

of musculoskeletal capacity, which even in modern, developed country populations is not only


                                                 6
lower among men in physical rather than mental or mixed work, but the rate of deterioration in

musculoskeletal capacity among men in physical work is greater (Nygård et al. 1988).

             Thus far I have stressed the positive relationship between early life conditions and

chronic disease at older ages, but the relationship could be negative as well. If genetic susceptibility

to death from infectious disease or other insults at young ages is positively correlated with genetic

susceptibilty to develop chronic disease at older ages, then, because fewer genetically “frail”

individuals survive to old age, the morbidity rate of such a cohort may be lower relative to a

cohort in which more genetically frail individuals survive. Additionally, cohorts who survive

infectious disease may acquire partial or complete immunity and therefore may have lower

mortality rates.



2 Data

The data used in this paper are drawn from the records of the Union Army pension program.3

This pension program was the most widespread form of assistance to the elderly prior to Social

Security, covering 85 percent of all Union Army veterans by 1900 and 90 percent by 1910 and

benefitting an estimated 25 percent of the population older than 64 whether as a couple consisting

of the former soldier and his wife, the single or widowed veteran, or the widows of veterans

(Costa 1998: 160). The program began in 1862 when Congress established the basic system of

pension laws, known as the General Law pension system, to provide pensions to both regular and

volunteer recruits who were severely disabled as a direct result of military service.4 The Union

Army pension program became a universal disability and old-age pension program for veterans

with the passage of the Act of June 27, 1890 which specified that any disability entitled the veteran

to a pension. Even though old age was not recognized by statute law as sufficient cause to quality

for a pension until 1907, the Pension Bureau instructed the examining surgeons in 1890 to grant

a minimum pension to all men at least 65 years of age unless they were unusually vigorous.

           Copious records were generated by the Union Army pension program. Pension appli-

cations included detailed medical examinations both for men whose pension application or bid

for a pension increase was rejected and for men whose applications were accepted. These records

are currently being collected and linked to the 1900 and 1910 censuses and to military service

records. The 1900 and 1910 censuses provide occupational information and the military service

records information on stress at young adult ages such as prisoner of war status, whether the

soldier was ever discharged for disability, and such illnesses as measles, diarrhea, tuberculosis,

typhoid, rheumatism, acute respiratory infections (e.g. pneumonia, bronchitis), malaria, and war

injuries. Infant mortality rates in county of enlistment are available from the 1850 United States

Census of Mortality and from the 1855 New York State Census of Mortality.5

           The records used in this paper represent a 49 percent sample of the final sample that

will be available and consist of men in 45 Ohio companies, 51 New York Companies, 37 Illinois

Companies, and 28 Pennsylvania companies. The sample is restricted to native-born men linked

to the 1900 census and aged 50 to 64 in 1900.6 About 10 percent of these men were not yet

collecting a pension in 1900, either because their applications had been rejected or because they

had not yet applied for a pension. A surgeons’ exam is available for 93 percent of all men who

had a pension in 1900. Men for whom a surgeons’ exam is missing tended to be men who entered


   5
    The mortality rates are from Fogel (1998) and New York State (1857). They are self-reported and are therefore
biased downwards. However, the bias is unlikely to differ markedly across counties.
    6
      These restrictions were made to ensure the availability of occupational information for all men circa 1900 and
the availability of epidemiological information on the county they were raised in. Observable characteristics do not
predict linkage to the 1900 census.


                                                         8
at a late age and received a pension on the basis of age. Although I assume that these men did not

have the specific chronic condition that I examine, the results are virtually identical when these

men are omitted from the sample.

           Men who entered the Union Army were probably healthier than the population as a

whole. An examination of men who were rejected for military service suggests that mean height

for the population was about 0.18 inches less than the mean of the recruits. Once men entered

the service, rural farmers, who were the better nourished segment of society, were more likely to

die because they lacked immunities to such common camp diseases as measles and typhoid (Lee

1997). However, men who survived the war (regardless of occupation) were only 0.02 inches

shorter than all recruits at enlistment, suggesting that the war itself induced minimal survivorship

selection on the basis of height and hence on early net nutritional status. Increased exposure to

disease probably left men in worse health than when they entered the army, but by age 50 even

men who had grown up in rural areas and had not served had probably been exposed to as many

infectious diseases as veterans because of increased migration.7 Several tests indicate that this

sample is representative of the general population in terms of mortality experience and wealth.8

           The records of the examining surgeons give height, weight, pulse rate, respiration, and

temperature at every examination. The physicians also noted general appearance, including gait

and ability to walk. The examining surgeons described each condition and if a surgeon ever

noted a respiratory, heart, or musculoskeletal condition, this detailed information is used in the


    7
      For example, malaria increased in the north following the Civil War even among women, probably because
of the return of large numbers of soldiers who had been infected with the plasmodium while serving in the south
(Akernecht 1945; Boyd 1941).
   8
     Among all adult males age 20 and over in the households to which recruits were linked in the 1860 census,
mean wealth was similar to that found in a random sample. Cohort life expectancies of veterans who reached age 60
between 1901 and 1910 resemble the cohort life expectancies found in genealogies and the distribution of deaths from
specific causes for all veterans who died between 1905 and 1915 does not differ significantly from the distribution
of expected number of deaths from those causes in the death registration states in 1910 (Costa 1998: 197-212).




                                                         9
analysis. Thus for heart disease the physician described pulse rate characteristics; whether a

murmur was present and its timing, type, and location and which valves were involved; whether

the murmur was accompanied by a thrill; whether there was enlargement, oedema, cyanosis,

dyspnoea, atherosclerosis, or impaired circulation. Respiratory examinations included reports

of respiratory sounds such as murmurs, rales, crepitus, vocal fremitus, and ronchae and reports

of decreased breath. Descriptions of rheumatism included where the rheumatism was located

and whether pain, tenderness, swelling, or crepitation was associated with the joint. Because

the surgeons did not base their diagnoses upon a recruit’s wartime experiences the correlation

between illness while in the army and a chronic condition at later ages is unlikely to be spurious.9

Disease rates are based upon an examining surgeon ever having noted a condition.10 Prevalence

rates for 1910 may be underestimated because men who qualified for a pension on the basis of

age alone, as many did in 1910, have fewer surgeons’ exams than their counterparts who qualified

on the basis of health.

           The Union Army data are compared with random samples of the non-institutionalized,

white population drawn from the 1959 to 1962 National Health Examination Survey and the

1971-1975, 1976-1980, and 1988-1994 National Health and Nutritional Examination Surveys.11

These surveys included medical exams, which, while not strictly comparable across all years, yield

diagnoses that can be compared with those of physicians working under contract from the Pension

Bureau. The symptoms and conditions that I examine did not require any diagnostic equipment


    9
      The same correlations between chronic disease at older ages and illness while in the army are found for men
who claimed that their disabilities were traceable to the war and for men who did not make this claim. Unfortunately
the sample of men who had been examined and whose claim for a pension was rejected was too small to be used in
an analysis.
  10
    I assume that a veteran has a condition unless an examining surgeon specifically states that he does not or gives
him either a disease specific rating of zero or a total rating of zero.
  11
     The bias introduced from an examination of non-institutionalized men only should be small. In 1900 institu-
tionalization rates for men older than 64 were just under 3 percent and by 1990 were just under 4 percent. Increases
in institutionalization rates for women were much higher (Costa 1998: 113).

that was unavailable to late nineteenth century physicians. These symptoms and conditions are

valvular heart disease (murmurs involving the mitral and aortal valves); congestive heart failure

(contemporaneous occurrence of oedema, cyanosis, and dyspnoea); atherosclerosis (detected by

feeling whether the arteries had hardened); irregular pulse; adventitious sounds (murmurs, rales,

crepitus, vocal fremitus, and ronchae) or decreased breath; dullness of chest on percussion; joint

problems; and back problems.



3 Trends

Table 1 gives prevalence rates for Union Army veterans aged 50-64 in 1900 and for the same

men aged 65-74 10 years later and point prevalence rates for white men in the same age groups

in recent health surveys. The prevalence of respiratory conditions fell by 67 to 71 percent, and

would have fallen by more if not for the increase in smoking. The prevalence of irregular pulse

rates, murmurs, and valvular heart disease fell by 90 percent and of atherosclerosis by 53 to 72

percent. Joint and back problems declined by 20 to 44 percent. The prevalence of respiratory

conditions and atherosclerosis increased more sharply with age at the beginning of the century

than it does today.

          How reliable are these estimates of declines in prevalence rates? Certainly part of

the decline in irregular pulse rates and murmurs may reflect the more careful examinations of

surgeons accustomed to direct observation. Furthermore, cumulative prevalence rates calculated

from the Union Army sample are not strictly comparable to the point prevalence rates estimated

from recent surveys both because a condition would be more likely to be noticed in multiple

examinations and because men would be more likely to develop a condition between the time of

the last exam and either 1900 or 1910. However, if the latter is true then prevalence rates in the

Union Army sample will be underestimated, but even if the former were true, it seems unlikely

  Note. See the discussion in the text on the comparability of prevalence rates between 1900/1910 and later
  years. Prevalence rates for 1900/1910 are for atherosclerosis and for 1971-1980 for arteriosclerosis. All
  prevalence rates are weighted by the age distribution in 1900/1910. Prevalence rates are calculated from the
  Union Army data, the 1959-1962 National Health Examination Survey, and the 1971-1975, 1976-1980, and
  1988-1994 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys. Questions on arthritis are not comparable
  across all years. In 1971-1975 and 1976-1980 physicians were asked to note tenderness, swelling, deformity,
  and pain on motion in the shoulder, elbow, wrist, metacarpophalangeal, proximal interphalangeal, and distal
  interphalangeal joints, ankle, feet, knees, and hips. In 1988-1994 the examiners were instructed to report only
  on the wrist, each finger of the hand, the toes, and the knee for those older than 59. This procedure appears
  to have increased overall finding rates.

that such a large decline in prevalence rates could be explained by definitional biases alone. Thus

while the estimated prevalence rates may not be precise indicators of true prevalence rates, it is

still probably true that the prevalence rates in the Union Army sample were much higher than

they are today.

             The high prevalence rates for joint and back problems are confirmed by analyses of

skeletal remains. For example, Larsen et al. (1995) report that in a mid-nineteenth century frontier

cemetery in the Midwest 8 out of 11 adult skeletons exhibited one or more skeletal pathologies

relating to general activity, including degenerative joint disease (osteoarthritis), nonarthritic joint

changes resulting from habitual postures, and fractures arising from traumas.

             The declining disease rates seen in Table 1 are readily reconciled with changes in cause

of death patterns observed during epidemiological transitions. Cause of death information may

simply be a poor indicator of morbidity rates in a regime in which infectious diseases are dominant.

Fifty-two percent of Union Army veterans aged 50 to 64 in 1900 with valvular heart disease died

of heart disease, as did 52 percent of those with an arrhythmia and 56 percent of those with

atherosclerosis. In contrast, 67 percent of men of the same age with valvular heart disease in the

1971-1975 survey died of heart disease, 69 percent of those with an arrhythmia, and 75 percent

of those with atherosclerosis. Had 9 percent of Union Army veterans not died from pneumonia,

bronchitis, and influenza, 4 percent from infectious disease, and 13 percent from genito-urinary

disorders, cause of death patterns may well have been more similar to those observed today.12


  12
       Men who died during the influenza epidemic were excluded from these numbers.

4 Determinants of Chronic Conditions

I estimate the impact of early and late life stress on chronic conditions among native-born Union

Army veterans aged 50 to 64 in 1900 and 60 to 74 in 1910 by a series of probit equations in which

the dependent variables are equal to one if the veteran had one of the following specific chronic

conditions: decreased breath or adventitious sounds; dullness of chest upon percussion; joint

problems; back problems; valvular heart disease; congestive heart failure; and atherosclerosis.13

The typical probit equation that is then estimated is


                              P rob(I   =   1) = P rob( < X       0
                                                                       )=   Φ(X   0
                                                                                      )



where I   =   1 if a veteran had the specific chronic condition, Φ() is a standard normal cumulative

distribution function, and X is a vector of control variables.14 The effect of a unit change in one

of the independent variables on the probability of having a given chronic condition is given by the

partial derivative of the probit function P with respect to that independent variable. For example,

if the dependent variable were whether a veteran had decreased breath or adventitious sounds
              @P
a value of    @x   of 0.096 for wartime respiratory infection implies that having had a respiratory

infection during the war increases the probability of decreased breath or adventitious sounds by

0.096.

            The control variables are derived from the 1900 census, the pension records, and the

military service records. They consist of variables proxying for environmental stress prior to


  13
     I also investigated the use of alternative specifications. In particular, I conditioned on all man who were examined
in a given year and did not have a specific condition and investigated what determined the probability of developing
that specific chronic disease by a given year. This did not yield materially different point estimates. However, the
sample size was much smaller and the standard errors much larger.
  14
     I use a probit rather a logit model because the logistic distribution tends to give larger probabilities to y = 0
when 0 x is extremely small (and larger probabilities to y = 0 when 0 x is very large). However, probit, logit, and
linear probability models yielded similar results.


                                                          14
joining the army such as dummy variables indicating size of city of enlistment and whether

the infant mortality rate in county of enlistment was high.15 They also consist of such dummy

variables as whether the veteran ever suffered from measles, typhoid fever, diarrhea, tuberculosis,

acute respiratory infections (e.g. pneumonia, bronchitis), malaria, and rheumatism while in the

army.16 Very few men are specifically identified as having suffered from rheumatic fever while

in the army, so rheumatism while in the army may be indicative of either an underlying chronic

condition, traumatic arthritis, or of a viral infection accompanied by rheumatic symptoms. The

reports submitted by camp doctors to the Surgeon General distinguish between acute and chronic

rheumatism and these suggest that 40 percent of all cases of rheumatism were acute and were

mainly caused by rheumatic fever. However some of the chronic cases may have been prolonged

acute rheumatic fever (Bollet 1991). Other measures of stress while in the army are whether the

veteran was ever injured, was ever discharged for disability, or was ever a prisoner of war.

            Several potential biases are likely to be introduced from the use of wartime measures

of stress. Infectious diseases acquired in the army may have been more severe than those

acquired in civilian life (because repeated rapid passage increased the virulence of infectious

agents). Contemporary observors noted that measles among Civil War troops was a much severer

infection than that witnessed in the civilian population (Cliff, Haggett, Smallman-Raynor 1993:

106). However, if survival rates among Civil War soldiers with infectious diseases were lower


  15
     A dummy variable rather than a continuous variable for infant mortality fit the specification better, perhaps
because the measure is noisy. Infant mortality rates tended to be highest in urban areas and in areas along the Ohio
River. About 19 percent of infant deaths were from infectious and parasitic diseases, 14 percent from respiratory
diseases, 17 percent from such symptoms and ill-defined conditions as fever, and 26 percent were uncodable. The
regressions that I present do not include height at enlistment as a coefficient, largely because sample size would fall
sharply if I were to restrict the sample to men beyond their growing years. When I included height as an explanatory
variable in the regressions, in most cases height was a small and insignificant predictor of chronic disease. However,
height was a positive, but small, and significant predictor of back problems, dullness of chest, and irregular pulse.
  16
    Interaction effects between disease dummies are not reported because the coefficients on these interaction terms
were small and insignificant.




                                                         15
than in the civilian population, the impact of infectious disease on older age chronic disease rates

will be underestimated.17 Furthermore, the effect of infectious disease will be underestimated

because many men undoubtedly had experienced infectious disease either before they entered

the army or after they left it.18 If men who caught infectious diseases while in the army were

inherently frailer (an unlikely supposition given the rates of exposure in army camps), then I will

be overestimating the impact of infectious disease on later morbidity. However, because I am

observing survivors, and therefore perhaps the hardiest men, this may lead to me to underestimate

the effect of infectious disease. A different type of bias is likely to arise in the case of the war

injured. Men who were injured in the war tended to be taller (suggesting better net nutritional

status during their growing years) and they also tended to be from urban areas (suggesting that

they had been exposed to many infectious diseases already). Despite their longer years of army

service, they were less likely to develop tuberculosis, a disease likely to strike those of poor net

nutritional status. If men who had been injured in the war were initially healthier and remained

healthier because they had been exposed to milder forms of infectious disease rather than the

severe camp forms, then being injured in the war might well be a negative predictor of chronic

disease.

           Additional control variables are occupation at enlistment and occupation circa 1900

(derived from the 1900 census for men in the labor force and from the pension records for

men out of the labor force) which proxy for socioeconomic status at younger and at older ages,

respectively. Occupations are grouped into professional or proprietor, farmer, artisan, and laborer.

Size of city of residence in 1900 proxies for exposure to infectious disease at older ages. Because


  17
     The findings will also underestimate the impact of infectious disease in a modern population in which survival
rates of men with infectious disease are higher.
  18
     For example, malaria was the United States disease of the late nineteenth century, prevalent throughout the
Mississippi Valley and as far up as Canada (Kiple 1993: 526).




                                                       16
mid-size cities had not yet initiated sanitary reforms whereas large cities had, exposure to disease

in mid-size cities should be greater (Preston and Haines 1991: 98). State of enlistment, age,

marital status, state of enlistment dummies, and regiment dummies, are also control variables.

These two sets of dummy variables are included to control for omitted state characteristics and

such omitted regimental experiences as battlefield stress. However, because regiments were

drawn from the same geographic areas, regiment fixed effects may reflect county of enlistment

fixed effects.

          The marginal effects for probits for respiratory conditions for 1900 and 1910 are given

in Tables 2 and 3. For both dullness of chest and decreased breath or adventitious sounds statis-

tically significant positive predictors in all four regressions were an acute respiratory condition,

tuberculosis, and measles while in the army. The impact of these infectious diseases was substan-

tial; having had just one of these diseases raised the probability of respiratory problems by about

0.1. Syphilis while in the army was a statistically significant and substantial positive predictor

of these two chronic symptoms as well. A high infant mortality rate in county of enlistment

increased the probability of dullness of chest in 1900 by 0.04 when regiment fixed effects are

excluded from the regression, and, when state of enlistment fixed effects were excluded as well,

was a significant, positive predictor of decreased breath or adventitious sounds.

          Men who had been farmers and laborers at enlistment were more likely to suffer from

respiratory difficulties both in 1900 and in 1910. By 1910 men who had been artisans and laborers

in 1900 were more likely to exhibit decreased breath or adventitious sounds. Artisans who were

millers, carpenters, and painters, all occupations with exposure to dust and fumes, had higher rates

of respiratory disorders than artisans who were blacksmiths, machinists, or coopers. Prevalence

rates for dullness of chest would have been 31 percent lower in 1900 and 57 percent lower in 1910

if the occupational distribution circa 1900 had been that of older men in 1990 and the occupational

distribution at enlistment had been that of younger men in 1940. Prevalence rates for decreased

breath and adventitious sounds would have been 21 percent lower in 1900 and 12 percent lower

in 1910, thus accounting for 31 percent of the decline in decreased breath or adventitious sounds

among men aged 50 to 64 and 18 percent of the decline among men aged 60 to 74.

          Marginal effects for probits for valvular heart disease and irregular pulse in 1900 are

given in Tables 4 and 5. Measles, typhoid fever, and rheumatism while in the army increased the

probability of valvular heart disease by about 0.08 in 1900 and 0.10 in 1910. Rheumatism while

in the army increased the probability of an irregular pulse by 0.1 both in 1900 and in 1910; typhoid

fever increased the probability by 0.06 in 1900 and 0.11 in 1910; acute respiratory infection by

0.05 in 1900 and 0.09 in 1910; tuberculosis by 0.14 in 1910; and measles by 0.09 in 1910. Men

who enlisted in cities with populations below 25,000 were less likely to have developed valvular

heart disease in 1900, but not in 1910. When state of enlistment fixed effects are omitted from

the regressions, infant mortality in county of enlistment becomes a significant predictor of an

irregular pulse.

          Table 6 presents marginal effects for probits for congestive heart failure and for

atherosclerosis in 1910. (These conditions are not examined in 1900 because so few men had

them.) Only rheumatism while in the army was a statistically significant predictor of congestive

heart failure, consistent with the findings of Wilson et al. (1998) that in the Civil War cohort

valvular heart disease (which is predicted by rheumatism) preceded congestive heart failure over

60 percent of the time. Infant mortality in county of enlistment and diarrhea and measles while

in the army were significant positive predictors of atherosclerosis.

          Tables 7 and 8 show the marginal effects for probits for joint and back problems in 1900

and in 1910. Rheumatism while in the army is a strong predictor of joint problems, increasing

the probability of a joint problem in 1900 by 0.24 and in 1910 by 0.20. Rheumatism while in

the army also predicts back problems both in 1900 and in 1910, increasing their probability by

about 0.14. Another predictor of joint problems was malaria, which increased the probability of

joint problems in 1900 by 0.15 and in 1910 by 0.12. This malaria was not recurrent. Relatively

few men had recurring infectious disease acquired during their service and those who did were

no more likely to have joint problems than those who did not.

          Occupation was an important predictor of both joint and back problems. For men in

such manual occupations as farmer, artisan, or laborer circa 1900 the probability of having a joint

problem relative to a professional or proprietor increased by 0.06 to 0.08 and of having a back

problem by 0.09 to 0.13. Men who had been laborers when they enlisted were particularly likely

to have joint and back problems; the probability of these conditions increased by 0.11. If the

occupational distribution circa 1900 had been that for older men in 1990 and the occupational

distribution at enlistment had been that for younger men in 1940, the probability of joint problems

would have been 9 percent lower in 1900 and 6 percent lower in 1910 and the probability of back

problems 20 percent lower in 1900 and 15 percent lower in 1910. Changes in the occupational

distribution alone therefore could explain 13 to 18 percent of the difference in prevalence rates

for joint problems between Union Army veterans and men in 1971-1980 and over 75 percent of

the difference in back problems.

          Men who had been discharged for disability were significantly less likely to have

developed joint problems and those who had been injured during the war to have developed back

problems. The latter were also less likely to have either valvular heart disease or an arrhythmia and

in two of the respiratory problem probits were significantly more likely not to have a respiratory

disorder at older ages. The inverse correlation between a war injury and morbidity is found both

among men who could trace their disabilities to the war and those who could not and among men

judged to have pensionable wounds by the examining surgeons and those who did not, suggesting

that the correlation does not arise from the rules of the pension program. Recall that men who

were injured in the war were initially healthier and may have remained healthier because they had

been exposed to milder forms of infectious disease rather than the more severe camp forms. A

Note. “Actual” probabilities were derived by using the previous probits to predict a prevalence rate for each individual
and then summing over all individuals. All other probabilities used the same procedure, but set the value of dummy
variables for infectious disease equal to zero.



war injury may therefore proxy for lower frailty, though I cannot rule out that men who survived

their war injuries were less likely to be genetically susceptible to disease.

           Table 9 summarizes the impact of infectious disease on chronic disease rates. It shows

that if no men had had respiratory infections while in the army the prevalence of decreased breath

and adventitious sounds would have been 4 to 5 percent lower and that of dullness of chest 10

to 11 percent lower; that if no men had had rheumatism while in the army the prevalence rate of

valvular heart disease would have been 4 to 5 percent lower, that of arrhythmias 3 to 4 percent


                                                         27
lower, and that of congestive heart failure 16 percent lower; that if no men had had malaria while

in the army the prevalence rate of joint problems would have been 1 percent lower; and, that if no

men had had measles while in the army the prevalence rate for valvular heart disease would have

been 2 to 3 percent lower, that for decreased breath or adventitious sounds 3 to 4 percent lower,

and that for dullness of chest 8 to 10 percent lower. If no men had had any infectious diseases

while in the army the prevalence rates for dullness of chest would have been 16 to 19 percent

lower, for decreased breath or adventitious sounds 9 to 14 percent lower, for arrhythmias 11 to

12 percent lower, for valvular heart disease 10 to 11 percent lower, for atherosclerosis 18 percent

lower, for congestive heart failure 20 percent lower, for joint problems 6 percent lower, and for

back problems 6 to 8 percent lower. Infectious disease therefore accounts for up to 19 percent of

the difference in chronic disease rates between 1900/1910 and recent surveys for decreased breath

or adventitious sounds and at least 13 percent of the difference for arrhythmias, 11 percent of the

difference for valvular disease, 24 percent of the difference for atherosclerosis, 13 percent of the

difference for joint problems, and 31 percent of the difference for back problems (see Table 10).

          Table 9 probably underestimates the impact of lifetime exposure to infectious disease

on chronic disease rates for the population as whole. Although prevalence rates for Union Army

veterans were probably similar to those for the population as a whole (veterans may have had

greater exposure to infectious disease, but were initially healthier), because illnesses are not

observed for men both prior to and after their army service, the coefficient on infectious disease

may be biased toward zero and the incidence rate for infectious disease will be too low. For

example, a 1928-1931 health survey shows that 12 percent of men and women aged 55 to 64 and

11 percent of those older than 64 had a history of typhoid fever (Collins 1937). In contrast, only

7 percent of Union Army veterans are known to have ever had typhoid. Assuming that at least 12

percent of men had had a history of typhoid in 1900 and in 1910, then the elimination of typhoid

fever alone would have lowered prevalence rates for valvular heart disease by at least 5 percent

and for irregular pulse by 3 percent. If the proportion of older men with a history of typhoid

fever declined by 83 percent between 1900 and 1910 and the 1970s, then at least 5 percent of the

decline in valvular heart disease can be attributed to declines in typhoid fever.19 In contrast, the

elimination of wartime typhoid could explain only 3 percent of the difference in valvular heart

disease between Union Army veterans and modern populations.



5 Disability and Chronic Disease

This paper has emphasized that chronic disease rates in the past were extremely high and that

this was in part caused by occupational hazards and in part by the high incidence of infectious

disease. This section examines whether conditional on having a chronic disease disability rates

are now lower or higher than they were in the past. My two measures of disability are subsequent

mortality and difficulty in walking.

           I compare the mortality experience of Union Army veterans with that of white men

in the 1971-1975 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Because men in the latter

survey are still being followed up, I restrict my observation period to ten years and examine mean

years lived within this ten year interval. I also present the uncensored means for Union Army

veterans (see Table 11).20

           Table 11 shows that although mean length of life in a ten year interval was higher

overall among men examined in 1971-1975 than among Union Army veterans, mean length of

life has not improved for men with specific chronic conditions. Wilson et al. (1998) find that


  19
     Allowing for a modest increase in typhoid fever history with age, the numbers in Collins (1937) imply that at
most 2 percent of the men in the first National health and Examination Surveys had had typhoid fever.
  20
    The NHANES sample is too small to examine disease interactions. I do not control for wartime experiences
among Union Army veterans because once I control for chronic conditions these were not statistically significant
predictors of subsequent mortality.

Note. Among men aged 50 to 64 only the difference in mean years lived between the Union Army sample and 1971-
1975 survey for the whole sample is statistically significant. Among men aged 60 to 74 the difference is statistically
significant only for the whole sample and for men with joint problems.

survival rates for congestive heart failure in the Union Army sample are similar to those in the

1971-1975 survey when patient history is used to determine prevalence of congestive heart failure

in the latter survey. These results do not necessarily imply that we have made little progress in

treatment. Men with specific chronic conditions in 1971-1975 may have had a much more severe

form of the chronic condition than Union Army veterans either because prevention efforts have

lowered incidence among men who would have gotten a less severe form of the disease or because

increased medical efficacy may be keeping alive men who in the past would have died before

being examined.

           Although life expectancy has not improved for men with specific chronic diseases,

the quality of life consequences of having a given chronic condition may now be less severe.

Anti-inflammatory drugs provide for improved control or alleviation of arthritis. Symptomatic

therapies can now be directed against reversible elements of obstructic airflow. Valve replacement

is common when severe stenosis accompanies valvular heart disease. Digitalis, diuretics, and

vasodilators are used to control aortic regurgitation and anti-arrhythmic drugs to control arrhyth-

mias. The Union Army records provide one measure of the activities of daily living that can be

compared with recent data to assess long-run changes in functioning – ability to walk.

           Union Army physicians noted gait abnormalities (“limps,” “lame,” “crippled,” “drags

leg”, “use left leg difficult”) and whether a veteran could not walk (“cannot stand”) and I use

these descriptions to construct a variable indicating whether the veteran had difficulty walking.

Because I only know whether a veteran had difficulty in walking and whether he had a specific

chronic disease from the surgeons’ exams, I restrict my sample to men with surgeons’ exams.21 A

probit in which the dependent variable was equal to one if the veteran had difficulty walking and

in which I control for early life conditions shows that a back problem increased the probability of


  21
     Because relatively few men did not have surgeons’ exams, I obtain similar results when I drop this sample
restriction.

walking difficulties by 0.15 in 1900 among men aged 50 to 64 and by 0.18 in 1910 among men

aged 60 to 74; a joint problem by 0.12 percent both in 1900 and in 1910; congestive heart failure

and atherosclerosis by 0.10 percent both in 1900 and in 1910; an irregular pulse by 0.04 in 1900

and 0.09 in 1910; and decreased breath or adventitious sounds by 0.04 in 1900 and 0.08 in 1910.

Controlling for adult chronic conditions, malaria, rheumatism, an injury while in the army, and a

discharge for disability were strong, positive predictors of difficulty walking.

          The examiners in the 1988-1994 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey

also noted gait abnormalities and I used this variable together with variables indicating whether

the individual was in a wheelchair or stretcher, whether he had paralysis or paresis of the leg,

and whether he was an amputee or had a cast on his leg to construct a measure of difficulty in

walking comparable to that used for Union Army veterans. Controlling for age and whether an

individual had a joint problem, a heart murmur, an arrhythmia, and a respiratory problem, a probit

reveals that a joint problem increased the probability of walking difficulties by 0.19 among men

aged 60 to 74 in the 1988-1994 survey and respiratory difficulties by 0.12. Heart murmurs and

arrhythmias were not statistically significant predictors of walking difficulties. In contrast, when

I run a similar specification among Union Army veterans in 1910 but with additional controls for

war injury and having been discharged for disability, a joint problem increased the probability of

walking difficulties by 0.20, murmurs by 0.06, and respiratory difficulties by 0.07.

          Table 12 presents predicted probabilities of difficulty walking for men with joint prob-

lems, decreased breath or adventitious sounds, murmurs, and arrhythmias. These probabilities

are derived from a probit regression of difficulty walking on age, whether an individual had a

joint problem, a respiratory difficulty, a murmur, or an arrhythmia. For Union Army veterans I

control for whether a veteran had a war injury or was ever discharged for disability and evaluate

probabilities setting the values of these variables to zero. These predicted probabilities show that

overall men’s probability of difficulty in walking has fallen by 18 to 54 percent (depending upon

Note. The probabilities are predicted from probits of the difficulty of walking on joint problems, decreased breath or
adventitious sounds, murmurs, and arrhythmias. The 1910 probit also includes controls for whether a veteran was
injured in the war and whether he was discharged for disability. The probabilities are evaluated with the values of
these variables set equal to 0. Note that men with “none of the previous conditions” might still have other chronic
conditions.



age) or about 0.3 to 0.7 percent per annum. These estimates of declines in disability are somewhat

lower than the decline of 0.5 to 1 percent between 1980 and 1990 found by Cutler and Richardson

(forthcoming) and are lower than the decline of over 1 percent per year found by Manton et al.

(1997) between 1982 and 1994. Table 12 also shows that conditional on having a specific chronic

condition, disability has fallen. Although the improvement in health has not been as great for men

with joint problems and respiratory problems as it has for men overall or for men with murmurs

and arrhythmias, nonetheless Table 12 suggests that quality of life has improved both overall and

for men with chronic conditions.



6 Implications

This paper has shown that the shift from manual to white collar occupations and reduced exposure

to infectious disease were important determinants of declines in chronic disease rates among


                                                        34
older men, declines that were on the order of 70 percent for respiratory conditions, 90 percent

for irregular pulse rates, murmurs, and valvular heart disease, 60 percent for atherosclerosis, and

30 percent for joint and back problems between 1900 and 1910 and the 1970s. Occupational

shifts accounted for 13 to 18 percent of the decline in joint problems since the early 1900s, over

75 percent of the decline in back problems, and 18 to 31 percent of the decline in respiratory

difficulties. Acute respiratory infections while in the army increased the probability of chronic

respiratory problems and arrhythmias at older ages; measles of chronic respiratory problems and

of valvular heart disease; typhoid fever of valvular heart disease and irregular pulse; tuberculosis

of chronic respiratory problems; rheumatic fever or post-rheumatic athropathies of valvular heart

disease, arrhythmias, congestive heart failure, joint problems, and back problems; diarrhea of

atherosclerosis; and malaria of joint problems. A high infant mortality rate in area of enlistment,

a proxy for exposure prior to army service, increased the probability of respiratory problems and

atherosclerosis. The infections likely to have the larger impact on chronic disease rates (rheumatic

fever or post-rheumatic athropathies on joint problems and tuberculosis on respiratory difficulties)

did have the larger effect.

          Although some of the relationships between early life conditions and later morbidity

outcomes were expected from a reading of the medical literature, the links between some of these

conditions, such as malaria and subsequent joint problems, are not well-established and therefore

represent new findings. Nor has the impact of occupational shifts and of reduced exposure to

infectious disease on the long-term decline in chronic disease rates previously been quantified.

The results of this paper imply that reduced exposure to infectious disease explains at least 10 to

25 percent of the decline in chronic disease rates among older men since the early 1900s.

          The paper also showed that the burden of chronic disease was high in the past not just

because prevalence rates were high but also because the duration of chronic disease was long

and chronic disease was disabling. Men aged 50 to 64 in 1900 lived an additional 16 years.


                                                35
Conditional on having a chronic condition, life expectancy was as high as for men in the same age

group in the 1970s, perhaps because men with a given chronic disease now have a more severe

form of that condition. However, conditional on having a chronic condition, the probability that

an older man would have difficulty in walking has fallen. By this measure disability for the total

population has fallen by 0.3 to 0.7 percent per year since the early 1900s.

          The sizable impact of infectious disease on chronic disease rates suggests that the link

between infectious and chronic disease may be much closer than that postulated by theories of

the epidemiological transition and that chronic diseases should not necessarily be thought of

as part of the natural process of aging. It also suggests that such public health investments as

water filtration, vaccination, and sewage systems could considerably improve elderly health in

developing countries by lowering infectious disease rates. The rate of return on these investments

may therefore be underestimated by analyses that take only infectious disease mortality into

account. These public health investments had been carried out in the United States by the 1930s

and childhood and infectious disease mortality fell throughout the first half of the century. The

full impact of these improvements, and of the continued shift towards white collar work and the

mechanization of tasks, may not be seen until 2035 or later, when the baby boomers will begin

to reach age 90. These potential increases in health and in longevity represent impressive gains

in the standard of living, but may aggravate the financing crisis in Social Security pension and

health care costs. Although healthier people may decide to work longer, retirement rates have

been rising throughout the century despite improvements in health (Costa 1998). Healthier people

need less medical care, but innovations in medical care, while improving outcomes for ill patients

and improving them by more than per person spending on medical care has risen, have increased

costs (Cutler, McClellan, and Newhouse 1998; Cutler and Richardson, forthcoming). Assessing

how effective proposals to resolve the financing crisis are likely to be will require us to draw upon

both the demographic and economic evidence.
