                                                ABSTRACT

This paper reports estimates of consumers' preferences for plans to improve food safety. The plans
are distinguished based on whether they address the ex ante risk of food borne illness or the ex post
effects of the illness. They are also distinguished based on whether they focus on a public good -- reducing
risk of illness for all consumers or allowing individual households to reduce their private risks of contracting
a food borne pathogen. Based on a National Survey conducted in 2007 using the Knowledge Network
internet panel our findings indicate consumers favor ex ante risk reductions and are willing to pay
approximately $250 annually to reduce the risk of food borne illness. Moreover, they prefer private
to public approaches and would not support efforts to reduce the severity of cases of illness over risk
reductions.

I.      Introduction

        Popular descriptions of the U.S. food safety system generally suggest it is “broken.”1 Following

the recent outbreak of salmonella attributed to tomatoes and more recently various types of jalapeno

peppers, the Secretary of Health and Human Services announced a new budget request that would

accelerate the implementation of joint strategies for improving food safety outlined in November 2007

as part of the Food Protection Plan and the Action Plan for Import Safety2. This latest increase would

boost the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) budget by 17.8% (from FY2008), adding new inspectors

as well as efforts to assure compliance with FDA requirements for high risk foreign and domestic food

sources.3 Any public initiative of this sort is composed of a set of new rules and expenditures seeking to

meet specific objectives, in this case improvements in food safety. However, there are no guarantees.

The policies are best treated as plans to enhance food safety not assured improvements.

        This paper reports the results of a national survey that evaluates what consumers would select if

they had the opportunity to vote for one of three “plans” to improve food safety. Two of the three plans

reduce the risk of food borne illness and one focuses on the severity of each case of illness. The three

plans were : (1) to expand the current FDA inspection system (i.e. the one in existence before the 2007

plans), (2) to offer a product allowing households to test for pathogens on food,and thus avoid using

contaminated foods or (3) to provide a medicine to reduce the severity of food borne illnesses.

        In general, respondents to the survey conducted between the end of August and September,

2007, have an annual willingness to pay of approximately $250 for either the plan to increase FDA

inspectors or the one offering a test kit for pathogens on food that households can purchase at a

subsidized price.4 Both of these alternatives seek to reduce the risk of food borne illness. One is a public

good in the sense that all consumers experience the risk reduction and the other is a private approach

to reduce risk, relying on households purchasing and using the test kit to detect pathogens. The

estimated economic values for these two alternatives are not significantly different. However, if we

consider the added cost of purchasing the private test kits, in addition to the increase in income taxes to

support either initiative, (using the average annual expenditures) households have a significantly higher

economic value for the private alternative offering the home test kit for food borne pathogens. In

addition our results clearly suggest consumers favor an ex ante focus on risk reduction; valuations for

(http://www.hhs.gov/news/press/2008pres/06) the details of the plan were outlined. The specific focus was to
improve import safety with 1,000 more proposed foreign inspections of food and medical product facilities and
1,000 more domestic inspections. Other steps include: accrediting trusted sources and allowing them expedited
entry, modernizing information infrastructure, and introducing preventive controls for high risk foods.

  The estimates for the marginal willingness to pay are derived using a sample restricted to include respondents
who understood the graphical presentation of risk and who responded with a 5 or greater that on a scale of 1 to 10

Table 5 below.

both the public plan for increased inspection and the plan for home testing dominate the value of the

proposed ex post strategy of medication to reduce the severity of cases of food borne illnesses at a

subsidized price.

        Our research design, findings, and their implications are presented in the next three sections.

Section II begins with a discussion of the recent gloomy prognosis offered by Shogren and Stamlund

[2007] for efforts to use consumers’ food selections to evaluate the tradeoffs they would make to

reduce risks of food borne illness. Their findings along with other recent research provide the

background for the design of our stated preference survey. In the second half of this section, we outline

the questions, experimental design, and survey format. In the third section, we discuss the estimates of

choice models for our proposed plans to enhance food safety. We report estimates for the marginal

willingness to pay for the plans and evaluate how the attributes of the plans and the characteristics of

the respondents influence their choices. The last section summarizes our conclusions and discusses

their implications for the current debate about how to enhance the security of the U.S. food supply.



II.     Evaluating Food Safety Policies: Context, Model, and Conjoint Survey

A.      Context

        The Shogren and Stamland (2007) analysis is part of a larger study these authors conducted

using the Knowledge Networks web panel. As part of one of the study, respondents were asked about

their health status, behavior related to food safety risk, and risk perceptions. In the analysis, they found

that measures of health status based on a variety of factual questions and measures of food safety

related behavior were internally consistent. The health indices were correlated with other health

measures and the indices of risk‐related behaviors were correlated with other risk behavior measures.

However, self‐reported behavior did not correlate well with measures of each respondent’s health

status. Second, personal risk perception measures were uncorrelated with other variables, such as
                                                                                                                        4


health status and risk behaviors. Finally, there was a correlation that the authors describe as “too high”

between risk reduction behaviors for preparing beef, pork, and chicken. That is, their survey

respondents described averting behaviors such as washing hands and utensils as effective in reducing

risks of foodborne illness for beef, pork, and chicken, yet there was no correlation between their actual

use of these behaviors and their reported perceptions of risks they face of food borne illness. Based on

the correlation patterns, Shogren and Stamland conclude that reported food preparation behaviors that

we would ordinarily assume were intended to reduce risks contain poor information about how people

perceive food safety risks and respond to them. Their relative judgment stems from the failure of the

respondents to satisfy the external consistency checks between these behaviors and different wordings

for similar decisions.

         During pre‐testing of our survey, we also found that focus group participants sometimes had

difficulties similar to what Shogren and Stamlund describe in “linking” personal behaviors to reductions

in their stated risk perceptions. The issues posed were not confined to food borne illness. The

participants explained the seeming contradictions between their willingness to take different actions

and their perceptions of risk with statements noting that their personal actions were likely to be

ineffective or that the issues we raised were problems that should be a public responsibility. When we

assigned the individuals with the property rights to high risk situations, they countered that the risks

were a public, not a private responsibility. In part, the results also reflect our failure to adequately

describe the proposed private actions in a way respondents were willing to accept or to explain how the

private actions were intended to work along with public actions to address each issue.

         The recent Hammitt and Haninger [2007] study estimating the value of reductions in illness and

mortality from food borne pathgens may face similar problems.5 Respondents were presented risk

  Without access to the specific text of their survey questionnaire, it is difficult to determine the level of detail used
in presenting the choice questions. Their paper was a short summary of the research findings. The authors do not
                                                                                                                 5


reductions produced by a stringent safety program that they were told did not use chemicals or

irradiation to accomplish this reduction. Their proposed public actions vary in the size of the reduction

in the probability of illness, the severity and duration of illness from food borne pathogens, the

conditional probability of mortality, and the type of food that is associated with the risks. The results

confirm a statistically significant and consistent relationship between choices made by the respondents

and the size of the risk reduction but indicate there was little response to either the severity or the

duration of typical cases of illness. Finally, the estimated willingness to pay in order to avoid statistical

cases of illness is approximately an order of magnitude greater than estimates from the primary earlier

study (by Hayes et. al. [1995]) for comparable risk changes. Moreover, Hammitt and Haninger’s

measures not only exceed the estimates from other studies but are dramatically larger (in real terms)

than estimates of unit values routinely used for most types of short term illnesses in environmental

benefit cost assessments.6

        There is a reasonably large literature suggesting that it is difficult to explain risk reductions in a

stated choice survey. The Shogren and Stamland results imply that the tangible nature of food

preparation as a part of most households everyday activities does not necessarily increase the feasibility

of measuring economic values for reductions in the risk of food borne illness. Our results suggest that

respondents need to be presented with choices that connect what is offered to them in the survey and

the change in risk or attributes of food in a tangible way. Saying risk reductions or health improvements

will take place doesn’t convince them. Describing the mechanism that accomplishes the changes may

but this needs to be evaluated within pretest activities. Thus, our results parallel the contingent


report the use of specific follow up questions to gauge whether respondents believed the outcomes would actually
be realized.
6
  For example the First Prospective Analysis conducted by EPA reports unit values for morbidity effects related to
air pollution ranging from $5.30 to $83 per day for respirator effects (at the low end) and work loss days at the
high end. Cases of emergency room visits are estimated to involve a $194 loss per case. Only hospital admissions
for cardiovascular cases approach the estimates reported by Hammitt and Haninger. The EPA estimates are in
1990 dollars. Even with adjustments for cost of living differences, most are dramatically lower than Hammitt and
Haninger’s results for food borne illness. See Table 6‐1 in U.S. Environmental Protection Agency [1999].
                                                                                                              6


valuation research undertaken for large natural resource damage assessments (see Carson et. al [2003].

In these cases what was offered to respondents was an intermediate action or what we have labeled a

“plan” to realize a change in an object of choice. Our conjoint survey expands this logic and offers

several different plans as choice alternatives. As with the earlier CV research there remains a challenge

in establishing connections between the plans and changes in the attributes or resources of interest (see

Smith [1997]).




B.      Model

        Based on this past experience our analysis was designed for a survey using a conjoint/discrete

choice framework with “labeled” choice alternatives. Each choice alternative is a specific plan to

address food safety by either reducing the risk of experiencing a food borne illness or the severity of a

case of food borne illness. The size of the risk change and reductions in severity vary across choice

alternatives as do their cost and (in the case of one type of plan) the time required to use the proposed

approach to reduce risk. However, the variation in these attributes is constrained to be consistent with

the logical structure of each plan. In the text describing each plan, we emphasize what the plan can and

cannot do. For example, a proposed medication taken at the first signs of the onset of a case of food

poisoning cannot reduce the risk of contracting the disease. The test kit and increased inspections do

not reduce the severity of the case, only the risk that the respondent contracts it. As a result, the plans

are not described by the same set of attributes.

        This approach is somewhat different than most applications of conjoint stated preference

methods where, as Holmes and Adamowicz [2003] suggest for environmental applications, the objective

is to estimate the values of “a technically divisible set of attributes of an environmental good.” As these
                                                                                                                   7


authors are careful to note, the logic maintains that commodities are demanded for their attributes and

people perceive the same attributes in about the same ways.7

         In this survey, we are interested in how respondents view a set of very different plans to address

the problem of food borne illness. Because the plans we developed do not have a single common set of

attributes, our strategy combines the approaches of contingent valuation studies and conjoint analysis.

Looking at the insights developed from debates in the early 1990s arising from the use of stated

preference surveys for damage assessments, the contingent valuation surveys that were widely

perceived to be successful, such as the 1991 study of the Exxon Valdez oil spill (see Carson and

Hanemann [2005]), presented the object of choice as a plan to avoid future damages.8 In a similar way,

we present plans to avoid future illnesses, but unlike a traditional contingent value survey the plans do

contain attributes and the attributes vary according to the experimental design strategy used in conjoint

surveys.

         A focus on plans implies the modeling of choices relies first on a simple discrete choice random

utility model specified in terms of the cost (money and where relevant time) and the alternative specific

constants for each plan. Our most detailed specification includes the varying risk and severity attributes

interacted with respondent characteristics.9 The effects of these attributes cannot be separately




7
  Describing goods and services by their attributes to estimate consumer preferences, as conjoint surveys do, relies
on several assumptions. The first, as noted in the text, is the association of the attribute vector with choice
alternatives. In practice consumers select commodities that differ in characteristics and cannot necessarily
repackage attributes any way they wish. A discrete set of alternative bundles are available.
     A second set of issues that arise in these models concerns how people perceive the attributes and whether
there is heterogeneity in the importance they place on different attributes. These issues arise in the specification
of mixed logit models. Since our framework offers 3 distinct plans to improve food safety that do not all contain
the same attributes, we have not considered these other important elements due to the perceptions and valuation
of individual attributes by different people. See Train [2003] for discussion of the econometric implications of
these assumptions.
8
  We do not formulate the model in expected utility terms because consumers are assumed to select plans on
bundles of risk reductions and other attributes. One plan, the medicine to reduce severity of illness, does not offer
an ex ante risk reduction from baseline conditions.
9
  We also include the inverse Mills terms in interaction form with the time stated as required for the plan to use
home tests to detect food borne pathogens.
                                                                                                                    8


estimated because the “plan consistency constraints” create collinearity between them and the

alternative specific constants. Moreover, a model based solely on attributes is misleading because

linear or even simple non‐linear specifications do not necessarily capture the constraints imposed in the

design.

          Equation (1) presents our simple model. We treat the risk of incurring food borne illness as an

attribute evaluated differently by different types of individuals.10




                                    Vij = v( yi − cij , a , a × Z i , A j × Z i ) + ε ij                    (1)




Vij designates the utility individual i realizes from selecting choice alternative j;, yi designates income

from individual I, cij corresponds to the cost presented to individual i for choice alternative j,

a corresponds to the vector of alternative specific constants relevant to each person based on the

choice panels he received, Aj represents a vector of attributes for choice alternative j, Z j designates

characteristics of each respondent that are hypothesized to influence choices, and ε ij is assumed to be

i.i.d. and to follow a type I extreme value distribution. The two terms a × Z i and Aj × Z i offer a short

hand for specifications that include respondent attributes interacted with alternative specific constants

for the plans as well as between plan attributes and respondent characteristics. For a respondent’s

characteristics to be included in simple RUM specifications they must be interacted with attributes of

the choice alternatives or with an alternative specific constant.




     We also investigated model specifications in terms of the attributes of the plans alone. They confirm people’s
preferences for risk reductions over an ex post focus of the severity of cases of food borne illness. The design
restrictions linking risk changes and time changes to one plan, severity changes to another, and risk change alone
to the third imply that simple interpretation of the individual estimated coefficients in this specification would be
incorrect.
10
   The structure of our choice experiment and sample size suggest there is little advantage in a random coefficient
or mixed logit specification.
                                                                                                            9


C.      Design of Choice Alternatives

        Our stated choice questions are based on three alternative plans to protect food safety. The

plans were developed after pretesting a wide array of strategies for describing the possibility of health

threats in four separate focus groups conducted in Phoenix and New York City. In each city, we

conducted two focus groups that were distinguished based on whether participants made less or more

than the median income for the households in each location. While each pairing received the same

information, the New York groups received information materials that were revised to take account of

the comments we learned from the Phoenix sessions.

        Threats were presented initially as evolving stories of contamination or in terms of some specific

source for a contaminant. We found participants were willing to acknowledge the plausibility of the

threats, but did not accept the proposed policies as workable. This was especially true if the policy

required responses by ordinary households. A pre‐test survey conducted using the Knowledge Networks

web panel in mid‐ July 2007 with 170 respondents evaluated further revisions of the sources of the

illness and the severity of cases of food borne illness. The results from the focus groups and the pretest

suggested respondents would be likely to select the status quo over a wide range of risks, levels for the

illness severity, and costs for plans to address the problem. These outcomes seemed to arise even with

individuals who acknowledged the severity of the problem of food borne illness. The key considerations

in respondents’ willingness to consider alternatives aside from the status quo were clear explanations of

the status quo conditions and descriptions of plans to improve upon that situation that seemed

plausible and potentially effective.

        To allow for the possibility that our adjustment to framing and design of the choice alternatives

would be ineffective in convincing respondents that these were plausible and effective alternatives, half

of the respondents to the final survey were assigned to the conventional format for a conjoint choice

involving two plans to deal with food borne illness and a status quo or no change option. The other half
                                                                                                           10


of the respondents were first asked “forced choice” questions. That is they were asked to select

between two plans based on the assumption that a decision had already been made by the government

to undertake a public protection effort with a pre‐defined cost per household in increased taxes. After

selecting between the two alternatives, respondents were then asked whether they would vote for their

preferred plan at the pre‐defined tax cost. Based on the survey results, we do not observe an excessive

number of status quo responses, indicating that the presentation of choice alternatives was perceived as

salient and credible. So we confine our analysis to the set of respondents who answered the

conventional conjoint that included the status quo option.

        Two of the plans represent ex ante responses that influence the probability of illnesses. They

vary depending on whether the individual undertakes the averting activity himself or the protection

arises as a public good available to all households thru greater food inspection. The third plan focuses

on the severity of cases of food borne related illness. Figure 1a provides the text used to describe all

three plans:

    •   the ex ante private plan—a home test kit for food borne contaminants;

    •   an ex ante plan to reduce risk by hiring more food inspectors;

    •   an ex post option that offers a medicine that influences the severity of the illness once it is

        contracted.

    All plans suggested that there would be an additional cost, added to each person’s federal income

taxes, for development and implementation whichever plan was selected. In addition, for the private

options (i.e. the test kit and the medicine), there was an additional cost associated with purchasing the

test kit and medication. These costs were described in monthly and annual terms (assuming each

respondent would purchase them as prescribed). In addition, the test kit was described as involving

some added time in food preparation each time the kit was used. This added time requirement was not

a part of the other plans. Figure 1b reproduces a representative choice panel from this survey.
                                                                                                             11


          The presentation of risk as an attribute of the choice alternatives used the Corso et.al. [2001]

strategy for presenting risks – a box with 1,000 squares. A fraction of the squares were colored in red to

designate the incidence of an event with the proportion of colored squares representing the probability.

To gauge respondents’ understanding of the graphical presentation we asked each person to compare

the relative risk associated with two different probabilities using the boxes with colored panels to

indicate graphically their relative frequencies of an event. This process asked them to compare the

depiction of 270 in 1,000 versus 3 in 1,000 risks and then to evaluate whether the box with 3 in 1,000

was a higher or lower risk than the one with 270 colored squares. The text of the question along with

the display of risks using the boxed diagram is given in Figure 1c. If they selected incorrectly, then the

survey text explained their mistake. If they answered correctly, the survey text reinforced why their

choice was correct11

          Table 1 presents the experimental design used for this survey and illustrates how the attributes

are constrained to be consistent with the features of each plan. The experimental design exploits a

commonly used algorithm to construct near‐optimal experimental designs. In our case, the selection

was constrained to assure the assignment of attributes for each choice alternative was consistent with

the features of the plan that was supposed to “deliver” the changes. In addition, we allowed for two

different types of home test kits to allow greater variation in the testing time component of that plans

approach to reducing the risk of food borne illness. This design evlauation led to twenty‐four pairs of

policy options. Designs were evaluated based on D‐efficiency, which minimizes the geometric mean of

the covariance matrix of the parameters and is the most commonly used criterion for constructing

experimental designs. To reduce respondent burden, the trade‐off tasks were blocked into twelve sets

of two questions.12 Each subject was randomly assigned to receive one of the twelve sets of two

conjoint questions.



D.       Survey

         The survey was sent to the Knowledge Netowork panelists on August 24, 2007, and continued

until September 10, 2007. The survey was sent to 2,242 panelists aged 18 and over. By the close of the

survey 1,606 had completed the survey with a 72% completion rate.

         Respondents were randomly assigned to the two versions of the food safety conjoint questions,

resulting in a sample size of 801 respondents to the choice format with two plans and a status quo or no

change alternative. The first column of Table 2 reports summary statistics for the demographic and

economic attributes of this sample, including a measure of respondents’ willingness to accept financial

risks. The risk tolerance measure was derived using a framework developed by Barsky et. al. [1997].

Their index uses responses to questions about choices between a secure job for life and another with a

50‐50 chance of two different income levels. With locally constant relative risk aversion, the answers

classify respondents into one of four risk tolerance groups.13 We use the numerical scores they assign to

each group. We also included questions about respondents’ experiences with cases of sickness due to

food as well as their experiences directly (or through someone they knew) with a hospitalization due to


12
   Two recent papers (Lusk and Norwood [2005] and Ferrini and Scarpa [2007]) have considered the properties of
conjoint/discrete choice estimates with alternative experimental designs and specification errors. While neither
study is directly relevant to our application – because they do not impose constraints on the design alternatives to
meet pre‐defined consistency features of a set of labeled choice alternatives – the Ferrini and Scarpa analysis
considers the widest range of design alternatives and specification issues. Their conclusion seems quite relevant to
our case. They note in the absence of detailed a priori information about the range of values for attributes and
constraints on sample sizes then selecting rudimentary designs that are optimized for linear models is likely the
best strategy (see p. 358‐359).
13
   The formulation of the Barsky et. al. [1997] questions allows each respondent to be placed in intervals based on
their response to an initial question and a follow up that changes the rewards up or down based on whether they
accepted or rejected the initial offer. Their risk tolerance index, θ, is the reciprocal of the coefficient of relative risk
aversion. If U(y) is the utility function expressed in terms of annual income, y, then 1/θ = coefficient of relative risk
                ⎛U       ⎞
aversion = − y⎜ yy       ⎟.
                ⎝    U y ⎠
                                                                                                            13


a case of food borne illness. Concerns about avian flu were asked to gauge respondent’s perceptions of

the prospects for conventional transmission of serious disease outbreaks across borders. We also asked

about their smoking habits and whether the respondent was the primary food shopper. Knowledge

Networks provided information from a client profile on a variety of health and food consumption

questions. Income was elicited using household income in an interval format. The mid‐point of each

interval assigned to each respondent. A Pareto tail adjustment was used to set the value for the income

assigned to those in the highest, open‐ended interval (see Miller [1966]).

        We also obtained from the Knowledge Networks profile data the full demographic and

economic attributes of the non‐respondents, panelists who were invited to take the survey but did not

by the time it closed. The second column of Table 2 reports a probit model testing for whether KN

panelists’ demographic and economic characteristics affected their willingness to complete this survey.

Age, race and whether the respondent was the primary shopper for their household are important

determinants of participation. Panelists identifying themselves as black were less likely to take the

survey, while panelists identifying themselves as white were more likely to participate. Primary shoppers

were also less likely to participate. We have developed a simple but approximate strategy for accounting

for this selection effect. We report the results with a selection term included but omitting it does not

change the primary results from our analysis.



III.    Results

A.      Choice Models

        Table 3 reports three choice models. The first two specifications include the total cost of each

plan (tax cost plus product specific costs at annual level assuming purchases based on full utilization),

the time required to use the test kit, alternative specific constants for each plan and an interaction term

multiplying the time needed to use the kit with the inverse Mills ratio from our selection model given in
                                                                                                            14


the second column of Table 214. Our hypothesis is that those panelists sensitive to the time

requirements of a plan to test for food borne pathogens will also be sensitive to the time required to

complete internet surveys. As we expect, the individuals who are less sensitive to time requirements

are more likely to be a part of the sample and would respond to the KN invitation to participate sooner.

           Models (1) and (2) are distinguished by the sample used. Model (1) includes all the

respondents. Each person received two conjoint questions, described in the survey as independent

situations, generating two observations for each respondent. We use a robust covariance estimator to

account for the potential heteroscedasticity due to this panel feature of the sample and to take account

of the fact that our approximate strategy for dealing with selection effects introduces

heteroscedasticity.

           Respondents consistently distinguish between the alternative plans —consumers have a clear

preference for ex ante risk reduction over ex post responses. Model (2) is estimated using a sub‐sample

that deletes respondents who, at the outset of the survey, had difficulty correctly identifying the low risk

situation using the box diagram to explain risk. The results are virtually indistinguishable comparing the

estimated coefficients and the tests of the influence of the labels for the plans on the respondent’s

choices. Whether we include or do not include respondents who appeared initially unable to

understand the graphical approaches used to describe risks did not affect these overall conclusions.

Thus, it appears that at the simplest level the strategy to use specific plans that consumers accept as

credible objects of choice seems to overcome some of the issues identified by Shogren and Stamlund.

One of the most surprising, and seemingly counter intuitive result with these simple models, is the

negative and significant coefficient for the plan to offer a medicine to reduce the severity of a case of

food borne illness. This result reflects a preference for ex ante approaches. The plan with medicine does

nothing to reduce risks and is likely to be interpreted by respondents as relying on personal action that


14
     These annualized costs were included in the choice panels presented to respondents.
                                                                                                            15


identifies the have contracted a food borne illness and then takes action to mitigate the symptoms of

that illness at an early stage.

        Model (3) in Table 3 reports a detailed specification for the choice model that includes both the

alternative specific constants for the plans and the measures of the attributes. The interaction effects

introduce nonlinearities in the effects of the attributes that mitigate the effects of the design induced

collinearity between the attributes and the alternative specific constants used to define the plans’

effects. For the risk change, we consider whether the measure of risk tolerance defined earlier, and

elicited through a separate set of questions, influences the contribution of the risk change to choice. For

the change in severity of the illness we use qualitative variables for respondents who rate their health as

excellent or poor. For each plan variable, we include interactions that identify respondents who have

had food borne illness, who know (or experienced) a case severe enough to be hospitalized, who

indicate they are very or somewhat concerned about the spread of disease through a pandemic, and

finally who indicate that they smoke.

        Overall, we found a number of significant interaction effects indicating that respondent’s

characteristics, past experience, and information can influence the intensity of their preferences for

avoiding illness. Most of the signs of the interaction effects are consistent with our a priori expectations

and some are statistically significant using conventional criteria. Considering the parameter for severity,

the coefficient reflecting the direct effect has a positive sign. But for respondents who rate their health

to be excellent the coefficient on severity is negative (adding together the coefficients on severity and

on the interaction term), while it is positive for those who rate their health as poor. The severity of the

illness only varies under the medication plan, so individuals who consider their own health to be

excellent are less likely to select the medication plan. Those who rate their health as poor seem willing

to consider an ex post response with the medicine. While not statistically significant, the sign of the

interaction of the risk change with the risk tolerance measure is consistent with a priori expectations.
                                                                                                                  16


That is, those respondents who appear more willing to deal with risk will not pay as much for policies to

reduce the risk of food borne illness.

         The interaction terms between the alternative specific variables identifying the plans and

individual attributes also are consistent with a priori expectations. Those with experience with food

borne illness are more willing to purchase plans to increase inspectors. If they have been hospitalized or

know someone who has, they are more likely to select the test to reduce their personal risk. Concerns

about pandemics generally increases support for all plans. The only result that seems implausible is

smoker’s willingness to purchase the medicine. This term may be serving as a proxy for greater risk

tolerance.

         Thus, the detailed model generally confirms the external consistency by providing the links

between most behaviors, health status, risk tolerance, prior information, risk perceptions, and stated

choices. The Shogren‐Stamlund “disconnect” does not appear to have affected our plan‐based strategy

for recovering choice information. However, it is harder to judge the tradeoff measures implied by

these choices because some plans bundle multiple cost and attribute changes in ways that do not allow

them to be separated. We turn to this issue in what follows.



B.       Marginal Willingness to Pay Estimates—Basic Models

         Table 4 reports the estimates for the marginal willingness to pay for each plan using only the

alternative specific constants.15 Thus, they offer a basis for comparing only the plans. They rely on

assuming comparable risk reductions and no “time costs” for using the test kits. Column (1)



15
  One could define a willingness to pay by considering a set of versions of each plan and deriving willingness to pay
based on the log sum rule that results from considering a simple RUM with the type I extreme value error.
However, this process would require us to define the set of choice alternatives. Since it would include
specification of both the tax increases and the prices for the private good (i.e. test kit and medicine) alternatives
and the time requirements the derived WTP would account for how differences in these aspects of plans influence
the WTP. Unfortunately there is no policy relevant process to define the choice set and, thus, we must consider
the simpler approximation we use in the construction of Tables 4 and 5.
                                                                                                            17


corresponds to estimates from model (1) and column (2) is model (2). The estimates for the plans for

the private test kit and the increased inspections are not significantly different using a Wald test with

the robust covariance matrix for the McFadden [1974] conditional logit model (model (1) χ2(1) = 1.14, p‐

value = 0.286, model (2) χ2(1) = 0.95, p‐value = 0.329).

        A “negative” marginal willingness to pay for the plan to offer a medicine to reduce the severity

of illness simply reflects respondents’ dissatisfaction with solutions focused exclusively on the ex post

outcome. These estimates suggest the measures are not significantly different from zero. In short,

consumers would not vote for this type of plan. The measures for opportunity cost of the time in food

preparation may seem large—$22.50 and $37.70 per minute. However, the framing of the question is in

terms of minutes for each time the test kit for food borne pathogens is used in preparing food that

involves fresh vegetables and meats. It would not have been plausible to present it in another format,

such as an annual time commitment because that would be based on assumptions about how many

meals are prepared with fresh foods at home. As a result, it is then difficult to compare these estimates

with other measures of the value of time. To do so requires knowledge of the expected patterns of use

of the kits. These usage levels could easily be in the hundreds of occasions. For example, adding a

minute to each of 150 meals would imply a value of 0.15 per minute (using our estimate of $22.50 per

minute) or an opportunity cost of time of about $9.00 per hour and $15.00 per hour with the $37.70

estimate.

        Before turning to some further cross checks of the framework using sub‐samples, it is important

to acknowledge that the food test kit implies a commitment beyond the income tax that depends on a

discretionary choice. That is, a vote for the private plan for the test kit requires only a commitment to

pay the proposed tax cost. It does not actually require respondents to buy the kit. A future purchase is

always an option that respondents can assume they might make provided they have voted to assure the

plan with food test kits is supported. This is why we argued some fraction of the proposed cost of the
                                                                                                           18


kit should be added to the marginal willingness to pay. This expected expenditure would reflect how

frequently the consumer would anticipate purchasing the kit. Of course, the risk reduction proposed

would not be realized without its use. Our description makes this point clear. Nonetheless, the equality

of marginal willingness to pay for the two ex ante plans relies on using only the estimated parameters

for alternative specific constants and the parameter for total cost term. While we do not know

respondents’ expectations for their expenditure patterns, it would seem that these consumers have a

strong preference for the private plan to reduce risk.




C.      Marginal Willingness to Pay—Selected Respondents

        Table 5 reports the estimates of marginal willingness to pay for three sub‐samples. We limit the

sample to respondents who correctly answered the risk graphic question and then consider respondents

who: (a) report they experienced food borne illness, (b) state they are the primary shopper, and (c)

indicate on a 1 to 10 scale values of 5 or greater as likelihood results from their stated choices would

influence policy (following Landry and List’s [2006] to focus on respondents who consider their answers

to be consequential). The marginal willingness to pay estimates for all three groups are somewhat

larger as we expected. They are greatly different from the estimates based on the full sample with

either the public or private plans for risk reductions, and, due to sample size, would not be judged

significantly different from zero. However, this later result should be discounted because the estimated

parameters are completely consistent with results from the full sample. With larger sub‐samples these

asymptotic results would have been consistent with our overall findings. We report them here as a

consistency check—indicating the choice patterns displayed by those with attributes likely to feel food
                                                                                                            19


safety was important (e.g. those who have experienced illness and those who report they are the

primary shopper). Equally important, if we narrow the focus to respondents who are likely to offer the

most reliable tradeoffs using Landry and List’s consequentiality index, we confirm the approximate size

of the MWTP found for the full sample.




IV.     Implications

        Consumers are clearly willing to pay to improve food safety and they are especially interested in

reducing the risk of food borne disease. If given the opportunity to select how public policy makers

would improve the safety of the food supply, households prefer strategies that offer them private

control over the ways risks are reduced even if that entails some increased financial and time costs.

        The concerns raised by other authors about the ability to elicit reliable measures for people’s

risk perceptions and behavioral choices do not seem to be present with our survey. The contradictory

responses leading to Shogren and Stamland’s concerns about disconnects between risk perceptions and

behavior as threats to the external validity of estimated tradeoffs for risk reductions were not present in

our survey. Presenting “labeled” choice alternatives that describe specific plans to reduce risk seem to

have enhanced the perceived salience of the tasks involved. Nonetheless, this strategy does limit our

ability to estimate the willingness to pay for cases of food borne illness. This arises because only one

plan, the case of the public plan to increase food inspections, offers a reduction in risk paid for

exclusively by an increase in the income tax. Using the marginal willingness to pay for this alternative

(based on the alternative specific constant) and the range of risk reductions assigned for our design to

this plan, yields a willingness to pay for an avoided case of food borne illness of $630 to $963 with the
                                                                                                                    20


variation depending on the risk reduction matched to the estimate of the constant marginal willingness

to pay for the plan. At its highest value this is one tenth the large estimates reported by Hammitt and

Haninger. However, the range for our estimates is more consistent with both earlier food safety

research and estimates of willingness to pay for short term morbidity effects in other contexts.

         Two potentially important next steps in research stem from our findings. The first arises from

the difficulties in covering separate estimates for the economic value of a reduction in risk of food borne

illness with our approach when that reduction can be realized with a wide variety of different plans. It

would be interesting to compare our approach maintaining the specialized design linking attributes to

labeled plans to a more traditional conjoint where the choice alternatives share a common set of

attributes and a single, plausible plan is used to describe how they would be brought about. This

comparison would help to understand the implications of using plan/attribute combinations to recover

marginal values for changes in attributes versus using the estimated parameters from a conventional

conjoint model. This comparison may well extend beyond situations involving risk changes to a wider

range of stated choice conjoint surveys. Surveys using labeled choice alternatives and comparing them

with those the attribute based studies for comparable situations would help to enhance our

understanding of the relevance of the the choice context for the performance of these models16. Our

results suggest that this approach may be partially responsible for the anomalies in conjoint surveys

involving risks. Second and directly relevant to the safety and security of the US food supply, it would

seem that policy makers have neglected policies that provide for private production of food safety

through in‐home mitigation and testing. Our findings suggest strategies to address food safety need to

be expanded to offer consumers private mitigation alternatives that can complement the existing

16
  This proposal is consistent with Berheim and Rangel’s [2008] description of ancillary conditions. This is a feature
of the choice environment that may affect behavior but is not taken to be relevant to the social planner’s choice
once the decision rests with that person. In our framework the context refers to aspects of the respondents’
perceptions about ability of the proposed agency to deliver what is promised. It also relates to their familiarity with
the payment terms. As discussed in Smith [2007] analysts assume people have full experience and that their
decisions reflect the choice resolution required to measure consistent economic tradeoffs.

protection from FDA’s food inspection program rather than pre‐supposing the preferred alternative is

always focusing on increasing the federal inspection programs to provide a “public” good – uniform (and

potentially smaller) risk reductions for all consumers.

 The design values in the table correspond to different units for each variable: risk it is cases in 1000 of individuals
 experiencing food borne illness in a year. Thus 270 is 270 cases in 1000 people. Cost is the annual cost for each
plan that is in addition to the increased taxes. Severity is the duration of the illness in hours for an average case of
   food borne illness. Time is the added minutes for food preparation each time the home test kit is used. The
 abbreviations for the plans are: kit corresponds to the home test kit for presence of bacteria or pathogens; med
refers to the proposed medicine that would reduce the severity of a case of food borne illness, and insp. refers to
        plan to increase the number of FDA inspectors to evaluate food products for bacteria or pathogens.
