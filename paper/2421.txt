      Bank Portfolio Choice with Private Information About Loan Quality:

                     Theory and Implications for Regulation




                                    ABSTRACT



     This paper models bank asset choice when shareholders know more about
loan quality than do outsiders. Because of this informational asymmetry, the
price of loans in the secondary market is the price for poor quality loans.
Banks desire to hold marketable securities in order to avoid liquidating good
quality loans at the "lemons" price, but also have a countervailing desire to
hold risky loans in order to maximize the value of deposit insurance. In
this context, portfolio composition and bank safety is examined as a function
of the market distribution of loan quality, and the distribution of deposits.
The model suggests that off-balance sheet commitments have little effect on
bankruptcy risk, and induce banks to hold more securities. We also show that
an increase in the bank equity requirement will unambiguously increase bank
safety in the long run. In the short run, banks are unambiguously riskier
on-balance-sheet, although the effect on bank safety is ambiguous.

1. Introduction

     The ability to design effective bank regulations depends critically on

understanding the asset allocation decisions of banks. For example, whether

an increase in the bank capital requirement increases or reduces bankruptcy

risk affects the desirability of using capital requirements as a policy tool.

Another important question is how off-balance-sheet items such as lines of

credit and loan commitments will affect a bank's portfolio decision. To

address questions such as these, we develop a model of the banking firm which

focuses on bank asset decisions.

     There are two driving forces behind a bank's choice between risky loans

and securities in the model: a) banks want to hold risky loans to maximize

the value of FDIC insurance; and b) because banks have private information

about risky loans ex post, most loans cannot be sold at a fair price when a

need for cash arises. Thus banks choose to hold a portion of their portfolio

in securities about which there is symmetric information, because these

securities can be sold at a fair price.

     Many theories of bank portfolio choice generate a demand for relatively

risk-free securities in the presence of FDIC insurance by assuming that banks

are run by risk-averse managers or owners. This explanation has been

suggested by Pyle (1981), Hart and Jaffee (1974) and Koehn and Santomero

(1980), among others, who explain bank portfolio choice under the assumption

that bank managers choose mean-variance efficient portfolios. Empirical

evidence, however, points against these models: the risky portion of bank

portfolios is relatively undiversified, with banks often specializing in

loans to a particular industry or locality. More fundamentally, as long as

the bank is owned by investors who can diversify on their own account, it
                                          2


will be suboptimal for the bank to diversify, thereby lowering the value of

FDIC insurance. In contrast, we assume that banks are risk-neutral. This

implies that banks have no intrinsic incentive to diversify their risky

assets.     Nevertheless, banks choose to hold marketable securities in order

to avoid loan sales at an unfavorable price.'

     Banks may need to sell loans because they face stochastic external

sources of demand for cash: two examples of such external demands are

deposit withdrawals and loan commitments. Insured deposit withdrawals are

treated as an exogenous and stochastic source of liquidity demand. Although

banks have some discretion about honoring loan commitments and other off-

balance sheet sources of liquidity demand, these commitments can lead to a

large and immediate need for cash. Since off-balance-sheet commitments are a

significant fraction of bank assets, in practice they may be a major source

of variation in cash demand. The model enables us to estimate a usually-

ignored component of the cost to the bank of making such commitments.

     The effect of a change in capital requirements on asset risk is explored

in both the short and long-run. In the long-run, increasing the equity

requirement significantly lowers bankruptcy risk. The optimal mix 'between

securities and loans is largely unaffected. The short-run effects are more

complex.    A small increase in the equity requirement tends to reduce

bankruptcy risk, while a large increase in the equity requirement can

increase bankruptcy risk.2 The increase also has the perverse effect of

making banks appear riskier on balance sheet.

     Our argument for the existence of liquidity costs may be outlined

simply:    if banks know more about loan quality than do outsiders, and if

outsiders are aware of this, then there will be a "lemons market" (Akerlof,
                                          3


1970) for loans. Equilibrium secondary loan prices will therefore reflect

the price of below-average quality loans, and banks will try to reduce the

probability of having to sell loans. One way for banks to avoid selling

loans is to hold securities about which there is synimetric information (and

which therefore bear no lemons discount), such as Treasury bills. Thus, our

model suggests a structural explanation for the existence and magnitude of

liquidity costs in selling risky assets. This contrasts with the sizable

literature that takes these costs as exogenous (e.g., Poole (1968), Frost

(1971), Baltensperger (1974), and Sprenkle (1985)).

     The paper is organized as follows: In Section 2 we discuss how

asymmetric information leads to a "lemons" discount. Section 3 presents the

model, and in Section 4 conditions are derived that determine the bank's

optimal portfolio. The sensitivity of portfolio composition to changes in

loan return variability, deposit variability, and liquidation penalty is

demonstrated by simulation in Section 5. Section 6 argues that loan

commitments are equivalent to stochastic deposit withdrawals, and so can be

expected to increase the demand for securities. Section 7 discusses the

effect of changing equity requirements.




2. Lemons and the Market for Loans



     We assume that ex post banks know the quality of loans on their books

and potential buyers do not. The market is competitive, so that there are a

large number of potential buyers who can either buy or refuse to buy a loan

at the price offered by the bank. Suppose that buyers are willing to buy a
                                        4

used loans at a price reflecting the average quality of loans ex ante. In

this case banks with average quality loans will be indifferent between

selling them or keeping them, since the price will be fair. However, no bank

with a higher quality loan will voluntarily sell at the price appropriate to

an average quality loan, since doing so would mean incurring a loss. At the

same time, all banks with below-average quality loans will profitably sell

their loans at the average-quality loan price. Thus, buyers of loans will on

average pay too high a price, and loans will be priced to reflect below-

average quality. This argument, made originally in a different context by

Akerlof (1970), can be used to show that in the absence of forced loan sales,

the equilibrium price of loans will be the price appropriate for the minimum

quality loan. In particular, for the investor to receive the average rate of

return when loan quality is aL, the discount c is given by solving (l-c)(l+r)

  (l+QL). The wider the dispersion between high and low quality loans, the

greater will be the banks' desire to avoid bearing this cost. Thus by

endogenizing the cost of selling loans, we will be able to predict the

sensitivity of portfolio choice to changes in the riskiness of the

environment.

     When there are forced sales of some high quality loans for liquidity,

the equilibrium price of a used loan will not be the price of the minimum

quality loan. Rather, the equilibrium price will reflect both the average

quality of loans sold due to forced liquidations and those sold because their

quality was worse than that reflected in the secondary market price. Thus,

the discount c derived above is an upper bound for the true discount on a

used loan. Even with forced liquidations, it is clear that the equilibrium

price of loans will be below that of the average loan, and thus there will be
                                        5


an incentive for banks to hold marketable securities to reduce the

possibility of a forced loan sale. The simulations in Section 5 illustrate

the effect of varying the discount c on portfolio composition.

     An alternative to selling loans is issuing securities; we assume in this

paper that firms issue no securities. This is a strong assumption,

particularly in light of the frequency with which banks issue uninsured debt.

The sale of risky debt or equity, however, is similar to the direct sale of a

loan since the price a bank outsider will pay for debt or equity depends on

loan quality. Lucas and McDonald (1987) show that the information asymmetry

leads to higher priced uninsured debt than when there is symmetric

information, so that even with funding alternatives such as debt issues,

banks will still face a potential lemons cost. A similar point is made by

Myers and Majluf (1984). Here we take the liability structure as fixed to

simplify the analysis.

     Finally, we also rule out borrowing from the discount window as a source

of funds. If by borrowing from the discount window banks could costlessly

avoid all loan sales for liquidity purposes, then there would be no

motivation for holding securities in this model. However, there is not

unlimited access to the discount window, and such borrowing is not costless.

Inclusion of the discount window in the model would likely reduce estimates

of bank security holdings,3 but qualitatively leave the results unchanged.



3. The Model

     We look at the problem of bank asset choice for a bank facing two

sources of uncertainty: risky returns on loans and random deposit

realizations. The bank must choose the percentage of assets held as loans
                                         6

and the percentage held as securities.

     A security is defined to be a low-risk asset for which there is no

private information, while loans are risky assets about which banks have

private information. The underlying idea is that banks learn about the

quality of loans that they make, both from an initial investment in

information and over time. Thus, a loan made to IBM might be considered a

security under our definition. We assume that securities have relatively low

risk. This is a critical assumption; if assets with symmetric information

are riskier than loans, loans will be dominated. In practice, banks are

prohibited from holding risky, publicly-valued assets such as stocks, while

banks do hold a significant fraction of their portfolio in relatively low-

risk government securities.

     The bank operates for three periods. In the first period all banks are

identical, while in the second period their actions depend on their

realization of loan quality and deposits. In the final period the bank is

dissolved. We begin by describing the cash flows, decision variables and

constraints in each period. This constrained optimization problem will then

be solved in Section 4. Because of the interaction between FDIC insurance,

the equity requirement, and the realizations of deposits and loan quality,

the model is quite complex. The simulation results and accompanying

explanations presented in Section 5 should allow the reader to understand the

model without working through the detail of the next two sections.

     The cash flows, decision variables, and constraints in each period are

as follows:

a) Period 0

     The bank starts with an exogenous, insured deposit inflow D. The
                                            7


capital requirement is a fraction g of deposits, implying that initial equity

must be at least gD. Investments can be made in new loans and securities.

Thus equity and deposits must be divided between loans, L0, and securities,

S0. Equity reduces the value of FDIC insurance, so we assume that initially,

equity will equal the legal minimum:


(1)       D(l+g)—S0+L0
Since equity makes up the difference between assets and deposits, the net

cash flow for equity holders at time 0 is


(2)       -gD


Investments in securities and loans last for two periods. Securities earn

the risk-free rate r in both period 1 and period 2. Loans, on the other

hand, are risky. In period 1, loans pay a certain return of a1 >      r.4   In

period 2 they return a2, which is distributed over [aL, aHI, with expected

value equal to the risk-free rate r.

b) Period 1:

      Between period 0 and period 1, the bank receives two new pieces of

information. First, the bank learns the quality of period 0 loans, so

uncertainty is resolved about a2, the period 2 return on loans bought in

period          After   loan quality is known, in period 1 the bank learns its

deposit realization 6. A positive 6 is a withdrawal, and a negative 6 is a

deposit. 6 is distributed on 6L' H' The bank must return any deposits

demanded, but may decline to take new deposits. The amount of deposits

voluntarily turned away is denoted          We will see later that deposits may

be turned away when a bank anticipates bankruptcy in the next period.

        Given the realizations of a and 6, the bank must decide the following:

               tht-h,r            rpmir             in hiic4r                        nr

(5) max [           (S0 -                                                  L0)(l+a2)                  L1(l+a)               S1(l-4-r)

                                                &)(l+r)                ]




4.    Choosing the Optimal Portfolio

        The objective of the bank is to maximize the present value of expected

cash flows. Since the bank is risk neutral, it discounts cash flows at the

risk-free rate, with discount factor $                                     = l/(l+r).                 The bank's time 0 choice

of o and L0 will be influenced by what it expects will occur in periods 1

and 2. In this section the allocation problem is solved via dynamic

programming.



Period 2

       Since all uncertainty has been resolved and no choices remain, equation

(5) describes the bank's profits.



Period 1

       At time 1, the bank knows S0, L, a2, and S.                                                    The only remaining

uncertainty is the return on new loans a, if new loans are purchased. The

bank chooses tS ,

period 2.   Thus, &      if period 2 profits are negative, i.e. the bank will
be bankrupt, and &
                       aL if period 2 profits are positive, i.e. the bank will
be solvent.)

     Lemmas 1 through 5 characterize the bank's actions as a function of the

state variables. First, lemmas 1 and 2 (proved in Appendix A) describe the

bank's security choices in period 1.


Lemma 1.    No new securities are purchased in period 1: S1 = 0.


Lemma 2.    All period zero securities are liquidated in period 1:

LSO — S0.


These lemmas can be explained intuitively. The bank prefers securities to

loans only when securities provide a buffer against liquidation costs.

Otherwise loans are more valuable because their variance increases the value

of FDIC insurance. After the realization of & is known, there will be no

more liquidation costs and hence no more demand for securities. In a version

of the model with a longer horizon, securities would be valuable in all but

the penultimate period. For this reason, time 0 security holdings, rather

than time 1 security holdings, are of predictive interest in this model.

     Bank decisions concerning loans, dividends, and deposits are described

by Lemmas 3 through 5. Optimal actions depend on the realizations of

withdrawals and the quality of loans made at time 0. The basic idea is that

if a bank anticipates bankruptcy at time 2, the equity holders want to pay

themselves as large a dividend as possible at time 1, since they expect low

returns from investing in new loans. On the other hand, if time 0 loans are

sufficiently good, banks will prefer to use new deposits to buy new loans,

because of the positive value of FDIC insurance.

    Changes in deposits can be divided into three regions, illustrated

schematically in Figure 1.             In Region 1, the period 1 withdrawal is

sufficiently large so that period 0 loans must be liquidated, but not large

enough to force the bank out of business. The minimum withdrawal that forces

the bank out of business, 6b, is the withdrawal that forces violation of (3)

In Region 2 no loans need be liquidated, but the withdrawal is large enough

so that no new loans can be purchased except by foregoing a dividend and

effectively adding equity to the firm. Region 2 is bounded below by

S0/(l+g), and above by l• Finally, in Region 3, cash from the sale of

securities and new deposits is enough to buy new loans without voluntarily

adding equity to buy new loans. In this region withdrawals do not exceed

S0/(l +   g),   or there is a net deposit inflow.

Figure 1. Optimal actions depend on deposit/withdrawal and loan quality



     In each of these regions, there is a critical value of time 0 loan

quality, a*, that determines the bank's best strategy. If a2 < a*, the bank

would rather pull out as much money as possible in period 1 in anticipation

of low profits or bankruptcy the next period. Otherwise, the bank prefers

to stay in business and purchase as many new loans as possible up to the

point where the equity constraint is binding. a* is the loan quality at

which shareholders are indifferent between liquidating the bank and operating

it for one more period. Assuming (l+g)(l-c) <              l,   for all regions a* can be

shown to solve (this follows from the proofs of Lemmas              3-5   in the appendix):

           The following lemmas describe a bank's behavior more precisely in each

of these three regions, assuming that (l+g)(1-c) < 1.                                                Proofs are in Appendix

A.



Lemma 3.             In Region 1, for a2 > cz*, loan liquidations are at the minimum

level allowing withdrawals to be paid:

                                                                   +   rD)/(l-c).
For a2 < a*, loans are liquidated until the equity constraint is binding:

                     =
                         L0
                               -

S and L are zero in both cases.
 v               1




Lemma 4. In Region 2, if a2 >                                 a*       the bank pays 8, pays a dividend with cash

from net interest income, and liquidates no loans. If a2 <                                                  a*, L0 L0 -

[(ID   -
            S)(l         +    g)].        L1 and 8v are zero in both cases.



Lemma 5.             In Region 3, if a2 > a*, voluntary return of deposits 8 is zero,
                                               15

and new loans L1      S0 -    S(l+g).8   If a2 <    a*,   L1=O, and assets are reduced

until the equity constraint eq. (4) is binding. This implies a voluntary

deposit return of S          max( 0, S0/(l-f-g)-S ).



     Lemmas 3 to 5 summarize the bank's portfolio strategy in period 1. For

high quality loans liquidation is avoided, and the bank makes the maximum

possible additional investment in new loans with money from insured deposits.

Low quality loans cause the bank to maximize current dividends in

anticipation of a low return in the following period. Equity is kept to the

legal minimum by dividend payments, except in the situation where paying a

dividend would involve liquidation of sufficiently high quality loans. We

can now identify two sources of benefit from holding securities. First,

securities prevent the bank from having to liquidate high quality loans at a

substantial penalty when the withdrawal realization is high. Second, a more

subtle benefit is that when the bank has low quality loans, securities make

it less costly to take out a larger dividend in period 1, in anticipation of

bankruptcy in period 2.



Period 0

     Finally, the period 0 maximization problem can be solved. The bank

chooses S0 and L0 to maximize the present discounted value of future cash

flows, subject to eq. (1). The initial equity investment, given in eq. (2),

is not affected by the bank's actions. Taking into account optimal behavior

in periods 1 and 2 as described by lemmas 1 to 5, the value function V0 can

be written as a function of S0 and L0. The value function is given in

Appendix B.
                                                         16

       If the value function is maximized at an interior S0 > 0, then the

derivative of the value function with respect to S0 will be zero at the

maximum. Note that L0 can be replaced by D(l+g) - S0 using (1), sO the

problem reduces to one choice variable. Then differentiating V0 with respect

to S0 yields

The signs of the terms in this expression depend on the following

considerations: The first line in (10) corresponds to Region 1 in Figure 1,

in which there is forced liquidation. If the liquidation cost c is zero,

this is unarnbigously negative since a1 >                     r.   This reflects the fact that

where liquidation is costless, securities are dominated by loans. As c

increases, so does the value of holding securities against forced

liquidation. In the second line, Region 2, c also directly affects the

comparison between loans and securities when loans will be liquidated.

Otherwise, the return from securities is compared to the return over the
                                       17

life of the loans. The third line in (10) corresponds to Region 3, where

deposit inflows are sufficient to buy new loans. The first integral shows

that if old loans are poor so that bankcruptcy is anticipated, the marginal

benefit of securities over loans is g/(l+g)+r-a1. The g/(l+g) reflects that

the deposits backing the securities can profitably be returned to reduce the

equity requirement, allowing a larger current dividend to be paid. The

final integral compares the expected return on loans made at time 0 and at

time 1.

     With symmetric information and therefore no liquidation costs, the

first order condition corresponding to (10) would be unambiguously negative,

so that no securities would be held. The next section demonstrates that

with asymmetric information, securities can be a significant component of a

bank's optimal portfolio, assuming reasonable parameter values. The

proportion of securities held is quite sensitive to changes in the

4istributions of loan quality and withdrawals.



5. Simulation Results

     In this section we explore the implications of the model via

simulations. Tables 1 and 2 illustrate the effect on portfolio composition,

bank value, and ex ante probability of failure, of changing the distribution

of withdrawals and loan quality. Table 3 shows the effect of varying the

lemons discount exogenously. The main qualitative results can be summarized

as follows:




     o A mean preserving increase in the variance of withdrawals lowers the

     value of the bank, and leads to an increase in security holdings.
                                      18

    The effect on the probability of failure is ambiguous.



    o A mean preserving increase in the variance of loan quality has an

    ambiguous effect on the value of the bank, and an ambiguous effect on

    security holdings. The probability of failure increases.



    o Exogenously increasing the lemons discount decreases the value

    of the bank, increases security holdings, and has an ambiguous

    effect on the probability of failure.



    Unlike many models of the banking firm, this model distinguishes

between balance-sheet risk and bankruptcy risk. It is clear from the

results that looking at the effect of a policy change on portfolio

composition will generally not be informative about the effect of the policy

on the probability of failure. In simulations of this model, the most

important determinants of the probability of failure are the distribution of

loan quality and the equity requirement; other factors were always second

order. Intuitively, a bank can largely offset changes in factors such as an

increase in the variance of withdrawals through its choice of security

holdings. As a result, a change in the variance of withdrawals may have

little effect on the equilibrium probability of failure. Howevr, there is

nothing the bank can do to reduce the ex ante probability of receiving bad

loans as long as it invests in loans at all. Thus, a bank with a high ratio

of securities to loans may nevertheless have a high probabilty of bankruptcy

if the variance of loan quality is high.

       As one would expect, increasing the variance of withdrawals always

reduces the value of the bank10, because it increases that probability that

the bank will have to sell loans at a discount. To protect loans from

liquidation, the bank increases security holdings as deposits become more

uncertain. In Table 1, the support of the distribution of withdrawals is

varied from +/-5% to +/-40% of deposit liabilities, holding other parameters

constant. The discount c is set to the level that would prevail if there

were no forced sales. For this specification, the model explains only a

fraction of actual bank security holdings. However, with the addition of

loan commitments in Section 6, the model predicts much larger security

holdings.

     In both Tables 2a and 2b we vary the distribution of loan payoffs, but

perform quite different experiments. In Table 2a, as loan variance

increases, the lemons discount is varied simultaneously to reflect that

loans sold in the secondary market receive the price for the lowest quality

loans. This represents an increase in the riskiness of the operating

environment. Security holdings rise as the variance of the return on loans

rises, because for these parameters the expected cost of liquidation rises

more rapidly than the gain from more valuable insurance.

     Table 2b answers the question of how, in a stable environment, an

individual bank's value and security holdings are affected by changing the

distribution of loan quality. Since the lemons discount remains constant,

increased variance increases the value of FDIC insurance. The bank

substitutes away from securities as variance increases, and bank value

increases. This increase in bank value is a standard result in the

literature on FDIC insurance (e.g., Merton[l977fl.

     Although these simulations indicate that the value of the bank

increases with variance in both Tables 2a and 2b, other parameters can yield

a decreasing bank value in Table 2a. An increase in the variability of loan

quality will raise the lemons cost and hence the cost of liquidating loans,

and also raise the value of insurance. If deposit variability is high, the

increase in expected costs from loan liquidations will offset the increased

insurance benefit, and bank value can then fall. Note that in both tables

the probability of failure is primarily a function of the variance of loan

quality.

     Finally, Table 3 illustrates how an exogenous change in the lemons cost
                                           22

will impact the bank. For fixed distributions of loan quality and

withdrawals, an increase in c has the expected effects: the value of the

bank falls, and precautionary holdings of securities rise. In all

parameterizations tested, the probability of failure fell with the increase

in the lemons cost, presumably because the safety gained from increased

security holdings more than offset the increased bankruptcy risk due to the

higher liquidation cost.

     The sensitivity of the model predictions to a1, the return on loans at

time 1, was also tested. As expected, a higher a1 leads to a higher

percentage of loans in the portfolio, ceterus paribus, because it increases

the expected payoff from loans relative to securities. Changing a1 has

little effect on the probability of failure. In all the results reported,

a1 was set to a 3% premium over the riskfree rate.
                                        23

     With this basic understanding of the effect of exogenous environmental

changes on bank portfolio choice, riskiness and value, we turn to the

question of how banks will be affected by various policies and institutions.



 6. Loan Commitments as a Source of Uncertainty about Cash Reciuirements



     Up to this point, we have focussed on stochastic deposit flows as the

source of uncertainty about liquidity requirements. While uncertainty about

deposit flows is significant at times, one could argue that often deposits

are fairly stable. Deposit uncertainty alone may not generate a sufficient

demand for securities to explain the actual magnitude of securities held by

banks. There are, however, common bank practices that can generate a

substantial need for liquidity and hence induce a substantial demand for

securities: off-balance sheet activities such as loan commitments and backup

lines of credit.

     Any bank obligation which could result in an immediate demand for funds

is equivalent in our model to a stochastic deposit outflow. Drawdowns of

loan commitments, for example, are like deposit outflows in the sense that

outsiders make claims to bank resources. Suppose that a bank has

outstanding loan commitments of M, and that the probability of takedowns is

distributed on [O,M]. The net effect of zero-mean deposit uncertainty and

loan commitments is a negative mean cash outflow. In fact, loan commitments

and backup lines of credit are a surprisingly large fraction of bank assets.

In 1985 the ratio of off-balance-sheet commitments to assets was 209% for

the largest seven banks (Andrews and Sender, 1986). For these banks,

standby letters of credit and loan commitments average over fifty percent of
                                               24

assets.

      Table 4 shows how security holdings are affected by changes in the

distribution of required cash outflows. The mean outflow is negative to

reflect takedowns of off-balance-sheet commitments.

       Comparing these results with the zero-mean simulations in Table 1, we

find that precautionary holdings of securities are substantially increased.

As expected, bank value falls with an increase in free loan commitments

because the bank substitutes towards securities to meet the larger expected

cash outflows. The change in bank value from increasing the size of

expected loan commitments is a measure of the cost of these additional
                                        25

commitments to the bank)2,13 Since banks increase securities to meet

increases in expected loan commitment takedowns, the effect of loan

commitments on the probability of failure is small in this model.

      From a regulatory perspective, the fact that off-balance-sheet

commitments have a small (possibly negative) effect on the probability of

failure implies that there is no need to regulate loan commitments to

protect against increases in risk associated with bank liquidity. This

analysis is incomplete, however, since it ignores the possibility that the

risk of off-balance-sheet items will systematically differ from those on-

balance - sheet.




7. Will Increasing the Equity Requirement Make Banks Safer?



     The recent increase in the rate of bank failures has sparked debate

about whether bank capital requirements should be raised. This model

provides a framework in which to examine the expected consequences of

changes in equity requirements on bank portfolio choice, profitability, and

bankruptcy risk. For both portfolio choice and bankruptcy risk, we find a

marked difference between the short and long-run effects of an increase in

equity requirements. In the long-run, an increase in the equity requirement

reduces bankruptcy risk in all simulation scenarios tested, and tends to

result in slightly higher security holdings. In the short-run, banks hold

proportionally fewer securities, and the probability of failure can either

rise or fall. Higher equity requirements always lower the value of the bank

to stockholders.

     For the short-run analysis, the policy change is assumed to occur after
                                                 26

the initial purchase of securities and loans, and after loan quality is

known, but before a signal is received about liquidity needs. To respond to

an increase in g the bank in the short-run can either sell assets and refund

deposits, or issue new equity. Since by assumption no equity is issued,

consider the case in which assets are sold and deposits refunded.

Securities can be sold without a lemons cost, while loans are costly to

sell. In period 0, the bank is indifferent at the margin about changing a

dollar of loans for securities. Once the bank learns about loan quality,

however, selling loans has a cost for all but the worst banks. Initially the

bank will prefer to sell securities if it must reduce assets. Thus the

assets remaining on the balance sheet will be riskier, at least until such

time that new deposits allow the bank to adjust to the new long run

equilibrium.

     The amount of deposits that must be returned when the equity

requirement shifts from g to g' is found by solving for 6 in the equity

constraint using eq. (1):



          L0 + S0    -    = (D   -
                                     6)(].   +   g')


                  D(g'-g)/g'



The value of securities sold will equal the amount of deposits returned, if

the bank has sufficient securities. For example, if equity requirements are

raised from 5% to 5.5%, then 9.1% of deposits would have to be returned. If

equity requirements were to rise from 5% to 7%, 28.6% of deposits would have

to be returned.
                                       27

     The effect of increasing the equity requirement on the probability of

failure depends on the size of the increase. If the increase is small so

that all deposit returns can be funded by selling securities, simulation

results suggest that banks will be safer due to the larger equity cushion.

However, for an increase in equity requirements that forces loans to be sold

at a discount, the effect on bankruptcy probability is ambiguous. Selling

loans at a discount increases the probability of failure, while increasing

equity reduces the probability.

     The long-run experiment involves changing capital requirements prior to

selection of securities and loans in period 0. The simulations in Table 5

illustrate typical long-run results. Most striking is the effect on the

probability of bankruptcy. The increased equity requirement reduces

bankruptcy risk by providing a bigger buffer against bad loans. The cost of

this buffer is a lower expected return to equity holders.

     The change in equity requirements also effects the equilibrium amount

of security holdings. It appears that an increase in the equity requirement

slightly raises the long-run holding of securities for a large range of

parameters. The net effect of an increase in g on security holdings is a

priori ambiguous, however14. The higher the percentage of loans in the bank

portfolio, the more insurance is worth. At the same time, the higher the

percentage of securities, the less is the expected cost of liquidating

loans. An increase in g reduces the value of deposit insurance, which

reduces the marginal benefit of investing in loans. On the other hand, an

increase in g also reduces the magnitude of deposit flows relative to the

size of the portfolio as a whole, which reduces the marginal benefit of

investing in securities. The simulation results in Table 5 show that for
                                       28


the range of g considered, the first effect
                                              dominates: as insurance becomes

worth less per dollar of equity, the bank holds more securities to reduce

expected costs of liquidating loans.

8. Conclusion



      This paper presents a model of bank portfolio choice in which loan

 sales are costly due to asymmetric information about loan quality. Risk-

 neutral banks will hold riskless, marketable securities even though FDIC

 insurance provides an incentive to maximize asset risk.

      The model provides a powerful framework in which to predict the

 response of the banking sector to changes in the operating environment, and
                                        29

to policy changes. Perhaps the most valuable contribution of the model is

that it highlights the distinction between balance-sheet risk and the

overall risk of failure. Our results suggest that simple balance-sheet

measures such as the ratio of securities to loans are a poor indicator of a

bank's soundness. The most important factors affecting bankruptcy risk are

1) the variance of loan quality in the economy, and 2) the amount of equity.

     Increases in required bank equity are shown to have the long-run effect

of making banks safer, with ambiguous short-run effects. Because of the

extra equity buffer arising from an increase in required equity, it is

possible for banks to become safer in the short run even though the ratio of

loans to securities will unambiguously rise.

     We also show that with loan commitments, banks with very different

ratios of loans to securities can have similar bankruptcy probabilities.

Banks with greater off-balance-sheet commitments, such as loan commitments,

will hold additional securities in order to offset the liquidation risk

posed by the commitments. For the simulation results we present, bankruptcy

risk is surprisingly insensitive to the existence of loan commitments.

Since the constraints are inequality constraints, the Kuhn-Tucker theorem

applies, and for each constraint either the multiplier will be zero or the

constraint will be slack.



Proof of Lemmas 1 and 2: Subtracting (Al3) from (Al4) yields


   f(l+r)f(a)da +            A7     f(l+a)f(a)da +              A8

Since

   f(1+r)f(a)da
    aL                       aL
it follows that


                            f(l+a)f(a)da
with equality only when &          =
                                       aL, which implies A7             A8.       If L1        0, then A8 >

0 which implies A7 > 0            and therefore               0. If L1 is        positive      and & >

then A8 —    0,   and A7 > 0, so Sl — 0.             If Ll is positive and &
                                                                                              aL,   then the

bank is indifferent between S1 and L1, so without loss of generality l can

be set to zero. Therefore S1 is always 0.

     Note that for AS0 =
                                  S,   eq. (A12)          -
                                                              eq. (A13).         Selling old

securities    is equivalent to not buying new securities. If assets other than
                                                               32

old loans are to be held they will be new loans.//



Proof of Lemmas 3 and 4:16 We proceed by deriving the value function for

this region and computing the optimal L0 and 6. For &                                                             S0/(l+g), no new

loans can be purchased without either selling old loans or foregoing

dividends. We assume that the discount c is sufficiently large so that old,

poor loans cannot be profitably sold in order to buy new loans (if c is

large enough, liquidating old loans will bankrupt the bank). Foregoing a

dividend to buy a new loan can easily be shown to have an expected return

less than or equal to the riskfree rate, so no new loans are purchased.

Using the fact that no new loans are purchased and Lemmas 1 and 2, the

decision reduces to:

                                                                    -   rD   -       &       -       6        +

where (A18) is the equity constraint, and (A19) gives the minimum

liquidation necessary to return the required deposits. Partially

differentiating (A17) with respect to L0 gives


 (A20) (1-c) -


where 1>0     0 if the bank is bankrupt, and = 1 if the bank is solvent in

period 2.          Since (1-c) (1 + aL), the sign of (A20) depends on whether or

not there is bankruptcy in period 2. The value function will be maximized
                 *
at either L or L , i.e. there is a corner solution for liquidations.

        Using the fact that AL0 equals either L or L*, we consider the two

cases to determine &

Case 1: AL0 =          L.     Substituting (Al9) into (A17), it follows that (Al7)

decreases in S , so 6 =0.
                       v         v
Case 2: AL0 =          L*.    Substituting (Al8) into (A17), the fact that (l-c)(l+g) <

1 establishes that (Al7) decreases in S
                                                     v        5° 6 =0.
                                                         ,
                                                                  V
                                                                              *
        Using the fact that &
                                       V     0, we can choose between L* and L .           This   can

be done evaluating (A17) at each of these points, which reduces to choosing



max ( L(l-c) + flmax[ 0, (L0-L*)(l+a2) -                     (l-i-r)(D-&)      ],
         *                       *
        L (1-c) + max[ 0, (L0-L )(l-4-a2) -              (l+r)(D-&)

Clearly the choice depends on a2. With quite a bit of algebra, the critical

level of a2 can be shown to be that given in (9).



Proof of Lemma 5: As in Lemma 3 and 4, it can be shown that foregoing a

dividend to invest in new loans is unprofitable. This along with Lemmas 1

and 2 can be used to simplify the value function:


(A21)        max  S0(l+r) + a1L0 + AL0(l-c) - rD                   -   8   -        +

subject to (A18) and (Al9). The bank has S0/(l+g) - 6 in free deposits

which it will either use to invest in new loans or to repay depositors

(taking it home as a dividend would violate the equity constraint).                     As in

Lemma 3 and 4, the fact that 1 -                   (l-c)(l+g)   > 0 implies that old loans will

not be sold in order to return deposits, and it is assumed that c is

sufficiently large so that old loans won't be sold to buy new loans. It

remains to choose whether to buy new loans or to return deposits. To

satisfy the equity constraint, it must be the case that


(A22)     L1 = (S0/(l-i-g)           -   6   -
                                                 6)(l+g)

Substituting (A22) into (A2l) and differentiating with respect to 6 reduces

to:




(A23) g +               [(l+r)   -
                                         (l+a)(l+g)]f(a)d
                j
                    A



Algebra establishes that choosing S                    so that (A23) equals zero is a local

minimum. Thus either only loans are purchased, or only deposits are

returned. As in Lemmas 3 and 4, it can be shown that the choice depends

monotonically on the realization of a2, and that the critical level is given

by (9).

l.In July, 1986, commercial banks in the U.S. held total assets of $2,537
billion, of which 25.5% were investment securities and cash assets (Federal
Reserve Bulletin, October, 1986, p. Al8).

2. Kareken (1987) presents a model in which the equity requirement has no
effect on the probability of bankruptcy. He uses this example to argue that
the equity requirement need not be an effective policy tool.

3.In practice, banks must use securities as collateral when borrowing through
the discount window. Thus banks would still have a demand for securities
even with low cost access to the discount window.

4. The assumption that loan income in period 1 is certain avoids adding
uncertainy that would not qualitatively affect the results. The period 1
return is set at a premium over the risk-free rate to capture the fact that
if the period 1 return were risky, its truncated return would be above the
risk-free rate due to FDIC insurance. In a more complete model, a1 would not
be fixed, but would be a declining function of the equity-to-asset ratio.

5.The assumption that uncertainty is resolved completely is made for
simplicity. The same conclusions would follow if the bank still faced some
uncertainty about loan quality, but less than the market.

6.  The second argument in the mm function is obtained by computing the
smallest     which will pay for the withdrawal and substituting this into the
equity constraint (4).

7. This restriction has two important effects. Most importantly, it
prevents the bank from selling low quality loans and using the proceeds to
return deposits in order to slacken the equity constraint. Without this
constraint, shareholders could profitably pay themselves large dividends in
period 1 when low returns in period 2 are anticipated. Since capital
requirements are on the order 5%, any liquidation penalty slightly over 5% is
sufficient for this condition to hold. This condition also discourages the
bank from liquidating old loans that are known to be of low quality and using
the proceeds to buy new loans. In equilibrium, one would expect that the
discount will be large enough to discourage banks from selling bad loans in
order to take a new draw from the loan distribution. However, we assume
rather than prove that old loans are not sold in order to buy new loans.

8.To back loans made from new deposits, -g& of new equity must be added. We
assume that net cash flow at time 1 is sufficiently large so that the
shareholders can add this equity simply by foregoing a dividend. For the
parameter values used in the simulations, this will always be the case.

9.It should be noted that although the integration boundaries are functions
of S0, the first order condition does not include derivatives of these terms.
This is because the derivatives of integration boundaries are multiplied by
expressions which are zero when evaluated at an integration boundary.
10. The value of the bank may be thought of as a rent from the FDIC
insurance. This rent tends to be greatest when loan quality variability is
high, but deposit variability is low.

ll.A significant difference between loan commitments and deposit withdrawals
is that failure to fulfill a loan commitment does not result in bankruptcy.
These contracts in fact appear to be frequently renegotiated by both
parties. Nevertheless, it may be costly in terms of lost good will and
reputation effects for banks to abrogate loan commitments. Even
disregarding formal loan commitments, customer relationships are important
in banking, and the failure to make a loan on demand could result in a lost
customer.

l2.This only captures one dimension of the cost to a bank of a loan
commitment. For an options pricing approach to pricing loan commitments,
see Thakor (1982) and Hawkins (1982).

13.Bank value can be negative because we have not included a loan commitment
fee in the model.

14. This ambiuguity is in contrast to the effect of a change in g in
portfolio-based models of asset selection, such as Koehn and Santomero
(1980). They find that an increase in g unambiguously induces banks to
choose riskier assets.
