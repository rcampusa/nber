                                              ABSTRACT

We present a continuous time series on first cabin passenger fares for ocean travel from New York
to the British Isles covering nearly a century of time. We discuss the conceptual and empirical difficulties
of constructing such a time series, and examine the reasons for differences between the behavior of
advertised fares and those based on passenger revenues. We find that while there are conceptual differences
between these two measurements, as well as differences in the average values, the two generally moved
in parallel, which means that the advertised fare series can serve as a reasonable proxy for movement
of the revenue-based fares. We also find that advertised fares declined over time, roughly paralleling
the drop in freight rates for U.S. bulk exports, until around 1890, but thereafter increased while freight
rates continued to decline. We propose several hypotheses for this divergent behavior and suggest
lines of future research.

1. Introduction

        The 19th century transportation revolution on the North Atlantic resulted fundamentally

from the introduction of increasingly efficient coal-fuel marine steam engines, which allowed for

the deployment of faster, safer, and above all bigger, oceanic steamships. The resulting time

savings, risk reductions, lower transport costs, improved communication, and growing

transatlantic ties in business, politics, and society, had widespread and important economic

consequences. Economic historians have, however, studied these processes more with respect to

transportation of freight cargoes, and to some extent mass immigration in the steerage class, than

from the standpoint of luxury class tourism and business travel.1

        Accelerated by the U.S Civil War of 1861-65, the transition from sailing ships to

steamships was first spearheaded in the 1840s by the subsidized carrying of transatlantic mail,

where the fixed speed and guaranteed arrival times of the steamships conferred powerful benefits

to long distance communication. Lines of transatlantic steamships on regular schedules then

captured most first class traffic from North America during the 1850s, immigrant crossings in the

1860s, and freight transport in the 1870s. Although perhaps not as quantitatively important as

freight in the nineteenth century, overseas travel has nevertheless been significant and long

lasting. Today, well over 30 million Americans travel overseas each year.2 Expenditures on

travel abroad and passenger fares paid to foreign flag carriers now amount to roughly 30 percent

of all service imports in the US International Accounts.3

        Comparable balance-of-payment measures for the 19th century have been difficult to

establish, however, owing to a paucity of systematic time series of travel price data (Gould,

1979; Cohn, 2009). Steerage fares series have been compiled from shipping company sources by

Keeling (2007, 2008a), Harley (1990), and Killick (2000, 2014), and can be supplemented by

useful additional though less extensive steerage price data sets (for example, Keeling (1999b,

2007, 2008a), Feys (2007) and Hvidt (1971)). North Atlantic freight rate information has been

developed and made available by North (1958) and Harley (1988). Statistics on first class ticket

prices have lagged, however. Sporadic observations and a few time series of first class passenger

fares are available for relatively short periods of time, but there is no long term series

representative of the broader industry.4

        Studies using steerage fare series have indicated that declining prices in the early 19th

century helped boost mass migration from the British Isles, although reductions in other barriers

also played a role. By late in the century the long term trend of transatlantic steerage fares was

flat to slightly upward. With incomes also rising long term, such fares amounted to only a few

weeks or months of U.S. wages by the late 1880s, and temporary fare reductions mainly came

during fare wars provoked by cyclical downturns in migration. For these later decades, to the

limited extent that there even was much of a general association between steerage fares and

 As regards these limitations, see for instance, Aldcroft (1968) and Gould (1979). Nothing like a
consistent time series is reported in the Millennium edition of Historical Statistics of the United States
(Carter, et al, 2006); for sporadic observations and anecdotes, see Cohn (1992), Dulles (1964), Hyde
(1975), Levenstein (1998 and 2004), and Tyler (1939). See also the sources used in Kludas (1986) and
Keeling (2008a). In this paper, as in the historical literature generally, “first class” and “first cabin” are
used interchangeably to refer to the highest priced class of passenger travel.

steerage volumes, the two tended to move together and with volume changes driving price

changes more often than vice versa. In the freight segment, fluctuations in transport charges for

U.S. bulk exports depended on the interaction of fluctuating American commodity output and

variations in shipping capacity. By 1914 steerage fares had climbed back to about where they

had been in the 1830s. Freight rates, over the same time period, dropped by roughly half, but

with many ups and downs in between.

      What were the patterns of first class passenger fares during these many decades of

developing long-distance transportation and economic growth? How similar or dissimilar to

freight and steerage rates were the processes by which first cabin fares were determined, and

what might their effects have been on transportation, travel movements and transnational

commerce? Was the trend in fares for luxury class North Atlantic travel in any way akin to the

long, uneven, but significant downward trajectory of charges for cargo shipments? Or were first

class passage prices more like those in turn-of-the-20th-century steerage, subject to competitive

fluctuations but ultimately not of great significance to the travel decisions of potential

passengers? To address these issues requires a more comprehensive, consistent, and continuous

time series on passenger fares.

        In this paper we present a consistent series on passenger fares for North Atlantic travel in

first cabin collected from newspaper and magazine advertisements for nearly a century of time,

from 1826 to 1915. This series is a revised and extended version of that used by Dupont, Gandhi

and Weiss (2012) in their study of the long-term trend in overseas travel.5 The series presented

here extends the time series backward another quarter of a century, increases the average number

 This 2012 study of American overseas travel found that demand for such travel was only slightly
sensitive to changes in fares, when other factors are taken into account. Note, however, that first class
Atlantic crossings were a narrower segment of overseas travel than was examined in that earlier paper.

of fare quotations per year, and reduces the influence of seasonality on fares.6 And we have

compiled both an unweighted and weighted fare series, the latter of which accounts for

differences in passenger volumes across shipping companies.

        The details involved in the construction of these series are contained in the appendix.

There we present the evidence we collected on minimum fares for 12 of the most prominent

lines, and explain how we estimated the value in those years for which we were unable to find

any advertised fares. We also present the estimates of the passenger volumes by shipping lines

which were used to calculate the weighted average fare. In the text, we discuss the merits and

shortcomings of the minimum fare series, and compare this new series of advertised fares with

the few available revenue-based series for subperiods of time compiled from financial records of

several shipping lines.

        The two series – advertised and revenue-derived fares – measure slightly different things.

The revenue-based fares measure what passengers actually paid; the advertised fares represent

the price information on which passengers based their decision to travel. Revenue-based fares

are more desirable for some purposes, but as already noted, they are hard to come by, whereas

the advertised fares are more readily available. Our comparison of the two different series

indicates that they track each other closely, so although the average advertised fares differ

somewhat from what passengers actually paid, they accurately represent the changes in fares

paid. This is important because measuring the changes in price, after all, is the point of

constructing a price index.

fare series used in Dupont, Gandhi and Weiss (2012).

2. Evidence on Fares from Revenue-derived Data

       Nineteenth century travel across the North Atlantic was generally well documented yet

not the ubiquitous mass routine that it has become since World War Two. Nonetheless, for

almost all transatlantic travelers before the 1950s, there was no feasible way to move between

Europe and North America other than on a transatlantic ship.

        By the mid-1800s, this occurred almost entirely through vessel fleets operated by

organized “lines,” which by the late 1880s had been consolidated into an oligopoly of large

multinational passenger steamship corporations. Most were based in Europe but they had agents

in New York, the port to and from which most passengers traveled. Managing and keeping track

of passengers was a vital part of this long-lasting transnational mercantile business. The details

of every traveler’s trip, including fees paid, were recorded and reproduced multiple times by

steamship lines, with paper copies of the information going to booking agents, accountants,

government authorities, cartel administrators and the customers.

       By the late 19th century, North Atlantic steamships were among the biggest human-built

spectacles of all time. Thousands of people watched their arrivals and departures; newspapers

often reported the names of first cabin passengers. Even in this mostly “open borders” era,

passengers -especially emigrants- were also increasingly inspected and tracked by government

authorities for health, safety, military, economic, and demographic record-keeping reasons

(Brinnin, 1971).

       Data on passenger revenues and passenger volumes have allowed researchers to calculate

average revenue per passenger. Such revenue-derived fares incorporate variations in fares

between vessels due to differences in the size, speed and vintage of the ship, and the location,

spaciousness and degree of amenities provided on board. Revenue-based fares can only be

                                                                                            Page | 7
                                                                                            First Cabin Fares




generated, however, where sufficient records have been preserved, and even that derivation can

require long hours of research, interpretation and transcription.

        The revenue-based fares for Cunard and Anchor, which are shown in Figure 1,7 depict a

roughly congruent pattern over the years in which they can be compared (i.e. after 1900). Fares

were rather stable up through 1907, and then rose quite rapidly over the next five years.

Although these series cover only a portion of the period for which we have advertised fares, they

serve as a useful check on the behavior of the advertised fares, as we show below.

3. Advertised Ocean Passenger Fares

        We have used advertisements in a number of newspapers and magazines to construct a

consistent long-term series on first cabin passenger fares from 1826 to 1914. This has proved to

be an efficient method of collecting enough evidence on fares to be representative of the industry

as a whole. The New York Times, and other period newspapers and magazines, a number of them

readily available on-line, reported ship movements, departure schedules, and contained shipping

line advertisements of fares, often on a daily or nearly daily basis across the period. Compiling

fares from standardized newspaper advertisements is more feasible than excavating

heterogeneous data from the archives of multiple firms. Such a series can cover a longer time

period than the fares that might be found for any single company because no company operated

for the entire time period; and the series reflects the industry as a whole, providing a broader

perspective from which to view the fares of individual lines. Moreover, an advertised fare series

has its own merit, namely that it represents the price signals which passengers were likely to

  Cunard Voyage Abstracts, Liverpool; Killick (2014) analyses from the archives of the Cope Line of
sailing packets has also yielded a series of annual cabin fares (presumably mostly first cabin) for 1822-68.
Although that line ran from Philadelphia, its pricing appears to have been representative of New York
based packet lines. See also Killick (2000).
                                                                                                   Page | 8

have considered when deciding to travel, even though it does not always measure how much was

actually paid.

        Although it is easier to construct a consistent long term series from advertised fares than

from archival data, it is not as simple as it might seem, and the series does have its shortcomings.

These reflect the incomplete coverage of shipping lines in the ads available in each year and the

nature of the evidence revealed in advertisements. Shipping lines did not advertise all the fares

available on each ship, did not advertise fares on all their ships, and not all lines advertised fares

in all years.

        The last of these deficiencies poses a particular challenge because after 1896 there are

relatively few newspaper ads that include fare information. We have not found a direct

explanation for the demise of advertised fares at that time, but it appears related to the

contemporaneous establishment of the first more or less permanent and broadly international

North Atlantic passenger shipping cartel regulations of first class fares.

        In order to extend our fares series from 1897 up to 1914, we have therefore used

schedules of minimum fare categories set by those cartels (or “conferences”). Although not

advertised in newspapers, these fares were reported in news stories and appeared in a number of

shipping line brochures. They essentially amount, at least in general, to the travel price levels

which would have been advertised in the press, had newspaper advertisements for ocean steamer

voyages continued to include fares after 1896. So, while we refer to our 1826-1914 series as

being ‘advertised fares,’ it is more accurately a combination of advertised fares up to 1896 and

mostly cartel minimums after that.8

  There are fewer cartel minimum agreements (after 1896) than fare observations for earlier decades, but
the cartel schedules typically show fares across the full range of passenger vessels in use, not just those
ships with the lowest fares.

        The shipping companies’ decisions to cease advertising minimum fares in the mid 1890s

and rely instead on collaborative inter-firm agreements about minimum fares, specified by

vessel, across the various types and generations of ships employed within each line’s fleet, was

driven in part by shipping lines strategies. Concerned about the risks of high fixed cost shipping

capacity which at times could provoke ruinous price slashing, especially during severe cyclical

downturns, both corporate and family-owned passenger shipping enterprises were increasingly

inclined to emphasize quality improvements over cost reductions. Their marketing approach to

the luxury travel market typically centered around demonstrating rapid technical innovations,

which had the concomitant result of helping make almost every new ship series bigger faster,

safer and more comfortable than predecessors (Keeling, 1999a). Growing overseas tourism of

wealthy Americans also seems to have been associated with relative price insensitivity among

many first class travelers. A shift away from fare competition may thus also have appealed to

shipping lines by making it easier to price discriminate between passenger segments.

        For the four decades preceding World War I, Cunard, White Star and Inman/American

dominated the UK-US luxury travel market, handling nearly three quarters of the cabin traffic,

which was their business mainstay and public relations priority during most of that period. 9 At

Cunard, for example, first cabin alone generated half of corporate revenues in the 1890s.

Profitability was far from automatic, however. And, from 1894 to 1895, the companies suffered

through one of the most severe fare wars of the steamship era in the North Atlantic.10

Nonetheless, in its wake, the British lines managed to reinforce efforts at technological

  The rate slashing which arose out of a British-German dispute over transit migration traffic was
exacerbated by one the most severe economic recessions in history (Carter and Sutch, 1992, pp. 347-52).

advancement and non-price competition, in part by abandoning over a quarter century of price

quoting in their newspaper ads.

        US-UK steerage fares were in full downswing by mid-1894. The American Line, whose

key concern was in protecting price margins, had already stopped including fare quotes for

steerage or cabin that previous January.11 With steerage prices well on the rise again by April

1895, White Star stopped quoting not only bargain basement steerage fares in its ads, but any

fares at all, cabin or steerage. 12 Meanwhile Cunard (which rarely ever published ads with

steerage fares) did continue listing first cabin rates, but only until April of 1896 the month that

the representatives of major North Atlantic shipping lines, meeting in Liverpool, struck the first

of a series of lasting agreements on conference-enforced, by-vessel minimum fares in first and

second cabin.13

        These cartel minimum fare deals encouraged market regularization, and helped protect

the profitability of low-end vessels by giving them a price advantage (Murken, 90-188, 644-48).

11
   The American Line (ex Inman), which was in something of straddle position in the fare war because its
sister company, Belgium’s Red Star Line, was part of the German alliance, had its eyes fixed on new U.S.
government subsidies recently granted, to help it acquire and operate two of the 1890s world class luxury
ships. The general course of the 1894-95 fare war from the American Line’s perspective is treated in
Flayhardt, pp. 165-69, and from the German lines’ standpoint in Murken, pp. 57-61. Hyde’s history of
Cunard adds little on the fare war, but is roughly consistent, and informative, in coverage of antecedents
and aftermath, (Hyde, 1975, pp. 95-107).
12
  Key fare changes during the 1894-95 fare war are traceable in the Cunard Voyage Abstracts and by
way of steamship ads in the New York press. New York Tribune and New York Times ads indicate little
change in first cabin rates from June 1894 to May 1895 (Cunard at $60 throughout, White Star at $60,
down to $50 on July 14, 1894, then back to $60 on April 27, 1895). Steerage fares, in sharp contrast,
plunged by over half during late May through July of 1894, mostly recovering only in April-May of 1895
(Cunard Voyage Abstracts, New York to Liverpool, New York Tribune, July 11, 1894, p. 9: White Star
steerage, New York to Liverpool at $10 versus $25 the day before). Anchor’s ads apparently
discontinued during the 1894-95 steerage fare war period, and White Star was alone in consistently
displaying steerage fare quotes in its New York press ads.
13
  In the New York Tribune, American’s last ad with fare quotes (for any class of travel) was on January
25, 1894 (p. 14) and White Star’s was on May 13, 1895 (p. 8). Cunard’s final ad with fare quotes
appeared on April 10, 1896 (p. 10). Meeting in Liverpool that month, American, White Star, Cunard,
Anchor and other British lines agreed on minimum second cabin fares on April 8, and on first cabin fares
on April 16 (Murken,1922, pp. 93-94).
                                                                                                Page | 11

Keeping publicity about low-end first cabin fares out of daily news advertisements also helped

foster renewed focus on improvements in travel quality. It thus makes sense to take into

consideration cartel-set pricing in the pre-1914 period, not only because these minimum fares

acted, as did the ads before them, as indicators of broader pricing trends, but also because their

adoption was a key component of long term changes and continuities in the attitudes toward and

role of pricing and price competition within the long-distance oceanic transport business.

        Even in the years before cartel pricing became the standard, we were unable to find fares

for the same set of shipping companies in every year. In some cases this is because they had not

yet begun operation or had ceased operations, but even when companies were still in business

they did not all advertise every year. The changing composition of companies that advertised

can cause the industry average fare to vary even though the fares might have remained the same

for all lines. As described below, we deal with this by calculating a weighted average fare which

avoids the consequence of having one or more shipping companies fall out of the sample in a

given year.

        Another complicating element arising from the use of ad-based fares, is that on almost

every ship there was more than one fare and on some there were many individual fares. Most

North Atlantic passenger shipping lines offered several categories of passenger travel: first and

second class (or first and second “cabin”), as well as steerage class. Within the first class

segment itself there were also differences in accommodations and fares: by vessel, time of year,

and on-board location.14 For example, on two ships of the American Line, the St. Louis and St.

Paul, there were 21 different categories of cabins and fares in first class. The difference in fare

14
   When emigrant traffic to the U.S. declined after the passage of the Quota Law of 1921, shipping
companies transformed the former steerage space into tourist third class to appeal to lower middle-income
travelers. By the 1930s, some companies had converted their second-class space into third class
accommodations (Coons and Varias, 2003).

depended on which deck (promenade, upper or main) the cabin was located, whether it was an

outside room or inside room, and whether it had a private bath or not (Flayhart, 2000).

        Fares varied according to the speed, vintage and size of ships within each shipping line.

The fares described above for the St. Louis and St. Paul differed from those on other ships in the

American Line, being slightly higher than on the New York and Paris, which were 5 years older,

and considerably higher than on the Berlin and Chester, which were considered secondary

steamers (Flayhart, 2000). Fares also differed across shipping companies for ships of the same

size and vintage. Because not all shipping lines advertised every year, the composition of the

sample of fares changes over time and from year-to-year, which could affect the comparability of

the average minimum fare we calculate, a point we discuss further below.15

        Moreover, advertisements may not have always captured changes in fares made within a

calendar year, or reflected discounts offered during the year, especially as the time to departure

drew nigh.16 Companies would not have advertised a change in fares if that went against an

agreement set by a cartel; those who cheated would not likely advertise that fact. But even

without such cartel behavior, firms may not have advertised every change in fare. Indeed, a

number of them appear to have placed ads for a yearly schedule and did not bother to change

them even when they might actually have altered their fares.17




15
   Fares differed for other reasons as well. They differed by season and even by day of the week, the
latter perhaps reflecting a difference in the ships that sailed on particular days.
16
   Ads would not likely have captured the 25 percent reduction given to those crossing on The American
Line’s ship New York in May 1900. That discount was offered to compensate for the slower speed of the
ship as it made its way back to Liverpool for repairs after having lost one of its propellers on the trip
westward (Flayhart, 2000, p. 306).
17
   A rare exception was when Cunard on June 3, 1854 (in The Albion), advertised schedules and fares for
upcoming weekly departures adding, “In consequence of the increased cost of coal, stores and provisions,
the price of Passage will increase.”
                                                                                                Page | 13

       However wide or narrow an assortment of cabins and fares there might have been, the ads

did not list them all. Instead, they tended to list the lowest fare in the cabin class – e.g. $80 and

up - or a range of fares. Since a typical shipping company ad covered a number of ships operated

by that company, the minimum fare was generally for the least expensive ship in the listing.

Only a minority of passengers could have traveled at those minimum fares, and those fares

would not be useful for estimating the total passenger revenue for a voyage. Nevertheless, they

are useful as an indicator of the behavior of fares. The ‘average minimum fare’ for the industry

calculated from advertised quotations serves a role comparable to ‘the interest rate’ in

macroeconomics. Just as movements in ‘the interest rate’ –say the prime lending rate – are

meant to suggest how other rates are behaving, changes in ‘the minimum fare’ indicate how

other fares are moving..

       These conceptual and measurement issues, combined with the time-consuming effort of

retrieving fares for each year, made the endeavor of constructing a price series more complex

than anticipated. Nevertheless, we have collected enough advertised fares for first class

accommodations to provide a continuous time series from 1826 to 1914. Our advertised fare

series has been compiled from newspapers and magazines, especially from the New York Times,

the New York Daily Tribune, the New York Tribune, and The Albion. Because New York was by

far the single most important port of arrival for passengers traveling to and from Europe, our

series is based on fares from just this one port in the U.S. We only recorded fares from ads

showing destination ports in the United Kingdom (primarily Liverpool, but also Southampton,

London and Glasgow), because a very high percentage of American overseas travelers went to

Europe in the period before World War I, and a large fraction of them made these cities in the

UK their first stop.18 Many advertisements for travel to Liverpool or Glasgow also listed ports of

call, such as Cork, Londonderry and Queenstown, and, it seemed appropriate to include fares

advertised for these other places.19 And, our data pertain to one-way fares from New York to

Europe.20 There were very few ads for roundtrip fares, but it appears that they would have been

roughly double the one-way fare. Where a first or second class fare for westward passage was

advertised, it was typically the same or slightly less than the eastbound fare.21

        Fares included in our series come from a number of different shipping lines.22 In each

year, we collected fares from advertisements for several lines, recording summer fares - fares for

   For much of the nineteenth century, 70 to 90 percent of Americans going overseas went to Europe.
The share declined after the Civil War, but still remained above two-thirds up through World War I.
(Dupont, Gandhi and Weiss, 2012). Although tourists embarked and disembarked at a number of different
ports, New York dominated in terms of numbers of passengers (Statistical Abstract of the United States,
1890, Table 153, pp. 210-15; 1886-1909, Statistical Abstract, 1909, Table 50; 1909-1919, Statistical
Abstract, 1920, Table 71). For the period 1871-87, fifty two percent of U.S. cabin passengers came
through New York. (These are international arrivals to America, including from regions other than
Europe and including second cabin arrivals. Source: Annual Report of the Chief of the Bureau of
Statistics on the Commerce and Navigation of the United States.) For 1899-1914, New York accounted
for ninety three percent of first cabin passengers embarking for Europe; 42 percent of them traveled to
and from ports in the British Isles. Of all UK-bound first cabin passengers from the USA over that period,
90% embarked at New York, and 10% at Boston (Keeling, 2012, Voyage database).
19
   The advertisements did not usually specify any difference in fare to alternative ports when multiple
ports in the UK were listed. In any case, fares to these other UK ports account for only 5 percent of our
observations and appear to have moved in tandem with those for Liverpool. Some advertised travel to
London for little or no difference than the fare to Liverpool, although the trip required a rail journey to
London.
20
   For the most part fares are per person in double occupancy cabins. Some ships, mostly in the era of
sailing ships, reported only single occupancy fares. Occasionally, some fares included wine, but most did
not.
21
   Apparently without exception after 1896, a single conference-agreed minimum first cabin fare -for
each vessel class- applied uniformly west- and eastbound. Discounts for roundtrip bookings seem to have
been a source of some irritation to conference organizers, however, because the standard practice of 5%
or 10% “off the homeward fare” was at times granted, defacto, in both directions. The actual discount
given evidently remained fairly modest. The 1896 conference deal proscribed roundtrip discounts
altogether. From 1902 to 1906, they were “10% off homeward” or effectively 5% of the ad-listed fare.
The 1908 conference seems to have effectively abolished them for good up until the First World War. See
Murken (1922, pp. 94-94, 102-03, 343, 672).
22
  The sample includes fares from the four most significant and long-lived passenger shipping firms on
the New York to Britain route: Cunard, White Star, Anchor, and Inman/American.

sailings in May through August - in almost all instances. Many ads displayed more than one fare

or a range of fares for first class that reflected the different locations of the cabin as described

above as well as differences in other amenities within that class. With enough additional

evidence on the distribution of cabins according to different amenities it would be possible to use

the range of fares to construct an average first class fare, but lacking that evidence we used only

minimum fares. We took the minimum fare (or the lowest value of the range) advertised for

summer sailings for each shipping line and averaged those across all lines to calculate both an

unweighted average minimum for the industry in that year, and a weighted average in which the

fare for each line is weighted by that line’s actual or estimated share of first cabin traffic to the

UK from New York.23

        As can be seen in Figure 2, the advertised minimum fares varied considerably across

lines and fluctuated quite a bit from year to year, while the average declined through the end of

the 1880s, leveled off for a bit, then swung upward beginning in 1890s. Nominal fares at the end

of the period were below those that prevailed on early passenger steamships before the Civil

War, and well below fares on sailing vessels earlier in the century, but were not much different

than those in the 1870s by which time the cost, speed and safety advantage of second generation

steam ships, with screw propellers and metal hulls, had enabled them to capture, from sailing

ships, all segments of the North Atlantic passenger traffic. Already by 1864 over 90% of first

cabin traffic between New York and Europe was carried on steamships.24

23
   Although rather crude, the methodology is similar to that used by Isserlis to construct his classic series
on freight rates. See Mitchell (1988). To simplify calculations, a few smaller lines were not used in
deriving the weighted and unweighted average series shown in Table 1, in appendix Tables 1 and 2, and
in figures 4, 5, 6 and A-1. The largest such example is probably the Atlantic Transport Line, which
carried first cabin during the final years of the period; its limited available fares were close to the overall
averages, so omitting it has had little effect on those averages.

           We think that most of the variation in fares reflects the ups and downs of the economy, as

well as the reality of entry and exit into the industry.25 But, it may also reflect the fact that we

were unable to find ads for a consistent subset of firms in all years, even when they were still in

business. This would not matter much if the fares for all firms were roughly the same, but they

were not as can be seen in Figure 3.

       Cunard, the first line to offer regular ongoing transatlantic steamship service beginning in

1840, advertised above-average fares for quite some years, but after 1865 converged towards the

levels offered by its leading competitors Inman and Guion.26 North German Lloyd, by then the

leading German-based passenger carrier, also made port calls in England. Initially it advertised

fares below Cunard’s, but after 1865 almost always had the highest listed prices. In order to have

a series that abstracts from variation that reflects the changing composition of the sample, we use

a weighted fare series.

       The weighted minimum fare series was constructed using actual or estimated shares of first

class passenger volume for each line, which varied from year to year.27 Cunard was the

dominant line during most of the period after starting service to New York in 1848, but also

typically charged higher fares than most if not all competitors. The weighted fare series thus

tends to edge above the unweighted series in years when Cunard’s market share was relatively

higher than normal. Nevertheless, the weighted and unweighted minimum fares are highly

correlated over the period from 1863 to 1914 as can be seen in Figure 4 (the correlation

25
  For example, during the economic slump of the 1890s, Inman, Guion and National (which together had
carried upwards of 40% of cabin passengers between the UK and USA during 1860s, ‘70s and ‘80s) all
went out of business or were shrunk and merged into other lines. See Keeling (2012, pp. 18-19). (Inman
was merged into American in 1886 (Bonsor, 1955, p. 235).
26
  There are many other examples of such variations between lines. Typically they were associated with
the types of vessels used: faster, larger, more spacious, and more modern ships could and did charge
higher fares (Murken 1922, pp. 107-09).

coefficient is 0.95). The average annual difference between them is about 2 percent, and there

are only six years where the differences are greater than 10 percent.

           First cabin fares fell steadily until the 1890s, partly reflecting increased competition.28

By 1889, the average weighted fare was half its 1863 value, but fares began increasing again in

the 1890s, somewhat earlier than occurred in the revenue-based fares shown in Figure 1. On the

eve of the First World War, both the weighted and unweighted fares had nearly climbed back to

the levels of the mid-1860s.

           The post-1890 surge in fares was significant, but only partially reversed the longer term

decline in passenger fares since 1826. Weighted fares increased an average of 2.6 percent

annually between 1890 and 1914, compared to a decrease of 1.4 percent per year between 1826

and 1889. A simple regression of weighted average fares on a time trend from 1826 to 1889

yields a coefficient of -1.4 as compared to 1.75 for the post-1890 period. This reversal in trend

for the weighted fares is evident in Figure 4 and is also confirmed by econometric tests for

structural breaks.29



4. Comparisons between the Behavior of Ad Fares and Revenue-derived Fares

           In Figure 5, the average revenue fare series for the Cunard and Anchor lines, available

starting in 1883, is compared against the respective advertised minimum fares of those two lines.

As expected, for each company, the revenue-based series was always higher than the advertised

series, and the two series moved in similar fashion over time. How much higher the revenue

  The Herfindahl index fell steadily between the 1860s and 1880s before increasing in the late 1800s and
early 1900s. A similar pattern is evident in the three-firm concentration ratios. The two fare series are
highly correlated with the HHI: the correlation coefficient between the HHI and the weighted fares is
0.69, and 0.645 with the unweighted fares. Nearly half the variation in weighted fares can be explained
by the HHI in a simple OLS regression.

fares were above the ad fares could and did vary for several reasons: for instance, companies

sometimes altered the range of on-board accommodations and amenities, price differences could

shrink or expand with the season and over the life of the vessel, and the composition, tastes and

pocketbooks of the traveling clientele also fluctuated.30

        The example of Cunard illustrates a further source of variation in the revenue fare-ad fare

differential: the whole catalogue of first cabin fare categories -from the modest interior rooms to

the palatial suites on upper decks- varied by vessel. A shift towards more luxury vessels would

tend to boost a line’s average revenue per passenger without impacting the minimum advertised

fare, which was set by the lower end vessels in the company’s fleet (regardless of how typical or

atypical they were of the line’s overall offering). Thus, even though Cunard’s revenue fares were

above the industry’s weighted average advertised fare by 30 to 40 percent for most of the period,

the difference widened notably by 1909-14, to 50 percent or more, illustrating the salient role of

the vessel mix in determining overall price levels.

        After White Star was bought by J.P. Morgan’s shipping “trust” in 1902, Cunard, not

wanting to suffer the same fate, began a modernization program by which it leapfrogged over the

technological level and ship investment programs of its rival firms. The strategy centered on the

launch of Cunard’s Lusitania and Mauretania in late 1907. This famous pair were the most

expensive and modern vessels of their day and the fastest ocean liners in the world. More

crucially, they were extremely popular with all categories of passenger - including those in first

class - and in the new and more solid passenger conference (cartel) agreements of early 1908,

30
   Even if the fares for each cabin remained the same from one year to the next, the average revenue-
based fare would remain unchanged only if the ships were occupied with the same adult-child and sex
composition of passengers. If, as seems typical, fares for the highest priced first class quarters were ten
times higher than the low-end minimum priced cabins, one percent of passengers deciding to switch from
minimum to top-end accommodations would raise the overall average first class fare paid by ten percent.

                                                                                                  Page | 19

they were rated in the highest price category: their minimum first class fare was set at $124

(Keeling, 2007, 2012). The impact of these extraordinarily high minimum fares on Cunard’s

average fare can be seen in Figure 5. With the Lusitania and Mauretania included, Cunard’s

average fare was $25 higher than it would have been without them. The result is that the average

weighted fare was about 75 percent of Cunard’s if we exclude the Lusitania and Mauretania; if

they are included, the weighted fares are only 63 percent of Cunard’s (between 1908 and 1914).

          The new Atlantic Conference deals also helped instigate and enforce a general rise in

fares after 1908, including at the low end where Anchor advertised. The effect is noticeable in

Cunard’s revenue based series, as we have just described, but it also shows up in the advertised

series. The movement of the advertised series reflects both an increase in the minimum fares by

the cartels, even for the slowest vessels, as well as the effect of the surge of cabin passenger

traffic enjoyed by Cunard, thus giving Cunard’s higher fares a larger weight in the advertised

fare series.31

          Cunard’s modernization program was not fully complete until 1914 when the third sister

ship, Aquitania, joined Mauretania and Lusitania. In the interim, White Star and HAPAG also

built newer ships and drew off some of Cunard’s traffic. Ironically, Anchor saw the largest

percentage increases in first class passenger traffic between 1908 and 1913, but the annual

increase in its first class passenger flow was still less than what Mauretania and Lusitania took

in an average month (and in 1912 Cunard “purchased the entire ordinary share capital” of

Anchor).32 The growth in bookings on the newer, more luxurious – and higher priced -

Mauretania and Lusitania reveals itself in the jump in Cunard’s average revenue per passenger.


31
   Most of this surge in passengers was booked on ships with the higher mandated minimum price
categories. See Murken (1922, pp 325-360, 671).

Between 1907 and 1914, the average fare on all of Cunard’s vessels rose by 41 percent, but when

confined to vessels other than the Mauretania and Lusitania, the average rose by only 18

percent. Over this same time period, the average advertised fare rose by 40 percent. In other

words, advertised fares track rather well the behavior of Cunard’s fares, even when Cunard was

making large increases in capacity of the most luxurious and highest priced cabins. And, the

advertised series behaves very similarly to that for Cunard for the previous 8 years. From 1900

to 1907, Cunard’s fares rose on average by only 3 percent while the advertised fare series

remained unchanged.33

          First cabin fares on the pre-World War I North Atlantic varied seasonally to a modest

extent (though more than in steerage) and cyclically as well (less so than in steerage).34 But,

more importantly, they also varied by route, line, and -unlike steerage- by vessel and on-board

location on the vessel. Revenue-based fares better capture the net effect of these various

influences, but such data sets are rare. Thus it is useful to see that while the level of the

advertised fare series differs from a revenue-based series – something that would be true even if

the latter were representative of the entire industry – it seems to be a reasonable indicator of the

long term trend in fares (and, to a lesser extent, of fluctuations in them), and thus provides for a

consistent long term series on changes in this key variable that will be useful in reexamining a

number of issues in the history of transportation.




33
   The two series changed at much different rates between 1883 and 1900, due largely to the 1883
advertised fare being unusually high relative to Cunard’s fares. The advertised fares rose noticeably from
1882 to 1883 when four of the sample firms - Cunard, White Star, Inman and National – raised their
minimum fares by 10 percent or more over the preceding year. In 1894 they all reduced them to the 1882
level. About half the divergence between the two series is accounted for by that hike in fares.

5. General Findings

     An important point to take from this investigation into passenger fares is the compatibility

of revenue-based fare calculations with time series compilations from contemporary

advertisements. Not only have we found that there is statistical consistency between the two

series, we also found numerous examples of correspondence and agreement between the fares

quoted in newspaper advertisements, and those specified in steamship line brochures, travel

agent literature, industry conference agreements and compilations of other business and

governmental entities. Indeed these consistencies are not a surprise, given the widespread

standardization of regulations, policies, practices, marketing strategies, and public relations of

the North Atlantic passenger shipping companies of the period, and their frequently high degree

of interdependence and collaboration. This general consistency means that the two can be used

together to pursue future research, such as investigating the interplay between publicly marketed

prices and actual revenue generation, or possibly working the revenue-derived calculation

procedure in reverse, in order to estimate transport company finances from fares and volumes.

      Overlapping sources also raise potential for substitution to fill gaps, and for slight

differences to perhaps yield insights regarding atypical episodes such as fare wars. Newspaper

advertisements can also enable longer time series than, for example, corporate records, and

future digitalization of additional historical periodicals may help make resulting time series

further extendible across both time and geographical space.

      First class advertised fares offer insights into the structure of travel prices across the North

Atlantic in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. With a larger sample of fares than we

have used here, it would be possible to track pricing differences more systematically by category

of ship, destination port, shipping line and season of travel. The ads and compatible conference

                                                                                               Page | 22

minimum fare settings show how differences in price offerings mainly stemmed from differences

in the types of vessels. Cunard, for example, generally had more higher-priced express liners,

whereas Anchor had slower, smaller vessels providing functional yet less luxurious travel

accommodations.

       Such vessel differences influenced price variation by port, although ports were different

for other reasons as well. Fares from New York to Glasgow and London might be generally

lower than to Liverpool, for example, partly due to being serviced more by lower-fare category

vessels, but also as part of a policy to help smaller ports compete with larger ones. Southampton,

in contrast, seems to have used its relative proximity (by rail) to London to develop a niche as a

hub or port of call for top-price category vessels of the several lines taking on and disembarking

passengers there.

       Beyond the general value of fares as a source for illuminating price-setting and structure,

the resulting time series they generate can provide meaningful detail on the long term trajectory

of travel prices, company competition, as well as exit and entry of firms and ships. The long term

trend over 1826 to 1914 on the key New York to Britain corridor was one of first class fare

declines over time, up until the late 1880s, with drops in passage prices concentrated on specific

episodes (as can be seen in figures 2 and 4). Developing this first consistent series of annual

minimum ad fares marks a valuable step towards uncovering the causes and effects of those fares

and changes in them, and for making informed comparisons between the rates for cabin travel,

steerage travel and freight transport.

6. Comparison of First Cabin, Steerage and Freight, and Possibilities for Future Research

     The pattern, trajectory and year-to-year detail of the first class New York to Britain fares

series suggest a number of implications for the transportation and economic history of the North

Atlantic. A key sub-period of interest is the late 1860s through the 1880s.

     Across the nearly three quarters of a century of transatlantic steamship travel from New

York prior to the First World War, the middle quarter century after the U.S. Civil War is

arguably the most dynamic in general, and for first class travel in particular. In 1866,

transatlantic telegraph connections became permanent. America’s transcontinental railroad and

the Suez Canal were completed a few years later. Communication and transport links were

globalizing the world, British ownership dominated global merchant shipping tonnage, and New

York and Liverpool were leading international ports anchoring the ends of the premiere long-

distance travel corridor (Headrick 1988), pp. 25-27, 50, 99).

       A year later Cunard retired the last of its early generation wooden paddlewheel

steamships. After a few more years, the four U.K. steamship lines which were to carry over 90%

of first cabin passengers between Liverpool and New York up until World War I (Cunard, White

Star, Anchor, Inman/American) had all launched vessels with compound engines. These engines

reduced fuel costs “by about a half, with a corresponding reduction in bunker requirements and a

considerable increase in space available for freight” (Bonsor 1955, 90, 93). By the 1880s, twin

propellers, triple expansion engines, and steel hulls were further improving vessel strength,

lowering coal requirements, and (by eliminating the need for auxiliary sails) enabling

construction of the tall superstructure-laden express steamers which were to characterize “the

standard ocean liner” (Keeling 1999b, 46, 68) for nearly a century to follow. A particularly early




                                                                                            Page | 24
                                                                                         First Cabin Fares




and important result of this turning point in international travel was the concomitant sizable

increase in the space and amenities available for luxury-oriented cabin class customers.

      Steerage and freight traffic also mushroomed during those post-Civil War years: European

immigration to America relative to the population reached a historic highpoint in 1882, surpassed

only (slightly) during the potato famine era influx of 1850-51 (Keeling 2008a, 267). Over the

quarter century ending in 1889, U.S. exports of wheat sextupled in volume, and the huge cargo

holds of the new British liners enabled them to all but drive sailing ships and tramp steamers off

the North Atlantic (Statistical Abstracts of the United States, Harley, 2008 and also 1971;

Graham, 1956). But even more striking developments took place in the first class travel segment.

        By 1870, 90% of North Atlantic passenger steamers’ pre-1914 transit time gain over

sailing ships had been achieved, the major U.K. lines were all providing at least weekly

departures from New York, and enroute mortality was continuing a long decline.35 Electric

lighting and the first forms of refrigeration were soon to become standard onboard features as

well. Cabin traffic between New York and the U.K. increased fourfold over the years between

1866 and 1889.36 At the end of those two and a half decades of huge improvements in service

frequency, safety and on-board comforts, first class travelers were, however, paying fares about

40% lower (1886-90 versus 1866-70: from data used in Figure 2. See also Figure 6). This

buoyant performance before 1890 contrasts noticeably with what took place in first class travel

on the New York – UK corridor for the two and half decades after 1890, during which first cabin

fares increased while first cabin passenger traffic stagnated. What is consistent for both the

   For European emigrants of the early 1880s it fell to a level below that of those staying in Europe

   Some of this increase was in the second class, but available statistics for Cunard show a nearly
threefold increase of first class volume alone (NY Commissioners of Emigration, Cunard Voyage
Abstracts). Re improvement in on-board amenities, see for instance, Brinnin (1971, pp. 273, 279, 363).

decades before and the decades after 1890s is the negative correlation of first cabin fares and

passenger volumes, which was stronger than might be expected given that most pre-World War I

first class transatlantic passengers were wealthy tourists not especially sensitive to the prices of

tickets for the oceanic transit.

        Further comparisons of price and volume patterns of first cabin, steerage and freight

during 1866-89 corroborate the unexpected degree of negative association between fare levels

and passenger tallies in the first cabin. 37 Although steerage fares over these two and a half

decades fell about as much as first class fares did, steerage bookings rose by only about two-

thirds of the increase racked up in first class. As might be anticipated, first cabin had fluctuations

(average deviation from trend) well below those of steerage and freight. The unanticipated result

from these comparisons, however, is that negative year-to-year correlation of price and volume

for first cabin was not only stronger than that of steerage (whose customers, were after all, not

purchasing discretionary leisure) but for that of freight as well.38

        Explaining why first class fares and passenger volume moved in generally opposite

directions so often and for so long will require more research to sort out the relative importance

of different variables and competing hypotheses. Consider just the following possibilities

involving the interaction between changing fares, the response of shipping managers, and the

volume of travel.39 Does the negative correlation of first cabin fares and volumes, strongest for

  Dupont, Gandhi, and Weiss (2012) estimated an own price elasticity of -0.25 for all passengers to all
international destinations. The estimated elasticity using the more restricted first class passengers and
fares to the UK that are described in this paper is about -0.5.
39
   As elaborated below, there are a number other factors at work, such as changes in income, in the price
of tourist goods and services abroad, in exchange rates, and in the relative price of domestic travel that
would need to be taken into account in any explanation. See Dupont, Gandhi and Weiss (2012) and

the sub-period 1866-89 but also detectable across the full period since 1826 (see Figure 6),

reflect budget-minded tourists splurging on European tours during the 1870s and 80s when fares

to England were dropping, but vacationing elsewhere after 1890 when the price of oceanic

passage rose again? Or did low-end tourist travel to Europe continue to increase after 1890 but

only in second class, the fastest growing passenger segment across the final quarter century to

1914? A third scenario is that when growth in tourist travel, which arguably had been driven

mainly by improvements to safety, convenience and comfort, slowed with more gradual

technical progress after 1890 and increased competition from other leisure pursuits, shipping

executives and owners responded differently than before. In the heady boom years after the Civil

War, largely unchecked by cartel arrangements, it might be supposed that they threw caution to

the winds, expanding capacity even faster than demand, and accepting lower fares, “made up”

for -at least in part- by higher volumes. Then, more circumspect after the punishing cyclical

downturns of the 1880s and ‘90s, shipping managers might have changed to emphasizing service

quality, risk reductions, and corporate reputation over the pace of revenue expansion, and

attempting to make up for a lack of growth in luxury class passenger volume by using route

restrictions, governmental barriers, and interfirm cartel deals to keep first class ticket prices

propped up. Although we cannot answer these questions here, our new series of annual fares

helps make such hypotheses more testable.

       An early twentieth century study of ocean steamship management suggested that “ocean

fares have fluctuated less, and have, on the whole, been maintained at a higher level than

freights” because technological scale economies and increased efficiencies in marine engineering

were, for passenger steamers, “largely offset by the additional costs occasioned by increased




                                                                                              Page | 27

speed, comfort, luxury and betterments of passenger service.” 40 Our evidence (Figure 7)

corroborates that claim of freight rates exhibiting lower fluctuations, but presents a somewhat

different picture than presumed with respect to price trends. While they decreased less than did

freight rates, long term first class passenger fares also exhibited a general downward drift, up to

about 1890. Thereafter movement in passenger fares began to diverge from that of freight rates,

trending higher while freight rates continued their long-term decline. This might reflect increased

efforts to substantially improve travel amenities as suggested by Johnson and Huebner, and made

evident with Cunard’s launching of the Lusitania and Mauritania in 1907. Or it might have been

more a matter of passenger lines using stronger cartel price support, especially after 1908, to

collect at least some offsetting revenue -through fare increases- for the mild cost inflation

incurred since the 1890s and for enhancements provided to passengers. Our consistent series of

first cabin passenger fares, for the key New York - U.K. routes, provides a vital measuring stick

for use in assessing such possibilities.

          Better fare data also make more feasible the exploration of other potential historical

overlaps between technological and market developments across the cabin, steerage and freight

segments of North Atlantic shipping. How fungible was fixed capital in shipping industries, and

how quickly could assets be shifted to a different use? What role did pricing play in the

overlapping and interchangeable accommodating of tourists and migrants in second class, and in

the overall management of passenger capacity and pass-through of fuel economies in the form of

improvements to on-board travel quality? How important were scale economies in price-setting

across the passenger segments and vessel categories? To what degree might trends in fares have

been significantly related to changes in routing, regulations, and corporate competition, collusion

and consolidations? How did trends in first class fares from New York compare to patterns of

other costs, such as hotel prices or cost of rail travel, involved in a “belle epoch” grand tour of

Europe.

      Available statistics for freight, steerage and cabin show a roughly six to eightfold increase

in volume between 1826 and 1914, which is slightly lower than the contemporaneous increase in

the U.S. population. This suggests an only minor stimulating role was played by the approximate

halving of Atlantic transit prices for freight and cabin over that span (and for steerage fares,

mostly reversed by the end of it).41 Was the development of first cabin travel ultimately based

more on the growth of non-price related market demand than on transportation revolution-related

reductions in travel expenses? If so, might this augment and support the similar argument of

Jacks and Pendakur (2010) concerning oceanic trade?

      And suppose such conclusions were to hold up, i.e. that falling costs of freight shipping and

oceanic travel were not key late nineteenth century “drivers” of either the contemporaneous

“trade boom” or the growth in first class transatlantic travel. If it turns out that lower fares did

not induce higher passenger volumes (in other words the demand for luxury class tourist travel to

Europe in this era was not driven by falling costs of the oceanic transit), what about factors on

the supply of such travel? With oceanic shipping’s expenses famously consisting

overwhelmingly of fixed costs, and (using the example of Cunard, 1900-14) with a five percent

net profit margin relative to revenues (a quarter of it attributable to first class traffic), a first class

passenger traffic relatively unresponsive to fare changes would mean that a ten percent fare hike

  Sources for these volumes are those referenced above in the discussion concerning 1866-89 for freight

would increase profits by something approaching fifty percent.42 One could well imagine such

dynamics influencing strategies of the corporations supplying first class travel service. Such

considerations also suggest potential for using fares data to measure and evaluate developments

in the industrial structure of maritime passenger transport. To what degree, for example, might

trends in fares have been significantly related to changes in routing, regulations, and corporate

competition, collusion and consolidations?



7. Conclusions

        Prior studies of nineteenth and early twentieth century travel, though insightful in many

ways, have been limited by a paucity of consistent and continuous data on travel costs. For first

class passenger traffic between the United States and the British Isles our research shows not

only that such data do exist, but that they can be gathered from various scattered sources and

compiled into a reasonably reliable, representative and informative long term time series. First

class fares from New York to Britain presented and analyzed here indicate a long term decline in

the costs of transatlantic tourist and business travel, between the 1820s and the early 1890s, in

some respects more similar than expected to the better-known reduction of costs for goods

shipments. Tracing the trends, likely origins and possible impacts of prices for cabin class

transatlantic travel, potentially in conjunction with contemporaneous observations of price

patterns for freight and steerage, may help future studies uncover and explain economic

similarities, differences and interactions between these transport segments, all of which can now

be more readily approached with the available assistance of a comprehensive long term series of

first cabin fares.

              First Cabin Passenger Fares from New York to Great Britain, 1826-1914



        Our series on passenger fares for ocean travel in first cabin class was collected from

newspaper and magazine advertisements for nearly a century of time, from 1826 to 1914,

supplemented in the years after 1896 with evidence from a few advertising brochures, and from

shipping conference agreements setting minimum fares by vessel and vessel category. Although

the ads contained fares for second cabin, and sometimes for third cabin as well as steerage, we

have restricted our series to first cabin fares for summer sailings.43 All the fares we used were

for departures from New York to ports in the United Kingdom because a very high percentage of

travelers went to Europe in the period before World War I, and a large fraction of them made the

UK their first stop.44 The most commonly observed destinations listed in advertisements were

Liverpool (53%), Southampton (16%), Glasgow (14%, mostly on Anchor line), and London

(11%).45 .



43
   We would like to have had observations that came from ads that appeared in the same month,
preferably June, and quoted fares for sailings in June through August. We were unsuccessful in that, but
almost all the fares we have recorded pertain to sailings during the months of May through September. In
a few instances it is not certain that a fare was for summer sailings. Some ads in April and May, for
example, would include sailings in June, suggesting a summer sailing, but the minimum fare advertised
might have pertained to only the departures in late May.
44
   For much of the nineteenth century the share of American travelers going to Europe ran between 75
and 90 percent. It declined somewhat after the Civil War, but still remained above two-thirds up through
World War I, and even up through the Great Depression (Dupont, Gandhi and Weiss, 2012). Over the
period 1900-14, 93 percent of first class passengers between the U.S. and Europe used the port of New
York, and 42 percent of them traveled to and from ports in the British Isles (Keeling, 2008a).
45
  In many cases, the advertisements also listed other destinations in the UK, such as Cork, Londonderry
and Queenstown. Because these other ports appear to have been substitutes for Liverpool or Glasgow, we
included fares advertised for these other places in a few years for which we were unable to find fares for
the major ports
                                                                                                Page | 31

          We recorded fares from more than 30 different shipping lines, and 30 individual

steamships, but our calculations of the industry averages are based on a subset of lines for most

of which we had 20 or more annual observations. The total number of observations in the sample

is 363. In order to calculate the weighted average fare in the period 1863 to 1914, we

supplemented these observations with estimates of fares in those years for which we were

missing an observation.46 Almost all the missing fares were estimated as equal to the average

value of fares in the surrounding years for that shipping line. The estimated fares and method of

estimation are shown in the notes to Table A2.

          On average we ended up with roughly 4 observations per year, although the number

varied from 1 or 2 in some years to more than 10 in others. For the years 1826 to 1862 our fares

came primarily from three sailing lines (1826-55), Cunard (1848-62), and the Great Western

steamship company. For the latter, we have only 11 observations, but they are concentrated in

the important period 1838-46, when the industry began the transition from sail to steam.47 For

the period 1863-1914, the calculations are based on fares for eight steamship lines, for each of

which we had a fare for 20 years or more.48

          The unweighted average fares are the simple average of the observations for the fares of

those firms in the two subperiods, sail and steam, and the two combined in the period of

transition. The average weighted fares for the industry were calculated by weighting the fares for



46
     For the period 1826-1862, we estimated fares for two years, 1847 and 1855. See Table A1.
47
  Near the end of the period we also have observations for several other steamship lines, as shown in
Table A1.
48
  The only firm of note that was not among those used to calculate the averages is the Atlantic Transport
Line because we could find only 7 observations. In the late 1890s and early 20th century its volume was
comparable to that of either German line.

each individual line by its share of the total first cabin passenger volume. These were derived in

two parts: 1826-1862 and 1863-1914 as described below.



Passenger Volumes and Weighted Average Fares, 1826 to 1862

          For this earlier period, we do not have data on passenger volumes by line, but for the

most part this is not necessary because the fares across lines were very similar. For the first part

of that period, 1826-37, only sailing vessels operated, and the fare quotes in the ads by the

various lines were nearly identical. And from 1838 to 1846, when the Great Western Steamship

Company was the only steam alternative to sailing packets, its fares were almost identical to

theirs. We thus saw little need for weighting in the years 1826 to 1846, and the average

weighted fare equals the unweighted fares.

          Beginning in 1847, the fares of different lines began to diverge, even among sailing lines.

For 1847, a year for which we have observations for only sailing lines, we assigned a larger

weight (2/3rds) to the NY-Liverpool Packets, and a smaller weight of one third to the average

fare for the two London based packet lines.49 According to Coleman (1972, 88), "The packet

was entirely an American vessel. The British merchant marine never made any real attempt to

compete in this trade."50 So we assigned a larger weight to the US based NY-Liverpool line.

          After 1848, when Cunard began service to New York, fares differed more noticeably

across lines, especially the fares of Cunard and the sailing lines, so weighting seemed desirable.

Our chief concern was to account for the relative importance of Cunard. Based on the histories



49
  Strictly speaking, we should perhaps have used these same share weights in the years prior to 1847, but
because the fares of the different lines were so similar we chose not to do so.

of the entry and exit of the various major shipping lines as described in Hyde (1975), Bonsor

(1955) and other sources, Cunard and Collins had the lion's share of the passengers in the

1850s.51 The Collins Line had some of the largest volumes in the 1850s, but it remained in

business for only a short time, from April 1850 to February 1858.52 Because its fares were

nearly identical to Cunard we have combined the two lines.53 As Collins faded out after 1855

Inman and the German lines, and to a lesser extent Anchor, moved into the market. Based on

these narratives, we set Cunard (as a proxy for Cunard and Collins) at 70% for 1853-55 when it

was at its peak importance. Then, as new steamship competition arose, reduced it to 60% in 1856

and then to 50 percent from 1857 to 1862 as Inman and the German lines entered the market.54

The assumed weights of 50 percent for Cunard and 50 percent for all others in 1862 is close to

the observed value for 1863, and yield a weighted fare for 1862 at the same level as that for

1863.

        In the five years before 1853, Cunard and Collins were newcomers to the transoceanic

passenger market, which had been the nearly exclusive domain of sailing ships. We put

Cunard’s share at 40 percent in 1848, to reflect the strength of the sailing lines; then increased it

to 50 percent in 1849 and 1850, as sailing vessels became less and less able to compete with the

51
   Hyde, (1975, 38) reports that in 1852 (11 months), Collins carried 4,300 passengers and Cunard 3,000.
Although we don’t know the total number of cabin passengers in that year, the 7,300 would represent
around 70 percent of the total cabin passenger volumes carried in the years immediately after the Civil
War.
52
   According to Bonsor (1955, 208-08), Collins was in business from 1850-57, but it ship losses were by
early 1856 a "blow from which the Company never fully recovered" (205)
53
  Indeed Collins and Cunard colluded to fix fares, something not revealed until after the demise of
Collins.
54
   Sailing fares were not found after 1855, so they are not included in our averages after that. This is of
little consequence as the maritime history sources are fairly clear that once Cunard started regular service
to New York in 1848, its steamships very quickly captured most of the first cabin traffic from sailing
packets. By 1864, sailing vessels carried less than 10% of passenger traffic.
                                                                                                   Page | 34

speed and comfort of the steam ships; and then with Collins’s entry we raised their combined

share to 60 percent in 1851 and 1852.

        The residual share of the passenger volume that was not assigned to Cunard was used to

weight the fares of the other lines as follows: For the period 1848-55, the non-Cunard share was

assigned to the sailing lines in the proportion described for 1847.55 After 1855, the non-Cunard

share was used to weight the average of all the other fares observed, all of which were for

passage on steamships.

        The fares for individual lines, and the average fares, both weighted and unweighted are

shown in Table A1. The passenger volume shares used to calculate the weighted averages are

shown in Table A2.



Passenger Volumes and Weighted Average Fares 1863-1914
        For the period after 1863 we had more complete evidence on passenger volumes so were

able to construct a weighted minimum fare series using actual or estimated shares of first class

passenger volume for each of eight lines. The total number of passengers from the UK to the US

for each of the British lines was taken from a variety of sources including the New York

Commissioner of Emigration, the New York Times, and, in later years, records of the

Transatlantic Passenger Conference. Estimates for passengers on the two German lines, HAPAG

and NGL, were derived by assuming that the German figures equal 10 percent of the total US to

UK passenger traffic in each year, and assuming that these passengers were evenly split between




55
  We did not include the $55 fare found for the Great Western Company in 1852. That fare was
noticeably out of line with all other fares, and in any case its share of the passenger volume could not
have been very large.
                                                                                                   Page | 35

the two German lines.56 Passenger volumes, and therefore the weights based on them, vary from

year to year, but Cunard accounted for roughly one-third of passenger traffic between 1863 and

1914, so its fares had substantial influence on the weighted average series.

       The fares for individual lines for the period 1863 to 1914, both those observed and those

estimated, and the average fares, both weighted and unweighted, are shown in Table A3. The

passenger volumes used to calculate the weighted fares are shown in Table A4.




56
  The 10 percent rule-of-thumb is based on the U.S. Special Consular Reports (1895-1905) and the
Commerce and Finance series eastbound passenger traffic, which indicate that the German lines carried
roughly 10 percent of passengers.

Sources: Weighted average passenger fares are from the appendix Tables A1 and A3. The freight index is from North (1958, Appendix Table
2, p. 549). North’s series ends in 1910, but is consistent over nearly the entire period. Other series extending beyond 1910, such as Harley’s
(1990, Appendix Tables), show a turnaround in freight rates from 1911-13, but this has little impact on the long term trend.

Notes and Sources: For sources of first cabin fares see the notes to Table A3:

        We assumed the 1849 fare for the London line of packets was equal to the fare observed in every other year. We did this so that there

would not be a spurious upward spike in fares in 1849 due entirely to the absence of a fare for the London line. We assumed the 1855 fare for the

NY-Liverpool line was the same as that in the preceding 4 years for which we have observations.

        Notes and Sources: Based on comments by Hutchins (1941), for 1847 we assigned a 2/3rds

weight to the NY-Liverpool fare, and one-third to that for the London packets. In the years 1848 to

1855 we assigned these lines the respective 2/3rd and 1/3rd of the non-Cunard share. Great Western

was excluded from the calculation in 1852 because its fare seems way out of line. Its share could not

have been very large in any case.

Notes to Table A3:

        Figures in italics were estimated as described below. We did not adjust any fares advertised during the Greenback Era because
the prices were specified in gold in most instances, or when not so specified the values appear to be equivalent to gold prices. In a few
cases the ads stated ‘in currency’, but converting them to gold would have only a negligible effect on our weighted and unweighted
fares series so we made no adjustment.

        Fares were estimated for a number of years in order to allow calculation of the weighted average. For the following, the fares were
estimated as equal to the average value of fares in the surrounding years for that shipping line.
        Cunard: 1865, 1875-76, 1878-80, 1899, 1901, 1906, and 1909-12;
        White Star: 1863, 1866, 1899, 1901, 1906, and 1909-12;
        Anchor: 1863, 1866, 1872, 1876, 1878, and 1899;
        Inman/American: 1885-86, 1894-95, 1898-1901, 1903, 1906, and 1909-12;
        National: 1877, 1885; and 1888;
        Guion: 1876-77
        HAPAG: 1866-70, 1875, 1886, 1892, 1894, 1899-1901, 1903-04, 1906, 1909-10 and 1912;
        NGL: 1867-68, 1872-73, 1890, 1899-1901, 1903-04, 1906, 1909-10, and 1912-13.


                In addition, we estimated fares for HAPAG for 1888-90 by assuming its minimum fare changed at the same rate as the known
fares for NGL. Finally, the 1914 fare for Cunard, White Star, Inman/American, and HAPAG were assumed to equal the 1913 fare for each line,
which mirrors the behavior of fares recorded for Anchor and NGL.

Steerage Fares:
        New York Tribune advertisements between May 1 and May 15 of each year,* weighted 1/3 White Star, 1/3 Inman, 1/6 Guion, 1/6
National. A pro-rating was done whenever ads did not turn up for any of those four lines. Cunard evidently included no steerage fares in ads; the
German lines (rarely) and Anchor (usually) did list fares but they were close to the average of the others. The overall annual averages were then
computed by the formula 2/3 westbound to New York, and 1/3 eastbound. A small sample of New York Times ads showed close congruence to the
New York Tribune listings.
For the following years where press ads were not found, or considered sufficiently complete, alternate estimations were made (currency
conversions were £1 = $4.86):
    1875 (£4.3): Average of three quotes (£4.1 Inman, £3.7 Guion, both instructions to agents
    From Balch collection, www.balchinstitute.org/resources/destinations/html accessed August 14, 2009,
    £5.25 Liverpool Steamship Conference agreement of June, 1875 (Hyde, p. 97). Inman and Guion also quoted same rates eastbound as west.
