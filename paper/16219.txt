The Valuation of Long-Dated Assets

                                              ABSTRACT

The expected time- and risk-adjusted cumulative return on any asset equals one at all horizons. Nonetheless,
I show that a typical asset's realized time- and risk-adjusted cumulative return tends to zero almost
surely. As a corollary, the value of a typical long-dated asset is driven by extreme events: either by
good news at the level of the individual asset or by bad news at the aggregate level. In the case of
the aggregate market, the fact that its Sharpe ratio is higher than its volatility suggests that bad news
is the relevant consideration in practice.

       In the absence of arbitrage, the fundamental equation of asset pricing states that the
expected time- and risk-adjusted cumulative return on any asset equals one at all horizons.
This paper arrives at, and then interprets, an apparently paradoxical result: for a typical
asset, the realized time- and risk-adjusted cumulative return tends to zero with probability
one.
       The objects of interest are the martingale Xt ≡ M1 R1 · · · Mt Rt , and the random variable
X∞ ≡ limt→∞ Xt . (Mt is a stochastic discount factor that prices payoffs at time t from the
perspective of time t − 1; Rt is the gross return on some arbitrary asset from time t − 1
to time t.) The fundamental asset-pricing equation—Et−1 Mt Rt = 1—implies that EXt = 1
for all finite t, so it is natural to expect that EX∞ = 1, too. It turns out that this may
or may not be true; typically, in fact, it is not, and when it is not, X∞ = 0.1 I provide a
variance criterion that dictates whether an asset is “typical” in this sense.
       Where, then, do such assets get their long-run value—their EXt = 1—from? I show
that when X∞ = 0, Xt occasionally experiences enormous explosions that can be attributed
to some combination of high M1 · · · Mt and high R1 · · · Rt . The former possibility can be
thought of as “bad news” at the aggregate level, and the latter as asset-specific “good news”.
It is important to emphasize that the existence and importance of such events emerge from
the logic of arbitrage-free pricing alone. I neither assume nor exclude the possibility of, say,
jumps in asset returns.
       The following simple (and well-known) example shows what is going on. Suppose that
there is a riskless asset with certain return Rf,t ≡ erf and a risky asset with return Rt ≡
        2 /2+σZ                                                     2 /2−λZ
eµ−σ           t   , where Zt is standard Normal. Mt ≡ e−rf −λ             t     is a valid SDF, where λ is
                                                                         2 t/2
the Sharpe ratio (µ − rf )/σ, so Xt = e−(λ−σ)(Z1 +···+Zt )−(λ−σ)                 .
       Setting σ = 16% and λ = 50%, Figure 1a plots 400 sample paths of Xt over a 250 year
horizon. Each sample path starts from X0 = 1. Figure 1b shows the same 400 sample paths
plotted on a log scale. Together, the figures illustrate the main results of the paper. First,
   1
       This statement holds with probability one, or almost surely. Throughout the paper, I drop such quali-
fications in the interest of readability.

        Figure 1: 400 sample paths of Xt , plotted against time, over a 250-year horizon.


despite the fact that EXt = 1 for all t, just two of the 400 sample paths lie above 1 after 250
years. (If the plot were extended, we would see that these paths, too, eventually tend to zero.
                                                                                     2 ×250/2
In the population, the median value of Xt after 250 years is e−(0.50−0.16)                      < 10−6 .)
Second, this tendency for Xt to approach zero along sample paths is counterbalanced by
occasional explosions in Xt : one sample path rises above 1400. The two figures together
illustrate the principle that in the long run, extreme events are the dominant influence on
asset prices. Third, the empirical fact that Sharpe ratios are high—λ > σ—means that in
this example explosions in Xt can be attributed to very negative realizations of Z1 +· · ·+Zt ,
and hence to explosions in M1 · · · Mt , that is, to extremely bad news.
    In this i.i.d.-lognormal example, the fact that Xt → 0 can be seen as reflecting special
properties of Brownian motion. In contrast, I need to impose almost no mathematical
structure to derive the main results of this paper, which are presented in Sections 1 and 2.
These rest only on a no-arbitrage assumption that leads naturally (in view of Harrison and
Kreps (1979)) to the application of martingale methods.
    With some extra structure—a conditional lognormality assumption—I am able to show,
in the case of the aggregate market, that explosions in Xt can be attributed to bad news,
by invoking the empirical fact that the market has a high Sharpe ratio. I also provide a
result that characterizes when such explosions can be attributed to bad news in the general
case, though the result requires imposition of structure of a different kind, in the shape of



                                                   3
a function, κ, that is introduced in Section 3.
    My approach is complementary to that of Hansen and Scheinkman (2009), who inves-
tigate long-run risk-return relationships in a somewhat more structured (continuous-time,
Markov) environment. The two papers focus on quite distinct objects of interest: eigen-
function decompositions as a means of characterizing long-run discount rates in the case of
Hansen and Scheinkman (2009), and the importance of rare events and the “edges” of the
distribution of sample paths in the case of this paper.
    There is also a link to the literature on equivalent martingale measures (Dalang, Morton
and Willinger (1990), Schachermayer (1992)). When X∞ = 0, an equivalent martingale
measure does not exist, even if there is no arbitrage. The results of this paper attempt to
demonstrate what this means in economic terms.
    The principle that the value of a long-dated asset may be dictated by extreme outcomes
is also explored by Weitzman (1998, 2009) and Gollier (2002) in the context of long-run
interest rates and of cost-benefit analyses of environmental projects with payoffs in the
distant future. In response, Nordhaus (2009) has suggested that Weitzman’s (2009) logic
rests on rather special assumptions about functional forms—notably on the properties of
utility functions near zero and on the distribution of “consumption” (to be understood
broadly) in the left tail. The present paper attempts to place the Weitzman argument on a
more general footing, based on very weak assumptions, that is immune to these criticisms.



1    An apparent paradox. . .

Time is discrete; today is time 0. Consider a sequence of gross returns, Rt , on some limited-
liability asset or investment strategy, and suppose that there is no arbitrage. For t > 0,
we can therefore define Mt to be a stochastic discount factor (SDF) which prices payoffs at
time t from the perspective of time t − 1 (Harrison and Kreps (1979), Hansen and Richard
(1987)). Then we have

                   Mt > 0,    Rt ≥ 0,   and Et−1 (Mt Rt ) = 1     for all t.              (1)



                                              4
Mt and Rt are random variables that only become known at time t.
       Define the risk-adjusted return Xt , t = 1, 2, 3, . . ., by

                                    Xt ≡ M1 R1 · M2 R2 · . . . · Mt Rt .

It follows from (1) that EXt = 1 for all t. Moreover, Xt is a non-negative martingale,
because

                             Et−1 Xt = Et−1 (M1 R1 · · · Mt Rt )

                                      = M1 R1 · · · Mt−1 Rt−1 Et−1 (Mt Rt )

                                      = M1 R1 · · · Mt−1 Rt−1

                                      = Xt−1 .

As a result, the random variable

                           X∞ ≡ lim Xt = lim M1 R1 · M2 R2 · . . . · Mt Rt
                                   t→∞         t→∞


almost surely exists and is finite, by the martingale convergence theorem of Doob (1953,
p. 319). It is tempting to argue that

                                                   ?
                              EX∞ = E lim Xt = lim EXt = lim 1 = 1,
                                         t→∞           t→∞            t→∞


but, as I now show, the interchange of expectation and limit is not valid in general. The
following two Propositions introduce and interpret the variance criterion 2

                                           X               p

      P       √
   If   vart−1 Mt Rt < K, for some constant K < ∞, then EX∞ = 1.

    Since the variance criterion is a sum of conditional variances, it is a random variable. Therefore the
              P       √                      P        √
two cases (i)   vart−1 Mt Rt = ∞ and (ii)      vart−1 Mt Rt < K, for some constant K < ∞—should be
understood to hold almost surely, as stated in footnote 1.

It follows, by a standard result—see, for example, Theorem 15.5 of Rudin (1987, p. 300)—

the second inequality being the L 2 inequality of Doob (1953, p. 317). The random variable
maxt Xt is therefore integrable. Since maxt Xt dominates Xt , it follows that Xt is uniformly
integrable, so EX∞ = 1 (and we also have E max Xt < ∞).

       In the above proof, I have adapted the treatment of a result of Kakutani (1948) given
by Williams (1995) by generalizing to allow for the empirically relevant case in which asset
returns and the stochastic discount factor can be serially dependent.3
   3
       This modification is not completely costless, since it comes at the expense of a mathematically less
elegant result: in the serially independent case, the variance criterion is a real number rather than a random
                                                                                       P        √
variable (since the conditional variances are variances) so the two alternatives—(i)     vart−1 Mt Rt = ∞ or
     P        √
(ii)   vart−1 Mt Rt < K, for some constant K < ∞—capture all the possibilities, and the above result is a
dichotomy. In the serially dependent case, on the other hand, other theoretical possibilities arise: it is possible
                                      P         √                                        P          √
to construct examples in which, say,     vart−1 Mt Rt = ∞ with probability 0.5 and          vart−1 Mt Rt < K
with probability 0.5, though such examples do not appear to be relevant in practice.

    To interpret the result, note that we only have   vart−1 Mt Rt < ∞ if the conditional
            √
variance of Mt Rt declines rapidly to zero as t → ∞: in other words, if Mt Rt is roughly
constant for large t. The following result makes this idea precise.

   Furthermore, if         vart−1 Mt Rt < ∞, we have Et−1 Mt Rt > 0 so, since Et−1 Mt Rt ≤
1, we must have

                                         Et−1    Mt Rt → 1.                               (3)
                                                                        √
(If not, it would have to be the case that for infinitely many t, Et−1 Mt Rt < 1 − δ
                                       √      2
for some δ ∈ (0, 1), and hence Et−1 Mt Rt < 1 − 2δ + δ 2 < 1 − δ. But this im-
                  √
plies that vart−1 Mt Rt > δ for infinitely many t, which contradicts the assumption that
P          √
   vart−1 Mt Rt < ∞.)
                                    √
    It follows from (2) and (3) that Mt Rt → 1, and hence Mt Rt → 1.

   To understand Proposition 2, suppose that there is an SDF Mt∗ and return Rt∗ such
that Mt∗ Rt∗ = 1. Applying Jensen’s inequality to the fundamental asset pricing equation


                                                   7
Et−1 Mt∗ Rt = 1, for some arbitrary return Rt , we find that Et−1 log Rt ≤ Et−1 log (1/Mt∗ ) =
Et−1 log Rt∗ . That is, Rt∗ is the growth-optimal return with maximal expected log return.
Moreover, we see that Mt∗ is a special SDF, namely the reciprocal of the growth-optimal
return (Long (1990)).4
        Proposition 2 can therefore be interpreted as saying that if either the returns Rt are not
asymptotically growth-optimal or the SDF Mt is not asymptotically the reciprocal of the
growth-optimal return—or both—then X∞ = 0.5 This justifies the following terminology:

Definition 1. We are in the generic case if Rt is not asymptotically growth-optimal or Mt
is not asymptotically the reciprocal of the growth-optimal return, or both.

        In the generic case, then, X∞ = 0. We are left with an apparent paradox. If such
an asset’s risk-adjusted return Xt tends to zero almost surely, where does its value—its
EXt = 1—come from? Why isn’t it cheaper ?



2        . . . and its resolution

The next result provides a resolution to this apparent paradox by expressing a sense in
which such an asset’s value can be attributed to outcomes in which Xt explodes.
    4                                                                                          (i)
        To see that this is an SDF, suppose that there are N assets with returns Rt , i = 1, . . . , N . The
growth-optimal portfolio is obtained by picking αi , i = 1, . . . , N to solve
                                                 X             (i)
                                                                               X
                                     max E log         αi Rt           s.t.         αi = 1 .
                                     {αi }


The first-order conditions are that, for each i,
                                                           (i)
                                                         Rt
                                                  EP                 (j)
                                                                           = λ.
                                                         αj Rt
Multiplying both sides of this equation by αi and summing over i, we find λ = 1, so
                                                   (i)
                                                  Rt

    As a theoretical matter, even if Mt Rt → 1 we may have   vart−1 Mt Rt = ∞, and hence X∞ = 0, if
the convergence takes place sufficiently slowly. Thus my terminology is conservative.




                                                                8
Proposition 3. In the generic case, in which X∞ = 0, we have

                   E max Xt = ∞       and    E [Xt log (1 + Xt )] → ∞   as   t → ∞.         (4)

In the non-generic case with EX∞ = 1, we have

                                             E max Xt < ∞                                   (5)

and the following partial converse to the second part of (4): if Mt Rt is bounded, uni-
formly in t, by some constant (which holds if, for example, the state space is finite) then
E [Xt log (1 + Xt )] remains bounded as t → ∞.

Proof. Inequality (5) was shown in the course of the proof of Proposition 1. Similarly, the
first part of (4) must hold because otherwise Xt would be uniformly integrable and we
would have EX∞ = 1.
      Next, since f (x) ≡ (x log x)+ is a convex function,6 (Xt log Xt )+ is a submartingale by
Jensen’s inequality, so max E (Xt log Xt )+ = limt→∞ E (Xt log Xt )+ . But then, by Proposi-
tions IV-2-10 and IV-2-11 of Neveu (1975), the second part of (4) and its partial converse
                        
hold with E (Xt log Xt )+ replacing E [Xt log (1 + Xt )].
                                                                                           
    It remains to be shown that lim E [Xt log (1 + Xt )] is infinite iff lim E (Xt log Xt )+ is
infinite. But this follows from the observation that when Xt ≥ 1,

                         Xt log Xt ≤ (1 + Xt ) log (1 + Xt ) ≤ 2Xt log (2Xt ) ,

together with the fact that E log (1 + Xt ) ≤ EXt = 1, since log(1 + x) ≤ x.

      The two results in (4) are to be contrasted with the fact that EXt = 1 for all t. Since
log (1 + Xt ) grows very slowly with Xt , the fact that EXt log(1 + Xt ) tends to infinity in
the generic case indicates that Xt is enormous in some states of the world. (For example,
it implies that for any ε > 0, EXt1+ε → ∞.)
      The next Proposition considers the probability that max Xt exceeds some large number
N . It places tight bounds on the rate at which this probability declines as N increases.
Such events are rare, but not—in the generic case—very rare.

Proof. Applying the submartingale inequality of Doob (1953, p. 314) to Xt , we have N ·

the first statement follows from the monotone convergence theorem.
   Suppose the second statement were false. Then there is an ε > 0 (to be thought of as
small) and C > 1 (to be thought of as large) such that P (max Xt ≥ N ) ≤ 1/N 1+ε for all
N ≥ C. Since max Xt is positive, we would then have

in contradiction with Proposition 3.

   As a corollary of Propositions 3 and 4, Monte Carlo pricing of a long-dated asset may
provide an unreliable indication of the asset’s value, as this largely depends on states of the


                                                      10
world that occur with very low probability. Ignoring, or failing to sample, such states of
the world will lead to underpricing of the asset in question: in the case of long-term bonds,
the tendency will be to overestimate long-run interest rates.
      We have seen that Xt → 0 in the generic case. How fast does convergence take place?
To answer this question, it is convenient to introduce stochastic order notation.7

Definition 2. Consider a sequence of random variables Zt . We write Zt = Op (1) if for
any ε > 0 there exists a constant N such that

                                            sup P (|Zt | > N ) < ε,
                                                t

and Zt = Op (Wt )—“Zt is of the same order of magnitude as Wt ”—if Zt /Wt = Op (1).

      For example, the central limit theorem implies that for i.i.d. random variables Ki with
zero mean and finite variance,
                                              t

    To take a simple example, consider an i.i.d. economy, and suppose that the asset of
                                       √
interest is not growth-optimal, so Et−1 Mt Rt equals some constant e−δ < 1 for all t. Then
Xt = Op e−2δt : convergence takes place exponentially fast.

3    How do extreme events take place?

In full generality, we have seen that for generic assets, X∞ = 0, an apparently paradoxical
result reconciled by the fact that E max Xt = ∞. That is, there are rare states of the world
in which Xt is enormous. In such states, we have

                              M1 R1 · M2 R2 · · · Mt Rt   very large,

and so we must have some combination of large M1 · · · Mt and large R1 · · · Rt . The former
possibility, large M1 · · · Mt , corresponds roughly to the realization of a disastrously bad
state of the world. In a consumption-based model with time-separable utility, for example,
M1 · · · Mt is large when marginal utility at time t is high. The latter possibility, large
R1 · · · Rt , corresponds to a particularly favorable return realization for the asset in question.
    To get more intuition for what happens in specific model economies, it is instructive to
explore two simple examples that are in a sense polar opposites. For simplicity, I suppose
in each case that there is a riskless asset whose return is constant over time.
    First, consider a risk-neutral economy. Any asset that is not asymptotically riskless is
generic, and the preceding results imply that returns on such assets satisfy

                         R1 · · · Rt                      R1 · · · Rt
                                     →0    and E max                  = ∞.
                            Rft                              Rft

Since M1 · · · Mt = 1/Rft is deterministic, the rare explosions that drive the second result can
only be attributed to occasional explosions in R1 · · · Rt . That is, in a risk-neutral economy,
the pricing of risky assets is driven by occasional bonanzas: low-probability events in which
R1 · · · Rt becomes very large.
    For the second example, take an economy in which Mt is a nondegenerate random
variable for all t, and consider the pricing of an “insurance” asset whose return Rt is a

                                                12
nondecreasing function of Mt . (If the riskless rate is constant then the riskless asset is
an insurance asset, for example.) Then, M1 R1 · · · Mt Rt can only explode at times when
M1 · · · Mt explodes, so the pricing of long-dated insurance assets is driven by extreme bad
news. This is a more general version of Weitzman’s (1998) logic.
      What can we say in the case of the aggregate market? From the Hansen-Jagannathan
(1991) bound, combined with high available Sharpe ratios and a low riskless rate, it follows
that σ(M ) is large relative to the volatility of the market, σ(R). By imposing some more
structure on the economy, in the form of a conditional lognormality assumption, we can use
this observation to argue that explosions in Xt must be due to explosions in M1 · · · Mt , and
hence to “bad news”. It turns out that the critical condition that implies that explosions in
Xt correspond to bad news is that the Sharpe ratio of the market is higher than its volatility.
In the data, the Sharpe ratio of the market is on the order of 50% while its volatility is on
the order of 16%, so this seems an innocuous assumption.

                                                                                      2
Proposition 6. Suppose that the market return Rt ≡ eµt−1 −σt−1 /2+σt−1 Zt is condition-
ally lognormal, and that there is a riskless asset with return Rf,t ≡ erf,t . Then Mt ≡
           2
e−rf,t −λt−1 /2−λt−1 Zt is a valid SDF, where λt ≡ (µt − rf,t+1 )/σt is the Sharpe ratio on the
market. Finally, suppose that the market Sharpe ratio and volatility satisfy λt > σt + ε
almost surely, for some ε > 0.
      Then we are in the generic case, so X∞ = 0 and E maxt Xt = ∞. Moreover, long-run
pricing is driven by the possibility of extremely bad outcomes, in the sense that explosions
in Xt are driven by explosions in M1 · · · Mt .8

                                                                   2 /2
Proof. We have Mt Rt = e−(λt−1 −σt−1 )Zt −(λt−1 −σt−1 )                   , so the variance criterion is

                             X             p         X                    2
                                                                              
                                  vart−1    Mt R t =    1 − e−(λt−1 −σt−1 ) /4 .

Since λt − σt > ε, the variance criterion is infinite, so without specifying anything further
about the properties of λt−1 and σt−1 , we have X∞ = 0. (In practice, we might want λt−1

      The appendix extends this result to allow for multiple risk factors Zj,t , j = 1, . . . , N .

and σt−1 to be high following realizations of Zt−1 or σt−2 Zt−1 that are negative and large
in absolute value.)
       By Proposition 3, we also have E max Xt = ∞. Since λt−1 − σt−1 > 0, Mt Rt is large
only if Zt is negative, so explosions in Xt correspond unambiguously to bad news at the
aggregate level (high M1 · · · Mt ) rather than good news at the idiosyncratic level (high
R1 · · · Rt ). That is, pricing is driven by the possibility of extremely bad outcomes.9

       The simplicity of the above result is largely due to the assumption of conditional log-
normality, which amongst other things implies that the higher (conditional) cumulants10 of
log M and log R are zero. With non-zero higher cumulants, things become more compli-
cated: it is possible to construct example economies in which (say) M is bounded, while
period returns R have a small amount of weight in the extreme right tail, in such a way
that σ(M ) is large (so the maximal Sharpe ratio is high) and σ(R) relatively small, and
yet explosions in M1 R1 · · · Mt Rt are due to right-tail events in which R1 · · · Rt explodes.
The goal of the remainder of this section is to refine this intuition, and to develop sufficient
conditions that determine whether or not “explosions in Xt are driven by bad news” for a
given parametric model, by using the theory of large deviations (and, more specifically, the
Gärtner-Ellis theorem).
       A natural metric for the extent to which explosions in Xt reflect bad news rather than
good news is the conditional probability that M1 · · · Mt > eψt , conditional on the event
that Xt > eφt . (Here φ and ψ are fixed growth rates and t is some large time.) Using the
notation
                                                                             
                       Pt (φ, ψ) ≡ P M1 · · · Mt > eψt M1 R1 · · · Mt Rt > eφt ,

we can say that bad news dominates consideration in the long run if Pt (φ, ψ) → 1 as t → ∞.
For fixed φ, this criterion is more (less) stringent if ψ is high (low).
   9
       In the model of Campbell and Cochrane (1999), for example, the conditional standard deviation of the
market return is not provided in closed form, but Figures 5 and 6 of the paper suggest that λt−1 − σt−1 > 0.

    By higher cumulants, I mean the third, fourth, fifth (etc) cumulants. See Backus, Foresi and Telmer
(2001), Martin (2009), and Backus, Chernov and Martin (2009) for more on cumulants.

                                      t→∞ t


I assume that κ(θM , θR ) is finite and continuously differentiable for all θM , θR ∈ R, and
write κM (·, ·) and κR (·, ·) for the partial derivatives of κ with respect to its first and second
argument, respectively. If the vectors (log Mt , log Rt ) are i.i.d. for all t, then the definition
                                           
(7) reduces to κ(θM , θR ) = log E M1θM R1θR , so κ(·, ·) is the cumulant-generating function
of the random vector (log Mt , log Rt ).

                                       ∗ < θ ∗ and P (φ, ψ) → 0 as t → ∞ if θ ∗ > θ ∗ .
       Then Pt (φ, ψ) → 1 as t → ∞ if θM    R       t                        M     R


Proof. See appendix.

       To link this result to the earlier results of this section, consider the simple special case in
                                        2 /2+σ
which κ(θM , θR ) = µM θM +µR θR +σM M θM                     2
                                              M R θM θR +σRR θR /2. This case arises if—

but not only if11 —the vector (log Mt , log Rt ) is i.i.d. bivariate Normal with mean (µM , µR )
and covariance matrix ( σσM
                          MR
                            M       σM R
                                    σRR ).   By Proposition 7, Pt (φ, ψ) → 1 if
                                                
                             σM M + σM R
                                                     φ − µR − σRR /2 − σM R /2 > ψ .
                          σM M + 2σM R + σRR

Fixing ψ > 0, this inequality is satisfied for sufficiently large φ, so long as

                                             σM M + σM R > 0.                                     (8)

In the “insurance asset” case, (8) holds because σM R ≥ 0. For risky assets with σM R < 0,
(8) may still hold if σM M is sufficiently large relative to σRR : in the case considered in the
introduction, for example, (8) is equivalent to λ > σ.
  11
       Very roughly, the assumption is that the economy looks lognormal over long time periods.

4       Applications

I now present two examples to illustrate the applicability of these results.


4.1     A generalization of a traditional result

Suppose that the SDF is the reciprocal of the growth-optimal return, Mt = 1/Rt∗ , but that
Rt is not asymptotically growth-optimal. Then Mt Rt 6→ 1; this is an example of the generic
case.
    In this context, Proposition 1 amounts to the statement that R1 · · · Rt /(R1∗ · · · Rt∗ ) → 0
as t → ∞: with probability one, the growth-optimal portfolio outperforms any non-growth-
optimal portfolio by an arbitrary amount in the long run. It can therefore be thought of as
extending the traditional results of Latané (1959), Samuelson (1971) and Markowitz (1976)
to the non-i.i.d. case. Of greater interest, it demonstrates that these traditional results
can be extended to SDFs Mt 6= 1/Rt∗ . This is important because it is often desirable to
work with SDFs that are more easily interpretable than 1/Rt∗ —for example, with SDFs
proportional to the marginal value of wealth.
    We also have a new result: E max [R1 · · · Rt /(R1∗ · · · Rt∗ )] = ∞. In the short run, the
growth-optimal portfolio can hugely underperform. The probability of N -fold underperfor-
mance is at most 1/N ; on the other hand, for any ε > 0 we can find large N such that the
probability of N -fold underperformance is at least 1/N 1+ε .


4.2     The consumption path of a utility-maximizing investor

                                                                                          β t u(Ct )
                                                                                      P
Suppose that there is an unconstrained investor in the economy who maximizes E
for some concave, differentiable utility function u(·) and subjective discount factor β. The
investor’s marginal rate of substitution is then a valid SDF, and the above results imply
that in the generic case,
                                          u0 (Ct )
                                     βt            R1 · · · Rt → 0                              (9)
                                          u0 (C0 )




                                                   16
and yet
                                                 0
                                                                  
                                              t u (Ct )
                                       E max β 0        R1 · · · Rt = ∞.                                              (10)
                                                u (C0 )
For these equations to hold when applied to a riskless asset with time-t return Rf,t , for ex-
ample, it is enough that pricing is not asymptotically risk-neutral, so Mt Rf,t 6→ 1. Suppose
that this is so, and that the riskless rate is constant, Rf,t = Rf . Furthermore, suppose the
investor is sufficiently patient that βRf ≥ 1. Then (9) implies that

                                                      u0 (Ct ) → 0.

         In particular, if u(·) satisfies the Inada conditions, then consumption tends to infinity
in the long run. This is a result of Chamberlain and Wilson (2000): here, though, the
result emerges as a special case of the more general results presented previously. Moreover,
the observation that almost sure convergence to zero is inextricably linked with occasional
explosions in Xt appears to be new.12
         Conversely, if the investor is impatient, with βRf ≤ 1, then (10) implies that E [max u0 (Ct )] =
∞, or equivalently—assuming u00 < 0—that E [u0 (min Ct )] = ∞.



5         Conclusion

The absence of arbitrage implies that expected risk-adjusted returns on all assets equal
one at all horizons. Proposition 1 provides a variance criterion that determines whether the
realized risk-adjusted return on an asset tends to zero. Proposition 2 demonstrates that this
is the relevant case unless (i) the asset is asymptotically growth-optimal and (ii) the SDF is
asymptotically the reciprocal of the growth-optimal return. These apparently paradoxical
findings are resolved by the fact that realized risk-adjusted returns explode (Proposition
3) occasionally (Proposition 4). Proposition 5 characterizes the speed of convergence of
risk-adjusted returns.
    12
         We can also strengthen the finding that u0 (Ct ) → 0 by applying (9) to the growth-optimal asset, to
conclude that β t R1∗ · · · Rt∗ u0 (Ct ) → 0. This is stronger because R1∗ · · · Rt∗ /Rft → ∞, so β t R1∗ · · · Rt∗ → ∞.




                                                            17
    In general, then, as a theoretical matter, explosions in risk-adjusted returns can be at-
tributed either to spectacular outperformance of the asset in question, or to disastrously
bad news at the aggregate level. I couple this observation with the empirical fact that
the market has a high Sharpe ratio to argue that disasters are the relevant consideration
in practice. As a corollary, cost-benefit analyses of long-dated assets, such as the payoffs
to environmental projects, should pay special attention to worst-case scenarios; calcula-
tions based on back-of-the-envelope logic, or on small Monte-Carlo exercises, are likely to
underestimate the value of such projects.

A        Appendix

A.1        Extension of Proposition 6 to the N -factor case

Suppose that the asset of interest loads on multiple conditionally Normal risk factors Zj,t ,
indexed by j = 1, . . . , N . Suppose, for example, that

                          Rt = exp µt−1 + β 0t−1 Z t − (1/2)β 0t−1 V t−1 β t−1 ,
                                  


where Zt = (Z1,t , . . . , ZN,t ) is a vector of risk factors with conditional covariance matrix
V t , and β t−1 = (β1,t−1 , . . . , βN,t−1 ) is a vector of loadings on the N risk factors at time
t − 1. I assume that the signs on factors are chosen so that βj,t > 0 for all j and t, so a
large positive value of Zj,t is always good news for the asset.13 I subtract off the variance
term in the exponential so that Et−1 Rt = eµt−1 . For simplicity, suppose also that there is a
riskless asset with return Rf,t = erf,t .
       Writing λt−1 = (λ1,t−1 , . . . , λN,t−1 ) for the vector of risk prices, the SDF

                          Mt = exp −rf,t − λ0t−1 Z t − (1/2)λ0t−1 V t−1 λt−1 ,
                                  


is valid so long as the risk premium, the price of risk, λt−1 , and the quantity of risk,
V t−1 β t−1 , are linked by the relationship µt−1 − rf,t = β 0t−1 V t−1 λt−1 . It follows that
                    n              0                       0                 o
         Mt Rt = exp − λt−1 − β t−1 Z t − (1/2) λt−1 − β t−1 V t−1 λt−1 − β t−1 .

So, if λj,t−1 − βj,t−1 is almost surely positive (respectively, negative) then factor j is impor-
tant in the long run due to the possibility of long sequences of negative Zj,t , representing
disasters (respectively, positive Zj,t , representing bonanzas).
       In the two-beta model of Campbell and Vuolteenaho (2004), two factors drive market
returns: Z1,t = NCF,t “cashflow news” and Z2,t = −NDR,t “discount-rate news”. In my
notation, the market return has unit loading on each factor, so βCF,t = βDR,t = 1. Equation
(8) of Campbell and Vuolteenaho’s paper expresses the fact that the price of cashflow
  13
       The loss of generality here—the asset’s factor loading cannot change sign over time—simplifies subse-
quent interpretation.


                                                      20
news risk, λCF,t , equals the coefficient of risk aversion, γ, while the price of discount-rate
news risk, λDR,t , is equal to one. Thus, whenever risk aversion is greater than one, so
λCF,t − βCF,t = γ − 1 > 0, the dominant concern in the long run is the possibility of
cashflow disaster. On the other hand, discount-rate news has no long-run impact in this
model, since λDR,t − βDR,t = 0. In fact, in any model in which price-dividend ratios are
stationary, so discount-rate news has no long-run impact on asset prices, this logic implies
that the price of discount-rate risk cannot systematically be either greater or less than one.
       In the long-run risks model of Bansal and Yaron (2004), there are again two priced risk
factors: an expected consumption growth factor (e) and a consumption volatility factor (w).
Using the notation of Bansal and Yaron, it can be seen that λm,e > βm,e if and only if risk
aversion γ is greater than the “leverage ratio” φ, which holds in their calibration. Similarly,
λm,w < βm,w < 0.14 Thus long-run pricing is driven by the possibility of disastrously
low shocks to the expected consumption growth factor and disastrously high shocks to the
consumption volatility factor.


A.2        Proof of Proposition 7

Proof. By Bayes’ rule,

                                       P (GM,t > ψ and GM,t + GR,t > φ)
                          Pt (φ, ψ) =
                                               P (GM,t + GR,t > φ)
                                           P(At )
                                   =                    ,
                                       P(At ) + P(Bt )

                 ≡ 1t t1 log Mi , GR,t ≡ 1t t1 log Ri , and At and Bt are the (disjoint) events
                     P                     P
where GM,t
“GM,t > ψ and GM,t + GR,t > φ” and “GM,t < ψ and GM,t + GR,t > φ”.
       When φ > 0, P(At ) + P(Bt ) tends to zero as t → ∞. (To see this, note that P(At ) +
P(Bt ) = P(M1 · · · Rt > eφt ). Now pick arbitrary ε > 0. As a corollary of the first part of
Proposition 6, if we take T large enough that eφT > 1/ε, then P(M1 · · · Rt > eφt ) < ε for
all t > T . That is, P(At ) + P(Bt ) → 0.) Since P(At ) + P(Bt ) tends to zero, P(At ) and P(Bt )
must each tend to zero.
  14
       Since βm,w < 0, in conflict with my earlier notational assumption, it is indeed the case that when
λm,w < βm,w , explosions in Xt occur at times of disaster.


                                                    21
       The goal is now to analyze the rates at which P(At ) and P(Bt ) tend to zero. We will have
Pt (φ, ψ) → 1 if P(Bt ) tends to zero at a faster rate than P(At ), and conversely Pt (φ, ψ) → 0
if P(At ) tends to zero faster than P(Bt ). So we must find a condition that ensures that
P(Bt ) tends to zero faster than P(At ):

                                         1                      1
                               lim sup     log P(B t ) ≤ lim inf log P(At ) ,                        (11)
                                t→∞      t                 t→∞ t


where B t is the event “GM,t ≤ ψ and GM,t + GR,t ≥ φ”. (The argument for the converse
condition, which ensures that P(At ) → 0 faster than P(Bt ) → 0, is very similar, so is
omitted.)
       Let κ∗ (xM , xR ) ≡ supθM ,θR ∈R xM θM +xR θR −κ(θM , θR ), the Fenchel-Legendre transform
of κ(·, ·). The Gärtner-Ellis theorem15 implies that (11) holds if

                                inf     κ∗ (xM , xR ) ≤      inf      κ∗ (xM , xR ) .                (12)
                              xM >ψ                         xM ≤ψ
                            xM +xR ≥φ                     xM +xR ≥φ

       The function κ∗ has the following properties: (i) it is convex (by Lemma 2.3.9 of Dembo
and Zeitouni (1998, p. 46)); (ii) κ∗ (xM , xR ) ≥ 0 (since it is at least as large as xM ·
0 + xR · 0 − κ(0, 0) = 0); (iii) κ∗ (xM , xR ) ≥ xM + xR (since it is at least as large as
xM · 1 + xR · 1 − κ(1, 1) = xM + xR ); (iv) κ∗ (µM , µR ) = 0 where µM ≡ κM (0, 0) and
µR ≡ κR (0, 0), so κ∗ attains its global minimum at (µM , µR ).
       From (iii) and (iv), µM + µR ≤ 0, so (µM , µR ) 6∈ {(xM , xR ) : xM + xR ≥ φ}. It follows
by convexity that κ∗ attains its minimum over {(xM , xR ) : xM + xR ≥ φ} on the boundary
of the set, i.e. on the line {(xM , xR ) : xM + xR = φ}. The question is then whether the
minimum is attained for xM greater than ψ or less than ψ. Setting f (x) ≡ κ∗ (x, φ − x),
(12) is satisfied if f 0 (ψ) < 0, or equivalently κ∗M (ψ, φ − ψ) < κ∗R (ψ, φ − ψ), where κ∗M
denotes the derivative of κ∗ with respect to its first argument, and similarly for κ∗R . The
result follows by the envelope theorem.

       For a proof of the theorem, see Theorem 2.3.6 in Dembo and Zeitouni (1998, p. 44). The simplified
version of the theorem outlined in Remark (c) (p. 45) suffices, due to the assumption that κ(θM , θR ) < ∞
for all θM , θR ∈ R.
