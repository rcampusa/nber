     This is a report on the results of a research project, sponsored
by the NBER's Program on Financial Marketsand Monetary Ecorwmics, which
involves the collection and organization of income account and balance
sheet data, at the firm level, for the years 1926—77. The primary data
source for the study is Moody's Industrial Manual. Working at the firm level,
it is possible to obtain accurate information on the market values of
traded securities.
     This paper presents and discusses some of the aggregate characteristics
of the dataset and also reports the results of estimating a simple portfolio
model which attempts to explain changes in firm balance sheet flows for the
periods 1927—35 and 1965—77.
     The data collected for the study, as well as software necessary to
manage them efficiently, are available from the authors. ?n NBER Technical
Paper will shortly be available to describe the dataset and software in detail.

      This paper reports the results of a research project which involves the

 collection and organization of income account and balance sheet data, at the

 individual firm   level,   for the years 1926—1977. The primary data source for the

 study is Moody's Industrial Manual.


      By working at the level of the individual firm,        it   is possible to obtain

 more accurate information on the market values of traded securities, and more

 detailed information on the structure of firms'   balance   sheets than is typically

 available at the aggregate level. Accurate data on the incane accounts and

balance sheets of firms over a substantial period of time can provide

researchers with a rich source of information, against which specific hypotheses

regarding corporate financing and investment decisions can be tested. The data

collected for this study, as well as software necessary to manage them eff i—

ciently, are available fran the authors in either IBM or VAX formats at a nani—

nal fee. An NBER Technical Paper is also available which describes the dataset

and software in detail.


     The first section of the paper briefly describes the manner in which the

data were collected and organized. A more detailed presentation of the charac-

teristics of the dataset and accc!npanying ccxnputer software can      be   found in the

Appendix. Section two considers the aggregate characteristics of the sample. In

particular, firm    average data on the sources and uses of funds, market
valuations, and rates of return are presented for the 1926—1977 period. The

third section of the paper reports on the results of utilizing sane firm-level

data to estimate a simple portfolio model which attempts to explain changes in

balance sheet flows.

1. Collection and Organization of the Data


                          of undertaking this research project was to construct a
     The primary   goal
micro dataset covering a substantial period
                                                      of time for use in testing Specific
                              financing    and    investment decisions, and the financial
hypotheses regarding firm
markets' valuations of these activities. A secondary goal was to organize and

present   the data in a manner that would allow other researchers to conveniently
access, verify and extend the basic dataset. To that end, the project also
involved the creation of canputer software to provide easy access to and
retrieval of   the data.


     The sample of firms for the period 1926—1977 is actually cxiiosed of nine
                                                      fran various issues of
separate subsamples, drawn periodically
Industrial Manual. The ccxnposition of these subsamples is outlined in Table 1.

The goal was to obtain nine overlapping subsamples of size fifty. Subject to

restrictions on fiscal year, degree of consolidation, decipherability of ccrnplex

transactions, and natural resource intensiveness, fifty—two firms were initially

selected using a set of randan numbers spanning the number of pages in each

Moody's edition.    Referring to        Table 1, 28 firms in subsamples one through

seven were deleted ex post because closer examination revealed inconsistencies

with the initial selection criteria. For subsarnpleS eight and nine, only 77 of

the 104 firms initially selected survived,                due primarily to changes in

                                                        acquisitions) which could not te
accounting policies (typically resulting fran

reconciled without resort to additional data sources, such as annual reports or

Form 10—K's.


     For each of the firms         in   a subsample, the values for 52 data       its are

recorded   annually. These items        are listed and described in the Appendix. About

thirty of the data items     can   be transcribed directly f ran   the   incc*ne account and



                                            —2—
  balance sheet tables of the Moody's volume corresponding to the subsample (see
  the third column of Table 1). For nost of the remaining data items, it      was
  generally   necessary to read the additional information provided in MOOy, and

  to employ issues of the Manual fran several years of the subsample. For

  instance, nultiple issues of the Manual were necessarily referenced when firms

  retired a debt or preferred stock issue during the subsample interval. In cases

 where information on the outstanding arrounts of individual debt issues for par—

 ticular years were missing, the sinking fund terms were used to interpolate for

 the missing values.


      The replacement value figures reported for firms' inventories (data item

 45) are generally available for the firms of subsample nine f ran footnotes in

 Moody's for the years 1976 and 1977. Also, a substantial fraction of firms

 increased the anount of inventories carried on a LIFO basis in 1974, and also

 reported the replacement values. To fill in data for missing years, twenty

 industry—level price indices were used to construct estimates in the manner

suggested by Lindenberg and Ross (1981). For subsamples seven and eight, book

values of inventories were cónverted to replacement values using indices for the

aggregate manufacturing sector. For all subsamnples, book values of plant and

eguipoent were converted to replacement values using Census Bureau deflators for

the manufacturing sector, One way in which the quality of these data could

clearly be improved would be to gather replacement values fran Form 10—K's for

recent years, and use industry deflators carputed by other researchers for

earlier years. The existing software would allow these new deflators to be

easily integrated with the main body of data.

       An interesting feature of the results presented in Table 3 is the rather

  dramatic decline in the Cash Items variable, which is
                                                          canposed primarily of cash
  and short—term marketable securities. Considered in conjunction with the recent

  increase in the role of debt in corporate capital structures, the decline is

  even nore striking. Closer inspection reveals that, at least           since the
 mid—l960's, the fall in the share of Cash Items in net assets has been accam-

 panied by an increase in the share of physical capital. The drastic increase in

 Current Liabilities in 1941 was due primarily to increased corporate taxation.


 Sources and Uses of Funds


      Figure 1 illustrates the relative importance of internal and external funds

 in financing the "average" firm, while Figure 2 depicts the role of debt
                                                                          arrong
 external sources of finance. In both figures, the large spikes appearing above

 the years 1937, 1941, 1947, 1951, 1956, and 1974 coincide with periods of unu-

 sual inventory accumulation and apparently represent a demand for external funds

 to finance unplanned inventories. However, this is not true for the broad spike

that appears above the years 1965—1968. 1)iring this period there was an unu-

sually large demand for funds for capital expenditures and for takeovers.1


     To highlight the longer—run trends, data on sources and uses of funds have

been averaged over the individual years of the subsamples, and the results are

presented in Table 4. According to these results, net issues of debt securities

remained quite constant fran the 1936—1941 period through the mid—l960's, when a

large shift toward external sources of funds occurred. In fact, the percentage

of total sources accounted for by net debt issues since 1965 is about twenty,

slightly nore than double the pre—1965 period.     The results of Table 4 also

vities that has occurred since the mid-196O'S. Virtually all
                                   increased expenditures on physical assets. The

relative to net assets.


       Several features of the 1927—1930 and 1931—1935 periods require carment.

First, during 1927—1930 there were
                                         virtually no retirements of ccxnon   stock,
                                   Retirements is due solely to retirements of pre-
and the —0.8 figure under Stock
                                                                      the years
ferred stock. Net issues of cc:mlon equity were negligible except for

1928 and 1929.       Furthermore, the   Plant/EquiXrnt data for the years prior to
                                         allanCes plus the change in net property
1935 were estimated as depreciation

account   and are   thus not canparable with the figures presented for later years.

This   latter feature accounts for the relatively large discrepanCY between Total
Uses and Total Sources for 1927—1930. Also, the relatively low figure for
Undistributed Profits for the 1927—1930
                                        period, 2.8 per cent of net assets, is

 cartion stock were paid out as dividends during this period.




 Market Valuations

       Securities markets provide a continuing

 earnings streams and, therefore,
                                                                      value of
 market value, as determined in financial markets, to the replacement
                                                                            how
 tangible assets has been dubbed TobintS 'q', and this section investigates

 'q' has behaved over the 1926—1977 period.




                                         —6—
      Figure 3 plots 'q' for the average firm in each of the nine overlapping

 subsarnples and also indicates the ccnposition of the ratio as between debt,

 equity, and preferred stock cc*iponents. For instance, the distance between the

 horizontal axis and the first broken line represents the market valuation of

 debt securities relative to net assets. To assist in interpreting the figure,

Table 5 provides the average values for the overlapping years of the subsamples,

 as well as for 1926—1927 and 1976_1977.2 A ccuiplete listing of the data used to

construct Figure 3 appears as Table 6.


     Both   Table   5 and Figure 3 clearly indicate the increasing importance of

debt in the capital structure of the t1average" corporation. What is sanewhat

surprising is that the sum of debt and preferred stock, relative to net assets,

has remained virtually constant over the entire fifty—year period, suggesting

that the increase in debt has cce     primarily   at the expense of preferred stock.

Another feature of Figure 3 which clearly stands out is the sharp fall and sub-

sequent rapid recovery of the cawon equity canponent         of   the ratio during the

1930—1934 period. This is even rrore dramatic when one considers that capital

goods prices were falling and, thus, reducing net assets and Iioving the ratio in

the opposite direction. The figure also plainly shows the substantial decline of

equity values that began in 1968. This slide in the ratio of the market value of

equity relative to net assets is steeper and nore prolonged than any previous

decline illustrated in the diagram.


     Because of significant sampling differences between the subsamples, Figure

3 has several substantial jumps which hinder interpretation. This is especially

true for the nost recent years. Figure 4 and Table 7 present data on 'q' for the

period 1965—77 which have been   spliced    to eliminate the discrete jump for 1971.

Rates of    Return

     This subsection presents calculations of several measures of the returns

            Coupled with the information presented in Figure    3 and Table 5, these


 results  confirm the significant decline which has recently occurred in the
 securities markets' valuation of assets relative to the returns generated by
 those assets. When we consider the differences in sampling procedures, the rates
                                            in this study are close to those reported

  1971—1977 periods, respectively, canpared with the estiinates of 8.7 and 7.5 per

  cent presented in Table 9.


      The rates of return reported in Table 9 ignore the effects of both actual

 and expected inflation upon the real value of the firms' financial assets and

 liabilities. In particular, the canponent of the rate of return on net assets

 which reflects the tax deductibility of the inflation premium contained in ncmi—

 nal interest rates is not included in the calculations. Also, no allowance is

 made for the distributional effects of realized inflation versus anticipated

 inflation between creditors and stockholders. However, because the difference

 between paper assets and paper liabilities, relative to total net assets, is

 Only +0.02 for 1961—70 and —0.055 for 1971—77 one would expect these effects to

be small.


Conclusion


     This section has presented sane of the aggregate characteristics of the

sample of manufacturing firms for the years 1926—1977. The results, as regards

the postwar period, are broadly consistent with those obtained by other

researchers. That is, the data illustrate the
                                                increasing importance of external

financing——particularly debt——as a source of funds for firms' real investment

expenditures. The results also illustrate the dramatic decline that has occurred

in the past fifteen years in the securities markets' valuation of net assets

relative to replacement values, and also relative to rates of return.

  the model's parameters is by
                                          means of a switching regression [Day, 1969]. We now
  outline this procedure.

 and 1936, and the last two panels, 1972 and 1978, were caiibined to give nine

 annual observations (1927—1935) for the earlier period and twelve (1966—1977)

 for the later period. To make the data in two neighboring panels trore can-

 patible, information on firms that overlap was used to adjust the means of the

 nonoverlapping finns in each separate period. This is done assuming, for each

variable, that had a non—overlapping firm been      represented     in both panels, its

mean would have changed between panels in the same way as for the average

overlapping firm.       For the earlier period there are twelve overlapping firms,

and eleven   in the later period.

      Tobin's q   is   adjusted and redefined for each firm   as   the ratio of observed
q   to the mean value of q over the particular sample period. This is done to

correct for persistent deviations of q above unity due to the capitalization of

ironopoly rents. The q variable enters the regressions with a lag of one year,

while the net cash flow variable enters contemporaneously. All variables are

measured as deviations around firm means.

          The Regime I results indicate that substantial portfolio reallocations take

  place in response to increases in 'q' and CF. On the asset side of the balance

  sheet, the largest responses to changes in both 'q' and CF are in real assets:

  plant and equipment, inventories, and other long term assets. Recalling that

 other long term assets primarily represent acquisitions, it is not surprising

 that its 'q' coefficient is larger than that reported for investment expen-

 ditures. On the liability side, this increase in fixed assets is accompanied

 primarily by increases in long term debt and ccmn     equity.

      Contrary to prior expectations, cash flow is a nre important variable in

 classifying observations between regimes than 'q', the respective standard

 deviations of CF and q being 0.02 and 0.30.

probabilities as weights. That is, the label P*q is E Pitqt . Given the

underlying model, the appropriate variables to include in equations explaining

aggregate balance sheet flow variables would be p*q,             (l_p)*q, P*CF, and
(l_P)*CF. This procedure would account for the changing distribution of firms by

regime.


      For example, it can be seen from Figure 8 that while aggregate q was
falling during 1973, the proportion of firms classified into Regime I increased
dramatically,   actually increasing P*q• This provides a possible explanation for

the fact that investment was increasing during a period when aggregate q was

falling.

 4. Sunary and Conclusions


      This     paper has reported the results of a research project which involved

 the oDllectjon and organization of incctne account and balance sheet data, at the

firm level, for the years 1926—77. Aggregate characteristics of the sample,

including sources and uses of funds, financial market valuations and rates of

return, were     presented and discussed. Another section of the paper   presented the
results   of   estimating a simple portfolio nxxiel explaining a number of balance

sheet flows using the firm level data.


     The dataset should provide other researchers with a rich source of infor-

mation against which specific
                                    hypotheses regarding corporate financing and
investment decisions can be tested.

  1. Raw Data


         Fifty two items of raw data are available for each firm in each

  Panel.     The first line is a firm header card giving        the   year of the
  Panel (e.g. 1972), an eight letter firm identification              cxde, the
  firm's name, a durable/nondurable classification, the bond
                                                         rating of
 the irost recently issued debt security, and the

 Moody's fran which the firm's data was generated. The bond rating
 symbol NR indicates that the firm's debt is unrated. An example of
 a header card fran the 1954 Panel of data is:

 PANEL 1954 BRISlDL—My CD.         En   A p. 1362

 Following each header card, there are 51 lines of raw numerical
 data.    For instance, the line following the      header   card listed above
 is:



01 55462,56611,61617,52266,42778,45308,44655


Item 01 is sales and the data are in thousands of dollars, for years

1953, 1952,..,]947. Thus, in 1953 Bristol Myers Co. had sales of

$55,462,000. In 1947, sales were equal to $44,655,000.


       Section 3 of the Appendix lists the variable          symbols as they
appear on    printed   output, along with a brief description of each of
the 52 data items.


       Most of the fifty—two raw data items listed are self           explana—

 Data Item 45.


      This data item gives an estimate of the replacement value of a

 firm's inventories.     The estimates in many cases are actually

 provided by the firms themselves in footnotes to the Moody's tables.

 When the only information available is the proportion of inventories

 in LIFO and the length of time LIFO has been used, one of twenty

 available price indices is used to estimate the replacement value of

LIFO inventories. FIFO inventories are assumed to equal replacement

value.


Data Item 46.


     This variable is the reported proportion of           a   firm's

inventories that is under the LIFO accounting method.


Data Item 47.


     This is the price index associated ,ith a firm's           FIFO

inventories.     It is used to canpute an WA. It is not necessarily

the same price index that is used in constructing a replacement

estimate for the LIFO portion of inventories.


Availability of Data Items.


     All 52 data items are not available for all panels.   Items 45

through 51 are available only for the 1978 Panel (years 1971—1977).

Item 19, additions at cost, and Item 1, sales, are not reported for

the 1931 and 1936 Panels. Data Item 1. for the 1931 and 1936 Panels

is replaced with the variable "Incaiie Taxes".
