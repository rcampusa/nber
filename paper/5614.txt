specifically, we show that tighter fiscal rules are associated with larger average surplus and lower

cyclical variability of the budget balance.    However, the lower flexibility of the budget balance

does not affect state output variability.

1. Introduction



        Recent work on the impact of balanced budget rules on fiscal behavior has identified two

critical questions. First, whether they are effective in enforcing fiscal discipline or, instead,

whether they can be circumvented by creative aaunting.         Smnd,    if these rules are eff’ive,

what are these benefits in terms of budget discipline versus their costs in terms of lost flexibility in

fiscal policy. Less flexibility should have costs in terms of output variability both in a neoclassical

fiamewor~ because it limits the ability to tax smooth and in a Keynesian framework, because of

the need for anticyclical policies. 1While balanced budget rules are rare for national governments,

various forms of restrictions of this type apply to US states. Furthermore, US states provide a

particularly attractive area for empirical research as most of the rules were imposed long ago,

reducing problems associated with sample selection bias.2



        In this paper, by looking at the experience of US state we conclude that balanced budget

rules are effective in enforcing fiscal discipline and they have no costs in terms of increased output

variability. Recent work by Eichengreen (1992), Poterba (1994), Alt and Lowry (1994), Bayoumi

and Eichengreen (1995) and Bohn and Inman (1995) has shown that, indeed, fiscal restrictions on

US states enforce some budget discipline, in terms of lower deficits and/or quicker response to

negative fiscal shocks at the cost of lowering anticyclical policies. Ptily by drawing on this

previous researc~ we make a very simple point in this paper: the increased discipline generated by

fiscal rules reduces budget flexibility, but it appears to have little or no cost in terms of more

output variability.



        The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents a very simple graphical analysis

which makes our basic point in the most elementary possible way. Section 3 presents some

supporting -nometrics      evidence. The last section concludes.



2. Budget restrictions, deficits and variability



        As our measure of budgetary restrictions we use the variable constructed by Anderson and

the Adviso~ Council on Intergovernmental Relations (1987). This inde~ which varies between O

and 10 with a higher number indicating more stringent fiscal controls, has been used by virtually

all earlier researchers into the impact of fiscal controls on US states. As we are interested in the

impact of fiscal controls on overall budgetary policy, we adopt the relatively broad measure of the

budget surplus used in Bayoumi and Eichengreen (1995). Others (for example, Bohn and Inmq

1995) have focused specifically on the types of expenditures covered by fiscal controls.

Reassuringly, the overall conclusions from both types of data appear similar. All of our analysis is

for the 48 mainland US states.



       Figure 1 plots the average primary budget surplus as a share of state product for the


                                                   2
period 1988 to 1992 against our measure of fiscal control.3 The figure shows a positive

relationship indicating that more stringent fiscal controls are associated with higher primary

surpluses. The regression line is as follows: (t-statistics in parenthesis)



PRIMS = 0.0023 + 0.0010 FC                                                                   (1)
           (0.72)      (2.62)


N. ofobs: 48    R*= 0.13



In equation (1) PRIMS is the average budget surplus as a share of state product, and FC is the

measure of fiscal control, increasing in the tightness of the controls.



       This relationship is not limited to the primary surplus. Figure 2 plots the average total

surplus as a share of state product for the period 1965-1992. Once again a positive relationship

appears. The regression line is as follows:



S = 0.0040 + 0.0004 FC                                                                       (2)
    (2.11)   (1.96)


N. of ohs. 48 R*= 0.08

where S is the average surplus 1965-1992.




   3The reason for truncating the data period at 1988 is that we were unable to obtain data on
   interest payments prior to 1988 from our data source (the WEFA group), although such data
   appear to exist. All other regressions use data from 1965-1992.

                                                   3
       Figure 3 plots the standard deviation of the change in the surplus as a share of state

product against the index of fiscal control. This figure shows a negative relationship between

surplus variability ad fiscal controls, indicating that these controls impose some rigidity in the

budget balance. The regression line is as follows:



STS = 0.0082-       0.0003 FC                                                                   (3)
      (10.87)       (-2.83)


N. of ohs: 48 R*= 0.15

where STS is the standard deviation of the change in the surplus as a share of state product over

1965-1992.



       The next figure 4 cotirms that the cyclical variability of surpluses is lower in states with

more stringent fiscal controls. Following Bayoumi and Eichengreen ( 1995), this figure is obtained

as follows. First we ran the following regression for each state for the sample 1965-1992.



DSJ, = a,+ b, DYJt +   CJSJ(,.l)                                                      (4)



where (D)S, is the (change in) the surplus as a share of output in state J and DY is the change in

the logarithm of real output. Figure 4 plots the coefficients b, against our measure of fiscal

controls. The plot shows a negative correlatio~ indicating that more stringent controls are

associated with less cyclical response of the budget. The regression line is as follows:




                                                  4
b= O.120 - 0.0069 FC                                                                              (5)
    (4.70)        (-2,30)



N. of ohs. 48     R2 = 0.10




Thus, these simple plots and regressions show that tighter fiscal controls impose more budget

discipline but also more budget rigidity.



        The critical policy questio~ however, is whether the rigidity imposed by the fiscal mntrol

has economic rests. Figure 5 suggests that the answer is negative, at least if economic costs are

measured in terms of the variability of real state product. This figure plots the standard deviation

of the logarithm of the growth in real state product versus our measure of fiscal controls. No

relationship appears to exist in the data. The regression line is as follows;



YST = 0.0003          - 0.0004 FC                                                                 (6)
             (9.13)     (-0.82)



N. ofobs: 48 R2 = 0.01



where YST is the standard deviation of state product for the sample 1965-92. The coefficient on

the fiscal control variable not ody is statistically insignificant, it also has the wrong sign.




        In summary, the larger rigidity imposed by tighter fiscal controls does not seem to have an

impact on state output variability,


                                                    5
3. Regression Analysis



       We have run several regressions controlling for a variety of variables. Our results confirm

the basic picture described by the simple plots of the previous section. Table 1 reports an example

of these regressions. In these particular regressions we control for the size of the state, measured

as the average of the logarithm of its nominal product between 1965 and 1992, a measure of its

output compositio~ namely the average proportion of nominal output emanating from the mining

sector between 1965 and 1992, and a regional dummy variable for Southern states. It is generally

believed that Southern states have different fiscal behavior from the rest of the country, and this

type of variable has been included in many earlier studies of fiscal policy across states (for

example, EichengreeL 1992 and Bohn and Inmq            1995),



       In column 1, which comesponds to figure 1, the dependent variable is the average primary

surplus as a share of state product (averaged from 1988-92). The coefficient on the fiscal control

variable has the expected signs and is significant at the 5 per cent level. The same observation

applies to column 2 which correspond to Figure 2. Here the depended variable is the average

surplus as share of state product for the sample 1965-92. In the third and fourth column which

correspond to figure 3 and 4 respectively the sign on the fiscal control variable is expected to be

negative, and, in fact, it is significatively negative. Finally, the last column which corresponds to

Figure 5 shows no correlation between our measure of fiscal control and state product variability.

Hence, d of our basic results appear robust to the inclusion of these extra regressors in the

regression.


                                                   6
        ~eadditiond     regressors generally havethe expected signmd impact. Forexample, the

results indicate that larger states have less variable fiscal surpluses and less variability of output,

presumably because their output base is more diversified, but tend to run more counter-cyclical

policies, possibly because fiscal leakages are perceived to be smaller. States with larger

percentages of output devoted to mining and quarrying have greater variability of real output, run

larger surpluses (possibly for prudential reasons) and have surpluses which vary less with the

cycle. More surprising is that fact that Southern states are found to tend to run smaller surpluses

than those in other regions, which appears somewhat out of keeping with the fiscal conservatism

usually associated with the region.



        We run several alternative specifications in addition to those reported in table 1. These

included several intermediate regressions in which only some of the additional independent

variables were included, and regressions where, in addition to the proportion of output associated

with mining, we also controlled for the proportion of output in agriculture and in manufacturing.

However, these additional variables were generally insignificant, and hence are not reported. The

qualitative nature of the results was unchanged by these experiments.



        Some insight into the reasons for the absence of a relationship between fiscal controls and

output variables can be found by regressing the variability of state product on both the coefficients

b, from the regression of the state budget on output, as a measure of the contribution of

anticyclical policies to stabilizing output, and on the variability of the change in the state surplus,

as a measure of the destabilizing impact of undisciplined fiscal policies. This regression produced


                                                    7
the following results:

YST = 0.025 - 0.048 CYCLE + 1.694 STS                                                           (7)
      (5.99)  (2.30)        (2.47)

N. of ohs: 48 R2 = 0.16



where YST is the standard deviation of state product for the sample 1965-92, CYCLE is the

cyclical coefficient discussed earlier, and STS is the standard deviation of the change in the budget

surplus as a percentage of state product. Anticyclical policies lower the variability of rd    state

product, but higher variability of the surplus in general raises it. As fiscal controls reduce both

factors, the net impact on output variability is uncertain. For US states the two itiuences

apparently approximately cancel out, leaving no direct impact from fiscal controls onto output

variability. Unlike the earlier results, however, this regression is not robust to the inclusion of

other explanatory variables. Adding the extra independent variables included in table 1

approximately halves the estimated coefficients and t-statistics on both anticyclical policies and

the variability of the fiscal surplus, although none of the new independent variables are

individually significant at conventional levels.



4. Discussion



       Tight fiscal controls which impose restrictions on deficits reduce average deficits and

reduce budget flexibility. However this increased rigidity does not seem to tiect the variability of

state product. This result can have two non mutually exclusive explanations. First, it may be the
case that the stabilizing role of fiscal policy at the state level is simply not very important, so that

reducing       its impact does not have a significant          effect on product       variability.    The second

interpretation     is that the fiscal restriction not only impede “good” anticyclical policies but also

limit politically motivated and biased policies which may have a destabilizing                    effect.




         These results on fiscal rules at the state level cannot be interpreted as an endorsement              of

balanced       budget rules for national     governments.        A recent literature      has shown that fiscal

institutions     matter for fiscal outcomes for national govemments.4            However, this literature does

not imply that balanced           budget rules are desirable.        On the contrary,       one may argue that

appropriate      procedures      may enforce fiscal discipline       without    the need for too constraining

balanced       budget   rules.    In other words, for national           governments    the tax smoothing     and

Keynesian anticyclical policy arguments may be much more important than for state and local

governments.       If this is the case the results of this paper suggest that while balanced budget rules

may be effective         for subnational     political   jurisdictions     they may not be so for national

governments.
