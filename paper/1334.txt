                     The Architecture of Economic Systems:
                          Hierarchies and Polyarchies


                              ABSTRACT



     This paper presents some new perspectives on the structure and
performance of alternative economic organizations. We posit that decision
makers make errors of judgement (for example, they sometimes select bad
projects while rejecting good projects), and that how these errors are
aggregated within different organizations depends on their architecture (for
example, on how individuals are organized together). Using this framework, we
compare the performances of two polar forms of organizations: hierarchies and
polyarchies.
     Assuming judgmental abilities of individuals are similar in the two
systems, we show that polyarchies accept a larger proportion of bad projects
(compared to hierarchies) whereas hierarchies reject a larger proportion of
good projects. We then determine the conditions under which polyarchies have
higher or lower expected profit. The conditions under which polyarchies
perform better appear to be more plausible and, moreover, this conclusion
holds also in the case where the rules for accepting or rejecting projects are
rationally determined based on the information available to individuals. The
architecture of organizations also affects their portfolio of available
projects; we determine conditions under which polyarchies have better or worse
portfolios compared to those available to hierarchies.

     There are many possible extensions of our approach. Among them are the
analysis of internal structure of firms, selection of managers (by other
managers) and the reproduction and self—perpetuation of organizations over
time.

                              HIERARCHIES AND POLYARCHIES




        There   is a widespread belief that the internal organization of an

economic system has an important effect on its performance. Yet, there is

very little in traditional economic analysis which investigates such a

relationship.1 In this paper, we present some new ways of looking at economic

systems. We motivate our discussion in the context of economic systems, but

it has implications for the internal organization of large corporations as

well.

        The thesis of this paper is that economic systems behave fundamentally

differently under different forms of organization, and that      central   to an

understanding of the performance of an economic system is an understanding of

its architecture. The architecture (like that of a computer or electrical

system)    describes, among other things, how the constituent decision making

units are arranged together in a system (i.e., who makes which decisions) and

who conveys what information to whom. Our attempt is to relate the

architecture of alternative economic systems, along with their attendant rules

for meting out rewards and punishments, to their performance.

        The axiom of human behavior which plays a basic role in our analysis is

that alL decision makers make      errors   of judgment. For concreteness we focus

on simple decisions which involve accepting or rejecting certain projects.

Individuals (or the constituents of economic systems) make these decisions

based on the information available to them. In any event, because of the

errors    in judgment, some projects which get accepted should have been
rejected, and some projects which are rejected should have been accepted.

Using the analogy from the classical theory of statistical inference, these

errors correspond to Type—Il and Type—I errors.

       The typology of economic systems on which we focus in this    paper   arises

from the differences in how individuals are organized together in a system.

We think of a polyarchy as a system in which there are independeat (and

possibly competing) sources of decision making. In contrast;, a hierarchy is

visualized as a system in which the decision making authority is more

concentrated.       In Section 1, we present simple (polar) dels of these two
           2
systems.
       The most important consequence of how the individuals are arranged

together       is that the aggregation of errors is different in different economic
systems.        The aggregation of errors, in turn, determines the performance of a
system.        For example, in a market economy, if one firm rejects a profitable

idea (say, for a new product), then there is a possibility that some other

firm might accept it.       In contrast, if a single agency makes such decisions

and this agency rejects the idea, then the idea must remain unused. The same,

however, is also true for those ideas which are unprofitable. As a result,

one   would expect a greater incidence of Type—Il error in a    polyarchy, and a

greater incidence of Type—I error in a hierarchy.

       It should be apparent, however, that the overall performance of a system

(for example, its profit level) will depend not only on its architecture, but
also on the mix of projects that is available to its declsioa makers, and on
the nature of errors that the decision making entails.
     Initially, in Section II, we assume that individuals make similar        errors

iii   the two systems, and that the nature of errors is exogenously specified.


                                          —2—
Moreover, the mix of projects available to the two systems is also

ideriticl. The performance of economic systems is thus attributable primarily

to what we have called their architecture.

    We then examine, in Section III, how the portfolio of projects available

to art economic system is influenced by its architecture. This represents more

of a general equilibrium view: the differences in the architecture will

affect the chances that different types of projects have of being accepted or

rejected. This will, in turn, influence the incentives of those who

conceptualize and invent projects, and will thus affect the kinds of projects

which are invented. For example, one would expect that the inventors would

attempt to generate those projects which are more likely to be accepted.

     The above analysis takes the errors in judgment (that is, the

probabilities of good projects being rejected and those of bad projects being

selected   by evaluators) as exogenous, as well as identical in the two

systems.    In Section IV, we   analyze an endogenous determination of these

errors.    This we   do by determining rational screening rules for project

acceptance, where the constituents in the economic systems take into account

whatever information is available to them.

     In this paper, we analyze only one, albeit an important one, aspect of

the architecture of economic systems. Some other important aspects are

sketched out in the concluding section.


I. TUE MODEL
     In the following model, a polyarchy consists of two firms, and a
hierarchy   consists of two bureaus. The   task of a bureau or a firm is to
screen    projects. Each project has a scalar (net) benefit, which can be



                                        —3—
positive, negative, or zero. A screen (i.e., a bureau or a firm) evaluates

every project and accepts or rejects the project.

      The decision process in a polyarchy and a hierarchy are depicted in

Figures 1 and 2 respectively. In a polyarchy, the two firms screen the

projects independently. For specificity, one may think of projects arriving

randomly (with probability one—half) at one of the two firms. If a particular

project is accepted by a firm, then it is no longer available to the other

firm. If the project is rejected, then it goes to the other firm where, once

again, it can be accepted or rejected. Neither firm screens the same project

twice, so that a project can not cycle back and forth between firms.3 The

portfolio of projects selected in a polyarchy therefore consists of the

projects accepted separately by each of the two firms.

      In contrast, in a hierarchy, all projects are first evaluated by the

lower bureau (bureau 1); those which are accepted are forwarded to the higher

bureau (bureau 2) and others are discarded. The projects selected by the

system then are those which pass through the higher bureau. Drawing an

analogy from the design of electrical circuits, the screens are placed in

series in a hierarchy whereas they are placed in parallel in a polyarchy.

      Throughout the paper, the superscripts P and H represent a polyarchy and

a hierarchy respectively. Also, for brevity, we use the superscript s, where

s = P or H. Let x denote the net profit (benefit) from a project,4 and let

 p5(x) denote the probability that this project will pass through a screen in
                                                           5
the system.      We refer to p5(x) as the screening function. Then the

probabilities that the project x will be accepted in the system s, denoted by

fS,   are   given by

      We refer to the portfolio of projects available to an   economic system as
the initial portfolio and the portfolio that it selects as the final

portfolio. For system s, NS denotes the number of projects in the initial

portfolio,       gS(x) denotes its pdf, and GS(x) denotes its cdf. The initial

portfolio contains both profitable and unprofitable projects, i.e., there are
                                                        6
projects with positive as well as negative x s.

      Our interest is iii examining the final portfolios in the two systems.

These can be represented using many different summary statistics. For

example, the fraction of initial projects selected by the systems, denoted by

S is given by



(3)          ns =        E[fS},


iii which E denotes the expectation operator; the expectation is calculated

with respect to the pdf for the system.

      On the other hand, if we are interested in studying the profitability of

alternative systems, then an important statistic is the expected profit. We

denote this by yS, which is7



(4)                  =   N5E[xf5].


One might also be interested in other statistics; we discuss these later.



                                                  —5—
      Screening Function: The screening function p(x) is the probability that
projects    with different levels of profit are accepted by a bureau or a firm.

It summarizes the error making properties of a screen. It can take any form,

provided



(5)          1     p(x) ) 0,



for all x, and      the strict inequalities              hold for at least some

      Two properties of the screening function are of special interest. The

first is its slope, i.e., p(x) =                           .   If   p(x) is positive then a

project with higher profit has a higher local probability of being accepted by

a screen. If p(x) = 0, then the screening is indiscriminate, since it                      does
not distinguish between a better and                 a   worse project.

      While in     certain   cases it        is   possible that the sign of p, changes over

the range of projects, we consider here oniy those screens which                    have at least
some, but not complete, discriminating ability throughout the range of

projects.        That is, p >      0, for         all x. Further, if p and        represent two

screens, and if       p(x)     >   p(x),      then we refer to the former screen as locally

more discriminating at x =              x.
      The   second important property of screens is the level of p(x). If
 p(x)   > p(x), then we call the former screen locally slacker, and the latter

locally tighter, at x =            x.
        In some cases examined in this paper, we employ linear screening

functions. The corresponding conclusions will approximately hold for all

those screens for which the curvature of p(x) is small. In such cases, p(x)



                                                     —6—
is expressed as



(6)          p(x) = p
                        1.'
                              + p

                                       (x —   i),

where    i   is   the mean of the initial portfolio, i.e., u =

and   p = p(.i)     is the probability that the average project will pass through a

screen. Clearly, a higher p and                      imply globally higher slackness and
discriminating capability.

       It is useful here to ask: what is it that the economics literature

typically assumes concerning the screening functions? In the absence of

uncertainty in the outcome of projects (as in the case of the present model)9,

much of the literature makes no distinction between the projects which are

worth selecting, and those which are actually selected. This assumptioa, in

the   context     of the present model, implies that: p(x) =              I if x > 0, and
 p(x) = 0 if x < 0.                In this case, the performances of a polyarchy and a

hierarchy are identical in every respect, as can be easil.y verified.

        Thus, the architecture of economic systems ceases to be a relevant issue,

if one   assumes     that human decision making            is   absolutely fauLtless. Even a

casual observation of actual functioning of business and public organizations,

in contrast, makes            it   abundantly clear that errors of judgment are an

inescapabLe feature of human decision making. This reaLization not only makes

it necessary to recast the traditional view of the literature, but it aLso

provides a potential cornerstone for unraveling certain hitherto unrecognized

differences among different types of organizational systems.



II. PORTFOLIOS SELECTED IN ALTERNATIVE SYSTEMS



                                                    —7--
       In this section, we investigate two questions. First, how is the

portfolio selected in each of the two systems affected by the exogenous

parameters representing the initial portfolios and the characteristics of the

screens? Second, what is the relative performance of the final portfolios in

the   two systems, and how is this influenced by the exogenous parameters?
While answering the second question, we assume that the two systems have the
same initial portfolios and screening mechanisms; the differences in their
performance    are therefore solely         due to the difference in their
architecture.         This assumption is not required for answering the first

question since it does not involve any comparison across the systems.

       The statistics of the portfolio selected which we etamine in some detail

are: the proportion of original projects selected and t (expected) profit

from   the portfolio selected. We also point out how some other statistics can
be analyzed.


       A.   The   Size of Portfolios Selected
       The proportion of the initial portfolio selected by the two systems,
     is given in (3).            Denoting   the difference in these proportions by An, we
find that

(7)         An = n P     —
                             H
                             a   > 0, since




(8)          fP   —   fH = 2p(x)1 — p(x)} >       0,




and    it is strictly positive        for some   x.


                                                 -8-
       Therefore: A polyarchy always selects a larger proportion of initial

projects than a hierarchy.

       The reason behind this result is quite intuitive. Consider a

hypothetical situation in which the second firm in a polyarchy does not accept

any project, whereas the higher bureau in a hierarchy accepts all of the

projects forwarded to it by the lower bureau. The proportion of projects

accepted in the two systems, then, would be the same, narnely, E[p(x)].                 It

follows then that the actual proportion of projects accepted in a polyarchy

will   always exceed that in a hierarchy.
       In fact, this intuition can be extended further. To see this, let good
(bad) projects be denoted by an arbitrary non—empty set A within the range of
x. Then the screening is completely faultless (erroneous) if
p(x) = 1 for x c A, and it is completely erroneous (faultless) if p(x) = 0,
for x      A.       Now, from (1) and (2), 'A f'gdx > f fHgdx, unless p(x) equals
either I or 0, for x             A.

     It follows that:        A polyarchy accepts a larger number of          good as well as
bad projects than a hierarchy, no matter how one defines good and had
projects, provided he screening is               neither    completely faultless nor

completely erroneous. Therefore, the incidence of Type—i error is relatively
higher in   a   hierarchy, whereas the incidence of Type—Il error is relatively
higher in a polyarchy.
       To understand the impact of initial portfolios on the size of portfolios
selected, let   represent a parameter representing the initial portfolio, i.e.,
the pdf of the initial portfolio is g(x, ). Then, from (3)

obtained by integration by part.1° In (9),                              f5 > 0, from (1) and (2).

we find from (1) and (2) that                             <   0, and fh      > o•   The   signs   of (9) and

(10) can now be evaluated using the standard properties of stochastic

dominance.'' The key results are as follows.

       An improvement (worsening) in the initial portfolio in the sense of

first—order stochastic dominance leads to a larger (smaller) proportion of

initialprojects being selected in both a polyarchy and a hierarchy. An
improvement (worsening) in the initial portfolio in the sense of second—order
stochastic      dominance leads to a larger (smaller) proportion of                           initial

projects being selected in apolyarchy,                           auda smaller (larger) proportion
being   selected in a hierarchy.

       These    results can                 be seen in Figure 3.        In   this figure, fP and fH are
concave and convex quadratics in x, since p is linear. n s the                                     area above
the x—axis bounded by the product of fS                          and   g. Naturally, this area
corresponding            to fP         is   higher   than that to fH; and       this area   expands, for both
a polyarchy and a hierarchy, if the probability weight g(x) shifts from lower

x to higher x.                Also, if the           probability weight shifts from the mean to the

two sides (due to a mean preserving spread, for example) then the area

representing S decreases in a polyarchy and it increases in a hierarchy.

     Explicit expressions for S are derived in the Appeadix I. From these
expressions, one can obtain bounds on the magnitudes of n, and also one can
ascertain how a5 is influenced by changes in the screening function. As one
can see in Figure 3: A higher (lower) slackness in screening raises (lowers)
the proportion of projects selected in both systems. We also show that:                        A

higher (lower) discriminating ability in screening lowers (raises) the

proportion selected in a polyarchy, whereas it raises (lners) the proportion

selected in a hierarchy.



       B. Profit in Alternative Systeiis

       Probably the single most important indicator of the performance of a

system is its (expected) profit. We begin our analysis o profit with simple

initial portfolios which contain two types of projects; mere general

portfolios are examined later.

       Two Types of Projects: Consider an initial portfolio consisting of two

types of projects, good and bad, with respective net profits x and —x2, where

    and x2 are positive. The probabilities of passing tLrough a screen are

denoted by parameters p1 and p2 respectively. The initial portfolio

contains a fraction n of good projects. If tY = yP —                            is   the indicator

to compare the profit levels in the two systems, then from (4)

       The above expression allows us to demarcate the parameters' space ifltO

two regions: one in which a polyarchy has a higher profit than a hierarchy,

and the other in which the reverse holds. To see this in its simplest form,



                                                 —11—-
first assume that x1 =
                             x2   ,   i.e.,   a good and a bad project have symmetric

gain and loss. The parameters which determine the sign of (11) are

       p2 , and   n.


       Figure 4 summarizes the results.          We are concerned only with the area

below the 450    line,   since p1 > p2 .       Now take, for a moment, the case in

which the initial portfolio contains good and bad projects in equal

proportions, i.e., n = 1/2.            Then a polyarchy has a higher profit in the

region ODA, whereas the reverse holds in the region ADB. That is, polyarchy

has a higher profit if



(12)         p1 + p2 < 1,



and the reverse holds otherwise.

       The intuition behind this result is as follows. Recall that a polyarchy

selects more projects, good as well as bad, than a hierarchy. A polyarchy's

profit from good projects is greater, but so is its loss from bad projects.

For a polyarchy to perform better, therefore, its higher profit from good

projects must outweigh its higher loss from bad projects. Now, the expression

(11) shows that a polyarchy's relative profit from good projects is highest

when p1= 1/2, and this decreases when p1 diverges from one—half. Similarly,

a polyarchy's relative loss from bad projects is highest when p2 =           1/2, and
it decreases as P2 diverges from this point. When we add the gain and the

loss, then we find that a polyarchy has a higher profit level if (12) iS

satisfied.
       If the initial portfolio contains a smaller proportion of good projects,

that is if n < 1/2, then from (11), we find that the parameter space is



                                              —12—

separated by a hyperbola like OEA, which is inside the region ODA'2. A

polyarchy has a higher profit within the region OEA, and the reverse holds

outside of it. The region OEA shrinks if the proportion of good projects in

the initial portfolio is smaller, and it coincides with the line

OA if a +     0.
      The opposite case, in which the initial portfolio contains a greater

proportion of good project has a parallel implication. A polyarchy then has a

higher profit outside of the region AFB, and the reverse holds inside it. Not

surprisingly, the two regions OEA and AFB coincide wIth the triangles ODA and

ADB   respectively,      as a tends to one—half.

      The same figure allows us to interpret the case in which good and bad

projects have different gain and loss, that is when                             *       •     A.s    is

apparent from (11), a higher x1/x2 leads to a higher relative profit in a

polyarchy, i.e., a higher gain from a good project or a lower loss from a bad

project is relatively advantageous to a polyarchy. It is intuitive,

therefore, that x11x2 plays a role analogous to a.                              Specifically, the line

AD separates the two relevant regions in Figure 4 if a =                                      +            A
                                                                                     x2/(x1         x2).
hyperbola like OEA is the           boundary if either a or x1/x2 is smaller than what
would satisfy the last equation. If a or x11x2                      is   larger, on the other hand,

then a hyperbola like AFB is the relevant boundary.13

      What we find concerning the screening probabilities, therefore, is that

if p1 is small        (and   significantly larger than p2) then                  a   polyarchy has higher

profit even if, within a range, the initial portfolio has fewer good projects

and if the gain from a good project is smaller than the loss from a bad

project. On the other hand, within a range of initial portfolios, a hierarchy

has higher profit if p1 is large, and if it is close to p2.

         A qualitative summary of the results is as follows. If the Initial

portfolio improves (because of a larger proportion of good projects, a higher

gain from a good project, or a lower loss from a bad project), then the

relative profit in a polyarchy (compared to a hierarchy) improves. The

reverse happens if the initial portfolio worsens. Within a range of initial

portfolios, however, a polyarchy has a higher profit than a hierarchy if the

screening of projects is tight and if it has high discriminating ability. The

opposite conclusion holds if the screening is slack and if it has low

         A General Project Portfolio: Now consider initial project portfolios

consisting of a spectrum of projects. Recall that the number of projects is

NS.      If pS(x) is a polynomial of order m then, from (4), Y8 is a function of

up to 2m + 1 moments of the distribution of initial portfolio. If the

screening function is approximately linear, then



(13)               Y = NS4(.i,           S    s, s
                                                                                      3
where:           o2 = E[(x        —   j) 2I       .         .
                                              > 0 is the variance and r = —EIx   u)       )/a
                                                                                                3
                                                                                                    is the

negative of the coefficient of skewness of the initial portfolio. 4 is the

expected profit per project in the initial portfolio, i.e., 4 = YS/NS

         Explicit expressions for                     are presented in Appendix I. Though these

expressions can be interpreted for arbitrary values of i and n,                           it might be
useful to hypothesize about the relevant range of these parameters. Common

experience suggests that the world is full of unprofitable ideas, whereas

profitable ideas are quite scarce. Also, the (net) profit that can be

typically made from even the best project is limited. In contrast, the losses



                                                        —14—
from those projects which are truly the worst can be much larger.    It ía

reasonable therefore to asstnie that the mean and the skewness of the universe

of projects are nonpositive. That is,



(14a)       i   < 0, and



(14b)       r > 0.



        The relative profit level is gIven by (see Appendix 1)14



(15)             =   2Ni[p(1   -
                                   p)   —     + 2NE(1 —       + p2



The sign of the above expression depends critically on p which, it should be

recalled, is the probability that the average project (which according to

(14a) has a nonpositive profit) will pass through a screen. For brevity in

exposition in what follows, we call the screening tight if p < 1/2.          We

note the foLlowing qualitative results.

        First, the intuition developed in the earlier section concerning the

screening function is confirmed in the present case as well. Specifically, a

greater tightness or a greater discriminating ability in screens corresponds

to a higher relative profit in a polyarchy, provided the screening is tight.

        Second, we obtain some new insights concerning the initial portfolio: A

larger negative skewness in the initial portfolio implies a higher relative

profit in a polyarchy. Also, a larger variance implies a higher relative

profit in a polyarchy, provided the screening is tight.

        Third, we note some of the circumstances in which the profit level in a



                                            —15—
polyarchy is greater or smaller than that in a hierarchy.            It is obvious from

(15) that if the screening of projects is indiscriminate, then the profit in a

polyarchy can not be larger than that in a hierarchy.

       Therefore: For a polyarchy to have a greater profit than a hierarchy, it

is necessary that the screens should have some discriminating ability.

       Further, a polyarchy has a lower profit if the inItIal portfolio is

symmetric and the screening is slack. On the other hand, a polyarchy has a

higher profit if the mean of the initial portfolio is close to zero, and if

the screening is tight.



       C.   Other Characteristics of Portfolios Selected
       Obviously,       additional summary statistics might be    of some interest in
comparing the overall performance of the two             systems. Among these are the

mean and the higher moments of the final portfolios. To obtain these, let

h5(x) denote the probability that a project with profit x is among the

projects selected in system s. Then from Bayes' theorem



(16)         hS(x) =      fS(x)g(x)


Moments of the final portfolios can be derived using the above pdf.

       For example, the mean of the final portfolio in the system s is

     xh(x)dx.       Denoting the mean by 1.1S   ,   we have
 f




(17)                =    +         , where


(18)
                S
                    =   E[(x   —   i)f S   I




                                               —16—
is the covariance between x and fs(x). Variance and other higher moments of

the final portfolios can be obtained similarly.

        Note that the covariance (18) is positive because p(x) is positive and,

therefore, x and fS      are   positively related. Thus: the final portfolios in

both a polyarchy as well as in a hierarchy have higher means than the means of

their initial portfolios. This happens because both systems improve upon

their initial portfolios due to the discriminating ability of their screens.'5



III •    INVENTORS' INCENTIVES



        A..   Deterainants of the Initial Project Portfolio
                                      portfolio as given, and examined how
        Thus far we have taken the initial
the performance of economic systems is affected by exogenous changes in this
portfolio. This is clearly a partial equilibrium view, since it ignores the
responses and incentives of those who invent projects. In a more general
equilibrium view, which we explore in this section, we explicitly take such
responses into account.
        There are many ways to represent the incentives which influence
inventors'      behavior, the constraints which inventors face, and how these two

aspects are related to the relevant features of the alternative economic

systems. What       we emphasize here is the commonly observed fact that the
acceptance of an idea or invention is often the most significant     reward to its

inventor,      and that inventors would attempt to invent those projects which have
greater chances of being accepted in an economic system.
         Specifically, we assume that the gain to an inventor from a project


                                          —17—
depends on whether the project is accepted or not. The utilities to an

inventor from an accepted arid a rejected project are denoted by U and U

respectively, where Ua        U   and U's are exogenous paraaeters.'6 We make

this assumption partly for simplicity, but it is also true that, in the

present problem, pecuniary reward to inventors can be linked only tenuously

with the actual values of projects.17

       We visualize the project creation process as follows. There are a large

number of inventors. Each of them selects a technology of invention from a

family of such technologies. A particular technology determines the number of

projects which will be generated, and it also determines the statistical

distribution from which these projects would be drawn. If inventors are

identical then, in a symmetric equilibrium, they will choose the same

technology and the resulting collection of projects will constitute the

initial project portfolio.

       One can therefore represent the inventor's choice as being exercised

through parameters (N, ), where N is the number of projects and the vector

   influences the pdf of the initial project portfolio. The pdf, thus, is

represented as g(x, ).        The maximand of inventors can then be written as



(19)        N[JUfSg(x, )dx + fUr(1 —       fS)g(x, 8)dx,


which can be rearranged in a simpler form as



(20)        Nti5 + NU




where U =   U/(U   —    U),   and n5 =   ff5g(x,   B)dx.



                                           —18—
       A heuristic way to interpret the above expression is as follows:

Inventors gain a bonus of one dollar for each project selected and               a   fixed fee

of U dollars for each project invented. Two              special   cases are worth noting.

If there is no fixed fee (that is, Ur + 0, and the second term in (20) drops

out) then the inventors maximize          the   number of projects selected. On the

other hand, if there is no bonus (that is, Ua =                    and only the second term
                                                            Ur
in (20) matters) then the inventors maximize the number of projects

invented. These responses are in accord with the intuition.

       Further, the combinations of N and              that can be chosen is restricted by

what is feasible. We represent the technological feasibility as



(21)         (N, ) e T


where T is the technologically feasible set of N and the elements of                     18


Maximization of (20), under the       constraint       (21) on the choice variables,

yields   Ns and      which, in turn, characterize the initial portfolio of
projects available to each of the two systems.


       B. Two   Types   of Projects
       In   this case, the inventors' choice variables are the numbers of good and

bad projects, which are denoted by N1 and N2. From (20), the maximand of

inventors in the system s is



(22)                                  +
             (f N1 ÷ f N2) + (N1


in   which recall that f and f are respectively the probabilities that a good



                                                —19—
and a bad project will be accepted in the system. These probabilities are

related to the screening probabilities, p1 and p2 ,                                through (1) and (2).
Further, the constraint (21) can now be represented in a simple form as



(23)       N2 = N2(N1).



Clearly, we need to consider only those cases in which there is a trade—off

between N1 and N2            otherwise the two systems have identical initial

portfolios.

       Dividing (22) by a constant, f + U, the maximand of inventors can be

written as



(24)         F5N1 + N2



where, F9 =
                   (f   +
                            U)/(f   + U).              The above maximand implies that          the   number

of   good projects in a polyarchy is larger (or smaller) than that in a

hierarchy if F1' is greater (or smaller) than FH. To examine this issue

further, we obtain the following from (1) and (2).



             F —                    —
                                            p2)[(l
                                                       —        -         U —
(25)
                    FH2(p1                                 p1       p2)         p1p2J


       Now, recall that p1 > p2 > 0. Therefore, the expression (25) is

positive if: 1 > p1 + p2                ,    that      is, the screening probabilities fall in the

region OAD    of   Figure 4, and if



(26)         U > p1p2/(l —                  —
                                p1              p2).


                                                           —20—
       Therefore, the initial portfolio in a polyarchy contains a larger number

of   good projects (compared to that in a hierarchy) if                 the screening of

projects       is    tight and discriminating, and if the fixed gains to inventors from

the invented projects are significant (so that (26) is satisfied). The

reverse holds if the above conditions are not satisfied.'9



IV. RATIONAL SCREKNINC RULES



       A. Determinants of Screening Rules

       Although        there    are many   possible   sources of error in screening, the one

on which we focus here is            that due   to errors in the assessment of the value of

projects. We          posit that the observations         on the   value of projects are
contaminated         by random errors, such that a perfect inference is          not

possible.           If the observations which an evaluator makes         on a project with

profit x are represented by y, then



(27)           y =    y(x,     0)




where        0 represents random errors. The screening rule then is a binary
function (accept or reject) of observations y.
        In   addition,       the screening rules will depend on the nature of information
flows within economic systems. For example, if firms ia a polyarchy do not
share information, then a firm can not distinguish between the projects which

are being evaluated for the first time from those projects which were rejected

by the other firm.20 A firm, therefore, will use the same screening rule for



                                                  —2 1—
all projects that it receives.

        On the other hand, if firms provide to one another their own observations

on   the   projects which they reject, then they might use two screening rules:

one for the projects being evaluated for the first time and another for the

rest of the projects. In fact, the same could happen even at an intermediate

level of information flow in which firms label their rejected projects.

        It is important to note here that the architecture of the economic system

itself conveys some information to its constituents, which they will use in

setting Bayesian decision rules. For example, even when there is no

information sharing, the two firms would not act independently, since each

firm knows that some       of   the projects it receives are those rejected by the

other firm and, consequently, the portfolio of projects faced by a firm is not

a replica of the initial portfolio, but it has been modified by the other

firm.

        Similarly,   in   a hierarchy, an important question is whether the upper

bureau uses the entire information collected in the organization (i.e.,

observations made by both bureaus) in its own screening rule,            or   that only a

part of the entire information is available at the top. In the case of no

information sharing between the bureaus, the upper burea&s screening will be

based on its own     information,    and on the knowledge of how   the   portfolio has

been modified by the lower bureau, but not on what value was observed by the

lower bureau for a particular project.2'

        In the section below we examine the case in which there is noinforaation sha-

ring between screens in either of the two economic systems. This is partly

for simplicity, but it also represents a base case which brings out the trade—

of fs which would remain important regardless of the nature of information



                                            —22—
flows.




        B. cut—off Levels     for Observed Project Values
        Project   evaluators often use cut—off levels for screening; a project is

accepted if its observed profit is above the cut—off level, and it is rejected

otherwise. Suppose that every screen makes one scalar observation; that the

errors in the observations made by different screens are identically and

independently     distributed; and that errors are additive,22 i.e.,



(28)          y(x, 8) =     + 8.


Denote the pdf of 0 by         £(0), and the corresponding cdf by L(8). Then



(29)          p(x, R) =   Prob[y(x,    8) > RI =     1   — L(R —   x),   and



(30)          P(c) =           = £(R — x)       0,


where

        In a polyarchy, denote the two firms by superscripts i and j, such that

i, j =    1   and 2; and i * .        If   R' is the cut—off level for firm i, then

 p1      p(x, R1) denotes the corresponding screening fuaction. For firm i,

then, the probability that a given project with profit x Will                        arrive to be
evaluated     for the first time is 1/2, and the probability that the same                     project
will arrive after being rejected from firm j               is   (1 —     p3)/2   .    Since   these two
kinds    of arrivals can not be distinguished, the probability that a given

(undifferentiated)     project with value x will arrive at firm I is

                                               —23—
4(2 —         pi),     and the probability that it will be selected is f p1(2 —            pi).
The expected profit of firm I is23

        In a hierarchy, let R and R denote the cut—off levels for the lower

       Selection Externality: Consider for a nEment, a hypothetical situation

in which the cut—off levels for firms in a polyarchy are belug set to maximize

the economy's total profit. In this case, (31) is maximized with respect to

       and R. Call this the 'social optimum'. Clearly, this optimum will

entail, in general, different cut—off points than what independent    firms   would

set; for example, in the optimum derived earlier. Also,   the   level of profit

in the economy will be higher (or at. least no smaller) in the social optimum

than in the private optimum. What we note then, is that the selection of

projects in a polyarchy might generate an externality, although the firms are

identical (even concerning the information they have).25 This externality

could prevent the firms from using those screening rules which maximize the

economy's profit. In contrast, there is no selection externality in a

hierarchy; since the optimal screening rules maximize the economy's profit.

       C. Two Types of Projects
       Consider a portfolio consisting of two types of projects. Denote the

(random) observations on good and bad projects by y1 and y2 . A general

property of cut—off points is seen as follows. Suppose for a nment that the

cut—off point R in a screen is set at the highest observation that a bad

project can yield, i.e., R = max y2 .         Then, the screen will block the bad

projects completely, though several good projects might be rejected as a

consequence. It is obvious that there Is no gain in setting the cut—off point

at a level higher than max y2, since by doing so one losies additIonal good

projects, without affecting bad projects (which are not being selected in any

case).

       By a similar logic, it    is never advantageous to   set R below the lowest

observation   that a good project can yield, at which level all good projects
are accepted.26 Thus


(36)        maxy2>R>rniny1

The trade—off within the above range of R is obvious: A. higher cut—off level

leads to fewer bad projects being accepted, but also to more       good projects

being    rejected. For   brevity, we refer to the upper and lover limit in (36) as

the highest and the lowest cut—off points.

        In Appendix II, we have derived explicit solutions for symmetric

projects, i.e., x1 = x2 =       x,   when the observation errors are uniformly

distributed with mean zero. The qualitative results are summarized below:

        (i) A lower (higher) proportion of good projects in the initial

portfolio corresponds to a tighter (slacker) screening lU        both systems. For


                                           —26—
instance, if the proportion of good projects is greater than two—thirds, then
both systems adopt the lowest cut—off level, ensuring that no good project is
rejected.    This certainly implies a significant probability of accepting a bad

project, but this screening rule is optimal since there are fewer bad projects

in the initial portfolio.

     (ii) The screening rule in a polyarchy is more conservative than that in

a hierarchy. For example, if the proportion of good projects is less than

one—half, then a polyarchy adopts the highest cut—off level, ensuring that no

bad project is selected, even though it loses many good proJects by adopting

this screening rule. In contrast, a hierarchy never finds it optimal to adopt

the highest cut—off level.

     (iii) A polyarchy has a higher (lower) profit than a hierarchy if the

proportion of good projects in the initial portfolio is less (more) than one—

half. Obviously, if one hypothesizes (as we did earlier) that unprofitable

ideas typically outnumber the profitable ones in a portfolio, then the present

model predicts that a polyarchy is a superior institutional arrangement. This

result can be understood in two parts. First, as noted above, a small

proportion of good projects prompts the decision makers to set tighter

screening rules. Second, according to the intuition developed earlier in the

paper, tighter screening implies a relatively better performance in a

polyarchy.



V. CONCLUDING RENARKS



     In this paper, we have proposed a typology of economic systems based on
how their constituents are arranged together. We have compared the



                                     —27—
performance of polar economic             systems        (decentralized versus centralized)27.
Errors in    individuals' judgment, which are an inescapable feature of human

decision making, play a key role in our analysis; since how mistakes add up in

an    economic system depends critically on                    how individual decision making units

are   organized together.
       We began this paper by assuming that the nature of individuals' errors is
similar in the two different architectures under examination, and focused our
attention    on what these errors imply for systems' performance. Subsequently,

we     •i..._
          .eu w.lw LILC LL.+-..
                            l_UI.   IJJ. CI. I. '.JI.                ,...   .       1A i-cc.-.
between    the two systems, when individuals use optimal decision rules based on
the   information available to them.

       There are other important reasons as well why the nature of errors

associated with different architectures may differ. For instance, it is

widely believed that the quality of decision making (i.e., who does what)

varies greatly across organizations; some individuals are better able to

screen projects than others. Two questions that can then be posed are: (i)

How does a system's performance depend on the assignment of individuals of

different abilities to different positions within the system, and (ii) How are

these decisions affected by the system's architecture.

       Decisions about who is to occupy what position within an organization are

usually made by other individuals within the system, and these decisions are

affected, in turn, by factors which are similar to those which affect

decisions on projects. Thus, the architecture of economic systems affects the

quality of those who make judgments about people as well as about projects.

This provides a basis for analyzing the ru1es of succession, and what we

call (in Sah and Stiglitz (1984b)) the self—perpetuating aspects of economic



                                                        —28—
sys terns.
      Another characteristic of economic systems which affects their
performance is the nature of rewards and punishments meted out to the decision
makers. This      has, of course, been the   question around which much of the
recent literature on incentives has focused. In the present paper we have not

emphasized this aspect as much as it deserves.28 This, however, is not

because we think that incentive problems are unimportant, but because we think

that some of them are rather well understood in the literature, and the new

aspects upon which we focus here (for example, aggregation of errors) have

received insufficient attention.

      On     the other hand, we should point Out that the architecture of a system
may be critical in determining what incentive          structures are feasible. For

example, in a hierarchical structure, promotions constitute an important part

of the rewards, a kind of reward which may not always be desirable in a

polyarchy. On the other hand, in polyarchical structures, several parallel

units perform similar functions, and it is possible to devise reward

structures, based on relative performance. These reward. struictures have a

number of desirable properties concerning incentive, risk, and flexibility,29

and these may not be feasible in a hierarchical system. Different

architectures may also differ in the degree of individual accountability which

is   feasible within them. One criticism of modern bureaucracies is, for
example, that collective decision making       makes   it difficult   to reward and
punish     bureaucrats individually.

      Although we have motivated the present analysis in the context of

economic systems, our approach also has implications for the economics of

internal organizations. There are two main differences.           First, certain kinds

                                        —29—
of externalities (such as the selection externality we pointed out earlier)

might   be internalized by a corporation in setting its internal rules. Second,
if    one internal architecture is better than another (based on whatever the
corporate criterion might be), then one might expect a corporation to adopt
the    better architecture.3° Whether a similar response arises in an economic

system is not obvious, since the theories of societal response have not

reached the same level of articulation as those of corporate response.

        Moreover, the problems of the design of economic systems are so complex

that    it might not be      reasonable to expect that one would find the best of all

possible systems. The analogy to computer architecture is then suggestive:

the standard question in this case is not to find the best architecture,

since it is nearly impossible to find it, but to analyze the properties of

alternative structures, with a view to making some possible improvements.

        The architecture of an economic system affects the behavior of the

organization in other ways as well; some of which have bea the subject of

extensive study outside economics. Social psychologists thave emphasized, for

example, that an individual's behavior may differ if he has participated in

the decision. making process compared to when he has been ordered to undertake

a particular task. Though these aspects of human behaviar have not

traditionally been incorporated into economic analysis, if they are important

determinants of economic behavior, e.g., of the effort exerted by individuals

or of the quality of their decision making, then they should be.

        The   above discussion is by no means exhaustive. Yet, it is clear that to

pursue    all, or even a      few, of these facets simultaneously would be nearly

impossible. We have chosen, therefore, to examine a few limited aspects in

the    present   paper, and have attempted to      pursue other important facets in our
subsequent       research.

          Optimal cut—off levels: From (4), the expected profit in the system s is

(A12)           yS =
                       Nx[f   a —
                                    f(1       —    a)].


The constant Nx can be dropped from (A12) since .t does t play any                                role   in

the analysis below. Now, since the two firms in a polyarchy set the same cut-

off point; from (1),                =
                                        k2         —
                                                        k'     for k =   1   and 2. Also, it turns out in

the present case that the two bureaus itt a hierarchy set the same cut—off

level. Thus, from (2), f =
                                            p       .     Further,   from (29),

                 —     x), and p2
    p1 = 1 — L(R                        =     1    — L(R + x).




          Using these expressions, the internal optima in a polyarchy and a

hierarchy are obtained, from (32) and (35), as solutions to the following

equations:



    A13
                  a    2.(R—x)          1+L(R+x)
(
                1—a&(R+x)1+L(R—x)

                  a    £(R — x)         1 —       L(R   + x)
(A14)
                1—a2.(R+x)=1—L(R—x)

Further, if the left hand side exceeds the right hand side                            in the   above

expressions,       then the cut—off level is at the lower corner of (36). If the

opposite is true, then the cut—off level is at the upper corner.

          The observation errors are uniformly distributed with mean zero. That
is:       —
                ,            for   u > 0 > —u; and 9.           = 0,    otherwise. From (36),

therefore, the range of R is: — x + u > R > x —                         u. Let S = x/u.              Clearly,

 6 is less than one from the last inequality, and it is positive. We find

that in a polyarchy

                                                                                      —

        Note the following sufficient conditions concerning the cut—off points.

According to (A15) and (A17), a polyarchy uses the lowest cut—off point if

 a > 2/3, and it uses the highest cut—off point if a < 1/2. A hierarchy, on

the other hand, uses the lowest cut—off point (see (A18)) if a > 1/2, but it

never uses the highest cut—off point. Also, it is obvious from the above

expressions that the cut—off point is raised in both systems (either

continuously, or in steps, depending on the region of a) if a goes down.
    The relative profit level is calculated as tY = Y1' —                     Take the
range: 0 < a < (1 — 5)1(2 —   ). In this range, expressions (A17) and (A19)
hold, and Y =   a(2   —    — ), where       =    (2   a2 —     3c& + 1)1(1 — 2a)2.

Further, in the present range of a,        is an increasing function of a.

Evaluating   at a = (1 — 5)/(2 —      ), we     find that          = 1/ES.    Consequently,

 Y > 0 within this range of a.
                               2
    Next take the range:           > a >     =        .   In thIs range, (A17) and
(A18) hold, and Y = (1      2a)(1 —         Thus,         tY    0, ii   1/2     a. Within

the remaInIng range of a, (A18) holds for a hIerarchy, whereas (115) and

1.   In fact, quite the contrary view has frequently been put forward: the

     Lange—Lerner—Taylor   equivalence theorem, for example, argues that a
     market    economy and a bureaucratic economy using a price system behave in

     an essentially identical manner. See Hayek (1935), Lange and Taylor

     (1964),       MIses (1935), among others, on this issue.



2.   Of course, this is not the only useful typology. We discuss so other

     typologies later.



3.   We assume that the projects are being evaluated sequentially. The

     probability of a project being accepted in a polyarchy remains the same,

     however, even if the projects are being evaluated simultaneously. (An

     example    of simultaneous screening is the evaluation of manuscripts by
     publishers, in contrast to the sequential evaluation of maauscripts by
     journal editors.) What differs in these two cases is the cost of
     evaluation, and the time taken in decision making.


4.   This scai.ar valuation takes into account all of the relevant benefits and
     costs. Also, we are assuming that the inter—project externalities are
     not significant (that is, the value of one project does not     depend
     significantly on    whether some other projects   are undertaken or not), and

     that   there is no restriction   on the number of projects that can be
     undertaken.    Of course, this model is not the only one which can be used

     to   compare alternative economic systems. We have investigated two other
     formulations. In the first, only a fixed number of projects can be
     undertaken, e.g., due to a fixed supply of investment capital, and the

     project   evaluators' attempt to select the best projects. In      the second,

     the   number of evaluators is fixed, and we determine the best way of

     organizing them. See Sah and Stiglitz (1984a).



5.   We are assuming that the screening functions corresponding to the two
     screens   within a system are identical. This allows us   to focus on the
     effect    of architecture; also, as we shall see in Section IV, this turns

     out to be the case when optImal screening rules are deterrnined In a

     variety of circumstances.



6.   There is not much   point   in considering portfolios which contain only

     profitable projects, or only unprofitable projects. It is highly

     unlikely that real world portfolIos have such features. In any event, if

     there are such portfolios, and if project evaluators know    the   relevant

     feature, then the issue of screening disappears altogether.



7.   We are abstracting from the screening costs which may differ in the two

     systems. See footnote 24, however, on this issue.



8.   The last condition merely rules out those uninteresting cases in which

     all projects are either accepted, or rejected.



9.   The only uncertainty in the present model is in project acceptance. See

     Sah and Stiglitz (1984a) for a discussion of project uncertainty and some

     of its implications.
10. We also assume that the end—points of the projects' distribution are

    fixed.




11. That is:    G(x) < (>) 0, with strict inequality holding for at least

    some x, implies an improvement (worsening) in the sense of first—order

    stochastic dominance. And:          fCG(z)dz < (>) 0, with strict inequality

    holding for at least some x, implies an improvement (worsening) in the

    sense of second—order stochastic dominance.



12. The center of these hyperbolas is p1 =             1/2, and p2 = 1/2, as is evident
    in Figure 4. The slopes of their asymptotes are +                            —
                                                                       [ax1/(1       cL)x2]1'Z.
    For a hyperbola like OEA, the length of the transverse axis (which is

    twice the distance DE) is     [{(i —           —               —                    The
                                           ct)x2       czx1}/4(1       a)x2)''2.
    corresponding length for a hyperbola like AFB is

                 —                       The special case in which                 =
     [ja x1 — (1   c1)x2}/4cxx1]1a'2.                                                  x2 follows
    from these expressions.



13. The same approach is useful even when the initial portfolios differ in

    the two systems. Take the general case in which, for i = 1                   and 2, N is
    the number of projects, and x is the (positive number) denoting the

    profit or loss from a project of type i in the system s. Then the center

    of hyperbolas is given by
                                          PP P P
                                 p N. x1/[N. x. + Ni xi.
                                                              1111
                                                                            Other relevant

    details can be readily worked out.



14. The expressiotsin Appendix I can also be used to ascertain the impact on

    profit (in each of the two systems) of changes in the initial portfolio

    (as reflected in the changes in the first three moments, since these are

    the only relevant parameters), and in the screening function. Sah and
    Stiglitz (1983) derive several propositions on the above comparative

    statics. For brevity, we do not discuss these results here.



15. Explicit expressions for It can easily be derived. Qualitatively, many

    of the properties of the mean are      similar to tho8e of expected profit.
    See Sah    and   Stiglitz (1983) for detailed results on the mean and the
    variance   of final portfolios.




16. The assumption that U         U is consistent with there being higher

    pecuniary   rewards to inventors from an      accepted project than from a

    rejected project. It is also consistent with the common observation that
    inventors partly measure their success in non—pecuniary terms (such as
    prestige), so that an accepted project is more desirable than a rejected
    project,   even if    the financial rewards   are independent of project

    acceptance. The assumption that U's are exogenous parameters implies

    that the inventors' effort is not significantly sensitive to the

    parameters of their choice. Also, we assume that the        financial   rewards

    are negligibly small compared to the (net) profit in a system. These

    assumptions can be relaxed by     endogenizirig inventors' efforts and the
    pecuniary    rewards.


17. Such a link is nearly impossible for projects which are rejected, since
     it is difficult to ascertain the profit from a project which has never

    been   undertaken. Even for the projects which are accepted, the actual

    values are known much later in time      than when the decisions are made.
    Moreover, the actual outcomes of accepted projects are often contaminated
    by other factors over which      inventors of projects have little or no
      control. Even then, some     dependence between pecuniary rewards to
      inventors and the actual values of accepted projects. might be desirable

      if monitoring costs are small and if there are no impediments to

      arbitrarily complex contracts. Also, it is possible to link the rewards
      to   the (ex—ante) observed values of projects. A full analysis of such
      incentive    schemes, however, is not attempted in the present paper.



18. If there is a possibility of significant variation ifi    the   level of

      effort, then there would be one such constraint for each level of effort.



19. Depending on parameters of the function (23) and on what the magnitude of

      U is, one can demarcate the space of acceptance probabilities

       (p1 and p2) into regions in which one system has a higher or lower

      profit than another. See Footnote 13.



20. It is assumed, however, that a firm has the information whether a project

      was evaluated earlier by them or not, and the firm uses this information

      to prevent a project from being evaluated more than once.



21.   Which one of    the possible information flows actually exists would depend

      on   the   costs involved. In addition, information is often contaminated in

      the process of transfer. (Not only is it generally difficult for one

      individual to communicate to another all that he knows, but also thete

      are incentive problems associated with whether it is in his interest to

      do so). These factors are important in both polyarchies and

      hierarchies. It is not obvious, therefore, that information     sharing is
      more easily achieved within a bureaucracy than among business firms, as

      is   sometimes believed.
22. Each one of these aspects can be generalized and can be made

    endogenous. The number of observations, for example, would depend on the

    cost and the technology of observation making.



23. A more complete determination of screening rules will, of course, take

    into account itS impact on the incentives of inventors. For brevity, we

    do not present here the details of such an analysis.



24. Obviously, this might not   hold if screening costs are significant,      since

    in   this case:
                       H       12 — CE[p 1 — C, where C s- the cost of
                           E[xp p ]       I



    evaluating a project. We discuss the implications of evaluation costs in

    Sah and Stiglitz (1984a).



25. Some aspects of this externality are parallel to   those   arising in the

     contextof screening and sorting. Also, note that the statements
     concerning screening externalities will hold in nre general models as
    well.


26. If y1      and y2 do not overlap, i.e., if mm y1 > max
                                                             y2,   then the

     decision problem disappears. This is because one can achieve perfect

     selection by selecting any R in the non—overlapping region. We do not

     concern ourselves with situations in which perfect laference is possible.




27. The nature of questions in which we are interested are not new. Ever

     since Plato (1968) stated the problem of defining a typology of

     alternative state systems, and that of comparing them, these questions
    have been the centers of controversial debates in the literature on

    political theory. See Popper (1950) for an appraisal of some of the

    earlier literature concerning state systems. The differences between our

    approach and the approaches taken in the political theory literature are

    briefly sketched in Sah and Stiglitz (1984c).



28. For example, our model for determining screening rules can be extended to

    include the possible effect of individuals' effort on errors, and the

    ffürt—reward trade off whicth is optimal in eanh of the two systems.

    Note, however, that the incentive structure may       not   always affect

    individuals' performance; it may not take much more effort to make a good

    decision than a bad one, but it may      take   much more abilFty.



29. See Nalebuff and Stiglitz (1983).



30. We have examined here only two   polar   architectures. More     generally,
    organizations (as well as economic systems) combine hierarchical and

    polyarchical features. Committees with alternative voting rules and

    different information structures are simple, but important, examples.

    Also note that the problem of finding the "best" architecture (given

    exogenous parameters) is methodologically the san as the one of

    comparing alternative architectures (which we have adopted in this

    paper); though, in certain circumstances, it might be possible to use

    standard optimization techniques by positing parametrically defined

    architectures.
