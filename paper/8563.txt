Were Compulsory Attendance and Child Labor Laws Effective?
An Analysis from 1915 to 1939

                                             ABSTRACT


        Secondary schooling experienced incredible growth in the first 40 years of the 20th Century. Was
legislation on compulsory attendance and child labor responsible for this growth? Using individual data
from the 1960 census, I estimate the effect of several laws on educational attainment for individuals who
were 14 years old between 1915 and 1939. The results show that legally requiring a child to attend school
for one more year, either by increasing the age required to obtain a work permit or by lowering the
entrance age, increased educational attainment by about 5%. The effect was similar for white males and
females, but there was no effect for blacks. Continuation school laws, which required working children
to attend school on a part time basis, were effective for white males only. These laws increased the
education only of those in the lower percentiles of the distribution of education. By increasing the
education of the lower tail, the laws contributed to the decrease in educational inequality, perhaps by as
much as 15%. States with more wealth and a higher percentage of immigrants were more likely to pass
more stringent laws, and states with higher percentage of blacks were less likely to do so. Importantly,
the results suggest that the laws were not endogenous during this period.

         In the first half of the 20th century, secondary schooling in the U.S. experienced

incredible growth: the percentage of young adults with high school degrees increased by a

factor of five from 1910 to 1940 (Goldin and Katz, 1997). Many factors help explain this

unprecedented increase in educational attainment. The demand for educated workers had

increased as a result of the increase of white collars jobs (Goldin and Katz, 1998). The

demand for young labor had fallen as immigrants came to the U.S.. And agricultural wages

had decreased because of technological changes in agriculture (Osterman, 1980). This

resulted in lowered labor demand in the agricultural sector, which employed a significant

number of young workers.1 Some states also wanted to increase education for other reasons,

often correlated with state income and state homogeneity (Goldin and Katz, 1997). During

this period, there was also an enormous amount of legislation geared toward increasing

school attendance and curbing child labor.2 The purpose of this paper is to answer the

question of whether state compulsory attendance and child labor laws contributed to the

increase in educational attainment from 1914 to 1939.

        With one exception (Schmidt, 1996), no one has analyzed the impact of these laws

during this period3—the most important years in the expansion of secondary education, when

compulsory attendance laws are most likely to have affected many people. This paper

contributes to the literature by analyzing a detailed set of laws, examining their effect on the

entire distribution of education, analyzing the factors that led to legislative changes in the

laws during this period, and testing for the endogeneity of the laws.

  In 1910, 72% of children 10-15 years of age engaged in gainful occupations were employed in agriculture
(Bureau of the Census, 1924).

  The number of changes for 1915-1939 will be analyzed in the next section.

  Acemoglu and Angrist (1999) and Lang and Kropp (1986) included this period in their data, but they analyze
the impact of the laws over a much larger span of time.

        The results (using individual census data from 1960) show that laws requiring a child

to attend school for one more year increased educational attainment by about 18 days,4 and

decreased educational inequality. Importantly, the results also suggest that the laws were not

endogenous during this period, in the sense that compulsory attendance and child labor laws

appear to have caused education to increase, not vice-versa.5

        This paper is organized as follows. Section 1 contains a short description of the

history of compulsory attendance and child labor laws, and it reviews previous studies in this

area and describes the strategy pursued in this study. Section 2 describes the data. The

econometric strategy and the results using individual-level results are in Section 3. Section 4

looks at the factors that explain the passage of the laws. Section 5 analyzes the effects on the

distribution of education. The endogeneity tests are presented in Section 6 and Section 7

concludes.

        1. What do we know about compulsory attendance and child labor laws?

        Compulsory attendance laws were first enacted by Massachusetts in 1852.6 By 1918

all states had such laws. From their early inception (and to this day) the laws were complex.7

They varied greatly across states in their specifications and enforcement.

        Compulsory attendance laws specified a minimum and a maximum age between

which attendance was required, and the minimum period of attendance. They also provided

penalties and procedures for non-compliance and listed the conditions under which

individuals could be exempted from attending school. Exemptions were given for a variety of


4
  Although they might not have decreased employment. For example see Moehling (1999), Goldin (1979).
5
  Endogeneity here refers to econometric endogeneity. The argument is that the laws did not result from
increases in education or any other variable that explains both.
6
  Earlier legislation on compulsory education existed in many states (the first compulsory education law was
enacted by Massachusetts in 1642 -- see Katz or Kotin et al.). Compulsory attendance laws forced parent to
send their children to school, not just to provide them with an education.
7
  See Kotin and Aikman (1980).


                                                       2
reasons, including achievement of a certain level of education (e.g. the completion of eighth

grade), mental or physical disability, distance from school, poverty, and lack of schools.

        The most important exemption was that, under certain conditions, children were

allowed to get work permits and leave school at an early age, generally lower than the

dropout age specified by compulsory attendance laws. Child labor laws, which extensively

regulated the employment of minors, were in place in all states by 1914.8

        Child labor laws and compulsory attendance laws were often not “coordinated” in the

sense that each specified different requirements for leaving school. For example, in 1924 in

Pennsylvania the ages for compulsory attendance were 8 to 16, but a child could be excused

after completing the 8th grade. Child labor laws in that state however allowed 14 year-olds

with 6 years of education to get work permits. Continuation school laws, which forced

children at work to continue their education on a part-time basis, were the only laws that

attempted to bridge the gap between labor and attendance laws.

        There is little agreement regarding the effectiveness of these laws. Stigler (1950) first

noted that although enrollments were higher in states with higher minimum compulsory ages

in 1940, the relationship broke down when he classified states by per capita income and

racial composition. Landes and Solomon (1972) analyze the impact of the laws on attendance

from 1880 to 1910. They find that compulsory education laws did not contribute to the

increase in enrollments during this period. They further suggest that states with higher

enrollments were more likely to pass more restrictive laws than other states. Eisenberg

(1988) shows that attendance levels and expenditures per school-aged child were important

factors in explaining the passage of the compulsory attendance laws from 1870 to 1915.


8
 These laws also included several conditions for the granting of the permits, such as educational requirements,
and exceptions under which those not meeting the general requirements could obtain permits.


                                                      3
         But none of these papers focuses on the 1914-1939 period, when the laws are most

likely to have affected many. Also, research in other social sciences has found that during the

preceding period (up to 1915) the laws were ineffective,9 but that the relevant laws were

enforced by the 1920s.10 Stigler (1950) and Edwards (1978) do look at the impact of the laws

on enrollments from 1940 to 1960 and conclude that they were not effective, but there is little

time-variation in the laws after the war, whereas there were many legislative changes from

1914 to 1939 (see next section).

         There are a number of studies that find that the laws were effective. Schmidt (1996)

finds large effects of compulsory education laws on the probability of high school

completion between 1920 and 1934. Lang and Kropp (1986), using data from 1908 to 1970,

show that compulsory education laws affect enrollments, even for groups not targeted by the

laws. Acemoglu and Angrist (2000) find that the effects of the laws on educational

attainment are positive and significant, the effects of child labor laws being larger. The two

latter studies, although covering many decades, do not control for time- and state-specific

variables, so their results could be biased.

         Two studies, Margo and Finegan (1996) and Angrist and Krueger (1991), use a

significantly different methodology to assess the impact of the laws: since the laws specified

the age at which children could leave school, those children born earlier in the year would

obtain fewer years of schooling. Using this natural experiment, Angrist and Krueger (1991)


9
   The United States Commissioner of Education said in 1886 that “in many instances (…) the compulsory
education law, if not actually dead letter, is practically so.” Many state laws did not provide enforcement
mechanisms, and if they did, they often lacked enforcement means. See Katz (1976) and Ensign (1921).
10
   Historians and lawyers believe that compulsory attendance laws were enforced by 1920. Most states instituted
school censuses to count the school population and assess the needs of each district. Truant officers ensured that
children were in school and fined parents in case of non-compliance. Also, expenditures in education increased
(See Tyack, 1974 and Katz, 1976). Note however the laws might not have been enforced in all states: Margo
(1986) reports that in Alabama expenditures on enforcement were low and that “teachers cited non-enforcement
of attendance laws as a major weakness in Alabama schools”.


                                                        4
compare attendance rates by state, cohort and quarter of birth between 1960 and 1980; Margo

and Finegan (1996) make similar analyses using the more detailed information on month of

birth available in the 1900 census. Both studies find that the laws were effective, but there

has been controversy about whether quarter (month) of birth affects education only because

of compulsory schooling laws.11

           This paper provides new evidence on these laws. In particular I make use of the fact

that the laws were complex and were likely to work in combination with one another. I

analyze the factors that resulted in changes in compulsory schooling and child labor

legislation, and include a very rich set of controls for state characteristics that potentially

affected both education and the passage of these laws for this period. More importantly, I

look at the effect of the laws on the entire distribution of education, not only at the effect on

average education or enrollments. If these laws were effective they would affect only those at

the lower end of the distribution of education, thereby lowering education inequality. And I

explore the issue of whether the laws increased educational attainment rather than resulting

from high education levels. These results therefore support the use of compulsory schooling

and child labor laws as instruments for education.12 Note that I concentrate on the effect of

the laws on completed years of education rather than on attendance or enrollments because

education is the more important social outcome.

           2. Data Description and Sources

           The data on compulsory attendance and child labor laws were collected from multiple

sources. Eight years of state-level data (1915, 1918, 1921, 1924, 1928, 1930, 1935 and 1939)

on these laws were collected. Some additional information was available for other years. I


11
     See Bound and Jaeger (1996).
12
     For papers that use these laws as instruments see Acemolgu and Angrist (2000) and Lleras-Muney (2001).


                                                        5
imputed missing observations by using the older values. The information was not

consistently recorded by a single agency. In case of conflicting pieces of data, the later

information was used to correct the data.13 The data contain information on the maximum

age by which a child must enter school (entrance age), the minimum age at which he can

dropout of school (dropout age), the minimum level of education required to be exempted

from school (education to dropout), the minimum age required to obtain a work permit and

leave school (work permit age), the minimum education level required to obtain a work

permit (education to work), and information on whether working children were required to

go to school on a part time basis (continuation school).

           Following Acemoglu and Angrist (2000), I constructed two additional variables. The

first one, childlaw is defined as work permit age minus entrance age. Childlaw is a measure

of the number of years a person would have to attend school if he entered school at the age

that compulsory attendance laws required and left as soon as he reached the age necessary to

obtain a labor permit. For example, in a given state in 1935, an individual must start school at

age 7 and may get a work permit at 15; childlaw would be equal to 8 years in this case. If

there was no law, the value for childlaw is set to 0. The second variable, comlaw is defined as

the number of years a person was forced to go to school if both the entrance and the dropout

age specified by compulsory attendance laws were enforced (i.e. leaving age minus entrance

age).

           National trends for these laws can be assessed by looking at graphs in Table 1. These

trends reflect a relatively large number of overall changes in legislation: 20 states changed

their continuation schools laws at least once, 25 states changed the entrance age at least once,



13
     See Appendix A for more details.


                                                 6
30 changed leaving age at least once, 29 changed work permit age at least once. The same is

true for the other aspects of the laws.

        Overall, the laws tended to require more attendance over time, although it was not

always the case that states passed laws that required more years of education.14 Also the

timing of the increases was different for each law.15 The education required to obtain a labor

permit and the education required to be exempted from school increased overtime, but they

both fell short of matching the implicit number of years of schooling required by compulsory

attendance and/or child labor laws.

        These trends for national averages conceal a great deal of cross-sectional variation in

any given year however. To illustrate this other type of variation I present tabulations of the

laws in three different years (1915, 1928 and 1939) in Table 2.

        These data on compulsory education are matched to census data, from the Integrated

Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS) 1960 census 1% sample.16 The Census provides

information on sex, race, state-of-residence, state-of-birth, age and whether parents are

foreign born. I kept all individuals that were 14 years of age in the 48 states between 1914

and 1939 (i.e. those born between 1901 and 1925 in the U.S.), except for those with missing

values on their education variable (highest grade completed). Occasionally I also use the




14
   For example, Louisiana changed the age at which a child could leave school from 16 in 1915, down to 14 in
1916, back up to 16 in 1921, back down to 14 in 1923, back up again to 15 in 1930, and down again to 14 in
1935!
15
   The average age at which a child must enter school decreased constantly throughout the period. Laws related
to continuation school were mostly implemented in the early 20s and remained mostly unchanged thereafter.
Changes related to the education required for a labor permit were implemented in the late 20s, but the education
necessary to be exempted from school increased also in the late 30s. The age required for a labor permit
changed significantly both in the early 20s and late 30s.
16
   The data comes from the IPUMS 1960 general sample and was downloaded from the web site
http://www.ipums.umn.edu


                                                       7
1950 census, which however contains fewer observations and was therefore not used for the

main results.17

         I matched each individual to the laws that were in place in their state-of-birth18 when

they were 14 years old. I chose this age because that is the lowest common denominator for

minimum leaving ages across states.19 Schmidt (1996) tested this assumption and found the

effect of the laws was largest when looking at age 14.

         Finally, I also match individuals with characteristics of their state-of-birth when they

were 14. The state-level data include state expenditures on education, number of school-

buildings per acre, percent of the population that was living in urban areas, percent of the

white population that was foreign born, percent of the population that was black, percent of

the population employed in manufacturing, average annual wages in manufacturing per

worker, average value of farm property per acre, and number of doctors per capita. Again,

these data were collected from multiple sources and imputed for the years in which there

were missing values.20 The summary statistics for the data are presented in Appendix C.

         3. Econometric Model and Results

         For each individual I estimate the following equation:

                           EDics = β Xics + δ CLcs + µ Zcs + αc + γs + Rrc + εics , (1)

17
   The 1920 and 1940 censuses were not used for several reasons. The 1920 census is not very appealing
because I can only look at a few cohorts (those that were 14 between 1915 and 1920). Also note that the
outcome variable that I use is completed years of education. This variable would be censored for most
individuals in the 1920 census and for many individuals in 1940 as well. Additionally, in 1940 there are very
few sample lines for the analysis.
18
   This matching procedure assumes that individuals went to school in the state where they were born.
Inevitably some individuals were mismatched. However Card and Krueger (1992) showed that mobility during
the first half of the 20th century was low and that the error that this procedure generates is small, around 10%.
Furthermore, if such an error exists, it likely will be uncorrelated with laws on compulsory attendance and with
child labor laws, because these laws were probably not the reason why individuals moved across states. Indeed
if I regress mobility between state-of-birth and state-of-residence in 1960 as a function of education,
compulsory education laws, and all other covariates used in this paper, I find that the laws are not significant.
The F-statistic of joint significance of the laws has a value of 1.17 (p value of 0.3151).
19
   With the exception of North Carolina (1915-1917) and Virginia (1915-1922).



                                                        8
where ED is the number of years of education for individual i, of cohort c, born in state s, in

region r; Xics is a vector of individual characteristics, such as sex and race; CL is a vector of

compulsory education and child labor laws in state s for cohort c; Zcs are state of birth

characteristics at age 14; αc are cohort effects; γs are state effects; Rrc are region- and cohort-

specific effects; and εics is the error term. The errors are clustered at the state-of-birth and

cohort level, and they are corrected for heteroskedasticity using White’s estimator. All the

regressions reported here include state and cohort effects. Thus, the effect of the laws is

identified from variations in the laws within states over time.

            The results are presented in table 3. In regression 1, I include childlaw, and a dummy

variable equal to one if the state had a continuation school law. The coefficient on childlaw is

about 5 percentage points. Thus an increase in childlaw of one raises educational attainment

by about 18 days. The coefficient on continuation school is also about 5%, but it is

insignificant. The F-statistics on the joint significance of these two variables is highly

significant.

            Regression 2 adds a variable that contains the level of education necessary to obtain a

work permit (education to work). This variable turns out to be insignificant. Its addition does

not change the coefficients of the other laws, and it lowers the value of the F-statistic of the

joint significance of the laws. In regression 3, I decompose childlaw into its two components:

the age at which a child had to enter school (entrance age) and the age at which he could get

a work permit and leave school (work permit age). The coefficients of both variables are

significant at the 5% level. I test whether the coefficient on entry age is the same in absolute

value as that of work age. The test does not reject the null at a 5% level.21 This result has an

20
     See Appendix B for more details.
21
     The test for equality is still not rejected if education requirements are not included.


                                                             9
interesting public policy implication. Historically it was difficult to pass legislation to

increase the work permit age.22 The result implies that it is possible to increase educational

attainment by lowering the entrance age, which might be more politically feasible and easier

to implement than increasing the work permit age (although the payoff, in terms of human

capital, might be different).

        Regressions 4 through 6 repeat all the estimations above but use the age at which an

individual was allowed to drop out of school according to the compulsory attendance laws

(dropout age) rather than the age at which he could get a work permit. Also I replace the

education required for a work permit with the education required to dropout from school

according to compulsory attendance laws. None of the variables are significant, except for

the age at which an individual must enter school.

        Table 4 contains a number of specification checks. Column 1 shows the results only

for states where the number of compulsory years of schooling is positive. The coefficient is

still significant (in fact increases) suggesting that it was the changes in existing laws rather

than introduction of new laws that were responsible for the increases in education. Columns

2 and 3 address the issue of measurement error in the laws. Column 2 shows the results

restricting the sample to the 8 cohorts for which no imputation in the laws has been done.

The results from restricting the sample to those that are still living in their state-of-birth in

1960 are in Column 3. In both cases the coefficient of childlaw is statistically identical to that

in Table 2, suggesting these sources of error are not very important. Finally in column 4, I re-

estimate the model using the 1950 census. The results using the 1960 census cross section are

22
  Between 1914 and 1938 the movement to make child labor law federal encountered opposition from the
southern states and from the Supreme Court which found the federal child labor bills of 1916 and 1918
unconstitutional. It was not until 1938 that child labor laws were made federal, in spite of the opposition of
manufacturer, farmers and textile interests. (Kotin and Aikman). One of the main features of the federal law is



                                                      10
derived from synthetic cohort variation, rather than real cohort variation. This can be

problematic if for example individuals die non-randomly. The results however, suggest that

that the synthetic cohort approach is not generating any bias.

         In all cases the estimate of the effect of the laws (5%) is similar to those reported by

other researchers. Acemoglu and Angrist (2000) report an increase of between 1 and 6

percentage points. Angrist and Krueger (1991) find that the impact of the laws was about 4%

in 1960. Eisenberg (1988) finds an effect of about 2%.

         Finally I analyze the effects of the laws by race and gender. There is reason to believe

that these education policies might have affected groups in different ways. For example,

researchers have suggested that the quality of education during the 20th century was very

different for blacks.23 If the laws had a differential impact, they might help explain the

evolution of gender and race gaps. The results are presented in Table 5. As in Margo (1990),

I find that the laws had no impact on blacks.24 It is unclear why this is the case. It is possible

that blacks faced much lower returns to education,25 so that even when confronted with

penalties it was still better to work than to attend school. It is also possible that law

enforcement did not concern itself with this group; i.e. that these laws were never meant to

affect blacks. Most probably however, blacks were very likely to be exempted by law due to

the lack of schools and school resources (also because blacks were more likely to be poor).




that it made the work permit age 16, rather than 14, which was the most common value across states during the
period.
23
   See Card and Krueger (February 1992), Margo (1990).
24
   This result calls into question previous findings in the literature that argue that quarter of birth can predict
education only because of its interaction with compulsory schooling laws. Those papers find that quarter of
birth affected educational attainment for blacks, but the results here suggest the laws did not affect them
(although note that Margo (1990) does find effects of the laws for blacks, but these become insignificant when
state dummies are included).
25
   Welch (1973) presents evidence that the returns to education were indeed very low for blacks in this period.


                                                        11
Indeed in the segregated South, there were relatively few black schools.26 There is also

evidence that the South generally allocated very limited funds to black schools, and that

those resources were diverted from black to white schools.27

        Note that the laws affected white males and females equally except for continuation

school laws, which only affected males (males in states with continuation school laws

obtained about 9% more education). Since males had more working opportunities than

females in this period, they were more likely than females to have obtained a work permit

and to be bound by continuation school laws.

        The results by gender are interesting for another reason. The 1960 sample might

suffer from selection issues, especially for men. For example it might be the case that men

with more education were more (or less) likely to die during World War II. Also, war

veterans greatly benefited from the GI Bill, which provided financial incentives to go back to

school. In order to assess whether the laws are correlated with veteran experience, I estimate

the likelihood of being a veteran (for white males only) using a probit model. Controlling for

education and all the other state and cohort covariates used in this paper, I find that

compulsory schooling laws do not predict veteran status.28 Results using only whites in the

1950 census—the Korean War having just begun—are identical(see column 4 of table 4).

Finally note that the fact that the coefficients are similar and significant for men and women

separately confirms that the war and the post-war events are not a significant source of

selection. This is consistent with Bound et al. (1999), who also found that the effects of the

GI Bill on educational attainment were small.

        4. Why were the laws changed during this period?

        An important question that arises in interpreting these results is: why did the laws

change? There are potentially many explanations. One important explanation is that the laws

resulted from high levels of education (rather than causing them). Higher enrollment levels

facilitate the passage of the laws, since they would encounter less opposition. The laws

would affect fewer individuals and expenditures would not have to rise by much as a

consequence. We expect therefore that those economic factors that affected education (such

as immigration levels, see the introduction) also made the passage of the laws more likely.

        Political forces also might affect the passage of the laws. Arguments in the case of

Pierce v. the Society of Sisters (1925)29 and in Meyer v. Nebraska (1923)30 suggest that the

politics of compulsory education in the early 20th century are very similar to those in the 19th

century.31 Those who supported legislation believed that universal education was necessary

to promote democracy and to guarantee a common American culture for all, including

different immigrant groups, races, and religions. In addition education would lower crime,

racism, and inequality, and was necessary for economic growth. These arguments suggest a

few reasons why individuals at the lower end of the distribution of education did not choose

to obtain higher levels of education: individuals did not anticipate the increases in the returns

to education, nor did they perceive the social returns to education, whereas legislators did.32




29
   In this case, the Supreme Court found Oregon’s law that all children ages 8 to 16 attend public schools
unconstitutional.
30
   In this case, the Supreme Court declared Nebraska’s 1919 law that all instruction be in English
unconstitutional.
31
   See Eisenberg (1988) and Butts and Cremin (1953) for a thorough description of the arguments in the 19th
century. I found no articles that discuss these issues for compulsory schooling laws for 1914-1939.
32
   It is also possible that there were liquidity constraints. See Card (1995).


                                                      13
In the case of child labor legislation, the main opposition came from the southern states,

textile industries, manufacturer’s associations, and farmer’s organizations.33

         I predict the changes in the laws as a function of average education level at the state

and cohort level, state characteristics, region dummies, state effects, cohort effects and

region*cohot effects. As expected, I find (Table 6) that higher wealth (measured by the value

of farm per acre) and higher percentages of the immigrant population resulted in more

stringent schooling requirements, whereas higher percentage of blacks resulted in lower

requirements. This last variable is probably a proxy for southern agricultural states. Higher

urbanization affected the entrance age and continuation school passage, but not work permit

ages. Unlike Eisenberg, I find that higher per capita expenditures on education did not result

in more stringent laws (they are significant only for entrance age, but then they have the

wrong sign). Also note that neither manufacturing wages nor the percentage employed in

manufacturing had an impact on the laws, which is consistent with the literature which

suggests that it was agriculture rather than manufacturing that opposed the passage of the

laws.

         Like Eisenberg, I find that education levels34 in these regressions affected work

permit ages (at the 10% level) and the constructed variable childcom, suggesting indeed there

is some potential endogeneity in the previous section. All of the factors that could potentially

explain the passage of the laws were included when looking at the impact of the laws on

attainment. Their inclusion did not affect the coefficient on the laws much,35 suggesting that


33
   These groups successfully delayed the passage of federal labor legislation by about 20 years. See Lescohier
and Brandeis (1966) pp. 440-450, Kotin and Aikman (1980) pp. 57-64.
34
   Note that education here refers to the average education level eventually obtained by a given cohort as
measured in 1960. Alternatively one can use enrollment levels at the time, but that data was not collected for
this project. Is is unclear that enrollments would be a better control, since education captures both enrollments
and in a sense, projected enrollments, which are just as important.

(on the basis of observables) the endogeneity might not be an important issue. The next two

sections however will address this issue more in depth, first by looking at the effect of the

laws on the entire distribution and then by testing for endogeneity more directly by looking at

the timing of the laws.

5. Effect of the laws on the distribution of education

           There are a few mechanisms through which compulsory schooling may have affected

the distribution of education. The standard human capital model predicts that the laws would

affect only those below the required level of education; individuals obtaining more than the

required level of schooling would not be affected at all. If binding, the laws should have

increased average education and decreased educational inequality by increasing the

attainment of the lower percentiles of education (Chiswick, 1969).

           Additionally, Lang and Kropp (1986) suggested that if individuals at lower levels of

education stayed in school because of the laws, then even those not targeted by the laws

might have increased their schooling in an effort to differentiate themselves from the bottom

(signaling theory of education). So the laws would shift the distribution of education to the

right. Note that the shift is most likely smaller at higher levels of education,36 so this

hypothesis also implies a lower level of inequality.

           Finally, if there are option value effects, those that are forced to obtain the required

level of schooling might continue their education beyond what the law prescribes, because

they now have the option to do so (for example, those that are forced to finish secondary

school can now decide to go on to get a high school degree). The distribution of education

would therefore be compressed even more than the human capital theory would predict.



36
     Lang and Kropp argue that this will be the case if education costs increase at higher levels of education.


                                                           15
        Note that the effects on the distribution of education are also suggestive about

whether the laws are endogenous or not. A finding that the laws affected all the percentiles of

the distribution of education would certainly suggest that the laws are endogenous (e.g. if the

entire distribution of education is shifting up only because of increased returns to education,

laws forcing children to stay in school are easily passed, and they might appear to affect all

percentiles). On the other hand, a finding that the laws only affect the lower percentiles of the

distribution is consistent with a model where the laws were enforced and had effects for

some children. And less likely to be the result of endogeneity.

        As preliminary evidence I plot the evolution of the percentiles of the distribution

throughout this period. As can be observed in graph A, the highest increases in education

were at the lower percentiles of education. I look now at the effect of the laws on the

different percentiles of the distribution of education by estimating regressions where the

dependent variable is a given percentile of the distribution for a given state and cohort. I use

OLS for a panel of state- and cohort- specific observations (1200 observations derived from

the 1960 census, using only whites). As can be seen in Panel A of Table 7 the effect of

childlaw is positive and significant for the 10th, 20th, 30th, 40th and 50th percentiles, but not for

the higher percentiles (except for the 90th percentile). The effect is strongest for the 40th

percentile and it declines for higher percentiles. The 10th to 40th percentiles vary from 5.5 to

11 years of education (again refer to Graph A). The implicit years of education in the laws

(as coded in childlaw) were most commonly 6, 7, 8 and 9 (see tabulations in Table 2), so this

result is consistent with the idea that compulsory education and child labor laws were

effective. The fact that the laws affected the 50th percentile can be understood as evidence for

the signaling theory of education, as well as for the “option value” theory.




                                                 16
        Alternatively I ran the regressions using the percentage of individuals with a given

level of education or less in a given state and cohort. The results (Table 7, Panel B) show that

the laws lowered the percentage of individuals obtaining 10 or less years of schooling (the

largest effect is for 8 and 9 years of schooling). But the effect remains stable or falls if I

include those with 11 years of education or more. Results in both Panels of Table 7 suggest

the laws were effective at and around the age specified by the laws, consistent with the

effects predicted by the human capital theory and both the signaling and option value theory.

But they are inconsistent with the endogeneity theory.

        The results above also suggest that compulsory schooling laws lowered inequality in

education since they increased the education level only of those at the bottom of the

distribution. To evaluate this hypothesis I decompose the variance of education into the

effects of shifts in composition (i.e. the number of individuals living under a given law), and

the shifts in education within and between law categories (see Juhn, Murphy and Pierce,

1993.) The total decline in the variance of education from 1915 to 1939 was 2.52. Panel A of

Table 8 shows that in fact a very large part of this decline in the variance can be explained by

changes in the number of individuals living under given laws (i.e. composition effects). But

note that since these changes in composition are due to many factors, these calculations are

merely suggestive.

        So, I now estimate the effect of the laws on inequality using the 75-25 range37 and the

variance of education as measures of inequality using regression analysis, and controlling for

all the other state-level characteristics. The results (Panel B Table 8) show that the effect of

childlaw on the 75-25 range is negative and significant. The effect on the variance is negative




                                                 17
but not statistically significant. During this period, the interquartile range (75-25 range) fell

by approximately 1.5 years (from 4.3 in 1915 to 2.83 in 1939), the variance of education fell

by 2.5 and childcom increased by a little more than 2 years. The regression coefficients imply

that about 14% of the decline in the interquartile range and 6% of the decline in the variance

can be explained by the changes in compulsory schooling and child labor laws. The effect is

larger for the interquartile range because it does not capture the shifts in the 90th percentile.

         Note that Goldin and Margo (1992) find that the variance in school quality also

declined during the first half of the 20th century. These two effects (decreasing variance of

school attainment and of school quality) might indeed be related: by passing compulsory

schooling laws states forced themselves to provide public schools, and thus to raise the level

of educational expenditures (to both enforce the laws and guarantee school availability).

6.Were the laws endogenous?

         Although most researchers find that the laws positively affected education levels, they

are skeptical to conclude that the effect is causal. As has been pointed out in section 4 and 5,

it is possible that higher enrollments permitted higher minimum ages to be instituted by the

legislature—causality could thus run from education to the laws and not vice-versa.

         States where attainment was high were also probably states where the laws were

stringent: individuals in those states might have stronger preferences for education. Indeed,

Goldin and Katz (1997) show that the Far West, the Great Plains, and parts of New England

led in secondary education from 1910 to 1940, while the South lagged. Those regions also

had more stringent laws (Panel A Table 9). Therefore a first attempt to address this issue

consists in estimating separate regressions by region (Panel B Table 9). The effect of

37
  This interquartile measure seems the most appropriate for a couple of reasons. First, the results above suggest
that the largest effects were not at the absolute bottom of the distribution (i.e. the 10th percentile). Also note that



                                                          18
childlaw on education is still significant, although it was much larger in the North than

anywhere else, and it is insignificant in the West. Interestingly, continuation school laws

were effective in the northern and southern states but not in the rest of the country. The

results suggest that although there were indeed large differences within the US, the laws were

effective within regions as well. However it is still possible that even within regions there

were important differences between states.

         Landes and Solomon—the only researchers that address directly this endogeneity

issue, propose an alternative test: if the laws are truly exogenous, then laws passed in a given

year should not explain the level of enrollments ten years earlier. They estimate 1870

enrollment levels using the 1880 laws as explanatory variables, and they find that the 1880

laws are significant and therefore endogenous.

         To perform this test I follow Landes and Solomon and estimate the effect of future

laws on current attainment by matching individuals both to laws that were in place when they

were 14 and to laws that were in place when they were too old to have been affected by them.

I therefore estimate two equations: one that includes the current law and a second that

includes the future law. Unlike Landes and Solomon, I match individuals to laws not only 10

years into the future but to every period between 338 and 12 years ahead. I examine the effect

on the educational attainment of people who were 14 in 1925 of laws passed in 1925, and of

laws passed in 1928, 1929, etc. when they were 15, 16, 17...24 and laws governing

attendance at 14 should no longer have affected their educational attainment (Landes and

Solomon use a 10 year lead because their estimates compare cohorts across decennial



the effect of the laws on the 90th percentile is positive and significant: it is unclear why this is the case.
38
  No states had set work permit ages at age 17. Therefore matching individuals to the laws that were in place at
that age should have no effect. The same is not true for ages 15 and 16, since some states did have work permit
for those ages (see Table 2).


                                                       19
censuses). So, in Table 10, the row labeled “3 years”, childlaw refers to the current laws, and

future childlaw refers to the laws passed three years later. I estimate these regressions at the

state and cohort level, and restrict the sample to those states for which there were changes

during the time interval. Regardless of the time span chosen (except for the 10-year span) the

current laws are always significant whereas the future laws are not. When L&S perform this

test, they find that laws passed 10 years after an individual's effective age are correlated with

attainment. When I perform this test, I find that laws passed 3-9, 11, or 12 years later are not

correlated with attainment. Interestingly, these results also suggest that the laws were

relatively more effective in the earlier part of the period.39

         Curiously, I do find an effect when I use a ten-year lead. Age misreporting could

explain this result. Oppenheim and Cope (1987) show that in the 1900 census when age and

birth date do not coincide (and the difference between them is more than one year), 75% of

the time the reported age and the age implied by the date of birth will differ by 10, 20, 30 or

40 years. Their results further suggest these discrepancies occur because census interviewers

recorded the wrong leading digit of age or decade of birth. Measurement error in age might

therefore explain Landes and Solomon’s results since this problem was more severe in the

last century.

5. Conclusions

         This paper has shown that there were two types of laws that contributed to the

increase in educational attainment from 1915 to 1939: the laws which specified the age at

which a child had to enter school, and the laws which specified the age at which a child could

obtain a work permit. Increasing the number of years a child had to attend school was shown


39
  The coefficient on the current law is increasing as the sample is restricted. As the lead increases, the
observations kept in the sample correspond to older cohorts.

to increase years of education by about 5%. These laws affected white men and women

equally but had no effect on blacks. They were more effective in the southern and northern

states than in the rest of the country. Continuation school laws, which forced working

children to attend school on a part-time basis, affected only white males and those born in the

northern and southern states of the US. The laws had an impact not only on average

educational attainment but also on the distribution of education as a whole. They

substantially contributed to the decrease of educational inequality by increasing the education

level of the lower percentiles of the distribution of education. Not only were these laws

effective, this paper has also shown that these laws were not endogenous during the 1915-

1939 period.

 the composition effect. The first and second sums constitute the total within variation change. The third sum captures changes in
 education. The third term captures changes in Pit so again this is a composition effect. The third and fourth sums constitute the total
 between variation.

Further Notes: Information about following variables was not available in the cited publications:
-1918: continuation school laws.
-1929: Entrance age
-1939: Education to dropout, Education to work and Continuation school

Years in between were imputed using the previous laws. However, for certain years, I used additional
information to correct certain variables:
1916: corrected Entrance age, Leaving age, Education to dropout and Work permit age using U.S
Department of Labor, Children’s Bureau. Summary of Child-Welfare Laws passed in 1916. Bureau
Publication No. 21. US GPO 1917.
1923: corrected Entrance age, Leaving age and Education to dropout, using US Office of Education,
Bulletin No.2, US GPO 1925
1925: corrected Leaving age and Continuation school using U.S Department of Labor, Children’s Bureau.
Important Legislative Changes Made in 1925 in Child Labor Standards and In Compulsory School
Attendance Standards Affecting the Employment of Minors.
1926 and 1927: corrected Education to work using U.S Department of Labor, Children’s Bureau. Child
Labor and Compulsory School Attendance Measures passed by the state Legislatures meeting in 1926 and
1927.
1936: corrected Work permit age using U.S Department of Labor, Children’s Bureau. Child Labor. US
GPO 1936
1937: corrected Work permit age, Entrance age, Leaving age and Education to dropout using U.S
Department of Labor, Children’s Bureau. Child Welfare Legislation, 1937, Bureau Publication No. 236, US
GPO 1938
1939: corrected Work permit age using: Merrit, Ella A., “Trend of Child Labor, 1937 to 1939”, Monthly
Labor Review. January 1940

                 Definitions of various compulsory education and child labor variables

Entrance age: maximum at which a child must enter school
Leaving age: minimum age at which a child can leave school
Education to dropout: years of schooling needed to be exempted from school according to compulsory
attendance laws
Work permit age: Minimum Age at which can obtain a work permit
Education to work: years of schooling needed to obtain a work permit
Continuation school = 1 if state required children that were exempted from school or that had a work
permit to attend continuation, evening or part time school. Compulsory evening school was included,
unless it was required only of illiterate individuals.
Continuation school age: Age until which child had to attend continuation school
Comlaw = leaving age-entrance age: implied years of compulsory schooling according to compulsory
attendance laws.
Childlaw = work permit age-entrance age: implied years of compulsory schooling according to child labor
laws

-Data on education expenditures and number of schools buildings per state comes from several
years of the Biennial Survey of Education. The data was exits for even years, starting in 1916.
Fortunately earlier data for 1914 also exits and was published in the Statistical Abstract of the
United States. Data for years in between was imputed using a linear interpolation.
-Data about the percentage of population employed in manufacturing and wages in the
manufacturing sector comes from the Census of Manufactures. It was collected every two year
and is available for all odd years. Data for years in between was imputed using linear
interpolation.
-Data on the percentage of the population that lived in urban areas, percentage of black
population and percentage white foreign born come from the census and it is only available every
ten years. Data for years in between was imputed using a linear interpolation by state.
-Data on average value of farm property per farm and per acre of farm land was reported in the
Statistical Abstract of the United States for 1910, 1920, 1925, 1930 and 1940. Data for years in
between was generated using a linear interpolation by state.
-Data about states’ population comes from the Statistical Abstract of the United States. Accurate
measures are only available every ten years from the Census, but estimates for every year where
published as well. These estimates are used to calculate all the per capita measures, when per
capita measures where not already available.
-Data on infant mortality rates comes form the National Vital Statistics. The state time series
going form 1915 to 1950 were published in1950. Data for early years was not available for all
states. Missing values were imputed using a linear trend by state.
-Data on number of hospitals and physicians comes from several years of the American Medical
Directory published every year since 1906 by the American Medical Association. Data is
available at the state level for the following years: 1906, 1909, 1912, 1914, 1916, 1918, 1921,
1923, 1925, 1927, 1929, 1931, 1934, 1936, 1938, 1940 (and beyond). Missing values were
imputed using linear interpolation.
-All monetary values (education expenditures, manufacturing wages, net income and farm value)
were converted into real dollars using the Consumer Price Index series provided by the Bureau of
Labor Statistics online at ftp://ftp.bls.gov/pub/special.requests/cpi/cpiai.txt. 1982-84 is the base
period.
-Measurement units: Population: in thousands; number employed in manufacturing: actual
number; wages in manufacturing: in thousands; net income: in thousands; number of school
buildings: actual number; expenditures in education: in thousands; number of farms: actual
number; value of farm property: in thousands; all land in farms: in thousands.
