             Institutional Aspects of High Unemployment
                 in the Federal Republic of Germany



                              ABSTRACT

      The sustained rise in German unemployment since 1973 poses a

problem of critical importance for the world economy. Fewer than

 two decades ago, Germany boasted an average unemployment rate of

under 1% and imported labor to relieve chronic labor shortages. By

the mid-l980s, unemployment had risen to over 8 percent of the

labor force. This paper investigates some of the reasons for the

secular rise in unemployment. We find that while deficient

aggregate demand can probably explain some of the current
joblessness, the secular rise in unemployment has consisted

primarily of an increase in the equilibrium rate of unemployment.

We also find little evidence that this increase is due to changes

in frictional unemployment. Rather, after reviewing institutional

details of the labor market in Germany, we identify various

impediments to the kinds of structural adjustments that have

operated to maintain a fairly constant equilibrium rate of
unemployment in the United States.

     The sustained rise in German unemployment since 1973 poses a

problem of critical importance for the world economy. Fewer than

two decades ago, this country boasted an average unemployment rate

of under 1% and imported labor to relieve chronic labor shortages.

By the mid-1980s, unemployment had risen to between 8 and 9

percent of the labor force- - levels not observed since the early

years of the Marshall Plan. These developments are even more

striking when compared with the United States, where average

unemployment rates have been higher but have also recovered from

the last two recessions (see Table 1). Furthermore, much of the

secular increase in West German unemployment took place during

periods of relatively high economic growth.

     This paper investigates some of the reasons for the secular

rise in West German unemployment. We find that while deficient

aggregate demand can certainly explain some of the current

joblessness in the country, the secular rise in unemployment has

consisted primarily of an increase in the equilibrium rate of

unemployment. We find little evidence that this increase is due to

changes in so-called "frictional" unemployment, such as increased

job search due to lower costs of search or an increase in the

variance of economic shocks impinging on the economy. Rather, we

find more convincing evidence of institutional forces impeding

labor market adjustments, most importantly, the inability of labor

markets to adjust and reallocate labor through wage changes. For

example, it is widely recognized that large adverse shocks to

manufacturing labor demand in the 1970s occurred in most of the

 industrial economies. In the United States, these shocks were

mediated in part by falling manufacturing sector wages (especially

in nonunion firms) and by an expansion of employment in the

lower-wage service (or tertiary) sectors. After reviewing the

institutional detail of labor markets in the Federal Republic of

Germany, we find strong evidence of impediments to the kinds of

structural adjustments that have taken place in the US over the

past fifteen years.

     We begin our analysis in Section 3 by considering the

response of a two sector economy that sustains an adverse shock to

its manufacturing sector, in the presence of a lower-wage service

sector. Following the literature, we presume that wages in the

manufacturing sector are set by unions, introducing some degree of

real wage ridigity. We assume alternatively that the low wage

service sector is characterized by market clearing, or by rigid

wages as in manufacturing. The rigid wages in the service sector

may be due to the presence of unions, to legal restrictions on

wage reductions, or to an effective floor on wages determinined by

the level of unemployment benefits.

     We then    present evidence that the US is more like the

economy characterized by labor market clearing in services,

whereas the Federal Republic of Germany resembles more nearly the

case of rigid wages. This is most obviously reflected in the

absolute and relative growth of the service-producing sectors in

the two countries. An increase in the extent of wage dispersion

across the sectors, which is predicted for the first economy, only


                                  2
obtains in the US. Additionally, labor productivity in the service

sectors has grown at considerably lower rates in the US, as would

be expected with rigid wages in services in Germany and flexible

wages in services in the US. The differential productivity

performance is mirrored (as predicted by the model) by the
differing paths of capital-labor ratios in the service sectors of

the two economies.

     While we cannot make an exact apportionment of the reasons

for non market-clearing in West German service sectors, we suspect

that two primary factors block a US-style expansion of the

tertiary industries in West Germany. First, the remarkable growth

of unionism in the service branches in Germany has resulted in

significantly better wage outcomes than in the corresponding US

sectors. Furthermore, institutions peculiar to West Germany

increase the impact of collective bargaining agreements on costs:

union agreements are implicitly or explicitly extended to cover

nonunion workers, and increasingly in those sectors that would be

expected to absorb redundant labor released by the production

sectors. Second, there is evidence that the unemployment insurance

system may preclude wage reduction in the West German service

sector, since compensation in these sectors would often be

dominated by unemployment benefits as has been argued by Minford

(1985).



1. fl Rise j the NAIRU j       Federal Republic .f Germany

     The recent experience in Western Europe and West Germany in

particular pose a serious challenge to the conventional "natural


                                  3
rate of unemployment" (or "non-accelerating inflation rate of

unemployment," the NAIRU) paradigm first proposed by Milton
Friedman (1968), which is widely considered an important point of

agreement among macroeconomists. Since       the natural rate of

unemployment is normally regarded as relatively stable        and

determined by factors that evolve only slowly over time, advocates

of the typical natural rate view must view the rise in European

unemployment as the outcome of "depression" conditions induced

by sharp declines in aggregate demand,    in conjunction with the

presence of nominal rigidities or expectational error. Several

arguments, however, suggest that this view is incorrect; rather,

the secular rise in unemployment rates in the Federal Republic of

Germany has largely represented movements in the natural rate

itself.

     This conclusion is generally supported by analysts who have

attempted to estimate the West German NAIRU directly. Layard

          (1984) report an increase of the natural rate in Germany
from 1.3%     in the late l960s to 6.2% over 1981-1983; Coe and

Gagliardi (1985) find an increase from 0.9 to 8.0%; Franz (1985)

estimates a NAIRIJ as high as 8.9% if obsolescence effects of the

capital stock are included. In contrast, estimates of the

equilibrium unemployment rate in the US has remained fairly stable

over the past decade, increasing by no more than 2% between the

late l960s and the early 1980s (Coe and Gagliardi 1985).

     Using two different techniques, we estimated the path of the

NAIRU in the US and West Germany over the past twenty-five years.

The first simply uses estimates of the barebones "accelerationist


                                    4
equation," which relates the rate of acceleration of the price

level to the deviation of current unemployment from the NAIRU,

with the latter proxied by a constant plus a fourth order

polynomial in time. Specifically, we use OLS to estimate


                —
                         ir1+ (l-)w2           + U+                    (1)

unemployment rate, t is time, and              is the rate of change in the

consumer price indices. If inflationary expectations are formed

via a        weighted average of past inflation rates with weights

summing to          unity,   this   equation may be derived from         an

expectations-augmented Phillips curve relation. An estimate of the

where hats denote estimates.

      As a more conservative alternative, we used a frequency

domain procedure that assumes that deviations of actual from

equilibrium unemployment only occur in the context of the business

cycle. Movements of unemployment at low frequencies represent

equilibrium movements, and at high frequencies, movements in the

cyclical unemployment rate. We first difference the standardized

unemployment rate series, decompose the data into its frequency

components via Fourier transform, and then mask all components at

periodicities of eight years or lower.                 An inverse Fourier

transform was then applied to the data, which are then summed

from some base year, here 1960. The results of both procedures

using OECD standardized unemployment rates are displayed in Table

2.1

      The results obtained by the two procedures are similar, and

support the results of other studies cited above. Whereas

unemployment in the United States has returned frequently to the

neighborhood of 6-7%, there         is strong evidence that the

equilibrium rate in the Federal Republic of Germany continues

to rise. Our NAIRU estimates for Germany, which range from 5.7 to

8.6%. in 1985, also suggest the existence of some "Keynesian"

unemployment that might be vitiated by a demand expansion (in that

the actual unemployment rate exceeds the NAIRU); nonetheless, in

both cases this represents a deviation around    secularly rising

equilibrium rate. Unless the paradigm of an "equilibrium rate"

is completely abandoned, deficient aggregate demand explanations

of European unemployment proposed by Tobin (1984) are        only

capable of explaining a fraction of the fifteen year secular

rise in West German unemployment.

      Our assessment of the NAIRU is consistent with evidence on

capacity utilization rates, total capacity, and the evolution of

1These procedures are of course not without important econometric
and conceptual problems. Sargent (1971) has correctly criticized
constraining the sum of weights on lagged inflation rates to unity
as a potentially suboptimal forecast. The first procedure ignores
simultaneous equations bias that arises if the inflation rate and
the unemployment rate are jointly determined. It is           also
inconsistent with strong forms of rational expectations; clearly,
if policies inducing a constantly increasing inflation rate over
time were fully anticipated by agents,     the economy would not
systematically deviate from the NAIRU. The second procedure may
underestimate the NAIRU if some of its movements occur over the
business cycle itself, i.e., if "hysteresis" considerations are
operative.

the capital stock. As Modigliani (1986)              have noted, the EC

countries in general have sustained a severe reduction of

productive capacity, and Burda (1987) has documented a large

cumulative reduction in the size of manufacturing capital stocks

relative to trend in these countries. As is evident from Table 3,

the aggregate capacity utilization            rate     in West German
manufacturing in 1986 is equal to its 1979 value, whereas US plant

utilization remains significantly below its previous peak. This

suggests that despite high unemployment rates in Germany,         firms

are operating at full capacity. Moreover, if we estimate equation

(1) and using a capacity utilization rate rather than the

unemployment rate, we find a stable relationship (insignificahce

of time shift variables) between German inflation and German

capacity utilization, instead of the unstable relationship bwtween

inflation and unemployment. The results presented in Table 4 imply

that unemployment rates in Germany, in contrast to capacity

utilization rates, contain relatively little information about the

overall state of unused resources in the economy. They also

suggest that firms have adjusted their long-run capacity to levels

consistent with a high equilibrium level of unemployment.

      One    explanation for   the       marked rise    in equilibrium

unemployment in the Federal Republic of Germany is predicated on

the    view that most unemployment is frictional; the rise in

unemployment is posited to involve prolonged job search or greater

job mismatch. In this section we attempt to examine the
plausibility of       theories of frictional unemployment                    in

accounting for the path of official unemployment, vacancies and

employment growth in West Germany, relying on comparisons of West

German and US labor market experiences.

     The preponderance      of evidence on the provision of
unemployment benefits (Layard,               1984,
Burtless    1986)   indicates    little significant             increase     in

replacement ratios over the past two decades. Thus the simple

hypothesis that a reduction in search costs is responsible for

increased joblessness seems unlikely. A more plausible model of

frictional unemployment first proposed by Lucas and Prescott

(1974) emphasizes the role of sectoral shifts in the determination

of the NAIRU for given preferences of agents,               and has been

recently investigated by Lilien (1982) using               US      data.    He

considers an economy consisting of several                 sectors,        each

buffeted by idiosyncratic disturbances.              Since agents require
time to move, retrain, and learn about new opportunities, the

natural rate is a function of the variance of sectoral shocks,

and thus sectoral hiring rates.     Not only is the "churning" view

of unemployment theoretically appealing, but seems at first

glance a plausible characterization of the facts. Employment in

Germany's   industrial    sectors         (construction,        energy,    and

manufacturing) has declined significantly since the first OPEC

shock. Moreover, these shocks have fallen asymmetrically on the

country, affecting the coastal and Ruhr regions more adversely

than Bavaria and Baden-Wurttemberg.


                                      8
        The wealth of macroeconomic evidence, however, provides

little support for job mismatch explanations of the rise in the

West German NAIRU. At the most cursory level, the shift in the

so-called "Beveridge curve" that several analysts have identified

in the US is not evident in Germany.2 To recall, the Beveridge

curve      is   the hypothesized       inverse relationship       between

vacancies and unemployment for a given             set of     structural,

taste,      and institutional parameters.        This association might

be due to shifts in aggregate demand with nominal rigidities

or to labor cost conditions impinging on the demand for labor,

shifts of which presumably would move the number of unemployed

individuals and available jobs in opposite directions. On the

other hand,     shifts in tastes for leisure versus consumption,

institutionally     or   technologically       determined    search   and

opportunity costs,       unemployment insurance, as well as the

sectoral composition of the economy,            will shift the     entire

Beveridge curve inward or outward. Figure 1 graphs vacancy and

unemployment rates in West Germany and the US over the period

1960-1984. The U-V locus in the Federal Republic appears far more

stable than its US counterpart! While the Beveridge curve itself

has      only   modest   theoretical       foundations      (see Jackman,

Layard, and Pissarides 1984), movements in the curve in Germany

provide no support for the hypothesis that at given unemployment

rates the number of jobs unfilled has risen substantially.

      If, as suggested by Lilien (1982), the source of increased

 frictional unemployment is an increase in variability of sectoral

 economic activity, it may be poorly detected in aggregate data

 (and Figure 1). A necessary            condition        for the "increased

churning" hypothesis to hold, however,              is an increase in the

sectoral variability of hiring rates.                  For each year in the

period 1961-1984, we computed            the standard        deviation     of

sectoral employment growth rates for the following group of seven

private       one-digit      industry        groups:      energy/gas/mining,

manufacturing, construction, wholesale and retail trade, transport

and       communication, finance, and other private services.3 The

results are plotted in Figure 2. While rising volatility of

sectoral employment in the US seems to support Lilien's

hypothesis,       this volatility has been declining              in     West

Germany,       suggesting if anything a           lack      of sufficiently

offsetting growth in expanding sectors. We shall return to this

important point below.

      This conclusion is supported by evidence on regional and

occupational mismatch. If the Lilien hypothesis were true, the

recent decade should have been characterized by an increase in

the imbalance across regions and occupations as agents wait,

retrain,      or search. Applying a measure suggested by Jackman,

Layard and Pissarides        (1984) to unemployment and vacancy data

from the Federal Employment Office (Bundesanstalt für Arbeit), we

examined the change over time in "mismatch." The relevant
statistic is

3As Lilien (1982)         notes,   employment growth rates are an
appropriate proxy for hiring rates if layoff and quit rates are
stable.

where u and v are the share of total unemployment and vacancies

of the ith state, occupation, or industry. The mismatch measure

may be interpreted    as the percentage of workers who must

move, change occupations, or change industry to equalize the ratio

of unemployment to vacancies in groupings. Time profiles of

occupational (39 categories), regional (10 LAnder), and industrial

(10 sectors) mismatch are displayed in Table 5. Our results on

occupational mismatch are similar to those of Layard, et.al.

(1984) for the UK; we find a significant decline (roughly 50%) in

occupational mismatch over the period 1979-1984.     We do find a

significant increase in regional mismatch over the past decade.

This supports generally anecdotal evidence on regional immobility

attributed to     unemployment      insurance, restrictive mortgage

contracts, and strong aversion to changing residence. For a

country not much larger than the state of Oregon, this may be

surprising; nonetheless, even if 20% of all unemployed Germans did

move to high-vacancy Lander,     they would still face an official

vacancy-unemployment ratio of nearly 1:25!

     Clearly, these numbers should be considered with some

caution. First, unemployment data from West Germany are reported

unemployment only and neglect unemployed individuals not
registered at the local employment offices. Second, vacancy data

cannot capture all offers made, and many offers are made directly

to job seekers without assistance of the state-provided matching

services. Nonetheless, if the link between reported vacancies and

actual offers is stable, we can learn something about the

preferences of and opportunities available to job searchers.

     If    one   dismisses changes in worker preferences as the

primary cause of the rise in the natural rate of unemployment in

West Germany, the culprit must be an insufficient number of jobs

to employ the labor force normally willing to work at the current

constellation of factor prices. This suggests a malfunctioning of

the labor market, i.e., wages are not adjusting sufficiently to

equilibrate demand and supply of labor and are above their market

clearing    levels for some or all      sectors   in the Federal

Republic of Germany.




3. Th Non-Adjustment    Wages: Theory

     It is widely recognized that the l970s were characterized by

a series of adverse shocks to the demand for labor in all

advanced industrialized countries: two oil price increases and

a still largely unexplained productivity slowdown. In Europe, this

was compounded by a well-documented increase in labor taxes. The

"wage-gap" literature has uncovered important linkages between

the post-shock performance of the Western industrial economies

and the response of their labor market institutions     (and real

wages) to these developments. Moreover,      the literature has

rediscovered the real wage-employment relationship in European

economies and a central role     for aggregate supply in the




                                  12
evolution of European output and employment in the 1970s.4

     What is the response of an economy to a decline in its terms

of trade, an adverse shift in total factor productivity, or some

other adverse shift to the demand for labor in its manufacturing

sector? Under such circumstances, the scope is limited for real

wage increases in manufacturing without negative effects on

employment, and the level of wages consistent with high employment

may actually decline. If, however, the manufacturing sector is

unionized, these wage reductions may not be forthcoming. It is

well-recognized that under a wide range of conditions, models of

monopoly union behavior imply a rigid real consumption wage, or at

least a rigid markup over the best alternative available in the

uncovered sector or the level of unemployment benefits.5 The union

may be willing to accept some unemployment among its members in

return for perserving a high real wage. Labor will be released

from the manufacturing sector.

     Barring wage reductions in the sector that sustain the shock,

either through direct concessions or an increase in the fraction

of nonunionized employees in manufacturing, there will be a

contraction of manufacturing employment. Redundant labor will be

absorbed by the nonunion or uncovered sector, where wages will

and Symons (1985), Adams, Fenton, and Larsen (1986).

5The seminal articles are McDonald and Solow (1981) and Oswald
(1982); see also Bruno and Sachs (1985), chapter 9 and Oswald's
1985 survey article. In the benchmark case, if utility of the
representative member has constant relative risk aversion and the
elasticity of labor demand is constant, the optimal union wage is
a fixed markup over the non union alternative wage or the
unemployment benefit.

                                   13
 adjust downward to clear the labor market. In the US, the service

 sector, which is little unionized, is a likely place to absorb

mucht of the surplus labor. It is significant that all net US

employment growth has occurred in the service      sectors, where

trade unions are of negligible importance.6

     We depict this two sector adjustment in the panels of Figure

3. Labor is homogenous and supplied inelastically by households in

quantity L, the length of the segment AB, which can be employed in

either sector. In the absence of market restrictions, a single

wage would clear the labor market. Suppose, however, that a union

sets wages in the manufacturing sector at Wm; consequently

employment in manufacturing is AC. Excess labor is absorbed by the

other sector, so employment in the tertiary sectors is BC, at wage

W. The response of this economy to a leftward shift of L is

displayed in the second panel of Figure 3. Employment in services

increases from BC to BD, manufacturing employment declines from AC

to AD and the service sector wage declines from W to W'.           In
                                                       S   5
practice in the US W itself is not fully rigid, especially due

to the presence of a non-union manufacturing sector, so that

adjustment takes place thorugh a reduction in Wm and


6Freeman and Medoff (1984) report unionization rates of 34% and
48% in US manufacturing and transport/communications/public
utilities, respectively, compared with 10% in trade, 4% in FIRE
(finance, insurance, and real estate), and 7% in other services.

71f the service sector wage comprises an important component of
the alternative wage available to union members, the decline in
the service sector wage may lead to a reduction of union wage
demands in manufacturing, even if there is no non-union
manufacturing subsector. This would reduce, but not wholly
eliminate, the reduction in manufacturing employment and the
decline in W

     The labor markets in the Federal Republic of Germany will in

general adjust with less flexibility to labor demand shocks.

First, wages in the manufacturing (unionized) sector will likely

decline less to increased unemployment than in the US. Second, the

sectors considered uncovered in the US may also be unionized, or

may for institutional reasons be required to pay some minimum

wage. Third, even if these sectors are not unionized, unemployment

insurance or welfare assistance may set a floor on the extent to

which wages in these sectors can fall. These impediments prevent

sufficient adjustment of nonunion, nonmanufacturing wages to
absorb displaced workers.

     Consider the panels of Figure 4, which depict the initial

equilibrium of such an economy and its response to an adverse

labor demand shift in manufacturing. In contrast to the

wage-adjusting economy, the economy in Figure 4 does not possess

an absorbing service sector. Instead, real wages are prevented

from adjusting, and there is an emergence of unemployment, given

by the segment CD in the first panel. In this economy, the

unemployment rate, rather than the relative wage differential,

responds to disturbances. When L1 shifts leftward to LD,,

unemployment increases from CD to ED. By assumption, relative

wages across the two sectors remain the same.

     Even if there is no union in the other sector, the provision

of unemployment insurance (UI) can have a similar impact on the

response of an economy to a shock to its higher wage manufacturing

sector. A sufficiently high unemployment benefit for newly
unemployed workers released from the manufacturing sector could

 introduce a lower bound on wages in the nonunionized service

sector. In one sense, this unemployment is voluntary, since

unemployed individuals are indifferent between working in the

service sector and collecting UI benefits; if there is some

probability of ultimate recall, their expected utility may be

higher in the latter state. On the other hand, actual positions

are never offered and would never appear in official vacancy data.

     Our simple model contains several strong predictions. In an

economy with labor market clearing in services and a rigid wage in

manufacturing, one should expect service sector employment to rise

both absolutely and relative to manufacturing. In an economy with

restricted adjustment in services, service sector employment will

increase only in relative terms. The size of the service sector in

terms of value added will respond similarly. Second, wage rigidity

in manufacturing will imply an increase in nominal wage dispersion

in the economy with market clearing. This follows from the fact

that the uncovered sector wage must fall to clear the labor

market. In the second economy, unemployment rises, but relative

wage dispersion by assumption is unchanged. Third, service sector

labor productivity in the first economy should decline in tandem

with the service sector wage, as should the capital-labor ratio.

Capital intensity in services will be higher in the second
economy. In the next section, we          will show that both
institutional and labor market evidence strongly suggest that the

US is well-characterized by the market clearing version of the

model, while the Federal Republic of Germany is closer to the

rigid wage version.

4. Evidence for the Model

4.1. Institutional Evidence

     An understanding of institutions is a sine aua                   for

meaningful analysis of the evolution of wages and employment in

the Federal Republic of Germany, since the institutions are quite

different from their counterparts in the US. To begin with,

collective bargaining process in Germany is highly regularized and

legally circumscribed. Wage negotiations take                place on an
industry rather than craft level through seventeen national labor

unions       of     the   umbrella     organization,   the      Deutscher

Gewerkschaftsbuj-id (DGB), which at yearend 1985 had roughly

7,720,000 members. Representing the employer's side is a
collection of about 1000 "employer associations" organized as the

EDA (Bundesvereinigung der Deutschen Arbeitgeberverbande). While

agreements        are ultimately concluded at the       regional      and

sometimes at the plant level, the constituent national unions

publicize a wage demand at the outset of the annual bargaining

round that serves as a standard for subsequent negotiations.

     Perhaps the most significant (and most frequently ignored)

feature of collective bargaining             in West    Germany      that

distinguishes it from the US is the possibility for wage

agreements        to be declared     "generally   binding"     for   all

employees and all enterprises in a sector, regardless of union

membership or whether the firm is a member of the employers'




                                       17
                                                           8
 confederation      (Allgemeinverbindlichkeitserklarung)       Although
 closed shop is         expressly forbidden by law, either side of a

 wage contract can petition the state (Land) labor minister for

 an extension of        the    contract ternis to all workers and

 enterprises, as long as more than 50% of all workers in the

 relevant sector are employed by firms that were a party to the

 original agreement.

      The extension of wage agreements is an important element of

 the West German collective bargaining landscape. While in a given

year only 10% of all agreements are declared generally binding,

they are often nationwide contracts, representing about 20% of

all employees in recent years.9 Schatz (1984) argues that even
if    agreements are not declared generally binding, the high

membership    rates of employers in employers'        confederations

(80-90% in manufacturing) enforces the wage agreement as the de

facto minimum wage, since member emtloyers are legally bound k

jy negotiated    wage contract. Insofar as this action serves to
"level the    playing field" on the labor cost side, there is

generally little objection from management of existing firms. It

is often suggested that declining industries request extension as

a flanking manuever.

     It   follows      that union membership      figures      severely


8The provision is found in Section 5 of the Tarifvertragsgesetz
(Wage Contract Law) of 1969. For references see the OECD (1979)
and Boedler and Keiser (1979); Schatz (1984) and Soitwedel (1984)
have written on the economic effects of "extension."

9See Schatz (1984), p. 25. Moreover, the number of contracts
"extended" has risen rapidly, from 173 contracts in 1968, to 448
in 1975, to 563 in 1986.

underestimate the power of West Germany's industrial unions.

Although the percentage of union membership hovers between 30 and

40%    of    dependent-status employment,          more than 90% of all

German workers are employed in sectors covered by collective
                   10
wage agreements!        In contrast, the choice of union representation

in collective bargaining in the United States is resolved             in

establishment level elections.          Since union shop generally
applies, there are few free riders and organization levels closely

approximate coverage by wage contracts.

      Significantly, collective bargaining and its "minimum wage"

characteristics extend to occupations and sectors which are

generally nonunion in the US. While blue collar membership in DGB

affiliated unions has remained constant over the past 15 years,

white collar union membership has risen by more than 35%             The

fastest growing DGB affiliate, Gewerkschaft Handel,          Bank,   und

Versicherung (HEy), represents dependent status employees in
the trade and      finance     sectors. Although     its   membership of

370,000 (yearend 1985) represented only about 10% percent of all

dependent employees in those sectors, it bargains on behalf of the

nationwide workforce in both banking and insurance, and has been

able to conclude state-wide wage agreements in the wholesale and

retail trade sectors. The DEC union Nahrung, GenuE, GaststAtte

(NGG), has extended its traditionally manufacturing orientation

 towards employment in the eating          and lodging   establishments,

 although these contain large numbers of family businesses and

 foreign workers. Moreover, because the tertiary sectors are

 characterized by greater numbers of smaller firms and lower

 membership rates in the employers' associations, the likelihood of

 an extension is higher; 23% of all "extended" wage agreements, for

 example, are in wholesale and retail trade.12 The German Federal

 Labor Office reports extensions            in such diverse service

 occupations as beauticians, transport workers, employees in the

eating and lodging trades, janitors, and security guards.13

       An important implication of the strong industrial unionism

observed in West Germany is that wage agreements tend not to

reflect differences in regional labor market conditions. Table 6

documents contractual wages for most highly skilled metal workers

in four West German regions with markedly different labor market

conditions. Schleswig-Holstein, Hamburg, Bremen, and Lower Saxony
have     suffered from a decline of shipbuilding and steel
industries.     In contrast, unemployment in Bavaria                and

Baden-Wurttemberg        has   been significantly lower than the
national      average,   reflecting        steady   demand for machine

tools, automobiles,      and high-tech products. Despite widely
disparate economic circumstances, IC         Metall settlements    have

varied little across bargaining regions over the past decade. The

that not all provisions of a wage contract need be extended;
nonetheless, wage provisions are the predominant object of
extension when the entire contract is not extended.

 disappearance    of significant wage drift over the same period

 documented by Grundlach (1986)          indicates   that these wages

 probably represent binding minima.

      We have argued above that another institutional factor that

 potentially limits the extent to which wages in the tertiary

 sectors can fall is the provision of unemployment insurance (UI)

 and related benefits. By creating a floor on wages paid by

 service-producing industries, the UI system may function much like

a union. In Germany this certainly seems feasible: assuming they

qualify, unemployed workers receive 63% of their last wage for one

year (Arbeitslosengeld), and about 52% for the next year
(Arbeitsiosenhilfe), followed by a similar rate thereafter

(Sozialhilfe). For a comparative overview of the extent and

duration of coverage for an average married breadwinner, see Table

7, which we have taken from Burtless (1986). Not only is the West

German statutory replacement ratio considerably higher (66 versus

37% of last wage) but the period of coverage is considerably

longer (one year with indefinite extension versus 26 weeks).

Moreover, Minford (1985) suggests that in Germany actual
replacement ratios- -the fraction of net take-home pay received by

unemployed individuals- -   normally exceed the official statutory
ratios. This is due to fixed components and nonlinearities in the

benefit schedules, social welfare supplements, and the           tax

treatment of the benefit.

    We have cited a litany of striking institutional differences

between the two economies that have the potential to block

salutory labor market adjustments in the service-producing

level of real wages in manufacturing and (2) the comparative

response of the two economies in the tertiary sectors.



4.2. Evidence from Labor Markets
fl   Nonadjustment   Wages j Manufacturing: fl Wage    Q.
     Revisited
     The last decade witnessed a resurgence of interest in the

role of supply-related factors on growth and employment, and a

large literature now exists on the role of labor costs in

aggregate supply and the demand for employment.14 A central theme

of these comparative studies is the failure of real wages in

manufacturing to moderate sufficiently after a series of inward

shifts in the demand for labor. These shifts include the two OPEC

shocks, which may be likened to a one-time productivity regress,

the secular decline in manufacturing      terms   of trade brought

about by competition from newly industrializing economies, and

the worldwide productivity slowdown.

     In the last five years, however, the "disequilibrium wage

hypothesis" as applied to the European economies has been

subjected to increasing criticism. That unemployment continued to

rise in recent years despite apparent wage moderation has prompted

many analysts to dismiss the relevance of wage levels for the

current labor market imbalance.15 Often cited is the fact that the

and Newell and Symons (1985).

                                   22
1985 labor share of manufacturing in West Germany - -   tautologically
the ratio of aggregate product wages to average productivity- - has

fallen to levels of the early 1970s (see Figure 5). It is

important to note that any account of the rise in the NAIRU in

the Federal Republic of Germany that stresses the failure of

labor       market   clearing   requires a demonstration that real

product wages remain above levels consistent with high

employment.16

         It is widely understood, however, that the wage share itself

contains no information about the consistency of wages with full

employment, since labor's current average product will generally

differ from average product at full employment)7 Some form of

adjustment is necessary for effects that additional employment

will have on the marginal, and average, product of labor. This

correction may have a neoclassical justification; an increase in

employment will reduce marginal product, and thereby the

correponding wage at high employment. An alternative correction,

suggested among others by Gordon (1986), is motivated by labor

hoarding or increasing returns to labor; it implies average
productivity may increase with labor input. These adjustments have

led to the "wage-gap" measure- -defined as the percentage deviation

of real product compensation levels from the (estimated) marginal

product of labor at high employment. Despite problems involving

productivity slowdown (Sachs 1979 and Bruno-Sachs 1985) as well as
membership induced hysteresis (Blanchard and Summers 1986) and
the capital shortage (Giersch 1981, Modigliani et.al.l986).

estimation of full employment labor supply, the specification and

estimation of an aggregate production function, and the
possibility of firm disequilibrium behavior, the use of the wage

gap concept by many analysts and the acceptance by the OECD and

the IMF of its "diagnostic function" (Bruno 1985) indicates its

utility in policy circles.

     In his original investigation,     Sachs (1983) assumed a

Cobb-Douglas technology with Harrod-neutral technical progress.

While many have criticized the Cobb-Douglas assumption, which

implies constant factor shares in equilibrium, this criticism

seems largely unjustified.      If the true technology is CES

with substitution elasticity less than unity, a     Cobb-Douglas

assumption actually biases estimated wage gaps downward,      or

against the conclusion that wages are excessive.18 The constancy

of wage shares throughout the period of capital deepening in the

1960s is well-documented and difficult to explain jointly with

the runup of wage shares in the l970s unless (1) the production

technology is Cobb-Douglas with slow       adjustment or     (2)

parameters of technology are themselves changing over time. While

both Artus     (1984) and McCallum (1985) have estimated low

labor-capital substitution elasticities, these estimates may

criticized for not adequately considering disequilibrium firm

behavior, since departures from long run equilibrium may involve

both Keynesian (labor hoarding) and neoclassical (costs of

18Recall that the the local elasticity of labor demand when
production is CES with fixed capital stock is        where a and
SK are the capital-labor substitution elasticity and capital's
value-added share; the wage gap is approximately w-w*
where the asterisks denote high or full employment values.

                                  24
adjustment) aspects. In the Appendix, we employ an error
correction model applied to nonstationary time series, (see for

example Granger and Engle 1987) to estimate the capital-labor

elasticity of substitution from the firm's first order condition

for profit maximization. The error correction model has the virtue

of imposing the estimated relationship only in the long run, while

allowing for short run deviations which are left relatively

unconstrained. We find strong evidence for the Cobb-Douglas

specification in aggregate West German manufacturing.

        Given a Cobb-Douglas specification of technology, how does

one estimate the marginal product of labor at "high" employment?

Sachs (1983) assumed that employment in 1960,            1973 and 1979

equalled full employment, and interpolated peak-to-peak growth in

average productivity as its underlying trend at full employment,

which under Cobb-Douglas technology equals marginal productivity

up to a multiplicative constant. Since unemployment rates in

Germany have failed to fall significantly over the past recovery,

it would be incorrect to consider average productivity in the

l980s as deviations around "high employment" levels, just as it is

incorrect to consider the unadjusted wage share alone as an
indication of real wage levels.19

        One approach, then, is to compute wage gaps using standard

neoclassical assumptions and estimates of relevant Cobb-Douglas

parameters, using capital stocks, imputed technical progress and

some estimate of "high employment hours." On the other hand,

Gordon (1986) has argued that there is a productivity dividend to

                                      25
increased eniployrnent, which has been widely documented in the US

data, suggesting a potential upward bias in wage gaps computed
under the above procedure. One solution to this problem is to

estimate the unconstrained response of average productivity to an

increase in labor input. From these estimates the high employment

average (and under Cobb-Douglas assumptions, marginal) product can

be recovered. This procedure will identify and incorporate a

productivity dividend if it exists.

     We recomputed wage gaps in manufacturing employing both

procedures, under the assumption that high employment labor supply

is simply equal to its average value over the 1970s.2° Both sets

of wage gaps are displayed in Table 8. Our results for West German

manufacturing continue to indicate a substantial wage gap, and a

striking absence of one in the US. We find no evidence of a

productivity dividend in West Germany, despite considerable

evidence of one in the US, belying Gordon's (1986) recent claim of

no difference in the productivity behavior between the US and

Europe. Our results thus corroborate those of Artus (1984), Bruno

(1986), and Sachs (1986) for West Germany and represent evidence

for a number of wage-related theories of unemployment.

     A decomposition of the change in the estimated      wage gap
since 1970 can shed some light on the sources of the persistent

wage problem in West German manufacturing. In Table 9, it is clear

that while consumption wage growth has slowed considerably, the

relative price of manufactures continues to deterioriate, despite

a respite of falling oil prices and dollar appreciation. In

addition, growth of estimated productivity at high employment is

still lagging, although the imputed rate of technical progress

has actually recovered its earlier trend growth; as the table

makes clear, the culprit has been the cumulative effects of an

investment slowdown over the past decade.21 Not reflected in

Table 9 is yet another important "supply shock." The tax
wedge- - the   component of total compensation represented by
indirect taxes,     social insurance contributions,            and other

employee compensation      not counted as wages and salaries- -has

increased from 51.6% in 1975 to 78% in 1984. When              all these

factors are taken into consideration,            the       much-touted

Reallohnpause     (wage    pause) of the early         1980s     remains

insufficient     to allow significant new job creation                in

manufacturing.



Services: Where      jj   Jobs?

     We have argued that a variety of mechanisms operating in

Germany may have prevented a US style adjustment to the adverse

shocks of the l970s. Considerable        support exists for this

interpretation of    the divergent job creation performance of US

and West Germany service economies. Growth in the broadly defined

services in the US is widely recognized, and often called the

"economic miracle" of the past decade. In a comparison of US

and West European employment growth, Wegner (1983) found while

that the composition of European employment has shifted towards

21See Burda (1987) and Bruno and Sachs (1985). Bruno (1986)
presents convincing evidence on the response of investment to the
high real wages of the 1970s.

                                    27
services, the shift has proceeded at a much a much slower rate

than in the US, in both absolute and relative terms. For evidence

on Germany, consider Figure 6, which compares total private

dependent status employment       in manufacturing and private

service-producing industries.    It could be claimed that the

sluggish performance of service employment merely reflects lower

overall growth. This view is rejected in Table 10, which compares

the percentage point change in the share of total dependent-status

employment    in broadly defined services    in the two countries

since 1960.    It is noteworthy that until the middle of the last

decade these shifts were roughly of the same magnitude in the

two countries; in the last decade the process in Germany has been

brought to a virtual      standstill.     To get an idea of the
magnitudes involved, had Germany sustained the same compositional

shifts as the US,    ho1din other employment constant, tertiary
sector employment would have exceeded current levels by another

950,000 jobs, or roughly 3.5% of the 1985 labor force!22

     In Table 11 we compare average growth rates in per employee

real compensation in the Federal Republic of Germany and the US.

In real terms, compensation growth in West German tertiary sectors

has clearly outpaced its American counterparts, and has until

recently kept pace with the manufacturing sector. In the most

salient example, the average employee in the finance and insurance



     1975,    tertiary dependent status employment in the FRG was
6,485 million or .251/.749 —      .33   times all other dependent
employment. Increasing this share by 5 percentage points over the
subsequent decade makes    it   .301/.699 = .42 times all other
private dependent employment in 1984 (18,272 million) = 7,868
million, compared to the actual 1984 figure of 6,904 million.

sector in Germany receives 1.21 times the average compensation in

manufacturing; in the US the comparable figure is 0;84. This

significant differential seems to be a direct outcome of HBV and

DAG (Deutsche Angestelite Gewerkschaft) nationwide collective

bargaining, as discussed in the last section. In wholesale and

retail trade, the average German receives compensation amounting

to .79 of the manufacturing average; in the US, the figure is

0.59. Only in private services are the ratios closer (0.68 in FR
                           23
Germany, 0.65 in the US)

     Recall that a key prediction of the model involved the

evolution of the wage differential between the more unionized

manufacturing and the uncovered service sector. In the model with

an absorbing service sector, one would expect the differential to

increase; in the nonadjusting economy, the adjustment takes place

through higher unemployment. Figure 7, which plots the standard

deviation of log average compensation in the manufacturing,

trade, transport and communication, finance and private service

sectors, suggests that the US experience is characterized by a

marked increase in relative wage dispersion, confirming results

of Bell and Freeman        (1985) and Lawrence and Lawrence (1985).

Until 1975, relative wages in West Germany also followed this

pattern. In the past ten years, however, intersectoral         wage

dispersion in West Germany has actually fallen. While conflicting

results have been      reported within the industrial        sector

23lnterestingly, in the finance and trade sectors, US employment
growth has been very strong. Over the period 1980-84, dependent
status employment in FIRE and trade sectors increased 9.8 and 7.3%
respectively in the US; in FR Germany, employment in the financial
sector grew by only 3.1%, and in trade actually declined by 6.8%.

 (Breithaupt and Soitwedel 1980 and Grundlach 1986 find decreases

 in wage dispersion, where Blanchard        ],.   1985 and Bell and

Freeman 1985 report slight increases), our results shows an

unequivocal tightening of wage dispersion at the one-digit level.

It is not implausible that increasing unionization of the service

sectors has contributed to wage demands in these sectors linked to

those in dominant metal and chemical workers unions, an outcome

predicted by simple union models. Table 12 charts the variability

of compensation in the wholesale and retail trade, finance, and

services sectors relative to aggregate manufacturing in the two

countries over the past quarter decade. It depicts a significant

decrease in variability in West Germany compared with the United

States. Note that this decrease began in the mid-1970s, when the

economy was growing rapidly.

     Trends in labor productivity in the tertiary industries

provide additional support for our thesis. In a recent survey of

the two countries, Wegner (1985) identified value-added per hour

as the most salient feature distinguishing the performance of

tertiary sectors in the US and West Germany. We reproduce his

findings in Table 13. It seems unlikely that these striking

productivity differences are solely attributable to different

production techniques available in the two economies. Rather, the

behavior of capital-labor ratios in these sectors support the

contention that producers of services in the two countries are

responding to differing relative prices. Figure 8 documents a

secular pace of capital deepening in aggregate services in West

Germany that is largely absent in the US; moreover, this trend is

sharply different in manufacturing. If technology is the same

across   countries, this outcome is predicted directly by West

Germany service industries facing a higher real price of labor.

Table 14, which displays average growth in capital-labor ratios at

the one-digit level service sectors, gives clear evidence of

higher capital intensity in Germany, and more importantly, a break

in the mid-l970s.

     To summarize, Germany has not experienced the strong growth

of service employment observed in the US. This might seem

puzzling, since output growth in these sectors has not been

insignificant.24 Clearly, some of this differential      is due to

slower growth rates of labor force participation in the Germany;

nonetheless, until the niid-1970s the shift to a service economy

was taking place at the same proportionate rate, while the

past ten years have witnessed a departure from the trend shared

with the US. Given the evidence on lower wage dispersion, markedly

higher rates of labor productivity      growth, and capital-labor

ratios, we suspect that the "wage problem" has manifested itself

in the German service sector.

     High unemployment in West Germany has become an accepted and

conspicuous feature of the world economic picture. The paths of

utilities in the US); banking and insurance 8.7% (9.6% in US); and
personal services 8.6% (15.7%in US). Less impressive were the
trade sector with 4.7% growth (20.9% in US) and, of course,
manufacturing with a paltry 0.9% real growth (11.4% in US).

unemployment and inflation, however, suggest that aggregate demand

factors can only go part of the way in explaining the secular rise

of joblessness in this country. We conclude that underlying real

factors have raised the NAIRU, or equilibrium rate.

     We were unable to find any evidence that the rise in the

NAIRU in West Germany is due to an increase in "frictional"

unemployment. Rather, in comparing the relative labor market

performance of Germany and the US, we suggest that nonadjustnient

of wages to adverse shocks and to unemployment itself should bear

the brunt of blame. Whereas the US economy has responded to the

adverse supply shocks of the l970s with the creation of 20 million

jobs in services, job creation in the tertiary sectors of West

Germany was grossly insufficient to offset the reduction of

employment in manufacturing. We find the data highly consistent

with the hypothesis that wage rigidity in services- -due to

unionization, minimum wage provisions,       or overly generous
unemployment benefits- -has obstructed rapid labor intensive growth

in these sectors and can help to explain the continuing rise in

West German unemployment.

         Estimation of Capital/Labor Substitution Elastisticies

represent       Hicks      and Harrod          neutral         technical        progress,

respectively, and w and p are the wage rate and the price of

output. Define the elasticity of substitution a

        It is easy to rewrite the first order condition as:

                    SK —    a(V/K)1'                                                 (Al)
where       is capital's share in value-added. If K is not fixed, the

condition will continue to hold, but the level of output is

indeterminate and must be fixed elsewhere.Note how (Al) does not

involve either A1 or A2. Taking logs, we obtain

                    ln 5Kt —     lna + pln(V/K)                                      (A2)

      If firms were always on the production function, one could

regard (A2) as a regression equation. Generally, firms will be off

the production for a variety of reasons. Costs of adjusting labor

input may retard the reaction of firms to changes in relative

factor prices. If there are fixed costs to hiring and firing,

firms may hoard labor over the cycle. Clearly if (A2) is estimated

directly, ignoring these phenomena, a left-out variable bias will


                                              33
arise. If the omitted adjustment term is negatively correlated

with V/K and makes a negative contribution to capital share, it

will tend to bias estimates of p upward, and thus of a downward.

     The model presents an ideal application of an error

correction model, which effectively only imposes the estimated

relationship at the lowest frequencies.25 If ln(V/K) and in           are

cointegrated with cointegrating vector [1 -ma -p1, then although

the individual series are nonstationary, the linear combination

                 in s - ma      -
                                    pln(V/K)
is stationary. One error correction model that incorporates this

restriction is

     ln SKt —
                   -y1ln   5Kt-l 72ln(V/K) 1 +

                             y3[ln SK 11 -        pln(V/K)i]   +

where e is an i.i.d. random variable.This model may be estimated

in the levels as

     in SKt —                       + a2ln SKt2
                 a0+ a1ln SKt1
                                                                   (A3)

                       + a31n(V/K)t . + a4ln(V/K) 2 +

and given estimates of the &s, the parameter of interest here, p

(which is exactly identified), may be solved as -(a34-a4)/(a1+a2).26

The regression results of estimating (A3) are presented in Table

Al. The estimated value of p is -(-O.758l+O..7878)/(l..3971- .4892)

= -.0327); implying a value of a of 1.034. The US results imply p—

0.1775 and a=O.849. The estimates appear in Table Al.

26Recent work of Stock         (1986) has shown that estimates of
cointegrating vectors to converge at high rates to their true
values, but are subject to small sample bias.

                             - Appendix  II
                         Computation of Wage Gaps

       The wage gap is defined as the difference between actual

wage and that which          clears the market when L—L (at high

employment). By the national income identity, technical progress

may be estimated using Solow's method (see Bruno and Sachs 1985).

That is, we approximate the continuous time full employment

relationship under Harrod neutral technical progress:

                         —
                    Vt       sLt(lt+   a) + SKtkt

with

                    —
                        sLt i(tl+ óa) + SKt1 kt
so

                    =
                        l+ s1(óv- sKtlâkt)                        (A4)

The resulting series was then projected on a constant and a fourth

order polynomial in time. The fitted series were            used as the

imputed technical progress. They are presented in Table A2. If
                               a    1-a 1-a a 1-a
production is given by V—K (AL)         —A K L      ,   then the average
product of labor at high employment                 V/Li is given by
A1(1-a)(K/L). To compute this we used employment,                  gross

constant-price capital stocks, and the imputed technical progress

series. The high employment labor supply Lwas taken to be average

of annual manufacturing man-hours in the l970s. Given that US

manufacturing employment is roughly at its 1970s average this may

be the appropriate benchmark.

       Alternatively, we estimated the following equation using


                                       36
manufacturing data, using both OLS and instrumental variables:

              —
                  a1+ a2l 1+ a3k +    a4v+   a5t +a6t +   a7t
where lower case letters indicate logarithms. Next, one can solve

this equation for steady state output:


    v —   (l/a4)[a3k    +
                            (l-a2)l   (a1+ a4v-4- a5t +a6t +    a7t)]
Now subtract l from both sides:


 v-l.- (l/a4)[-a3k+ (la2a4)l (a1+ a4v+ a5t +a6t +               a7tfl
Substituting i for 1, we have the average product at full

employment:


        (i/a4)[a3k+ (l-a2-a4)l- (a1+ a4v+ a5t +a6t +            a7t)]
If there is a productivity dividend, (l-a2-a4)/a4 will be greater

than unity.       Note that we do not impose the constant
returns restriction at estimation, which is a4=l-a2-a3.
