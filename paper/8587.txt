        Macroeconomists acknowledge the contribution of human capital to economic growth, but their
empirical studies define human capital solely in terms of schooling. In this paper, we extend production
function models of economic growth to account for two additional variables that microeconomists have
identified as fundamental components of human capital: work experience and health. Our main result is
that good health has a positive, sizable, and statistically significant effect on aggregate output. We find
little variation across countries in average work experience, thus differentials in work experience account
for little variation in rates of economic growth. Finally, we find that the effects of average schooling on
national output are consistent with microeconomic estimates of the effects of individual schooling on
earnings, suggesting that education creates no discernible externalities.

                                      1. Introduction



       Although labor quality in the form of human capital clearly contributes

significantly to economic growth, most cross-country empirical studies identify labor

quality narrowly with education. Our central argument is that this practice ignores strong

reasons for considering health to be a crucial aspect of human capital, and therefore a

critical ingredient of economic growth. Healthier workers are physically and mentally

more energetic and robust. They are more productive and earn higher wages. They are

also less likely to be absent from work because of illness (or illness in their family).

Illness and disability reduce hourly wages substantially, with the effect especially strong

in developing countries, where a higher proportion of the work force is engaged in

manual labor than in industrial countries. A substantial body of microeconomic evidence

documents many of these effects (see Strauss and Thomas 1998). Testing whether such

effects translate into an aggregate effect of population health on economic growth is

important. Health, in the form of life expectancy, has appeared in many cross-country

growth regressions, and investigators generally find that it has a significant positive effect

on the rate of economic growth (see Bloom and Canning 2000, 2001). However, these

regressions do not clearly indicate whether health directly benefits growth or whether it is

merely a proxy for other missing or mismeasured factors (see, for example, Barro and

Sala-I-Martin 1995).

       The main objective of this study is to include health in a well-specified aggregate

production function in an attempt to test for the existence of a true effect of health on

labor productivity, and to measure its strength. However, because human capital is


                                              3
multidimensional, we need a model of growth that includes all its major components.

This ensures that we do not erroneously overestimate the contribution of one component

by mistakenly attributing to it the contributions of those components we omit. Thus we

further add work experience to our model, because considerable microeconomic evidence

indicates that it has an impact on workers’ earnings (see, for example, Mincer 1974). We

construct macroeconomic measures of health and work experience to examine whether

microeconomic evidence of their importance as forms of human capital carries over into

their ability to explain economic growth.

       To this end we construct an aggregate production function that expresses a

nation's output as a function of its inputs and the efficiency with which it uses these

inputs. These inputs are physical capital, labor, and human capital in the three dimensions

of education, experience, and health. Our model also considers the efficiency with which

these inputs are used, that is, total factor productivity (TFP). We estimate all the

parameters of this production function using panel data for 1960-90 and obtain measures

of the relative contributions of each of the inputs and of TFP to economic growth.

       An alternative approach is to calibrate the model using microeconomic evidence

for parameter values (see, for instance, Klenow and Rodriguez-Clare 1997; Prescott 1998;

Young 1994, 1995). The potential advantage of estimation over calibration is that the

microeconomic evidence measures the effect of improvements in an individual's human

capital on own earnings, ignoring the additional effects it might have on other individuals

or on society as a whole. These additional effects, that is, externalities, might arise

because people’s productivity depends on the productivity of their coworkers. When

workers obtain more schooling, their earnings rise, but those of their coworkers may rise


                                               4
as well. By estimating the returns to human capital in aggregate, we let these returns

differ from microeconomic estimates, which allows us to make inferences about the

existence and magnitude of the externalities.

       Our main result is that health has a positive and statistically significant effect on

economic growth. It suggests that a one year improvement in a population's life

expectancy contributes to a 4 percent increase in output.

       We also find that our estimates of the contributions of education and work

experience are close to those found in microeconomic studies. Indeed, the differences

between our parameter estimates and the averages found in microeconomic studies are

usually statistically insignificant. Thus we find no evidence of the existence of

externalities to human capital in the form of schooling and experience (or such

externalities are too small for us to detect). While large cross-country differences in life

expectancy and average years of schooling explain a substantial proportion of the income

gaps we observe between countries, cross-country differences in average work experience

are small, implying that work experience plays a relatively minor role in explaining

income gaps.



                                          2. Theory



We assume that we can decompose economic growth into two sources: growth in the

level of inputs and growth in TFP. We take our inputs to be physical capital, labor, and

human capital.




                                              5
          We model output as a function of inputs and technology using the following

aggregate production function:



                                                                    2
                               Y = AK α Lβ eφ1 s + φ 2 exp + φ 3 exp + φ 4 h ,        (1)




where Y is output or gross domestic product (GDP); A represents TFP; K is physical

capital; L is the labor force; and human capital consists of three components, average

years of schooling s , average work experience of the work force exp , average square of

work experience exp 2 , and health h (which we proxy with life expectancy). We express

the effect of the human capital terms on output as powers of an exponential. As long as

workers earn their marginal product, using this functional form implies that log wages

depend on the level of schooling, experience, experience squared, and health status,

which is the relationship usually found in microeconomic studies.

          Taking logs of the aggregate production function, we derive an equation for the

log of output in country i at time t :



             yit = a it + αk it + β l it + φ sit + φ exp it + φ exp it2 + φ 4 hit ,              (2)
                                            1       2          3



where y it , k it , and l it    it   are the logs of Yit , K it , and Lit , respectively. Equation (2) is an

identity, but in practice ait , the level of TFP in country i at time t , is not observed and

appears as an error term when the equation is estimated.


                                                            6
        We model TFP as follows:




                       ait = ait* + vit , where vit = ρvi, t −1 + ε it ,       (3)




where 0 < ρ < 1 and ε it is a random shock. Each country has a long–run, steady-state

level of TFP given by ait* . Its actual TFP, given by a it , deviates from the steady state by

the random difference vit , which consists of systematic and idiosyncratic components.

The systematic difference, represented by ρvit −1 , shrinks over time. The idiosyncratic

randomness is represented by ε it . A simple special case popular in the literature (see, for

example, Mankiw, Romer, and Weil 1992) is to posit that ait* is the same for every

                          *
country, so that a it* = a t . In this case, vit represents country i 's deviation from the

world's common level of technology at time t . This deviation may be persistent, but as

time passes, this country's TFP converges to the world level at the rate 1 − ρ , which

represents the speed of technological diffusion.

        While technology may eventually diffuse, some countries may enjoy long-run

                                                                           *
advantages in TFP that are not eroded over time, so that a * it ≠ a t . To parsimoniously

                                                                                     *
model how steady-state TFP may differ across countries, we allow a it to be a function of

geography, proxied by the percentage of country i 's area that is in the tropics, and a

measure of the quality of its political institutions. Tropical location has recently been

viewed as a geographical disadvantage to growth because of obstacles it creates in the

diffusion of agricultural technologies from temperate to tropical zones, disadvantages in



                                                   7
food production, and infectious disease ecology (see Bloom and Sachs 1998). The quality

of political institutions, on the other hand, has been argued to affect economic growth

because it provides the social stability, effective provision of public services, and

enforcement of private contracts that are required for growth.

             For estimation purposes, turning our production function into a growth equation is

useful. Differencing equation (2) gives us




   ∆y        = ∆a + α∆k + β∆l + φ ∆s + φ ∆ exp + φ ∆ exp 2 + φ 4 ∆hit + ∆v it .                                     (4)
        it       t     it    it  1 it   2     it 3       it



             Substituting out the error term ∆vit using equation (3) and noting that the lagged

productivity gap vit −1 is the difference between actual output and output at the average

world TFP level at time t − 1 generates




         ∆yit = ∆at + α∆k it + β∆lit + φ1∆sit + φ 2 ∆ exp it + φ 3 ∆ exp it2 + φ 4 ∆hit                       (5)


+ (1 − ρ )(ai, t −1 + αk i , t −1 + β li, t −1 + φ1si, t −1 + φ 2 exp i, t −1 + φ3 exp i2, t −1 + φ 4 hi, t −1 − yi, t ) + ε it




Equation (5) shows that growth in output can be decomposed into four components: the

growth of world TFP; the growth of inputs; a catch-up term as some of the country’s TFP

gap, vit −1 , is closed and the country converges to its steady-state level of TFP at the rate

1 − ρ ,; and an idiosyncratic shock to the country’s TFP, ε it .




                                                            8
        The problem with estimating equation (5) as it stands is reverse causality. While

we are interested in measuring the contribution of input growth to output growth, output

growth may have a reverse causal effect on input growth. For example, economic growth

may stimulate investments in physical capital. Output growth may also augment human

capital by facilitating increased schooling or improving people’s health (see, for example,

Bils and Klenow 2000; Pritchett and Summers 1996). Statistically speaking, this reverse

causality creates a correlation between the input growth (independent) variables and the

error term ε it that renders ordinary least squares estimates of the coefficients in equation

(5) inconsistent.

        Consider a country that experiences an unforeseen and idiosyncratic improvement

in efficiency, ε it > 0 , that raises output, and therefore also raises inputs through the

mechanisms just explained. We would observe growth in both outputs and inputs, yet

incorrectly attribute the growth in outputs to growth in inputs, when in reality the

relationship is exactly the reverse. This would lead us to overstate the contribution of

inputs to growth. We need to disentangle the effect of inputs on growth from the effect

that growth has on inputs. We accomplish this by using an instrumental variables (IVs)

technique. An IV is a variable that must satisfy two criteria. First, it must be correlated

with the endogenous independent variables, that is, the variables that suffer from reverse

causation. In our case, these endogenous variables are the input growth rates in equation

(5). Second, it must be uncorrelated with the error term ε it , conditional on the IV’s

correlation with every other specified independent variable on the right-hand-side of

equation (5). Intuitively, this second requirement implies that the IV must be uncorrelated

with any random TFP shocks that might provoke the reverse causal mechanism described


                                               9
earlier. If such an IV exists, then the first condition ensures that variations in the IV

induce variations in the endogenous inputs. The second condition ensures that the reverse

causality problem will not contaminate these induced variations in the endogenous inputs.

Thus correlations between variations in output and the induced variations in the

endogenous inputs can be interpreted as the causal effect of input growth on output

growth, disentangled from the reverse causality problem.

        We assume that lagged levels and growth rates of inputs serve as valid IVs. These

clearly satisfy the first condition: lagged input use is a good predictor of current input use.

It also arguably satisfies the second condition. While lagged input use probably correlates

with predictable changes in the efficiency with which a nation uses its inputs, it is

unlikely to be related to unpredictable changes in this efficiency, represented by the

idiosyncratic error term ε it . Assuming lagged inputs satisfy the two conditions is quite

compatible with lagged TFP levels and expected TFP growth (the catch-up term in

equation [5]) affecting previous input decisions. An important implication of our model is

that the coefficients on a lagged input level and its current growth rate should be the

same. We test this restiction as a simple check on our model’s assumptions. Failure to

satisfy these equality restrictions would point toward a more complex error structure for

TFP.



                                            3. Data



We construct a panel of countries observed every 10 years from 1960 to 1990. Output

data (GDP) are obtained from the Penn World Tables (see Heston and Summers 1994 for


                                               10
a description). We obtain total output by multiplying real per capita GDP measured in

1985 international purchasing power parity dollars (chain index) by national population.

          We measure a country's labor supply by the size of its economically active

population using data from the International Labour Office (1997), which also gives labor

force participation rates disaggregated by gender and five-year age groups. However, our

labor supply measure is unable to adjust for the fact that some fraction of the labor force

is unemployed, and therefore should not be counted as providing labor inputs. Nor are we

able to adjust for the hours the labor force works. Schooling is mea sured by the average

total years of schooling of the population aged 15 years and older from Barro and Lee

(2000).

          Life expectancy data are from the United Nations (1998). We use these as a proxy

for the health of the work force, even though they measure mortality rates rather than

morbidity. Higher life expectancy is generally thought to be associated with better health

status and lower morbidity (Murray and Chen 1992; Murray and Lopez 1997).

          We construct a measure of aggregate work experience for each country by

computing an experience measure for each of 22 gender and age group combinations

(male and female for age groups 15-19, 20-24,...,60-64, 65+). Experience is simply the

amount of time spent in the labor force. For each group we measure this by average age

minus average years of schooling minus the age at which schooling starts, which we

uniformly assume to be six. This measure of experience is likely to be reasonable for

males, but may overstate the experience of females, who more frequently spend periods

out of the labor market. For simplicity in our calculations, we take the average age of

each group to be the mid-point of its age range. Average work force experience for the


                                              11
country as a whole is a weighted average of the group-specific experience measures,

where the weights are the shares of each group in the total economically active

population. Aggregate squared experience is the analogous weighted average of the

squared experience of each group.

       In this calculation of experience, measured years of schooling for groups aged 25

and older differ by gender, but are assumed to be constant across age groups within each

gender. They are set to Barro and Lee’s (2000) measures of total schooling for the male

and female populations older than 25. We calculated the years of schooling for the groups

aged 15-19 and 20-24 by combining Barro and Lee’s data on schooling for populations

aged 15 or more and 25 or more to infer education for the population aged 15-24, using

the fact that schooling for the population older than 15 equals the weighted average of

schooling for the 15-24 population and schooling for the population older than 25 where

the weights are population shares.

       As data on capital stocks for the time period we are interested in are meager for

most countries, we generate a capital stock series for each country using a perpetual

inventory method. We initialize the capital stock series in the first year for the Penn

World Tables (version 5.6) provide investment data, setting the capital stock equal to the

average investment/GDP ratio in the first five years of data, multiplied by the level of

GDP in the initializing period, and divided by 0.07, our assumed depreciation rate. This is

the capital stock we would expect in the initial year if the investment/GDP ratio we use is

representative of previous rates. Each succeeding period's capital is given by current

capital minus depreciation at 7 percent, plus the level of current investment.




                                             12
        Our capital stock series has wider coverage than the Heston and Summers (1994)

variable for capital stock per worker, which is only available for 62 countries from 1965

onward. Where the two overlap, the correlation coefficient between the log levels of our

series and theirs is 0.97, indicating that the two series are similar. For many countries

investment series do not start until 1960, suggesting that our capital stock data for the

1960s may be suspect, because of the way we construct the initial stock of capital.

Because of depreciation, by 1970 the capital stock estimates become fairly independent of

the initializing assumption used. We therefore limit our estimation to 1970-90, though we

use data from 1960-70 as instruments.

        Our measure of institutional quality is the good governance variable from Knack

and Keifer (1995), while the percentage of land area in the tropics comes from Gallup,

Sachs, and Mellinger (1999).



                                  4. Estimation and Results



We begin by estimating equation (5) under the assumption that steady-state TFP levels

are the same in every country, or in other words a * it = a * t . The results are reported in

table 1. Each regression is estimated by nonlinear least squares, and all contemporaneous

growth rates of inputs are instrumented with their lagged growth rates. Time dummies

(not reported) are included to proxy the average global level of TFP in each period; these

appear in levels in the catch-up part of the regression, while the differences between

successive time periods measure growth in average TFP over the period.




                                               13
[insert table 1 about here]



           The results in column (1) of table 1 include only physical capital, labor, and

schooling as inputs. We find coefficients of close to 0.5 for both capital and labor. We

can show that under certain standard assumptions about technology and competition

(specifically, that technology displays constant returns to scale and that input markets are

perfectly competitive), these coefficients should be equal to the share of each of these

inputs in national income. This makes us suspect the results of this estimation, because

the respective shares of capital and labor in national income are typically one-third and

two-thirds, respectively (see Mankiw 1994, p. 74). However, the sum of these

coefficients is close to one, which is what we would expect under constant returns to

scale technology. Our estimate of the coefficient on schooling translates into a social rate

of return of 17.2 percent2, which is somewhat higher than the average of 9.1 percent

found in microeconomic studies. However, while we find that this estimated rate of return

to schooling is significantly different from zero, it is not well determined, and we cannot

reject the hypothesis that it is the same as the microeconomic estimate of 9.1 percent. The

catch-up coefficient is 0.196, indicating that almost 20 percent of the gap between a


                                                                                             ∂Yit     Y

country's actual and steady-state TFP is closed over a decade, implying an annual rate of

convergence of about 2 percent.

             Adding experience variables in column (2) has the effect that none of the human

capital coefficients is now significant. However, when we calculate the rate of return to

schooling we get 12.8 percent, which is statistically different from zero, though once

again we cannot reject the hypothesis that the actual rate of return is 9.1 percent. The

coefficients on average experience and average experience squared are large in absolute

size, though poorly determined. We cannot reject the possibility that these coefficients are

jointly zero, or indeed, that they produce estimates of the productivity of experience that

are the same as those found in the microeconomic studies.

             The reason for the poorly determined coefficients on our experience measures

seems to be that in our sample average experience and average of experience squared are

highly correlated (the correlation coefficient is above 0.98). Average experience in our

sample ranges from 18 to 28 years, and over this short range its relationship with the

average of experience squared is almost completely linear.3 The wide range of years of

work experience we see in microeconomic data allows us to identify the nonlinear

relationship between experience and wages, but in macroeconomic data the small

  The average of experience squared can be written as the square of average experience plus the variance of
experience across individuals within the country. This implies that it is not only the lack of variation in
average experience that is the problem, but also that the variance of experience across the work force is
similar across countries.


                                                      15
variation in average experience across countries means we cannot pick up such subtle

effects.

           Adding life expectancy in column (3) gives similar results. Again, the human

capital measures are jointly statistically significant, but we cannot reject the hypothesis

that the coefficients are equal to those found in microeconomic studies. The coefficient

on life expectancy is 0.01, suggesting that increasing life expectancy by one year

improves work force productivity and raises output by about 1 percent, though this effect

is not well determined and the coefficient is not statistically significant. Note that in

column 3 the coefficients on capital and labor take on values that are close to their

stylized factor shares of one-third and two-thirds.

           In all three regressions in table 1 we cannot reject the hypothesis that we have

constant returns to scale, that is, that the coefficients on physical capital and labor add to

one. In addition, in each regression we cannot reject the restriction that the coefficients on

the levels and growth rates of inputs are equal.

           We do not report estimates of world technology levels, and these are not fully

identified. We can estimate the total technology effect for each period (the sum of the

world rise in the level of technology, plus the convergence effect as countries catch up

with the base year's world technology level). However, we cannot separate these two

effects without imposing additional restrictions. The problem is that if we see rapid

growth in a particular period, we cannot say if it is because the base year TFP level was




                                                16
high and all countries are converging toward this, or because world TFP has grown

quickly during the period.4

         Overall, the picture that emerges from table 1 is that the macroeconomic results

are surprisingly close to the results found in microeconomic studies. In every case we find

that we cannot reject the hypothesis that the macroeconomic estimates on the returns to

schooling and experience are the same as the microeconomic evidence. In all

specifications we appear to have constant returns to scale, though in some the coefficient

on physical capital appears to be closer to half rather than the one-third that seems to be

the stylized fact. TFP exhibits large gaps across countries, but these gaps are being closed

at the rate of about 2 percent a year.

         The results in table 1 may depend on our assumption that the steady-state level of

TFP is the same in every country. We experimented with different geographical and

institutional variables that may explain long-run differences in TFP and settled on the

percentage of land area in the tropics and a measure of governance as the two that seem

most significant in our framework. We include these variables (which are taken as fixed

over time) in the levels part of equation (5).

         Table 2 excludes average experience squared from the estimation. The average

experience level in our sample is 23 years, and at this experience level the marginal

impact of an extra year of experience on wages (using our microeconomic data

coefficients) is about 1.8 percent, and the expected effect on output (assuming no


4
 One additional restriction would identify TFP in the model. For example, we might fix world benchmark
TFP in 1960 as the TFP of the United States (that is, set 1960 world TFP so that the error term for the
United States in that year is zero), or as world average TFP (so that the average of the error terms in 1960 is
zero). However, the normalization we use does affect the estimates of both the level and growth rate of
world technology.


                                                      17
externalities) is therefore just (1.8 × β ) percent implying a coefficient on experience in

our regressions of around 0.01.



[insert table 2 about here]



         In all three columns of table 2 the coefficient on schooling is small and not

statistically significant. However, we cannot reject the possibility that the rate of return to

schooling is 0.091 as given by microeconomic data. Adding average experience in

columns (2) and (3) generates coefficients on experience that are negative and lower than

the productivity effects found in microeconomic studies. This suggests that experience

reduces aggregate output, even though in microeconomic data it increases individual

wages.

         Adding life expectancy in column 3 produces a result that is positive and

statistically significant, and suggests that each extra year of life expectancy raises the

productivity of workers and leads to an increase of 4 percent in output. This is only

slightly stronger than the effect found in most studies of the contribution of health to

economic growth.5




5
 Studies of the contribution of health to growth often fit regressions of the form
y it − y it −1 = α 0 y it −1 + α 1 ln hit + α 2 xit + ε it , where y it is log of per capita output,
                                                                                           hit is life
expectancy, and x it represents other regressors. When output reaches the steady state, yit − yit −1 = 0 and
                                ∂y it    − α1
simple computation shows that         =         . This quantity should be directly comparable to our
                                ∂hit α 0 hit
coefficient on life expectancy of 0.04. We can compute this quantity using representative results from
Bloom, Canning, Graham, and Sevilla (2000) which have           α 0 = −1.69,α1 = 2.81, hit = 63        giving us


                                                          18
        As we would expect, countries with better governance tend to have higher steady-

state levels of TFP, while those in the tropics have lower TFP. An F-test of the joint

significance of the governance and tropics variables in each of the specifications in Table

2 shows these to be significant at the 5% level, allowing us to reject the assumption

underlying Table 1, that steady state TFP is constant across countries. The speed of TFP

convergence is again around 2 to 2.5 percent a year.

        While our results generally agree with those found in microeconomic –studies, our

parameter estimates are not well determined. For example, in column 3 of table 2 even

the coefficient on physical capital is not statistically significant. A central problem in

macroeconomic studies is a lack of degrees of freedom. In addition, aggregate data

exhibit a great deal of multicollinearity; capital intensity, education level, and health

status all tend to move together. Average experience and average experience squared are

highly correlated, while average experience is highly negatively correlated with average

schooling (extra years of education mean less average work experience).

        Determining the rates of return to inputs from macroeconomic data with any

precision is likely to be difficult. This suggests that so long as the aggregate data do not

suggest the presence of large externalities, calibrating macroeconomic models using

estimates of private returns from microeconomic studies is useful.

Our model accounts for economic growth by the growth of factor inputs, technological

innovation, and technological diffusion. Our main result, consistent with our theoretical

argument and with the microeconomic evidence, is that health has a positive and

statistically significant effect on economic growth. It suggests that a one-year

improvement in a population's life expectancy contributes to an increase of 4 percent in

output. This is a relatively large effect, indicating that increased expenditures on

improving health might be justified purely on the grounds of their impact on labor

productivity.

         We find no evidence that the macroeconomic effects of education and experience

are any greater than those found in microeconomic studies. This suggests the absence of

externalities at the aggregate level and that calibration studies provide reasonable pictures

of the proximate sources of economic growth. Accounting for economic growth is only

the first stage of an explanation. Once we have established the importance of physical and

human capital we need to go behind these variables to ask what determines cross-country

differences in factor accumulation. For example, our estimates of the effect of life

expectancy capture only its direct effect on labor productivity. In a fully specified model,

life expectancy may influence life cycle savings (Lee, Mason and Miller 2000) and capital

accumulation, and the expected returns to and investment in education (Bils and Klenow

(2000)). Thus improvements in health may increase output not only through labor

productivity, but also through the accumulation of capital. A fully specified model of

economic growth would be multidimensional, showing not only how inputs and
