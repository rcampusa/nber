                                            ABSTRACT

This paper examines the impact of residential foreclosures and vacancies on violent and property crime.
To overcome confounding factors, a difference-in-difference research design is applied to a unique
data set containing geocoded foreclosure and crime data from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Results indicate
that while foreclosure alone has no effect on crime, violent crime rates increase by roughly 19% once
the foreclosed home becomes vacant – an effect that increases with length of vacancy. We find weak
evidence suggesting a potential vacancy effect for property crime that is much lower in magnitude.

I. Introduction

There are many social problems arising from foreclosure. At the household level, families
undergoing foreclosure can lose accumulated home equity and access to future stable housing; on the
social level, foreclosure can have implications for surrounding neighborhoods and larger
communities. One potential impact of increased foreclosures in a community is crime. A recent and
growing literature has documented the existence of a connection between foreclosures and crime.
However, little work has been done to establish the mechanism and persistence of these effects.
Working with a unique dataset from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania which utilizes both county deed
records and utility shut-off dates to identify vacancy periods, in this paper we document that
foreclosure per se has little impact on crime. Instead, we find that it is foreclosure driven vacancies
that lead to increased crime in the immediate neighborhood of foreclosures – these increases are on
the order of 19% when comparing outcomes in a 250 foot buffer of the foreclosed home to those in
the area between 250 and 353 feet away. The crime effect appears to peak and then level off at
between 12 and 18 months following the initial period of vacancy and then attenuates once the house
is re-occupied.

Sociologists have long theorized a link between neighborhood characteristics and the geographical
distribution of crime (the social disorganization theory). For example, Shaw et al. (1929) suggested
that high crime rates occur in areas that are characterized by physical deterioration. On a more
conceptual level, Faris (1948) stated that crime rates are reflections of the degree of disorganization
of the control mechanisms in a society. A modern version of these theories is Wilson and Kelling’s
(1982) broken windows theory, which posits that neighborhood-level disorder is a precursor to
serious crime. Skogan (1990) further categorized disorder as social or physical. Social disorder refers
to delinquent behavior, such as public drinking, and physical disorder refers to visual signs of
negligence, such as abandoned buildings. The idea being that disorder reduces a community’s
willingness to maintain social control and provide better opportunities for crime.




                                                   1
Relatedly, Skogan viewed foreclosed 2 and vacant buildings as a form of neighborhood physical
disorder. Neighborhood effects from foreclosure may start at the onset of the foreclosure process.
Once a homeowner realizes that she faces foreclosure, she may begin taking less care of her house.
Thus, while the property is still occupied, it may begin to show visible signs of disrepair. This lack of
upkeep may provide a signal to potential criminals that there is a lower level of surveillance in the
area and thus reduce the neighborhoods level of crime deterrence. Later in the process, if the property
becomes vacant, the lack of surveillance will become more apparent. Further, neglected vacant
buildings may offer criminals and/or squatters places to gather and conduct their activities. In sum,
this literature suggests that both foreclosure and vacancy may be positively associated with crime
rates, with vacancy possibly having a stronger impact.

While a number of recent studies by criminologists, economists and ubanists have explored the link
between foreclosures and crime, less work has been done to explain the process through which
foreclosure leads to crime. Using Chicago area foreclosure and crime data for the year 2001,
Immergluck and Smith find that a 1 percent increase in the foreclosure rate leads to a 2.3 percent
increase in violent the crime rate for a given Census Tract. However, given that this work is done
using a single cross-section of Census tract-level data the authors cannot speak to the issue of
causation vs. correlation. Using county-level longitudinal data, Goodstein and Lee (2010) conclude
that foreclosure increases burglary and some other property crime. While this study overcomes the
cross-sectional limitations of the work by Immergluck and Smith, the aggregation of their data to
such a large geographic scope greatly hinders the insight that can be gained on neighborhood
processes. Katz et al. (2011) undertake a block level analysis on data from Glendale, Arizona and
find highly significant effects of foreclosure on violent and property crimes, but not on criminal
homicide or robberies – as with Immergluck and Smith, the direction of causality in their study is
unclear.

Two papers have dealt more directly with the issue of vacancy. Spelman (1993) analyzed field data
on building conditions within one neighborhood and found that blocks with vacant properties have
higher crime rates compared to blocks with fully-occupied buildings. Finally, in research undertaken
concurrent to our analysis, Ellen et al. (2013) evaluate the impact of foreclosures on crime rates in


2
  Because there are multiple stages in the foreclosure process, there is no consensus on the exact definition of foreclosure in the
literature. For the rest of this paper, we use the terms “foreclosure” and “foreclosure filing” interchangeably to refer to an earlier
stage in the foreclosure process, when a lis pendens has been filed. We aware of the fact that some of the papers we cite here may
define foreclosure as a later stage in which a property is sold at sheriff sale.


                                                                  2
New York City. Their paper stands out in the extant literature for having an empirical strategy
which identifies a causal link between foreclosures and crime. They use a difference-in-differences
approach which evaluates the crime impact of foreclosures on a given faceblock – while controlling
for faceblock fixed effects as well as neighborhood (Census Tract or Police Precinct) specific trends
(quarter X neighborhood fixed effects).    Ellen et al. test three different measures of foreclosure
activity: the number of houses entering foreclosure in the previous 18 months; the number of
currently active foreclosures; and, the number of properties that have reverted to lender ownership or
REO status (a proxy for vacancy). They find crime effects of the largest magnitude when using
REO status as their foreclosure metric. This result holds under the inclusion of Police Precinct
specific trends. However, while the statistical significance of their first two foreclosure measures are
robust (at the 10% level) to the inclusion of Census Tract-level neighborhood trends, the REO
measure loses its significance when these tighter neighborhood controls are used – there are 76
Police Precincts and 2,246 census tracts in New York City. Overall, Ellen et al. find that an
additional foreclosure leads to an increase in violent crimes on a given faceblock of between 1.4%
and 2.6%.

Our approach is most similar in spirit to that of Ellen et al., with two key differences. First, while
they succeed in identifying an overall effect of foreclosures on crime, we focus on understanding
better the process through which foreclosure leads to increased crime – with special attention paid to
identifying both the impact of foreclosure duration and vacancy on crime levels. Second, we take a
different approach to geography, utilizing a much more restrictive notion of neighborhood when
constructing our treatment and control neighborhoods. This approach allows us to evaluate each
foreclosure as its own unique treatment. Specifically, we define treated neighborhoods as a 250 foot
buffer surrounding each foreclosed house and define control neighborhoods an equal area donut
surrounding this buffer (250 feet – 353 feet). As a result, our definition of neighborhood is much
smaller than that of Ellen et al. (10.4% of the size of the average New York Census Tract and 0.4%
of the size of the average New York Police District). Our experience working with data for
Pittsburgh suggests that when larger neighborhood definitions are used that control and treatment
neighborhood characteristics (housing and demographics) become significantly different from one
another.

Our empirical analysis suggests 4 key findings: 1) the foreclosure process can lead to significant
increases in violent crime rates – we estimate that, within 250 feet of a foreclosed home, the


                                                    3
foreclosure process leads to a roughly 19 % increase in the number of reported crimes per year (an
increase of .13 crimes per year within the 250 foot circle relative to a base rate of .67 crimes per
year); 2) these increases in crime are driven not by foreclosure per se, but instead by the vacancies
that are associated with the foreclosure process; 3) the impact of vacancy on crime increases as the
property stays vacant for longer periods of time, likely plateauing at between 12 and 18 months; and,
4) once a house is reoccupied the crime impacts of the previous vacancy are attenuated.

The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows, section II presents background information on the
current foreclosure crisis and the foreclosure process in our study area, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In
section III, we describe the data used in this study; describe the empirical methodology and present
graphical evidence on the impact of foreclosure and vacancy. Empirical results are presented in
section IV and we provide a brief conclude in section V.




II. Background

Starting in 2006, the United States began a period of significantly increased home mortgage
foreclosures. As of the third quarter of 2009 (roughly the end of our study period), residential
mortgage delinquency rates, as reported by the Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA), stood at a
seasonally adjusted 9.64 percent – higher than any previously reported level since the MBA began
tracking foreclosures in 1972.

Our research considers the impact of foreclosure and vacancy in the context of Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania. In Pennsylvania all foreclosures are carried out through the court system and a lender
must follow a state-level judicial process in order to foreclose on a property. The process begins
when the borrower fails to make payments for at least 60 days. At that time, the lender can initiate
the foreclosure process by sending a Notice of Intent to Foreclose. If the borrower pays all dues and
fees within 30 days, the default is “cured.” However, if the borrower is either unable or unwilling to
resolve the debt, the entire balance of the mortgage becomes due immediately. The lender can then
file a suit to obtain a court order to foreclose on the property (foreclosure). Sometimes the borrower
resolves with the lender or successfully sells the property to another permanent owner before the
sheriff sales date and the property does not become vacant. Otherwise the lender can choose to sell
the property at sheriff sale, setting the opening bid for at least the outstanding loan amount. Typically
under this process the property is not sold and will return to the lender (Had there been any potential

                                                    4
buyer for the property at a price equal to the outstanding loan amount, the owner could have sold it
earlier), most of the time a bank or a mortgage company. The borrower is evicted after the sheriff
sale. The foreclosed property is then classified as a real estate owned (REO) property and stays
vacant until it is sold to a new permanent owner.

As described above, a typical foreclosure case consists of multiple stages: foreclosure filing, sheriff
sale, and sale to a new permanent owner (REO sale). However, some foreclosures are resolved
between the borrower and the lender and never reach the point of a sheriff sale. Figure 1 provides an
illustration of the two most common outcomes following a foreclosure filing. In our data, 57% of the
foreclosure filings result in property sale to another permanent owner before sheriff sale while 43%
experience a period of vacancy until they are finally resold.

To facilitate identification of the impact of foreclosure per se as opposed to foreclosure-led vacancy,
we divide the foreclosure process into four stages: pre-foreclosure, foreclosure (running from initial
foreclosure filing date through either vacancy or direct sale by the borrower), vacancy (running from
initial vacancy to the REO sale date), and reoccupation which begins at the REO sale date. Due to the
judicial nature of foreclosure in Pittsburgh, the whole process typically takes one to two years to
complete. As shown in Figure 1, the median length of foreclosure stage is 240 days for those without
sheriff auction, and 262 days for those experiencing vacancy. The median length of vacancy is 231
days.

Although foreclosure activity reached record highs in the third quarter of 2009, Pennsylvania was not
hit as hard as many other regions. The foreclosure rate was 2.58 foreclosures per 1000 households for

while the national average was 7.35 foreclosures per 1000 households, a 22.50% increase from the
third quarter of 2008.




III. Data & Empirical Strategy

Our analysis is based primarily on the aggregation of four distinct sources of data. The sources of
these data are as follows:

Crime: Crime data is obtained from the Police Department of the City of Pittsburgh. This data
includes type of crime and the exact time and street address of each reported crime incident from
2005 to 2009. These records we geocoded with more than 99% success using high quality GIS parcel
maps produced by the Allegheny County Assessor’s Office.

Foreclosure filings: The foreclosure filing data are obtained from City of Pittsburgh court records.
This file contains information on every foreclosure filing in the city from 2006 to November 2009,
such as the date of filing, the parcel ID of the property receiving foreclosure filing, borrower and
lender names, and the current stage of filing. Settled and discontinued cases are deleted from the
sample. The locations of these foreclosures were geocoded using the same approach as for the crime
data and with similar success rates (in excess of 99%). Note that only residential3 properties are
included in this analysis.

Housing transactions: The property transaction data come from Allegheny County Recorder of
Deeds Office, which contains sale date, price, parcel ID and buyer and seller names for every
property transaction since 1986. Foreclosure filings are linked to all subsequent property transactions
by parcel ID to determine the periods of vacancy and reoccupation.

Housing and neighborhood characteristics: The housing characteristics data are obtained from
Allegheny County’s Office of Property Assessments. Most of the information is taken from the last
county-wide reassessment in 2002. These assessment data contain housing conditions such as square
feet, number of bedroom and year structure was built for every property in the city. Data on
neighborhood characteristics come from two sources. Selected block-level demographic

  A property is defined as residential if its structure type falls into one of the following categories: single family, two to four
family, row house and townhouse.

                                                                   6
characteristics (such as race and age) are taken from the 2000 Census of Population and Housing.
Information only available at more aggregate levels (such as education and income) is not included
due to the lack of geographic precision. Pre-existing (2005) crime counts come from the crime data
described above.

Attaching crime and vacancy data to our foreclosure sample raises some issues. We begin with the
crime data. As a participant in the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program, Pittsburgh’s police
department follows UCR’s guideline of classifying and reporting offenses. All offenses are first
classified into 26 categories in a particular order, with homicide being the highest in the hierarchy. In
case of a multiple-offense situation, the police department will record only one offense that is the
highest on the hierarchy list and not the other offense(s) involved. For example, one crime incident
described as both robbery and homicide will appear as homicide but not robbery.

Table 1 provides a description of the 26 crime categories and percentages of each type of offense
recorded in the data. Note that violent crimes are coded in highest hierarchical order, followed by
property crimes. As a result the coding rule will not change the total number of violent crimes but all
other crimes will be under-reported. The degree of under-reporting increases while moving down the
hierarchy list.

                                                   7
Due to this coding rule, we focus our analysis on violent and property crimes, as they have higher
priorities to be coded, and thus provide a more accurate measure of the actual reported number of
crime incidents.



Figure 2: Spatial Distribution of Crimes and Foreclosures




Percentages are calculated from all crimes in the City of Pittsburgh in 2006.




To give a sense of the spatial distribution of both crime and foreclosures, Figures 2 presents the
spatial distribution of both Crime and Foreclosures in Allegheny County during our study period
(2006 - 2009).

Turning to vacancies, distinguishing the impact of vacancy requires us to identify the period of
vacancy for each foreclosed property. In most cases, a foreclosed property is seized by the lender at
the sheriff sale, and it becomes vacant immediately thereafter. The property then stays vacant until it
is resold to a new permanent owner (REO sale). As a result, the REO status can typically define most
foreclosed properties’ vacancy periods.



                                                                     8
The REO status is identified by two dates: the sheriff sale date and a subsequent REO sale date.
Linking foreclosure filings to home sale data enables us to track the complete transaction history of
each foreclosed property. In addition, all sheriff sales in the deed record are categorized as “sheriff
deed” rather than “deed”, which serves as a clear identifier. Therefore, a sheriff sale date is assigned
to a foreclosure if on that date the property is recorded on a sheriff deed with the seller listed as the
borrower who failed to sell the house prior to the sheriff sale. An REO sale date is thus defined as a
subsequent transaction date when the REO property, under the name of a bank or mortgage company,
is finally sold to a new permanent owner.

An issue arises because occasionally the REO status does not coincide with the period of vacancy,
for instance, when the borrower abandons the property before the sheriff sale date. To address this
issue we use data on gas shutoff dates to assist in the identification of vacant foreclosed properties.
This data was obtained from the 3 major gas companies that provide service to virtually every
property in the City of Pittsburgh. This data contains a list of addresses with no gas usage as of a
specific day every December from 2006 to 2009.

Combining information on REO and gas shut off status, we begin by defining the starting point of
vacancy as the date a foreclosed property is sold to a bank/mortgage company (sheriff sale), and the
ending point of vacancy as the date of the next transaction, when the property is resold to a new
permanent owner (REO sale). If the property has an REO period and the gas shutoff month occurred
prior to the sheriff sale date, we assign the December 31st of the gas shut off year as the starting date
of vacancy. Among the 3,282 properties foreclosed between 2006 and 2009 in Pittsburgh, 1,403
experienced vacancy. Among those, the vacancy periods of 1,213 (86%) properties are solely defined
by REO status.

Nevertheless, it is likely that the method described above can only generate close approximations of
the actual vacancy periods. As a result, some of the foreclosed properties may be classified as vacant
when they are in fact occupied, or vice versa. To the extent that this occurs it will lead to a bias in
our estimates of the differences in crime rates between vacancy and non-vacancy periods. If there is
no correlation between this measurement error and other variables in the model then the bias
imparted by this measurement error will attenuate our estimates.4

    Our results are robust to the exclusion of properties that experienced a vacancy prior to the sheriff’s sale.

                                                                     9
Figure 3: Foreclosures in 2006 vs. Crime in 2005




                      10
We now turn to our identification strategy. As has been well-documented, 5 foreclosures tend to
cluster in lower-income neighborhoods with higher portions of minority residents and subprime
mortgages. Thus, the correlation between foreclosure locations and both observable and
unobservable neighborhood characteristics makes it difficult to identify the effect of foreclosure and
vacancy on crime rates by simply comparing areas with and without foreclosed houses. If the
locations of foreclosures correlate with some unobservable neighborhood characteristics that affect
crime rates, cross-sectional analysis will yield biased estimates. Further, cross-sectional analysis
cannot rule out the possibility that the observed foreclosures are the result of crime rather than the
cause.

To further illustrate the general problem, figure 3 presents the location of all 2006 foreclosures in our
dataset overlaid on 2005 crime density.               The figure demonstrates that, while there is a reasonable
amount of independent variation, there is a marked spatial correlation between crime and
foreclosures at the macro level. If we aggregate crimes and foreclosures over a relatively large
spatial scale (for instance at the ward or track level) and then regress 2006 foreclosure rates on 2005
crime levels, because of this correlation, we get a significant and positive coefficient suggesting that
crimes cause foreclosure. This is the major challenge for our identification strategy. As we discuss
in the results section below, tests for reverse causality suggest that by focusing our analysis on a very
small spatial scale that we are able to overcome this problem.

While previous studies consider crime data that has been aggregated to the county, police district,
census tract or block level, our data provides the specific locations and dates of all reported crimes in
the city of Pittsburgh. This data allows us to compare crime rates within small proximate areas in
which neighborhood characteristics are more homogenous than in the aggregate comparisons of the
existing literature.

The mechanisms discussed above for relating foreclosure and crime would generally be associated
with a continuously decreasing relationship between crime and distance to the foreclosure site.
Ideally, our analysis would identify a clearly delineated boundary between treatment and control –
the exact point at which the effect goes to zero. However, our definition of treatment area will likely
be either too narrow or two broad.

Figure 4 highlights the implications of such mistakes. If we make our treatment neighborhoods too
small, a portion of each control neighborhood will actually be treated. Conversely, if the treatment
neighborhood is too large, a portion of each treatment area will actually be untreated. In both cases,
misaligned treatment-control boundaries will lead to systematic under-estimates of the mean
difference in crime counts between true treatment and control areas. Thus we expect any such errors
to lead to attenuation bias in our estimates of the effect of foreclosure and vacancy on crime.

We proceed by defining as treatment areas a set of circles, one centered on each foreclosure in our
dataset. We define as controls a set of rings that circumscribes each treatment circle. To facilitate
direct comparisons of crime counts between treatment and control areas, control areas are defined so
as to be identical in area to treatment areas, as illustrated in Figure 5.6 For a given foreclosure, the
treatment area is defined as the region within 250 feet of the foreclosed property (an area roughly
consistent with that of a large single city block). The control area is then defined as the surrounding
ring lying between 250 feet and 353.6 feet of the foreclosed property (these ring dimensions ensures
that treatment and control regions are of the same size). In choosing treatment and control areas,

 We evaluate the use of different control and treatment areas as part of the sensitivity analysis contained in the
empirical results section below.

Note: The dot marks the center of the foreclosed parcel. Blank areas between blocks of parcels are streets. The radius of the inner ring is
250 feet and the radius of the outer ring is 353.6 feet. Treatment area is inside the inner ring while control area is between the two rings.

ideally the researcher would have knowledge of the true path of spatial decay and locate the
treatment-control boundary precisely where treatment effects end (or possibly at a distance where
there exists a steep decline in treatment effects). Given our limited knowledge of the true spatial
decay process, instead the choice is driven by statistical issues. As the size of the treatment area
grows larger, differences between the treatment and control areas in terms of demographics and
housing stock grow -- undermining the assumption of “all else equal” between the two regions.
Conversely, as treatment and control areas get smaller fewer and fewer crimes are observed in these
areas, leading to much noisier estimates of the treatment and control area crime rates. The choice of
treatment region was chosen to balance these two concerns.

To test how well our approach identifies similar treatment and control areas, Table 2 presents
summary statistics on the characteristics of houses inside the treatment and control rings, as well as
demographics from the 2000 Census and crime rates for 2005 (prior to our study period). Statistics
are computed separately for treatment (Column 1) and control regions (Column 2). As a diagnostic,
Column 3 reports the coefficients and standard errors from a series of regressions for each of these
variables on a treatment indicator. These summary statistics suggest that our design succeeds in
identifying treatment and control neighborhoods that are similar in terms of observable
characteristics. All of the coefficients in Column 3 are statistically insignificant, with the exception
of days since last sale. However, considering the mean difference in days since last sale is 55 days
compared with a base level of 5,583 days this difference doesn’t suggest a need for concern.

Our empirical analysis requires attaching crime data to each treatment and control region. Given that
treatment and control are of identical area and on average have essentially the same number of
houses (see table 2), it is appropriate to directly compare crime counts between treatment and control
areas. To build the panel data set that facilitates this study’s difference-in-differences approach, it is
necessary to aggregate crime totals for fixed time periods for each location. To this end, for each
foreclosed property, quarterly crime counts in the treatment and control areas for different quarters
are aggregated and attached to individual foreclosures according to the specific timing of foreclosure
filing and vacancy7. As a result our unit of measure is the number of violent or property crimes in a
treatment or control area in one calendar quarter.

As noted above, a foreclosed property can experience as many as four stages: pre-foreclosure,
foreclosure, vacancy and reoccupation. We define the pre-foreclosure period as the 6 quarters before
the calendar quarter a property receives a foreclosure filing. Foreclosure period is defined as the
foreclosure filing quarter plus up to 8 subsequence quarters, excluding all quarters following either
sale or the presale vacancy of the property (see below). The vacancy period is defined to run up to
eight 8 quarters following the quarter of initial vacancy and is truncated by re-occupation. The
reoccupation period covers the 4 quarters immediately following re-occupation. 8                                         Table 3
summarizes quarterly crime rates for our treatment and control areas by foreclosure/vacancy status.

  For example, crimes surrounding property i in the fourth quarter of 2006 are identified as “a quarter before foreclosure” if
property i receives a foreclosure filing in the first quarter of 2007.
8
  The use of longer lags is constrained by the time period covered in our data.

                                                                15
We begin with a graphical analysis of the data. Figure 6 shows violent and property crime trends for
both treatment and control areas, controlling for quarter-year fixed effects. The average number of
violent crimes in treated areas during foreclosure quarters appears to remain largely unchanged from
the pre-foreclosure quarter’s baseline. Violent crime rates then increase during the quarters of
vacancy and largely drops to the pre-foreclosure level after the foreclosed properties are reoccupied.
These trends suggest that vacancy increases violent crime but foreclosure alone does not have a
strong effect. The fact that crime rates appear to drop after re-occupancy strengthens this
interpretation. The pattern appears to be similar for property crime rates, though with more noise.

While the treated community data is suggestive, to evaluate the possibility that changes in both crime
and treatment status are being driven by some unobserved confounding factor, it is important to
compare the trends in treatment areas to those in the adjacent control areas.

Thus, Figure 6 provides a visual presentation of our complete identification strategy. Consistent with
the notion of a continuous and decreasing spatial effect of vacancy on crime, it appears that the
control areas also may experience some increase in crime rates during vacancy quarters, but at a
much smaller scale than do the treatment areas. Again, there is no evidence that foreclosure per se
leads to increased crime.

IV. Empirical Results

The specification for our empirical analysis is presented in equation (1) below. Our definition of
treatment and control areas effectively reduces the study area to regions within 353 feet of a
foreclosed and/or vacant property and includes observations only for those quarters that we identify
as either pre-foreclosure, foreclosure, vacancy or re-occupation. The specification incorporates 3

250 feet of the foreclosure sites) with each of these 3 indicators (note: pre-foreclosure then becomes
the omitted category). Thus, the counterfactual change in crime rates in areas immediately
surrounding foreclosure sites is estimated using crimes in areas just slightly farther away in the same
periods. We also include neighborhood-quarter fixed effects (controlling for presence in one of 86
neighborhoods) as well as housing characteristics for the treatment and control areas. Finally, to
flexibly control for the potential impact of additional foreclosures that occur in treatment and/or
control regions during the study period, we include a vector of indicator variables for the presence of
1, 2, 3, or more than 3 foreclosures in the relevant region (control of treatment). Thus, the estimating
equation is as follows:

(1)


where,                       the number of violent or property crimes in control or treatment areas
surrounding foreclosed property i in quarter t.                       equals 1 if in quarter t property i received a
foreclosure filing in a previous quarter but is still occupied;                    equals 1 if in quarter t property i is
vacant as a result of foreclosure;                   equals 1 if property i is reoccupied in quarter t. Parameters
of interest are           and      .The estimated impact of foreclosure is given by                  , while the impact of
foreclosure-led vacancy and the impact of reoccupation are given by                       and       respectively.

Table 4 presents the coefficients of interest from the estimation of equation (1). The dependent
variable in columns (1) through (3) is a quarterly count of violent crimes. Housing characteristic
controls include all average housing characteristics reported in Table 2 9 . In the first row, the
coefficient on treatmentXforeclosure is small and insignificant; suggesting that foreclosure alone
does not impact violent crime rates in treatment areas relative to control areas. Conversely, we find
that during the time a foreclosed property stays vacant, the treatment areas have significantly more
violent crimes than do the control areas. Comparing Column (1), (2) and (3), we find that adding
housing controls and controls for the presence of other foreclosures, has little impact on our
coefficient estimates – providing additional evidence as to the similarity of our treatment and control
areas. In terms of scale, given that the average number of violent crimes within 250 feet of a
foreclosed property each quarter is 0.170, the coefficient of 0.0315 in column (3) translates into an
increase of roughly 19%. Table 4 also presents additional coefficients from the estimation of

 Including both housing and Census 2000 demographic controls in equation (1) does not change our results. We omit results
with Census controls in Table IV because block level data cannot be precisely measured in our highly localized study areas.

equation (1): the effect of being treated and being in foreclosure, vacancy or reoccupation period.
The coefficient on being treated is essentially 0 for violent crime. The effect of being in foreclosure
period is insignificant after controlling for housing characteristics, and the effect of being in vacancy
period is close to 0. Following re-occupation the point estimate of the differential between treated
and un-treated areas in our most robust specification drops by 28 percent (from .0315 to .0224) and
loses its significance.

We now turn to the results on property crimes presented in Column (4) through (6). The graphical
evidence suggested a relationship between property crime and foreclosure driven vacancy – albeit a
noisy one. The statistical analysis yields consistently positive but statistically insignificant
coefficients (p-value         .3). Given an average of .538 property crimes per quarter in our treatment
rings, the point estimate of .0263 on treatmentXvacancy represents roughly a 5% increase in property
crime.

While these findings differ from those of Ellen et al. (2013) in retrospect they are not that surprising;
for three reasons. First, the hierarchical nature of crime reporting in our data may be masking a
property crime impact due to the fact that whenever both a property crime and violent crime occur
simultaneously the incident is reported as a violent crime and not as a property crime. Given our
empirical approach, this masking of property crimes will attenuate the estimated effect.10 Second, and
perhaps more importantly, if the uptick in violent crime is being driven by the attraction of drug
dealers and/or squatters to the vacant properties, it may be reasonable to expect that interactions
among these individuals and between these individuals and others are the source of the uptick in
violent crime. Spatially, the frequency of such interactions will be concentrated in very immediate
proximity to the foreclosed house and will drop of quickly with distance from the vacant house.
Conversely, if the presence of these individuals is also associated with an increase in property crimes
the spatial process will likely be more diffuse – and thus more difficult to identify. Consider for
example a squatter living in a vacant house who chooses to participate in either a burglary or motor
vehicle theft. It is possible, and perhaps likely, that their target area for such activities would go well
beyond the 250 foot buffer used in our analysis and would diffuse across the entire neighborhood. In
such a case, identification of this effect will not be possible in our analysis – and will in general be
quite difficult to identify cleanly. Finally, to the extent that either squatters or drug dealers who have


10
  One potential approach to this attenuation problem would be to estimate the effect of treatment relative to control areas. For
this approach to be appropriate, we would need to know that the reporting bias for property crimes is identical in treatment and
control areas. Unfortunately, our data doesn’t allow us to assess this possibility.

                                                               19
taken up residence in the vacant property are themselves the victim of crimes, it is possible that such
individuals would be less likely to report a property crime than a violent crime. Especially given that
in the case of a violent crime, reports are likely to be generated through the victim’s interaction with
first responders and/or their access to medical care.

Specification Tests and Sensitivity Analysis

To further evaluate the robustness of our findings, we consider a number of specification tests and
sensitivity analyses. Our Difference in Differences approach combines two strategies for dealing
addressing unobserved confounds.           First, by utilizing pairs of small-scale spatially proximate
treatment and control regions, we attempt to control for spatial correlation in crimes and foreclosures
that may be driven by other spatially co-varying factors. For instance, a casual review of figure 3
suggests the potential for reverse causality – foreclosures in the current year appear to be related to
crime rates in the previous year. To evaluate the ability of the cross-sectional component of our
empirical strategy to overcome these spatial correlations, we randomly choose 2,000 locations in the
county and then place pairs of treatment circles and control rings in these locations (replicating the
basic empirical strategy described above). We then compute, by year, the number of violent crimes
(2005 – 2008) and foreclosures (2006-2009) that occur in each of these control and treatment rings.
Using this data, table 5 presents the results of a simple regression of foreclosures/vacancies in year t
on the number of crimes in year t-1. Columns (1) and (3) present regressions which don’t utilize

the treatment/control structure of the constructed data.               Given the spatial correlations that are
apparent in Figure 3, it’s not surprising that this analysis yields highly significant positive
coefficients on the previous year’s crime level. However, once we incorporate fixed effects for each

of treatment/control pairs (columns (2) and (4)).               This relationship completely disappears.
Suggesting that our treatment/control approach effectively controls for confounds in this setting and
that reverse causality is not a concern for our analysis.

               FIGURE 7 - COMPARING FORECLOSURE RATES IN TREATMENT AND CONTROL REGIONS




The second component of the D-in-D strategy leverages variation over time. A possible concern on
this dimension is that there could be systematic differences in the time path of foreclosure levels in
our control vs. our treatment rings. Figure 7 presents monthly data on the foreclosure rates in control
vs. treatment regions for our 4 year study period.11 There is a small difference in overall foreclosure
rates, with treatment regions experiencing, on average, .008 extra foreclosures per month. However,
there is no difference in the trends across the two types of regions – they track perfectly.              These
identical trends lend support to a causal interpretation of our Difference in Difference results.

A further concern is our choice of the scale of our treatment and control areas. The difference-in-
differences approach taken here will be void of confounding observed neighborhood effects (static or


11
   By construction, the treatment rings have one more foreclosure than do the treatment rings (each treatment
ring is constructed with an observed foreclosure at its center). We don’t include that foreclosure in the
construction of the graph. Thus, we are presenting data on additional foreclosures.

                                                       21
dynamic) as long as there aren’t systematic and heterogeneous changes occurring in these effects
within a spatial scale less than the 353 foot radius circles that encompass our treatment and control
areas. The price of this strong identification strategy relative to confounds is that estimated treatment
effects may be biased downward if the areas we identify as controls are actually subject to treatment
(or vice versa). This problem of potentially treated controls can be reduced by defining significantly
larger control areas - for instance the Police District level controls used by Ellen et al. (2013). This
of course requires the stronger assumption that the immediate neighborhoods surrounding
foreclosures (i.e. our 250 foot circle or Ellen et al.’s faceblocks) aren’t changing in ways that are
significantly different from the now much larger neighborhood. We can also overcome this potential
problem by increasing the size of the treatment area, with the potential downside of including
untreated locations in the treatment area. To evaluate these issues, Table 6 replicates our most robust
specification, varying the size of the treatment and/or control rings.

One minor complication associated with varying the area of treatment and control areas is the fact
that we now need to re-scale our crime counts by the area of the treatment and control rings. Thus, in
Table 6 we report results in terms of crimes per acre. As a reference, in our baseline specification,
treatment and control areas are each 4.505 acres in size. Thus, our estimated coefficient of .0315
extra counts per quarter translates to a quarterly increase of .0070 additional violent crimes per acre
each quarter.

The First Two columns of Table 6 hold the size of the treatment area constant and expand the size of
the control area (500 feet and 1000 feet). For violent crime, under these two models, our point
estimates for the effect of vacancy shrink slightly, but remain significant at above the 5% level. For
property crime, solely increasing the size of the control area has no meaningful impact on our results.
We also note that offsetting potential treatment spillovers with larger control areas comes at the cost
of increased heterogeneity between our treatment and control areas. For both violent crime and
property crime, as we increase the area of the control areas, the baseline differences in crime rates
between treatment and control areas increases substantially.

The final column of Table 6 presents results using much larger treatment and control regions (500
feet and 1000 feet). For violent crime, this change reduces the estimated magnitude of the vacancy
effect. While not significantly different from the baseline results, this reduction in magnitude is
suggests that the effective treatment area is smaller than 500 feet. Turning to violent crime, we now
get an estimated positive effect that is significant at the 10% level.                 The coefficient estimate
of .00453 translates to a 3.5% increase in property crime rates (relative to a baseline of .130 property
crimes per acre each quarter). This estimated 3.5% increase is smaller, but of roughly similar
magnitude, to the insignificant estimates presented in Table 4.

Finally, we consider the impact of different lengths of vacancy on violent crime rates. The motivation
here is twofold: first, to rule out the possibility that our main results are driven by compositional
effects; second, to better understand the role of vacancy length on crime rates. Given the generally
insignificant and small magnitudes associated with property crime effects, we only present results for
violent crimes. 12

The potential concern regarding composition effects derives from the fact that only half of the
foreclosed homes in our sample actually fall into vacancy. As a result compositional effects could
potentially create spurious correlation between vacancy and crime that are actually driven by
foreclosure. For example, if foreclosure leads directly to crime in cases that will eventually lead to
vacancy but has no effect in cases where vacancy never occurs, the estimated coefficient on vacancy
may be positive even if crime rates remained unchanged during the vacancy period.

A direct remedy is to separately estimate the effect of different stages of vacancy on subsamples of
foreclosed homes that stayed vacant for various lengths of time. If the impacts of different lengths of
vacancy remain positive and consistent across all subsamples, we can likely rule out the existence of
this type of compositional effect. To this end, we present estimation results for equation (1) based on
a group of subsamples, adding interaction terms for being in treatment areas and in different stages of
vacancy. 13 We restrict the sample to all homes that experience vacancy after foreclosure, thus
reducing the sample size by roughly half. The results are shown in Table 7. The coefficients are all of
the expected sign and generally become larger in magnitude as the length of vacancy increases,
indicating that longer-term vacancy has a stronger effect on violent crime rates. Moreover, the

12
   Property crime results in these models are consistent with the insignificant results for property crime presented
in Table 4.
13
   For the remaining analyses we return to the baseline treatment and control areas on which the results in Table 4
were estimated.

estimated coefficient for all interactions equal to or greater than 6 months of vacancy are statistically
significant. Note that the coefficient on foreclosure is again close to 0 and insignificant.

It is still possible that there exists selection in terms of the length of vacancy. To address this
potential, Table 8 reports estimates of equation (1) with subsamples of foreclosed homes
experiencing different lengths of vacancy. While almost all of the coefficient estimates on vacancy
are positive, most of them lose significance, likely due to the large reductions in sample sizes. For
areas surrounding houses vacant for more than 18 months, the coefficients on having been vacant for
longer terms are larger in magnitude and statistically significant, confirming the results in Table 7.
Finally, the coefficients on foreclosure are generally small and insignificant. Overall, these results are
consistent with estimates in Table 7 and confirm the absence of compositional effect in the main
estimation results presented earlier.

Finally, given that there is no evidence of compositional effect, we use the entire foreclosure sample
to generate more precise estimates of the way that vacancy length impacts violent crime. Results are
reported in Table 9. The estimates are similar to those presented in Table 8, but obtain more
statistical significance with the larger sample. The results indicate that presence of houses vacant for
longer than 6 months increases violent crime rates, with the impact increasing with duration of
vacancy and possibly plateauing somewhere between 12 and 18 months.

V. Conclusion

In this paper we use a difference-in-differences research design with tightly constrained control
locations to measure the impact of residential foreclosures and vacancies on violent and property
crime. Using detailed data on addresses and dates of foreclosures and crime, we estimate that, on
average, violent crimes within 250 feet of foreclosed homes increases by roughly 19% once the
foreclosed home becomes vacant, compared to crimes in areas between 250 and 353 feet away.
Foreclosure alone is found to have no effect on violent crime. We find weak evidence of a causal
link between foreclosure driven vacancies and property crime – on the order of 3.5% - 5%. As we
discuss above, these weak results on property crime may reflect limitations of the crime data that we
use and/or could reflect the existence of a very different spatial process for property crime (one that
would be very difficult to identify using our data).

Because we exploit the exact timing and location of foreclosure, vacancy and crime by comparing
crime rates in geographically small and homogenous areas at different stages of foreclosure, these
results provide a significant improvement upon the existing literature that attempts to identify the
impact of foreclosure and vacancy on crime with cross-sectional design or analysis at aggregate
levels that are subject to considerable concerns regarding omitted variable bias. Our analysis
provides the first clear evidence of the potential primacy of vacancy over foreclosure per se in
leading to increases in neighborhood crime. In addition, it provides the first evidence on the impact
of vacancy length on crime and concludes that longer terms of vacancy have a stronger effect on
violent crime compared to shorter-terms of vacancy. One important caveat is that, while we have
documented local increases in crime rates associated with foreclosure driven vacancy, our analysis
can’t speak to the impact of foreclosures and/or vacancies on net crime in a city.

As a policy matter, while the majority of current federal and state level foreclosure programs are
focusing on loan modification, these results strongly suggest that policies aiming at post-foreclosure
vacancy reduction may also warrant attention.
