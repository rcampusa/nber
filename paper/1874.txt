         The October 1979 Change in the Monetary Exchange Regime:
          Its Impact on the "Forecastab-ility" of Interest Rates



                                   ABSTRACT



      Subsequent to the October 1979 shift in monetary policy in the United

States, interest rates in North America not only reached unprecedented levels,

but also exhibited unprecedented volatility. This paper shows that the

anticipated quarterly changes in long—term rates associated with the rational

expectations model have remained small during this post—shift period.

Recorded forecasts of long—term interest rates in Canada continue to prove

inferior to the no—change prediction of the martingale model. The "perverse"

relationship between the slope of the yield curve and the subsequent movement

in long—term rates exists in the Canadian data, but is of only modest value in

a forecasting context. The excess return on long—term bonds implicit in the

recorded forecasts of the level of interest rates varies sharply, yet there is

no evidence that forecasters have identified a predictable component of a

time—varying term premium.

I.     Introduction


       In October 1979, the Federal Reserve implemented a new policy of

targeting monetary aggregates rather than interest rates. Subsequent to this

apparent change in the conduct of monetary policy, interest rates in the

United States not only reached unprecedented levels, but also exhibited

unprecedented volatility.1 Reflecting the close linkages between the U.S. and

the Canadian capital markets, interest rates in Canada exhibited similar

behavi or.2

      One element of the October 1979 change in the monetary regime that is as

yet unexplored is its impact on the forecastability" of interest rates. Two

theoretical points are now well known. First, Sargent (1976) and Pesando

(1978) have shown that under the joint hypothesis of market efficiency and a

time—invariant term premium, short—term movements in long—term interest rates

will be inherently unon_forecastable,fl at least so long as the yield curve is

reasonably flat. Under this rational expectations model of the term

structure, agents without access to inside information will not be able to

improve upon the no—change prediction of the martingale model. Secondly, as

emphasized by Pesando (1979), there is nothing in the theory of efficient

markets to suggest that agents cannot outperform the no—change prediction in

their forecasts of short—term movements in short—term interest rates.

      The unprecedented levels and volatility of interest rates make timely an

investigation of two empirical questions. First, have the anticipated

quarterly changes in long—term interest rates remained sufficiently "small'

that the no—change prediction continues to characterize accurately the

rational expectations model? Secondly, have forecasters been able to

outperform the no—change prediction in this environment of volatile interest
                                      2


rates? If time—varying term premiums have become more important, as alleged

by many participants in the capital market, then short—term movements in long—

term interest rates may have a significant "forecastable" component, even if

the bond market is informationally efficient.

      Further, there is an "awkward fact" regarding the slope of the term

structure and the subsequent movement in long—term interest rates that merits

attention in the forecasting context. When the term structure has a positive

slope (that is, when the long—term rate exceeds the short—term rate), the

prediction of the rational expectations model is that the long—term rate will

subsequently rise. The anticipated capital loss is necessary to equalize the

holding—period return on short— and long—term bonds, up to the time—invariant

term premium. Yet, as Shiller (1979) has emphasized, on the basis of interest

rate data drawn from both the United States and the United Kingdom, the

empirical relationship appears to be the opposite. Under the null hypothesis

of market efficiency, the implication is that a time—varying term premium does

exist and is positively related to the slope of the yield curve. The

quantitative importance of this relationship, and the question of whether it

is reflected in recorded forecasts, merit attention.

      Due to the availability of recorded forecasts of both short—term and

long—term interest rates in Canada,3 it is useful to address these empirical

questions with Canadian data. This paper is thus organized as follows.

First, the post October 1979 data on interest rates in Canada are examined to

see if the anticipated quarterly changes in long—term interest rates under the

rational expectations model continue to be "small." Secondly, three sets of

recorded forecasts of short—term and long—term interest rates are evaluated,

using the no—change prediction of the martingale model as a benchmark. To

provide an additional perspective, the excess returns on long—term bonds that
                                          3



are implied by the recorded forecasts are also calculated. Thirdly, the

relationship between the future change in the long—term interest rate and the

current slope of the yield curve is explored, both before and after the

October 1979 shift in policy. The importance of any time—varying term premium

so identified is quantified, and used to provide a further perspective on the

evaluation of the recorded forecasts. A summary and statement of conclusions

completes the paper.



II.   Anticipated Changes in Long—term Interest Rates under the Rational
       Expectations Model


      Let               denote the expected return on an n—period bond held

during period t ,      let   rt denote the one—period interest rate at the

beginning of period t , and let               denote the marginal term premium —

assumed to be time—invariant — accorded an n—period bond if held for one

period. Then, in its most useful formulation for the present purpose,4 the

rational expectations model requires:



                =
                    r    +   (n)                                                   (1)




Implicit in (1) is the value of the long—term interest rate (now, an (n—i)—

period rate) expected to prevail at t+i.         This is the long—term rate which

produces the capital gain or loss necessary to satisfy (1).         The anticipated

change in the long—term interest rate is the difference between this expected

long—term rate and its current value.

      To calculate the anticipated change in the long—term rate, it is useful

to employ the linearized expression for the holding—period yield on long—term

bonds (H') derived by Shiller (1979):
                                                    4




        (n) —     —
                        t
                                -
                                 nt+l
                       _________________
                                        R'
        'it
                                -


where         =       (l   -   y1)/(l    -        and     =   1/(1 +   ), and   where R equals

the "normal" long—term interest rate around which the expression for the

holding—period yield is linearized. Equations (1) and (2) can be rearranged

to yield:



        E(R) = (l/Y)[R                         - (1 -
                                                        )(rt + (n))j                      (3)




The anticipated change in the long—term interest rate under the rational

expectations model is thus:



        E(R) -                      =   [(1   -               - (rt   +                   (4)


If one has data on an index of long—term interest rates (ideally, a constant

maturity index), one can comfortably ignore the change in the maturity of the

bond and simply refer to the left—hand—side of (4) as the anticipated change

in the long—term rate.

        Have the anticipated changes in the long—term interest rate under the

rational expectations model remained "small" subsequent to the October 1979

change in the policy regime? Since economists traditionally forecast

macroeconomic variables on a quarterly basis, and since recorded data on

quarterly interest rate forecasts are available, this is the unit of

observation adopted in the remainder of this paper. Data on 90—day Treasury

bills and long—term Government of Canada bonds, as well as data on 90—day

finance company paper and long—term corporate bonds, permit us to calculate
                                         5



the anticipated changes in the respective long—term rates. To implement

equation (4), we need: (i) to specify the terms to maturity of the respective

indexes of long—term interest rates; (ii) to estimate the marginal term

premium, and (iii) to choose the "normal" long—term rate around which to

linearize the expression for the holding—period yield.

      For both the Canada and the corporate bonds, the term to maturity is 17

years or 68 quarters (n =   68).6   As shown by McCulloch (1975), the marginal

term premium approaches the average term premium quite rapidly. The latter —

under the rational expectations model — is simply equal to the average spread

between the long—term and the corresponding short—term interest rate. During

the period 1979:4—1985:3, the spread between the long—term Canada rate and the

90—day bill rate averaged 46 basis points, and the spread between the

corporate bond rate and the paper rate averaged 107 basis points. These

figures are used to approximate the marginal term premium which appears in

equation (4). For the period 1957:1 to 1979:3, these term premiums were set

equal to the corresponding spreads of 131 and 133 basis points, respectively.

      The average value of the long—term rates rose sharply in the later

sample period, from 6.72% and 7.63% to 12.97% and 13.96% for the Canada and

corporate bonds, respectively. In light of these sharp increases, it is

inappropriate to linearize around the average value of the long—term rates

over the combined sample periods. Instead, we linearized around the average

values in each of the two subperiods. This raised the value of the term

enclosed in square brackets on the r.h.s. of (4) by about 50% in the later

sample period.7 Other things equal, this raises the anticipated changes in

long—term rates associated with the rational expectations model by about 50%

in this post—shift sample period.8
                                      6


      The actual arid anticipated changes for the long—term Canada and

corporate rates are summarized in Table 1. To focus on the impact of the

shift in the policy regime, the results for the period 1957:1—1979:3 are

contrasted with those for the period 1979:4—1985:3.

     The results indicate that anticipated changes in long—term rates are

about three times larger after the shift in the policy regime, yet still

relatively small. The mean absolute anticipated change in the long—term

Canada rate equalled 6.39 basis points after the shift, compared to 2.10 basis

points before the shift.9 For corporate bonds, the corresponding figures are

7.08 basis points and 2.57 basis points.10 The maximum anticipated change in

the Canada bond rate rose from 6.60 basis points to 17.63 basis points; in the

corporate bond rate, from 9.32 basis points to 20.17 basis points.1'

      In spite of the increased size and volatility of the anticipated changes

in the long—term rate, these anticipated changes continue to be dominated by

the actual changes. For the Canada bonds, the mean absolute value of the

actual change in the long—term rate equalled 109 basis points, which is close

to twenty times the mean absolute value of the anticipated change. Of

particular significance is the size of the variance of the actual changes

compared to that of the anticipated changes. The ratio of the latter to the

former equalled 0.3% for the Canada bonds, and 0.4% for the corporate bonds.

These fractions are lower than the corresponding ones for the earlier sample

period. Under the rational expectations model, anticipated and unanticipated

changes in the long—term rate must be uncorrelated. Under this model, 99.7%

and 99.6% of the variances of the observed changes in the interest rate on

Canada and corporate bonds in the post—shift sample period reflect the receipt

of new information.

III. An Analysis of Recorded Interest Rate Forecasts in Canada


      Pesando (1981) examined the recorded forecasts of both short— and long—

term interest rates in Canada made by Data Resources Incorporated (DRI) of

Canada and the Conference Board in Canada, as well as the means of the

quarterly surveys of interest rate forecasts compiled by McLeod, Young, Weir

and Company Limited. He found that the no—change prediction of the martingale

model outperformed the recorded forecasts of the long—term rates, but not of

the short—term rates.

      We have updated the recorded forecasts examined in this earlier study,

in order to assess the impact —   if   any —   of   the October 1979 shift in the

monetary regime on the accuracy of the recorded forecasts. Under the rational

expectations model, anticipated changes in the long—term interest rate have

increased in the post—shift period, suggesting cet. par. that the recorded

forecasts of long—term rates are more likely to outperform the no—change

prediction. Further, if time—varying term premiums have become more

important, then the rational expectations model will be a less satisfactory

approximation to reality. If so, the implication — again —          is   that the

recorded forecasts of long—term rates are more likely to outperform the

martingale model. As previously noted, there is nothing in the theory of

efficient markets to suggest that agents cannot outperform the no—change

prediction in their forecasts of movements in short—term rates. The success

of the recorded forecasts of short—term rates documented in the earlier paper

serves, in the main, to enhance the "credibility't of the recorded forecasts of

long—term rates, in spite of the inability of the latter to outperform the no—

change prediction.

      The root—mean—square errors of the recorded forecasts, both one quarter

and two quarters ahead and for the pre— and post—shift sample periods, are
                                       9



shown in Table 2.12 Shown also are the root—mean—square errors of the no—

change prediction. The martingale forecasts were set equal to the interest

rate at the end of the latest month which unambiguously preceded the month in

which the recorded forecasts were made. This procedure confers an

informational advantage to the recorded forecasts. This advantage typically

consisted of about two weeks, but in some cases approached a full month.

      On balance, the recorded forecasts fare quite poorly. There is no

evidence that the recorded forecasts of the long—term rates are superior to

the no—change prediction. Forecasts of the long—term rate (or rates) by DRI

and the Conference Board were significantly inferior to the martingale model

in the post—shift period, while the accuracy of the survey forecasts compiled

by McLeod, Young, Weir is about the same as that of the no—change prediction.

The most distinguishing feature of the post—regime results, however, is the

deterioration in the accuracy of the recorded forecasts of the short—term

rates. For both DRI and the Conference Board, the recorded forecasts of the

short—term rate are also inferior to the martingale model.13

      Financial practitioners often emphasize the ability of forecasters to

predict turning points in interest rates as a major —   if   not the major —

criterion   in performance evaluation. For portfolio managers, whose relevant

decision may be to increase or to reduce the fraction of their funds allocated

to long—term bonds, the implicit loss function apparently assigns considerable

weight to directional guidance.

      The success of the recorded forecasts in identifying turning—points is

summarized in Table 2A. The key measure is the fraction of the one—period

(E(R?) —     R')    and two—period (Et(R) —R) forecasts of the change
in the long—term rate that are correctly signed. For the combined sample

period, the fraction of the one—period forecasts that are correctly signed

a       DRI and the Conference Board forecast the average value of the interest rate during the quarter. The realization,
        in calculating the forecast errors, is set equal to the average value of the interest rate during the quarter to
        which the recorded forecast pertains. In the McLeod, Young, Weir surveys, it is the end-of-quarter interest rate
        that is being forecast, and the realization used are the rates prevailing on the last Wednesday of the quarter
        for which the forecast is made. Forecast dates for the recorded figures vary within the quarter and are thus not
        strictly comparable across forecast sources. Forecast errors, in basis points, are expressed at annual rates.

ranges from 0.415 (DRI, industrial bond rate) to 0.605 (Conference Board,

industrial bond rate). For four of the six sets of forecasts, the direction

of change in the long—term rate is predicted correctly less than one—half of

the time. This is true in the post—shift period as well as in the combined

sample period. In short, there is nothing in the assessment of their

directional accuracy to overturn the prior conclusion that the performance of

the recorded forecasts is poor.

      The fraction of the recorded forecasts of the change in the short—term

rate that are correctly signed is higher, in both the pre—shift and the post—

shift periods. For three of the four data sets, the direction of change is

correctly predicted more than one—half of the time in the post—shift period.

However, this appears to be the only — and quite modest — success of the

forecasters in predicting short—term rates during the post—shift period.

      In spite of their lack of success in the post—shift period, it is

instructive to examine two other features of the recorded forecasts. The

first is the size of the forecast changes in the long—term rates. If these

are large relative to those associated with the rational expectations model,

then either those making the forecasts implicitly assume (1) the market is not

efficient in its use of information or (2) time—varying term premiums do exist

and are "forecastable." Second, it is useful to identify the excess returns

(i.e., the holding—period yield on long—term bonds less the corresponding

short—term rate) that are implicit in the recorded forecasts. If the market

is efficient in its use of information, these excess returns reflect the term

premiums anticipated by those making the forecasts. The question of whether

these forecast excess returns reflect any systematic component that exists in

realized excess returns merits investigation.
                                      13


      The mean absolute values of the forecast changes in the long—term rates

are presented in Table 3, for both the pre—shift and post—shift periods. For

all three sets of recorded forecasts, these mean absolute changes are far

greater than those implied by the rational expectations model. During the

post—shift period, for example, the mean absolute changes in the long—term

Canada rate forecast by DRI, one and two quarters ahead, were 66.7 basis

points and 32.8 basis points, respectively.14 These forecast changes far

exceed the mean absolute change of 6.4 basis points implied by the rational

expectations model during this post—shift period.

      For all three sets of recorded forecasts, the mean absolute values of

the predicted changes in long—term rates are also greater in the post—shift

than in the pre—shift period. In effect, this indicates that the forecasters

deemed the rational expectations model to fit less well in the post—shift

period. The results reported in Table 3 suggest that either forecasters. view

the market as inefficient in its use of information and/or believe that time—

varying (and forecastable) term premiums contribute importantly to the

movement in long—term interest rates. If these forecasters believe the

capital market to be efficient, the implication is that they assign increased

importance to the role of time—varying term premiums in the post—shift period.

As noted, this possibility is raised frequently in the financial press.

      The large values of the forecast changes in long—term rates correspond

to substantial capital gains and losses, and hence to implicit forecasts of

holding—period yields on long—term bonds which vary across a wide range.

Using the linearized expression for the holding—period yield (equation (2)),

we have calculated the implicit forecasts of the holding—period yield on long—

term bonds as well as their excess return. The latter equals the forecast

holding—period yield less the corresponding short—term rate at the beginning

of the forecast period (i.e., E(H") -      rt).

  a For the DRI and the Conference Board in Canada, the last quarter's value as
     reported by the forecaster is subtracted from the one—quarter—ahead
     forecast to obtain the one—quarter—ahead forecast change. For the McLeod,
     Young, Weir surveys, the base rate reported in the surveys is used.
     Forecast changes are in basis points at annual rates.

      From Table 3, it is clear that the predicted changes in long—term rates

are smaller, and hence the implied capital gains and losses are smaller, in

the two—quarters—ahead forecasts. Thus the two—quarters—ahead forecasts of

the holding—period yields are likely to vary across a narrower range than the

one—quarter ahead forecasts. Because the two—quarter—ahead changes are more

precisely measured (since there is no uncertainty about the base rate used in

their construction), it is useful to focus on the two—quarter—ahead forecasts

of holding—period yields and excess returns. If their variation is large, so

must be the variation in (the less precisely measured) one—quarter—ahead

forecasts.

      These two—quarters—ahead forecasts are presented in Table 4. Note that

the variation in predicted holding—period yields and excess returns is large,

especially in the post—shift period. Consider, again, the DRI forecast of the

long—term Canada rate. In the pre—shift period, the implied forecast of the

quarterly holding—period yield on long—term Canada bonds has a mean of 12.82%,

and a range of —0.94% to 27.53%. In the post—shift period, the implied

forecast has a mean of 16.42%, with a range of —9.08% to 29.57%. The implied

excess return has a mean of 4.08% and range of —9.74% to 18.67% in the pre—

shift period, and a mean of 4.10% and a range of —21.09% to 19.34% in the

post—shift period.

      In short, the excess returns on long—term bonds implicit in the recorded

forecasts vary across a wide range. If those making these forecasts view the

market as efficient, this variation suggests that they anticipate large

quarter—to—quarter movements in time—varying term premiums.15

      Finally, it is interesting to note that practitioners sometimes

criticize forecasters for predicting changes in long—term rates that are too

small relative to observed changes. Melton (1986), for example, observes

critically (page 3):

      "...in the five years that Institutional Investor has surveyed
      economists concerning their expectations for interest rates, the
      average absolute forecast.. .was 97 basis points, compared to 173
      basis points in rea1ity"



Melton subsequently analyses (page 10) the "persistent tendency for some

economists to understate the magnitude of future changes of interest rates."

      The criticism that forecasters understate the actual volatility of long—

term interest rates is, of course, dramatically at odds with the message from

the rational expectations model. Such critics would appear to implicitly

reject the hypothesis that capital markets are efficient, since the variation

in ex post returns on long—term bonds is far greater than that which one might

reasonably assign to the role of a time—varying term premium. The predicted

annual changes in the long—term rate cited in the previous quotation imply

that the excess return on long—term relative to short—term bonds is forecast

to vary over a wide range.   It seems fair to ask whether forecasts that the

excess return on common stocks relative to short—term bonds will vary over a

comparable range would be assigned much credibility by market participants.



IV.   The Slope of the Yield Curve and the Forecastability" of Changes in the
       Long—term Interest Rate


      Implicit in the rational expectations model is a positive relationship

between the current slope of the yield curve and the subsequent movement in

the long—term interest rate. When the term structure has a positive slope

(that is, when the long—term rate exceeds the short—term rate), the prediction

of the rational expectations model is that the long—term rate will

subsequently rise. The anticipated capital loss is necessary to equalize — up

to the time—invariant term premium —   the holding—period return on short— and

long—term bonds.
                                      18


      However, as Shiller (1979) has noted using interest rate data drawn from

both the United States and the United Kingdom, the empirical relationship

appears to be the opposite. Subsequent movements in long—term rates are

negatively related to the current slope of the yield curve. None of the data

sets examined by Shiller extend beyond 1977, so his evidence does not pertain

to the post—shift period.16 Under the null hypothesis of market efficiency,

the implication of the "perverse" forecasting result identified by Shiller is

that a time—varying term premium does exist, and is positively related to the

slope of the yield curve. When the long—term rate exceeds the short—term

rate, long—term bonds are priced by the market to provide an excess return

that exceeds that implied by equation (1); that is, Et(H) '     rt   +   (n)
if
           rt
      Does this "perverse forecasting relationship exist in the Canadian

data, in both the pre— and post—shift periods? This question is readily

answered. Regressions of the future change in the long—term rate on the

current slope of the yield curve, for both the Canada and the corporate bonds,

are presented in Table 5. For long—term Canada bonds, the relationship

between the subsequent change in the long—term rate and the current slope of

the yield curve is negative, in the pre—shift, post—shift and combined sample

periods. In no sample period, however, is the coefficient of the yield curve

significantly different from zero)8 For the corporate bonds, the negative

relationship exists in all three periods, and is significant in the pre—shift

and the combined sample periods.

      Regressions of the excess returns of these long—term bonds on the slope

of the yield curve are also presented in Table 5. They, of course, provide

similar results. In all cases, the slope coefficients are positive,

indicating that excess returns vary positively with the long—short spread.

The relationship is significant for the corporate bonds, but only in the pre—

shift and combined sample periods. One cannot, however, reject the null

hypothesis that the relationship between future changes in the corporate bond

rate and the slope of the yield curve is the same in the pre— and post—shift

periods.19 This suggests that the relationship may prove to be useful in a

forecasting context. Further, as evidenced by the magnitude of the point

estimate of the slope coefficient, this relationship may be quantitatively

important. In the pre—shift period, for which this point estimate is the

smallest, it nonetheless equals 3.079. This implies that a one hundred basis

point increase in the long—short spread is associated with a 307.9 basis point

increase in the excess return on long—term corporate bonds.

      As highlighted by the excess return regressions, even a small

correlation between the future change in the long—term rate and the current

slope of the yield curve may be important in an economic sense. It is thus

instructive to determine whether the observed relationships are sufficiently

stable so as to be useful in a forecasting context. A natural breakpoint in

the sample is the apparent shift in the monetary regime which occurred in the

third quarter of 1979. Equations (2) and (5) in Table 5 were thus used to

generate forecasts of the change in the long—term Canada and corporate rates,

respectively, in the post—shift period. The root—mean—square errors of this

forecasting procedure were then compared to those of the no—change prediction

of the martingale model.

      For both the Canada and the corporate bonds, the predicted changes using

the "slope'1 regressions are more accurate than the no—change predictions, but

only modestly so. For the Canada bonds, the root—mean—square error for the

period 1979:4—1985:2 is 137.7 basis points, compared to 139.4 basis points for

the martingale model. For the corporate bonds, the corresponding figures are

141.8 basis points and 145.7 basis points.
                                      21



      The predicted changes from the "slope" regressions are considerably more

accurate than the recorded forecasts. However, this is due —   in   the main —   to
the inferiority of the recorded forecasts relative to the no—change

prediction. For the McLeod, Young, Weir surveys, the root—mean—square error

of the one—quarter ahead forecasts of the corporate rate for the period

1979:4—1982:4 (the period for which the survey data are available) equals

193.3 basis points, compared to 174.7 basis points for the "slope" regression.

For the one—quarter ahead DRI forecasts of the Canada rate, the margin of

superiority for the "slope" regression is 107.9 basis points to 124.4 basis

points.20 And so on.

      Finally, it is instructive to examine the relationship between the

change in the long rate implicit in the recorded forecasts and the slope of

the yield curve. Regressions of the one—quarter—ahead and two—quarter ahead

implicit forecasts of the change in the long—term rate on, respectively, the

current slope and the one—quarter—ahead forecast slope of the yield curve are

presented in Table 6. Interestingly, in the two cases in which a significant

relationship exists, it is in the direction required by the rational

expectations model. When the long rate exceeds the short rate, the forecast

is that the long rate will rise, and conversely. This is not, however, the

relationship that exists in the actual data.



V.    Sumary and Conclusions


     The substantive results contained in this paper can be summarized

succinctly. First, in spite of the increase in both the level and the

volatility of interest rates in Canada following the October 1979 shift in the

monetary regime in the United States, the anticipated quarterly changes in

long—term rates implied by the rational expectations model remain "small."

This suggests that the no—change prediction remains a close approximation to

the rational expectations model, at least over quarterly forecast horizons.

Second, recorded forecasts of long—term interest rates in Canada during this

post—shift period prove to be less accurate than the no—change prediction.

Third, these recorded forecasts of the level of long—term rates imply forecast

changes in these rates far in excess of those associated with the rational

expectations model. The implication is that the excess return on long—term

relative to short—term bonds is forecast to vary over a wide range. Such

variation may be associated with a belief that a time—varying term premium

contributes importantly to the movement in the long—term interest rate.21

There is nothing in the performance of the recorded forecasts, however, to

suggest that the systematic element of a term premium —   if   it exists — has

been identified by the forecasters.22

      Finally, in both the pre— and post—shift period, the subsequent movement

in long—term rates is negatively correlated with the long—short spread. This

is, of course, the opposite of the relationship implied by the rational

expectations model, and invites the interpretation that a time—varying term

premium is linked to the slope of the yield curve. Nonetheless, this negative

relationship is statistically significant only for the corporate bond rate,

and not in the post—shift period. This "perverse" relationship between the

current slope of the yield curve and the subsequent movement in the long—term

rate is, at least for Canadian data, of only modest value in a forecasting

context. Somewhat paradoxically, the forecasts of the change in the long—term

rate that are implicit in the recorded forecasts, when significantly related

to the slope of the yield curve, are in the direction required by the rational

expectations model.

                                   FOOTNOTES



 1.   The increased volatility of interest rates in the United States in the

      period subsequent to the October 1979 shift in policy has received

      considerable attention. See, for example, Roley (1983) and Walsh

      (1984).

2     During the six years prior to the shift in policy (1973:4—1979:3), the

      90—day bill rate had a quarterly mean of 8.38% and a standard deviation

      of 1.49%. During the six years subsequent to the shift in policy

      (1979:4—1985:3), these rose to 12.52% and 3.31%. For long—term

      Government of Canada bonds, the mean interest rate rose from 9.12% to

      12.97%, while the standard deviation rose from 0.61% to 1.76%.

3.    For the pre—shift period 1975—1978, Pesando (1981) examined the accuracy

      of the short— and long—term interest rate predictions of Data Resources

      Incorporated of Canada, the Conference Board in Canada, and the McLeod,

      Young, Weir surveys. These recorded forecasts, updated to the post—

      shift period, are examined in the present study.

4.    As is well known (Cox, Ingersoll and Ross (1981)), the several different

      formulations of the pure expectations model of the term structure are —

      due to Jensen's Inequality — inconsistent if interest rates are random.

5.    SMiler (1979) shows that the approximation error resulting from this

      linearization is not large, a point emphasized more recently by Campbell

      (1984).

6.    The corporate bond series in the McLeod, Young, Weir 10 industrials,

      compiled by McLeod, Young, Weir and Company Limited. The other series

      are compiled by the Bank of Canada. The corporate bond rates are those

      prevailing on the last business day in the quarter. All of the other
                                      25


      rates are those prevailing on the last Wednesday in the quarter. For

      corporate bonds, the reported term to maturity figure of 17 years is

      clouded by the existence of call options and sinking funds. The

      maturity figures are reported under the convention that the maturity of

      a bond equals its maturity date if the bond is trading beneath par, and

      equals its earliest call date if the bond is trading above par. For

      this reason, one has more confidence in the constructed series of the

      anticipated changes in the long—term Canada rate.

 7.   The value of this term rose by 47.1% for the Canada bonds, and by 46.0%

      for the corporate bonds.

 8.   Intuitively, it is the percentage change in the long—term rate which

      produces the anticipated gain or loss. The higher is the level of the

      long—term rate, the larger must be the absolute change in the long—term

      rate to produce this percentage change.

 9.   We also calculated the anticipated change in one of the most actively

      traded long—term Canada bonds (the 9.5's of 2001), again as implied by

      the alternative of holding a 90—day Treasury bill. For this

      calculation, we incorporated the fact that the maturity of the bond

      declines by one quarter with each observation. For this bond, the

      average absolute value of the anticipated change for the period 1979:4

      to 1985:3 equalled 5.65 basis points, which is close to the figure of

      6.39 basis points obtained for the index of long—term Canada rates.

10.   If, contrary to most empirical studies, the term premium is set equal to

      zero (i.e., the pure expectations hypothesis is assumed), the mean

      absolute anticipated changes in the long—term rate in the post—shift

      period rise to 6.93 and 8.37 basis points for Canada and corporate

      bonds, respectively. These higher values reflect the tendency of long—
                                         26


      term to exceed short—term rates, which thus requires — on average — ex

      ante increases in long—term rates to produce the capital losses

      necessary to equilibrate ex ante returns.

11.   Both maximums occur in 1981:1. In this quarter, the bill rate equalled

      16.44% and the Canada bond rate equalled 13.48%. An anticipated decline

      in the long—term rate of 0.1763% or 17.63 basis points is necessary to

      produce the anticipated capital gain required by equation (1), given our

      estimate of the term premium.

12.   The forecasts of DRI and the Conference Board are for the average

      interest rate to prevail in the quarter, while the survey forecasts

      compiled by McLeod, Young, Weir are for end—of—quarter interest rates.

      To calculate the forecast errors for DRI and the Conference Board,

      realizations were set equal to the average interest rate in the quarter,

      as measured by the average of the interest rates on the last Wednesday

      in each month during the quarter. To calculate the forecast errors for

      the McLeod, Young, Weir surveys, realizations were set equal to the

      interest rate on the last Wednesday in the quarter.

13.   The root—mean—square errors reported for the pre—shift sample in Table

      2, for both the recorded forecasts and the martingale model, are

      larger —   often   considerably so — than the errors reported for a roughly

      similar period in Pesando (1981). The increased errors reflected the

      typically large errors that occurred in the first three quarters of

      1979, which were not included in the earlier paper.

14.   For the DRI and Conference Board forecasts, the one—quarter—ahead

      changes are calculated by subtracting the value in the current quarter

      as reported by the forecaster from the one—quarter—ahead forecast of the

      average level of the interest rate. The one—quarter—ahead changes were
                                         27


      also calculated by subtracting the interest rate at the end of the month

      which served as the base period for the forecast. In all cases except

      for the one—quarter—ahead change in the McLeod, Young, Weir 10

      industrials forecast by DRI, the mean absolute values of the forecast

      changes were greater using the latter procedure, and thus greater than

      the changes reported in Table 3.

15.   There also exists the possibility that the forecasters are unaware of

      this implication of their predictions about the future levels of

      interest rates. In light of this possibility, it might prove useful for

      forecasters to calculate the holding—period yields and excess returns

      implicit in their predictions of interest rate levels.

16.   Campbell and Shiller (1984) find continuing evidence of this "perverse"

      forecasting relationship when they regress the excess monthly return on

      a twenty—year bond relative to a one—month bill on the long—short spread

      for the period 1955:1 to 1979:3. Shiller, Campbell and Schoenholtz

      (1983) find this "perverse" relationship continues to hold when the U.S.

      data are updated through mid—1982.

17.   For a review of recent evidence regarding the existence of time—varying

      term premiums, see Melino (1986).

18.   This is the relevant benchmark, given our interest in looking for stable

      relationships which might prove useful in a forecasting context. One

      might also be interested, for example, in the size (and significance) of

      the slope coefficient relative to the value predicted by the rational

      expectations model. See, for example, Shiller, Campbell and Schoenholtz

      (1983) and Pesando (1981, footnote 7).

19.   As shown in Schmidt and Sickles (1977), the Chow test for structural

      breaks can be unreliable when, as in the cases arising here, variances
                                        28


      and sample sizes differ in the two subperiods. We thus performed an

      asymptotic F—test (Amemiya 1985, pp. 31—38). For corporate bonds, the

      relevant test statistic, which is distributed F(2, 110)), equalled

      0.409. One cannot reject the null hypothesis of an unchanged

      relationship for Canada bonds as well (F(2, 110) =   0.392).   This

      latter result is less interesting in view of the lack of statistical

      significance of the slope coefficients.

20.   Because DRI and the Conference Board forecast the average value of the

      interest rate during the quarter, the regressions were rerun with

      quarterly averaged data and then used to generate the corresponding out—

      of—sample forecasts.

21.   It is useful to compare these results with those of Kane (1983), who

      also examines survey data on interest rate forecasts. Kane concludes

      that time—varying term premiums do exist and vary positively with the

      level of interest rates. However, Kane further observes that such

      variation is small relative to observed quarter—to—quarter changes in

      long—term rates. He thus concludes that his results provide only

      qualified support for the proposition that interest rate movements are

      forecastable. The forecasts examined in this study indicate, under the

      null hypothesis of market efficiency, a relatively more important role

      for time—varying term premiums.

22.   There is one anomaly in the behaviour of long—term rates in Canada

      during the post—shift period that merits note. During this period,

      there is a significant correlation between the current change in the

      long—term Canada rate and the lagged long—term U.S. Government rate.

      Indeed, the lagged U.S. rate explains a full 22 per cent of the variance

      of the change in the long—term Canada rate during this period of
                                29


volatile rates. This relationship does not, however, exist in the pre—

shift period. A regression of the excess return on long—term Canada

bonds on the lagged U.S. rate indicates that a one basis point rise in

the latter is associated with a 13.9 basis points rise in the excess

return during the post—shift period. We suspect that this relationship

is likely to prove to have been unique to this period, and thus not to

be useful in a forecasting context. Interestingly, the DRI forecasts of

changes in the long—term Canada rate are not influenced significantly by

the lagged U.S. rate. To the extent that the DRI forecasts are so

influenced, the relationship is in fact stronger in the pre—shift

period.
