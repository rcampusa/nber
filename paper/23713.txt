Migration-Induced Redistribution with and without Migrant's Voting

NBER Working Paper No. 23713
August 2017
JEL No. F22,H0

                                          ABSTRACT

We are motivated by the unique migration experience of Israel of a supply-side shock triggering
skilled immigration and the concurrent decline in welfare-state redistribution. This paper
develops a model, which can provide an explanation for the mechanism through which a supply-
side shock triggering high-skill migration can also reshape the political-economy balance and the
redistributive policies. The paper highlights the differences in the political-economy induced
redistribution policies between the cases in which migrants participate in the electoral system and
the case where they do not. When migrants are allowed to vote, and they take advantage of this
right, then, following the shock, all income groups gain, except low skilled immigrants who lose.
When migrants are not allowed to vote, or choose not to participate in elections, all income
groups gain, except the skilled migrants who lose.

    I.   Introduction


         Following the collapse of the Soviet Union some three decades ago, scores of immigrants
(about 20% of the Israeli established population at the time) went to Israel. Relative to the native-born
Israelis, these immigrants were poor in wealth, but abundant with skills.1
         In history, immigrants often shift the balance of politics among ethnic groups, economic
classes and age groups, so that they may generate political backlash. However, in Israel, the political
backlash has been moderate, whereas the change in the political balance was substantial. Israel’s Law
of Return grants returnees immediate citizenship and consequently voting rights. An early study by
Avner (1975) finds that the voting turnout rate of new immigrants was markedly lower than that of the
established population. This means that immigrants did not fully exercise their voting rights and did
not therefore influence the political economy equilibrium in Israel, as much as the established
population.2 However, a later study conducted by Arian and Shamir (2002) about voting turnout
patters of new immigrants to Israel in the 2001 elections reverses the earlier finding, the new
immigrants in this study are predominantly from the Former Soviet Union (FSU). Arian and Shamir
find no marked difference in voting turnout rates between the new immigrants and the established
population. Immigrants’ voting is key to understanding the political-economy mechanism that
determines income distribution and redistribution (see Razin, Sadka and Swagel (2002 a, b),
         Migration differs from the movement of other factor inputs (such as capital flows) in one
fundamental way. Migrants become part of the society of the receiving country, including its evolving
culture and politics.3 A highly developed social welfare system in the receiving country may greatly
complicate matters, as emphasized by Razin, Sadka and Swagel (2002b). A related issue is the
implications of ageing population for the size of the welfare state; see Razin, Sadka, and Suwankiri
(2011). While high skilled and therefore high-wage migrants may be net contributors to the fiscal
system, low skilled migrants are likely to be net recipients, thereby imposing an indirect tax on the
taxpayer of the receiving country. Sooner or later, then, migrants may shift the balance of politics
among ethnic groups, economic classes, or age groups, and reshape the distribution of wealth and
disposable income, That is, immigrants influence the size of the welfare state.

and the difference between which is a measure of redistribution. As the bottom graphs indicates, with

the former Soviet Union (FSU).

* Redistribution is measured by the gross and disposable income Gini coefficients.


        Figure 1 demonstrates a strong rise in income inequality between 1990 and 2003, which is a
combination of declining market income inequality, more than offset by and a marked fall in
redistribution. The influx of high skilled immigrants can explain these two conflicting trends: A rising
middle class thanks to high- skill migration, and a rebalancing political-economy-based income
redistribution policy.
        The paper aims at developing a formal political-economy mechanism that may explain these
phenomena. Specifically, we develop an analytical model in which immigrants voting is key for the
explanation of this episode.

        The organization of the paper is as follows. Section II describes the model, and Section III
presents the political-economy equilibrium. In Section IV, we discuss the redistribution with and
without migrant’s voting. Section V provides concluding remarks.

 II.    The Model
        The ingredients of the model are as follows.




                                                                                                        2
          II.1 Human Capital Investment

          There are just two types of workers: “skilled” (with a symbol ) and “unskilled” (with the
symbol     ). The wage per unit of labor of a skilled worker is , whereas an unskilled worker earns a
wage of       per unit of labor, where            1. All native-born (with a symbol            ) are initially unskilled.
However, a native-born can acquire education at some cost ( ) and becomes skilled. Individuals differ
from one another through their cost of education: there is a continuum of native-born individuals,
distinguished only by their cost of education. For notational simplicity, we normalize the number of
native-born individuals to one. An individual is identified by her cost of education, so that an individual
with a cost of is termed a c-individual. We assume for simplicity that the cost of education is uniformly
distributed over the interval , ̅ .

          All native-born individuals are endowed with               units of a composite good, the single good in
               4
this economy . All individual inelastically supply one unit of labor. If a c-individual acquires education
and becomes skilled, her income5 is (denoted by                 )


                                      1                                 1                                            (1).


          Where a flat wage is tax rate;         is a uniform (lump sum) per capita social benefit; and is the
interest rate – the return to capital. If a c-individual decides not to acquire education and remain
unskilled, her income (denoted by         ) is


                                       1                            1                                                (2).

                                                         ∗                                               ∗
          Thus, there is a cutoff level of cost,             , so that all c-individuals with                will choose to
                                                     ∗                                    ∗
become skilled, and all the others (with                 ) will remain unskilled. This         is defined by

                                                                                               ∗
          Upon some re-arrangement, the cutoff level of the cost of education,                     , becomes:

  To simplify the analysis, we assumed that E and c are uncorrelated. A possible extension of the model is to
assume some distribution of E, which is negatively correlated with c, so that more capable individuals (with
low c) have accumulated larger endowments (higher E).

            Note that           may well exceed , which means that those c-individuals with                                below but close
      ∗
to        (which is endogenous) actually borrow in order to acquire education. Naturally, the payoff in
terms of the higher wage would more than offset the borrowing cost. For those individuals                                                    is
negative.

            Also, note that we are employing a static framework within which all economic and political
processes occur simultaneously with no time dimension.7 For instance, we do not distinguish between
the time in which the education is acquired, and the time when the earnings occur. Similarly, capital
earns its return at the same time it is employed.

                                                                            ∗
            The number of c-individuals with                                    is the number of native-born skilled individuals.
Denoting this number by               , it follows that



                                                                                                                                             .
                                                                    ∗
                                                                        .                                                              (4)

            Then, the number of native-born unskilled individuals,                                    , is thus given by

            Therefore, the aggregate stock of physical capital, , is equal to

    Such a framework is akin to a steady state in a dynamic model with rational expectations.

                                                                                                                                             4

         There are also two types of migrants: the skilled who can earn a wage          in the host country,
and the unskilled who earn a wage of          in the host country. None of them has any initial endowment.
The migrants come to the host country after they have already made and implemented the decision
whether to acquire or not acquire education. Thus, it is exogenously given who is skilled and who is
unskilled. In other words, the economy benefits from the skilled migrants because it does not have to
pay for the cost of investment.

         II. 2. Income Groups

         The income of skilled and unskilled migrants, respectively, is:


                                               1                                                         (8)   .
and


                                              1                .                                         (9)   .
         The income of the native-born as a function of is depicted in Figure 2. Note that            declines
                                    ∗
in a straight line until it reaches , where

                ∗                                  ∗
                         1                             1           1                1            .

                 The labor income of the unskilled native-born and the unskilled migrants is the same,
but the total income of an unskilled migrant which is 1                   is definitely below the income of
an unskilled native-born, the difference being the capital income enjoyed by the unskilled native-born,
namely     1        . The total income of a skilled migrant is definitely higher than the total income of the
unskilled migrant, because of the higher wage earned by the skilled, whereas both have no other income.
The income of the skilled migrants exceeds the income of the skilled native-born with                , but falls
short of the income of the skilled native-born with            .

           The income of a skilled migrant is                1           , whereas the income of a skilled -
individual is 1                                1        . Therefore, as long as        is positive (i.e. the -
individual does not borrow in order to invest in human capital), then                    . However, if
0 (i.e. the individual borrows in order to invest in human capital), then the income of the skilled migrant
(   ) is greater than the income of the skilled native-born (        ). In sum, we have the following ranking
of incomes:

                                      ∗
                                                                                         .


           II. 3. Supply of Immigrants

           Recall that the country employs an unrestricted migration policy. We envisage an economy that
allows any migrants to come. Thus, the decision whether to immigrate or no rests solely with the
migrant. Each potential migrant has some reservation income, so that she will migrate if and only if she
will be accorded a higher income in the destination country.

                       Due to various factors (such as skill, family ties, age, etc.) this reservation income is
not the same, but there is rather a continuum of such reservation incomes. Distinguishing between the
two skills groups, we then assume that there is an upward sloping supply function for each skill group,

                                                                                                              6
depending on the income accorded to immigrants in the destination country. Denoting the number of
skilled migrants by      , the supply function of skilled migrants is given by an iso-elastic function:


                                                                                                    (10)   .
        where      and      are some positive parameters. Similarly, the supply function of unskilled
migrants is given by


                                                                                                    (11)   .
        where      is the number of unskilled migrants and        and     are some positive parameters.




        II. 4. Production and Factor Prices

        We employ a Cobb-Douglas production function


                                            ,        0, 0        1                                  (12)   .
        where    is gross domestic product,       is a total factor productivity (TFP) parameter, and      is
the capital-share parameter (and (1        ) is the labor-share parameter).    is the total labor supply in
efficiency units and is given by


                                                                                                    (13)   .
                The competitive wage per efficiency unit of labor ( ) and the competitive interest rate
( ) are given by the marginal productivity conditions



                                           1                                                        (14)   .
        and



                                                        ,                                           (15)   .

        where we assume for simplicity that capital does not depreciate. We also assume that capital is
immobile across countries. This is meant to say that there is some immobile, untradeable factor, such

                                                                                                           7
as for instance land, housing, etc., whose returns are determined in the confines of the domestic
economy, and are affected by immigration.

           II. 5. The Redistribution System

           We employ a very simple system of redistribution. Wages are taxed at a flat rate of . The
revenues are distribution by a uniform per-capita transfer .

           We assume that the migrants qualify for all the benefits of the welfare state, and they are
naturally subject to the state taxes. Therefore, the government budget constraint is as follows:


                                                 1                                                           (16)   .
           assuming that the government has no other revenue needs, except for redistribution.8 Note that
it follows from equation (16) that and           must be of the same sign. A positive wage tax ( ) allows the
government to accord a positive transfer ( ) to all. A subsidy to wages (namely, a negative ) requires
the government to impose a lump-sum tax (namely, a negative ) on all. When and                      are positive, the
tax-transfer system is progressive. When they are negative, the system is regressive.

    III.   Equilibrium

           With unrestricted migration, the flows of migrants            and       are determined by the migrants
themselves according to their reservation incomes (embedded in the supply functions, (10) and (11),
and the income accorded to them in the host country. There are therefore only two policy variables –
the tax rate and the social benefit . However, as the government is constrained by a balanced budget
(condition (16)), it follows that there is essentially only one policy variables; once             is chosen, all the
other economic variables are determined in equilibrium, including the tax revenue (                   ), the number
of migrants (      and       ), and . Or, alternatively, once   is chosen, all the other economic variables are
determined in equilibrium.

           Choosing as the single policy variable, we note that there remain 15 endogenous variables –

                                     ∗
                         ,   ,   ,       ,   ,   ,   ,    ,     ,    ,         ,   ,   ,   ,   .

  One may wonder why there is no tax on the initial endowment ( ). In a distortive. However, in a dynamic
setting, which we preferred to mimic in a static framework, represents accumulated savings, and taxing it
will be distortive. Furthermore, because all native‐born possess the same initial endowment, taxing it in our
static model does not distribute income across native‐born income groups; but taxing amounts to
transferring income from the native‐born to the migrantsstatic model such a tax is not.

                                                                                                                    8
There are also 15 equations in the model, (2) – (16), from which the endogenous variables are solved.
In addition, the income of the skilled native-born, which depends on their education cost, is given by
the function defined in equation (1).




IV.     Redistribution with and without Migrants’ Voting

        As explained in the introduction, we aim at studying the effect of migration on the progressivity
of the welfare state, and the resulting distribution of disposable income. This depends on the skill
composition of migrants and the extent of their integration in the political system that is whether or not
they participate in the electoral process. We consider the extreme cases: Case (a) when migrants do not
participate in elections; Case (b) when they fully do. For each of these two cases, we also study how a
skilled migration shock affects the political economy equilibrium and the ensuing functional and size
distribution of income. For this, we resort to numerical simulations.

        The policy variable is chosen by a natural (and plausible) version of a majority voting.




        Case (a): Migrants do not vote

 In this case, the political equilibrium is rather straightforward. Note that if a ‐individual would like
     to raise , then all ‐individuals with          (whether skilled or unskilled) would certainly support
       such a move. This means that the distribution of the voters over the most preferred is single‐
        peaked. Hence, the that will be chosen in equilibrium is the median voter’s most preferred .

        Note that the story of the immigration to Israel from the former Soviet Union described in the
introduction is characterized by the immigrants being on average more skilled than the native-born. To
focus on this feature we considered the case where

          ̅   ∗
                  ,


        that is the median native born is unskilled.

        Then the median voter is also an unskilled native-born (for     sufficiently large, this will indeed
be the case). Then the equilibrium       will be at the (endogenously determined) Laffer point. The
equilibrium is described in row (a)(1) in Table 1.

        Now suppose that there is a skilled migration-supply shock. Specifically,       rises exogenously
from 1.2 to 8.2,, whereas     is kept unchanged. Note that as immigrants do not vote, the identity of the
median voter does not change. As expected, the wage per efficiency unit falls, and the interest rate rises.

                                                                                                          9
The policy becomes more progressive. Both and rise. Note that the skilled-migration shock is strong,
and the number of skilled migrants (       ) rises sharply’ even though their income (       ) falls. The fall in
their income stems from both a decline in the tax ( ), which is somewhat offset by the rise in the transfer
( ).

         In fact, the median voter, who is an unskilled native-born and as such a net beneficiary of the
welfare state, encourages a flux of skilled migrants in order to “exploit” these net fiscal contributors to
the welfare state. Indeed, the tax rate raised, and more importantly, the social benefit ( ) rises
significantly. Interestingly, all skilled and unskilled native-born are better off as a result of this supply-
side shock of skilled migrants. Note that native-born unskilled benefit mainly because both the interest
rate ( ) rises (and they save all of their initial endowment), and the transfer ( ) is more generous.

         Table (1)(a) suggests also that the average income of the native-born skilled ( ̅ ) rises. It is
worth pointing out that all skilled native-born (regardless of their cost of education, ) are better off. By
revealed preferences, the income of every skilled native-born is at least as high as that of an unskilled
native-born, because a skilled person could have chosen to stay unskilled.

         Case (b): Migrants vote

         Suppose now that migrants do vote. Formally, everything takes place in one point in time, as
the model is static. That is, migration, education, and voting decisions, and the resulting factor incomes
are all made simultaneously with the voting decisions, so that voting decisions are made while taking
into account the effects of the voting outcome on immigration and all other variables, and vice versa9.

         The equilibrium is determined as follows:

         Upon observation, we can see from equations (2) and (9) that the direct effect of the tax-transfer
policy on the incomes of the unskilled native-born and the unskilled migrants is the same, and works
through the net wage income 1                   . For the unskilled migrant this is the only effect of the tax-
transfer system. However, for unskilled native-born, there is also an indirect effect through capital
income     1       (note that    depends on ). However, our calculations indicate this indirect effect is
of a second-order magnitude compared to the direct effect.

         Similarly, upon observation of equations (1) and (2), we can see that the direct effect of the tax-
transfer policy on the incomes of the skilled native-born and the skilled migrants is the same and works




9
  We are essentially assuming a perfect foresight. In a dynamic model, it is important to specify the sequencing
of decisions. In our static model, the simultaneous determination of all variables may be viewed as a steady
state of some dynamic setup.

                                                                                                             10
through the net wage income 1                 . Here again, there is also and indirect effect on the income
of the skilled native-born (but not on the income of the skilled migrants) through the capital
income           1       . Again, our calculations suggest that the indirect effect is of second-order
magnitude.

         Thus, all unskilled (both native-born and migrants) are affected by the tax-transfer policy
mainly through 1                , whereas all skilled (both native-born and migrants) are affected mainly
by 1             . It is therefore natural that all the unskilled whose wage is only       would rather prefer
to tax wage income and take advantage of all the skilled whose wage,            , is higher. Thus, the most
preferred policy of the unskilled entails a positive tax and a positive transfer. Therefore, if the unskilled
(both native-born and migrants) constitute a majority, then the political economy equilibrium tax and
transfer will be positive – a progressive tax-transfer system. However, due to the indirect effect which
applies only to the unskilled native born, the most-preferred tax and transfer policy is not necessarily
the same for the unskilled native-born and the unskilled migrants. Therefore, the tax-transfer policy
chosen is the most-preferred policy by the larger of the two sub-groups (the unskilled native-born or
the unskilled migrants).

         Similarly, the skilled (both native-born and migrants whose wage is higher than the unskilled)
would opt to grant a subsidy to the wage, financed by a lump-sum tax. That is, they opt for negative
and    – a regressive tax-transfer policy. In this case too, there is also an indirect effect which applies
only the skilled native-born. Thus, the most-preferred tax-transfer policy is not the same for the two
sub-groups of skilled native-born and skilled migrants. In this case, too we postulate that the political-
economy tax-transfer policy is the most-preferred policy of the larger sub-group.

         Note that indirect effect of the tax-transfer policy which works through the capital income
 E     c 1      is not the same for all members of the skilled native-born sub-group (because it depends
on ). In this case, we assume that the median voter within this group prevails.

         As before, we start with        1.2, and parameter values that entail the unskilled (both native-
born and migrants) as a majority:                          . This is described in row (b)(1) of table 1. As
predicted, the political-economy tax-transfer policy is progressive:        and        are positive. Also, the
unskilled native-born form a majority of the unskilled:             .

        We then contemplate a skilled migration supply shock that is we keep all other parameter values
constant and increase the parameter value of         . From 1.2 to 8.2 (as in case (a)). The results we
described in Figure 2 (a,b) and in row (b)(2) of Table 1. This supply-side shock triggers a wave of
skilled migration. The results are shown in the second row of Table 1. The number of migrants (            )
rose sharply. As a result, the skilled constitute now the majority:                      . Also, the skilled
migrants form the larger of the two skilled sub-groups, (i.e.             ) and their most-preferred tax-
transfer becomes now the political-equilibrium tax-transfer policy. As predicted, the political-economy
tax-transfer policy becomes now regressive: and are negative. Furthermore, the politically dominant
sub-group of skilled migrants drives out all unskilled migrants (            0), by according them zero
income (       0). As skilled labor is assumed a perfect substitute of unskilled labor, the group of skilled
migrants have no need for the unskilled migrants who pose a fiscal burden and therefore drive their
number and income to zero. Noteworthy, the unskilled native-born were initially the politically
dominant sub-group and dictated their most-preferred progressive tax-transfer. Following the supply-
side shock of skilled migration, the unskilled native-born lose their dominance to the skilled migrants
who are now dictating their most-preferred regressive tax-transfer policy. Nevertheless, the unskilled
native-born are better off, because the return to their capital income (namely, ) rises.

        The comparison between the two cases is insightful. When not given the right to vote, the
supply-side shock of skilled migration (case ( )) renders the fiscal system more progressive. By
contrast, when the migrants have the right to vote (which they fully exercise), they cause the fiscal
system to be regressive. Noteworthy, when they are not allowed to vote, the skilled migrants lose and
all other income groups gain. When they are allowed to vote it is the unskilled migrants who lose, and
all other income groups gain.

        The model therefore help explain what is shown Figure 1: a rise in income inequality between
1990 and 2003, which is a combination of declining market income inequality and a more than
offsetting fall in redistribution. The influx of high skilled immigrants can explain both: A rising
middle class and a rebalanced political economy based income redistribution policy.


 V.              Concluding Remarks

        This paper develops a model, which can explain the mechanism through which a supply-side
shock of skilled immigration, alter substantially political economy based policies. In particular, we
show that when migrants do not vote, the fiscal system becomes more progressive. When they do vote,
the fiscal system becomes less progressive. In both cases, the native-born gain.

        The paper comprises of a static model. The dynamics of the interactions between immigration
and income redistribution need further research.
