How Do the “GATS-Plus” and “GATS-Minus” Characteristics of Regional Service Agreements
Affect Trade in Services?

                                             ABSTRACT

Preferential liberalization of trade in services is a central feature of the new regionalism. “GATS-Plus”
and “GATS-Minus” have become the distinctive characteristics of the service RTAs and this paper
aims to investigate and distinguish the different effect of the “GATS-Plus” and “GATS-Minus” components
of RTAs on the service trade . The results of the empirical research by using the gravity equation either
with time-varying exporter and importer fixed effects or with the specific exporter and importer fixed
effect and year fixed effect both indicate : (1) belonging to a RTA (both “only goods” RTA and “service”
RTA) can increase the bilateral service trade between the trading-pairs significantly. (2) almost all
the “GATS-plus” and “GATS-neutral” commitments either on market access or on national treatment
made by trading-pairs with each other under service RTAs have significantly positive effect on bilateral
service export. (3) the commitments of “GATS-minus” characteristic do not have significant negative
effects on bilateral service export because “GATS-minus” treatment can be neutralized to some extent
by two main preferential erosion mechanisms under the RTAs: “liberal rule of origin” and “non-party
MFN provision”.

 How Do the “GATS‐Plus” and “GATS‐Minus” Characteristics of
   Regional Service Agreements Affect Trade in Services?

1. Introduction

1.1 Raise the Issue
  Due to technological progress, the trend towards privatization and the liberalization of
capital flows, a wide range of service activities that were previously considered non-
tradable now enter international commerce. In the last three decades, services account for
the fastest growing segment of international trade. The volume of world trade in services
increased more than 11-fold from US$387 billion in 1980 to US$4,350 billion in 2012.
As a consequence, international trade negotiations have increasingly considered services.
From being a marginal phenomenon before 2000, preferential liberalization of trade in
services has now become a central feature of trade negotiation which can be regarded as
the part of the “deep” behind the border commitments that characterize the new
regionalism. According to the WTO database, 133 RTAs covering services have been
notified under GATS Article V at the end of January 2014, of which 118 RTAs were in
force. So far the key traditional demanders in multilateral services negotiations such as
United States, EU, Japan, Canada, Australia and the major developing economies
including China, Chile, Mexico, India etc have all taken an active part in the regional
service liberalization process. Governments that are parties to these regional service
agreements account for more than 80% of world services trade (Roy et.al, 2006). Given
the rising popularity of RTAs on services, their impact on services flows becomes a
concern. Though one might expect that countries entering these RTAs do so with the
objective of eliminating barriers to trade in services and in the hope that the agreements
will increase the services trade between the parties, the real consequence is an empirical
issue.

1.2 Literature Review
  Economic literature is replete with theoretical models and empirical analyses
documenting the impact of RTAs on trade between partner countries. But most of the
existing studies have focused only on goods. Due to the scarcity of the reliable data on

                                            2
trade in services, especially of bilateral flows, it is almost impossible to carry out
empirical research on the bilateral trade patterns for services– in particular – on the
RTA’s effects on trade flows in services. Fortunately, to some extent, this lacuna has
been filled with the publication of the OECD’s database on bilateral services trade in
2002 (Shingal, 2010). Since then more attention has been given to the role of RTAs on
trade in services. In sum, two distinct empirical methods have been employed in
investigating this problem: Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) models and Gravity
Model. Because the CGE model sets a high requirement on data, the utilization of it in
this field is difficult and limited. In comparison, the gravity model as one of the most
successful empirical tools in economics which can relate service trade flows between
countries to their geographic and economic characteristics easily has become the
mainstream method to explain the determinants of bilateral service trade.
  It should be noted that though most original literature on the determinants of services
include a binary variable RTA indicating whether the trading countries are in a regional
trading agreement in the gravity equation, chances are that the variable RTA is treated
more as a control rather than a policy variable of interest and the significance of its
influence on service trade volume tends to differ across studies. Grünfeld and Moxnes
(2003) separated total services into travel, transport, government and commercial services
and applied a gravity model to the bilateral export of services and FDI flows based on
data for 1999 from the OECD. The paper included a dummy variable for common RTA
membership, a measure of corruption and a trade restrictiveness index of the importing
country as the regressors. Their results indicated a common membership in a regional
free trade agreement has no significant effect on service trade which reflects the fact that
many RTAs do not emphasize the liberalization of service trade and strong impediments
to service trade still exist through national regulations.
  Like Grünfeld and Moxnes (2003), Walsh (2006) also used a gravity equation to
estimate the determinants of total services, government services, transport services, travel
and other commercial services separately based on the import data for 27 OECD
countries in three-year period (1999-2001). In order to reduce the heterogeneity bias of
the random effect and the time-variant variables omission bias of the fixed-effects model,
Walsh used the Hausman-Taylor model for the first time .Walsh’s results suggested that


                                               3
GDP per capita and a common language can be the most important determinants of
bilateral service trade, but the adjacency and membership of the European Union did not
increase services trade significantly, which confirms the result of Grünfeld and Moxnes
(2003).
   Concerning RTAs’ effect on the service trade, other literature contradicted the
argument given above. Gilbert et.al. (2001) investigated the effects of specific regional
trading arrangements on bilateral services trade based on a sample of 38 countries for
1997. They found evidence of significant effects from the standard gravity variables of
economic size and distance and trade-enhancing effects of a limited number of specific
RTAs. Kimura and Lee (2006) extended the standard gravity framework by including a
measure of remoteness (a trade weighted measure of the distance between the two
countries) and a measure of trade restrictiveness (the Economic Freedom of the World
Index developed by the Fraser Institute) as regressors. By estimating this extended
gravity equation with a mixture of ordinary least-squares (OLS) and time-fixed effects
and based on the OECD statistics on trade in services for the years 1999 and 2000, their
results suggested RTAs can have significant positive effects on trade in services and even
under the conditions that RTAs did not explicitly cover services. The presence of the
“Only goods” RTAs could indirectly facilitate the process of service trade, which is
contrary to that of Grünfeld and Moxnes (2003). Mirza and Nicoletti (2004) formulated
and tested a gravity model of services exports by using the data from the OECD with an
emphasis on the unique characteristics of services trade. Their results confirmed the roles
of economic size and distance in services exports and reported a large significant effect of
membership in a common RTA on bilateral services exports. Ceglowski (2006) estimated
a gravity equation for services trade based on a sample of 28 OECD countries for the
period 1999-2000. Her study used a dummy variable for the membership in a group of
RTAs including CER between Australia and New Zealand, the EFTA, the EU, NAFTA
and the European Economic Area. The study found the common membership in a RTA
has a significant, positive effect on bilateral services trade and much of that effect
appears to reflect the impact of bilateral trade in goods on services trade. The policy
implication of this result is that service export can be promoted through the RTAs by
raising member’s bilateral goods trade.


                                             4
  In recent years because of the acceleration of the regional service trade liberalization
process, some economies especially the developing ones begin to wonder how to design
their regulations and make commitments under the framework of RTAs and what kinds
of RTAs can be used as a tool to enhance their social and economic welfare such as
decreasing the deficit of service trade. The heterogeneity of the RTAs and their different
effects on service trade has aroused a wide attention. The variables describe the
characteristic of RTAs become the key explanatory variables of policy interest in the
gravity model. The following are the representative literatures.
  Shingal (2010) used the gravity model to distill the trade effects of RTAs on bilateral
services trade into those emanating from services RTA and “only goods” agreements and
thereby confirming complementarities between the two. Depending on the economic
status of the two trading partners, this research classified the RTA as North-North (NN),
South-South (SS) and North-South (NS). It further broke down NS-RTA into symmetric
and asymmetric depending on the extent of reciprocity of commitments and their
implementation between the partner countries. Their results indicated that in addition to a
services RTA, the incremental impact of an “only goods” RTA is also important for the
sample. North-South services agreements are found to be more conducive to raising
bilateral services exports between trading partners and this trade effect emanates largely
from asymmetric North-South agreements.
  Park and Park（2010）applied the gravity regression analysis to four major services
sectors(financial, business, communication and transportation services) and found service
RTAs can create service trade inside the region but the trade-enhancing effect is sector-
specific. The trade enhancing effect of RTAs is stronger between the developed members
than that between the developed and developing countries. The author also examined
whether the trade effects of RTAs vary over time.
   Guillin (2013) firstly took the liberalization “depth” of the service RTAs into account.
According to the degree of liberalization in service trade, this paper divided the RTAs
into several categories and estimated the trade effect of each category by using the
gravity equation which included the bilateral and country-and-time fixed effects. Basing
on the panel data from 1999 to 2007, their results showed that only EIAs (RTAs which
covered the service trade) have a positive and significant impact on trade in services.

                                             5
Moreover, as expected, the deeper the agreement is, the more intra-trade the signatory
countries have.
   Behncke (2013) analyzed the relationship between intra EU trade in services and
European Integration based on a panel data set covering the year period of 2000-2010.
The author paid much attention to overcoming the endogenous bias of the EU dummy
and compared the service trade effect induced from European trade integration and
European monetary integration. Her results indicated a high positive impact on aggregate
services trade between member states from the former and a negative one from the latter.
The positive effect can vary between the service sectors and the more distinctive effects
are for business services, travel and EDV services.

1.3 Contribution of the Paper
   Existing literature analyzing the RTA’s effect on service trade using gravity-based
approaches shows a lack of consensus. In fact, global service trade liberalization is
advancing along two tracks: a multilateral track (GATS and its subsequent negotiation)
and a regional track (regional, sub regional and bilateral agreements).Both systems have
produced an increasingly complex web of rules, principles and commitments that regulate
the service trade flow. By means of a very detailed comparison of the two systems, a
typology has been established for classifying specific elements in the RTAs depending on
whether they simply mirror GATS provisions (“GATS-neutral”), go beyond GATS
provisions (“GATS-Plus”) or fall short of GATS provisions in some respect (“GATS-
Minus”). Several studies have been conducted to compare RTAs and GATS including
Sauvé (2005) who pointed out the key architectural innovations of services RTAs.
Stephenson (2005) and Roy et al. (2006) evaluate the liberalization content of selected
bilateral and regional agreements. Marconini (2006), Goncalves and Stephanou (2007)
review the negotiating experiences of countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. But
when it comes to the empirical research on the service trade effect of the RTAs, the
existing literature has not paid attention to the “GATS-Plus”, “GATS-neutral” and
“GATS-Minus” characteristics of the RTAs and has not distinguished the possible
different effects of these characteristics on the service trade. This paper tries to make a
contribution at the empirical level by investigating and distinguishing the different effect
of the “GATS-Plus” and “GATS-Minus” component of RTAs on the service trade based

                                             6
on the gravity model. This research can help shed light on the following questions: What
types of the service commitment (“GATS-Plus” or “GATS-Minus”) under the RTAs
appear to encourage bilateral service trade? Will the “GATS-Plus” commitment promote
service trade significantly and why? Will the “GATS-Minus” commitment yield an
adverse effect as general expected and why?
   The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 gives a brief but comprehensive
introduction to the “GATS-Plus” and “GATS-Minus” characteristic of RTAs from the
perspective of commitment and architecture. Section 3 is the empirical research
(specifying model, sample, data and relevant estimation techniques). Section 4
summarizes the empirical findings and gives the policy implication .Section 5 concludes
this research.

2、“GATS‐Plus” and“GATS‐Minus” characteristic of the Regional
Service Agreements
2.1 “GATS‐Plus” and “GATS‐Minus” Commitments and Their Distribution

   Regional Service Agreements can produce the so called “GATS-Plus” commitment in
two main ways .The first is to assure partners’ service provider that they can be regarded
as the local service providers on issues such as regulation and taxation. This commitment
can extend the national treatment (NT) to areas where the nation has not made such
commitment in the GATS yet. The second is to provide better market access (MA) to the
partner’s service providers (such as recognition of professional qualifications for
individuals and regulatory certification for firms etc) (Baldwin et.al，2007). In general,
the main performance of the “preferential content” under the framework of the Regional
Service Agreements can be the “wider” or “deeper” commitment concerning market
access or national treatment compared with that of GATS.
   Several literatures have tried to assess the “GATS-Plus” commitments in the Regional
Service Agreements. The representative literatures are as follows. Roy et.al (2006)
reviewed the commitments undertaken by 29 WTO Members (counting the EC as one)
under mode 1 and 3 in 28 PTAs negotiated since 2000 and compared them with these
members’ GATS commitment and Doha Round offers. To assess the RTA commitments,
the research focus both on “the sector coverage” and on “the commitment depth” in order

                                              7
    to provide an aggregate picture on to what extent the members of the RTAs have
    undertaken new commitments or improved the level of bindings for already committed
    sectors. Roy（2011）and Fink and Molinuevo(2007) followed the same method of Roy
    et.al (2006).The difference lies in Roy （ 2011 ） extended the sample of Roy et.al
    (2006)’s database to cover 53 WTO Members (also counting EU Members States as one).
    Like its earlier version, the expanded dataset limited its assessment to mode 1 and 3
    because both modes represent the overwhelming share of total world services trade. On
    the contrary, Fink and Molinuevo (2007) also took the other two modes (mode 2 and 4)
    into account, but their analysis is just based on 25 FTAs which participated by at least
    one East Asian country. As far as we know, Miroudot et.al (2010) gave a more
    comprehensive and detailed measurement on the “value-added” of RTAs. Based on 56
    regional trade agreements where an OECD country is a party, the preferential content of
    RTAs was assessed for each sub-sector (155 sub-sectors in total based on GATS Sectoral
    Classification List), each mode of supply (four mode) and each type of commitment
    (market access or national treatment). Based on Miroudot et.al (2010), this paper
    calculates the “Preference Margin” (“PM” is used to signify the ratio of the subsectors on
    which the member has made the GATS-Plus commitment for the service provider from
    the RTAs partner) of these RTAs for each mode (table 1) and each sector (table 2).

    Note：（1）The figures in column 2 and 7（column 3 and 8）are obtained by the ratio of the subsector which the

divided by the number of subsectors which the member has made commitment in the RTAs. (3) The figures in column
5(column 10) are obtained by 1 minus the figured in the column 4 (column 9). The index preferential margin (PM) is
used to evaluate to what extent the commitment under the RTAs go beyond the GATS.

Source：Author’s calculations based on Miroudot et.al (2010）.

  The results in the Tables 1 and 2 confirm that in general, the commitments under the
service RTAs have go beyond that of GATS by introducing preferential bindings in a
significant number of new supply mode and new sub-sectors. Specifically, these
calculations results indicate:           (1) the value of PM for market access and national
treatment for the total mode are 58.92 and 57.30(column 5 and 10 of Table 1). This
means in close to 60% subsectors covered by RTAs, the service providers come from the
RTAs partner have been given the preferential treatment (so called “GATS-Plus”
commitment). (2) The preferential margin of mode 4 is highest (73.47 and 72.84), next is
the mode 1(62.09 and 60.62) and mode2 (53.89 and 54.87), mode 3 is the lowest (51.07
and 44.67). (3)From the perspective of the sector, the “GATS-Plus” market access
commitment is more concentrated on “Other services” (90.16), “ Health related and
social services”(80.28), “ Transport services”(74.7), “Recreational, cultural and sporting
services”(70.83), on the other side the value of PM in “Communication service”( 47.62)
and “Financial services”(52.33) is comparatively low.
   The “value added” of the RTAs generated from broadening the sector(mode) coverage
or deepening the liberalization level is distinguished, but the phenomenon of “negative
preference” (the commitment of RTAs fall short of the same country’ GATS
commitments) cannot be ignored either. Based on a review of some 80,000 commitments
in 66 agreements, Adlung and Miroudot(2012) listed four representative kinds of
“GATS-Minus” commitments—“including additional restrictions not listed in GATS”
(additional), “tightening the existing GATS limitations” (tightening), “omission of
subsectors or sector segments” (omitted) and “reciprocity elements” (reciprocity) — and
provided an overview of modes and service sectors that has been affected by them .Table
3 indicates that GATS-minus commitments can be found in the vast majority of the 66
RTAs. In detail:            (1) “GATS-Minus” commitments are concentrated on mode
3(commercial presence) and mode 4(movement of natural persons) and the commitments
on 35% (36%) subsectors of the mode 3 (mode 4) contained the GATS-minus


                                                        9
commitments. The corresponding figure for mode 1(mode 2) is 16 %( 13%). (2)
Concerning individual sectors, “financial services” (38%), “communication services”
(24%) and “business services” (19%)                  have been affected by the “GATS-Minus”
commitments most, the least affected ones include “Construction and engineering”(2%),
“Education services”(2%), “Tourism &travel-related services”(2%), “Distribution
services” (1%), “Environmental service” (1%) and “Recreational, cultural, sports services”
(1%).

Note：（1）The figures in column 2（column 3）are obtained by the ratio of the subsector which the member has
made commitment on this mode in the GATS (RTAs) multiplied by 100.（2）The figures in column 4 are obtained by
the number of the subsectors which the member has made commitment in the GATS divided by the number of
subsectors which the member has made commitment in the RTAs. (3) The figures in column 5 are obtained by 1
minus the figured in the column 4 . The index preferential margin (PM) is used to evaluate to what extent the
commitment under the RTAs go beyond the GATS.

2.2 Service Rules in RTAs which Departure from GATS Multilateral Rules
   Trade agreements can help to promote international commerce by reducing barriers to
foreign participation, making trade policies more transparent or enhancing the credibility
of the trade regime. Besides commitments, the architectural choices and the liberalization
mechanism design can be the key issues because different rules can entail different
obligations for even the same commitments across different agreements. Regional service
agreements have made innovation from various perspectives. Based on the existing
research concerned including Latrille and Lee(2012)，Roy et.al(2006)、Roy（2011）、
Adlung and Mamdouh(2013) etc, the representative rules in the regional level which
departure from GATS can be summarized as follows and of course not just limited to
these.
2.2.1 Commitments Scheduled on Negative List
   The first key architectural choice concerns the approach towards scheduling trade
commitments. Positive and negative listings are the two representative legal techniques.


                                                     11
GATS have adopted the former, which means the market opening commitments can only
apply to sectors and modes listed 1 . The commitments themselves are subject to
limitations or conditions inscribed. Whether these limitations are for existing non-
conforming measures or for future measures has not required to be indicated clearly (Roy
et.al, 2006）. Moreover, since only "measures" are bound, no indication is given to the
relevant laws/regulations, which will accentuates the lack of transparency (Roy et.al,
2006）.On the contrary, some RTAs followed the so called NAFTA-type which opted
for a negative list, whereby market opening disciplines can apply to across-the-board
except for scheduled reservations (including the existing non-conforming measures and
the future measures). Under the negative list schedule, trade is unrestricted across all
service activities unless a sector carve out or scheduled limitations applies ,which
indicate the actual level of openness is spelled out by indication of the legal/regulatory
framework in place(Roy et.al, 2006）.
    In sum, though in principle the same level of openness can be realized by means of
either a positive list or a negative one, the latter can provide greater transparency and
lends greater credibility to service trade policies. In other words, knowing what is not
allowed—rather than allowed—may help service providers better understand how they
can do business in a foreign country. What’s more, agreements using a negative list
typically include a ratchet mechanism whereby any future liberalization of the
reservations is automatically locked in which makes sure the actual policies will not
become more restrictive.
2.2.2 Comparative Liberal Rule of Origin
    In the case of services, rules of origin apply to “service providers” instead of the
“service” itself. In general, three kinds of standard may be used to decide whether a
certain service provider is eligible to benefit from preferential treatment or not. The first
one( standard i ) is about “jurisdiction”(e.g. requiring a eligible juridical person should be
constituted or organized under the laws of one of the parties , which means it should have
a legal existence in the territory of a party. An eligible natural person should be a citizen
or a permanent resident of a member). The second one (standard ii ) is about the “location”
1
  The sector commitment (market access and the national treatment)under the GATS is based on the positive list, while the most
favored nation commitment is based on negative list ,so some experts think GATS followed the hybrid list approach(Latrille and
Lee,2012）.

                                                                12
where the service provider carries out economic activities (e.g. requiring an eligible
juridical person should have substantive business operations and a natural person should
have the centre of economic interest in the territory of the party). The third one (standard
iii) is according to the service provider’s “ownership” or “control vested” (e.g. the benefit
is limited to give the domestically owned or controlled service suppliers).
   The majority of service RTAs adopt more liberal rules of origin than GATS. (1)
GATS Article 28(m) set the rules of origin for juridical person on mode 1 and 2 based on
the standard i and ii mentioned above, but when dealing with mode 3 the restrictive
standard iii has been inscribed. On the contrary, most RTAs have not taken the standard
iii into account when describing the eligible juridical person for mode 3 with a view to
promoting third country FDI inflows into the integrating area and extending the benefits
of integration to all investors that are established in one of the RTA Parties. (2) With
regard to natural persons, GATS Article 28(k) sets the rules of origin based on both
standard i and ii. But all RTAs just refer to standard i , in which the definition of
“nationals” and “permanent residents” is generally provided by the concerned party’s
national legislation (Miroudot et.al, 2010). Liberal rules of origin can help minimize the
trade diversion effects, promote entry of the most efficient service providers but bear pay
the cost of undermining the bargaining advantage of the members of RTAs in multilateral
negotiations.
2.2.3 Introduction of Non‐party MFN.
   Most Favored Nation (MFN) treatment is a key obligation of GATS. Most service
RTAs also include the similar provision which makes sure the parties to the agreement
can receive treatment no less favorable than that granted to other parties. What’s more,
the MFN provision found in some RTAs also focuses on the treatment of parties versus
non-parties, which requires the trade preferences accorded to non-parties should also
extend to RTA parties. Though this non-party MFN clause can be subject to a negative
list of reservations in general, the RTAs member has an incentive to ask for the non-party
MFN treatment which ensures the domestic service providers will benefit from current
and future trade preferences extended to non-parties (Fink and Molinuevo, 2007). From
this perspective, the non-party MFN provision included in RTAs can help further



                                             13
promote the multilateralisation of regional commitments compared with the MFN
commitment.
2.2.4 Separate Rules on Service Investment.
  Under GATS, commercial presence has been defined as one of the supply modes
(mode 3). Because there is no separate service investment chapter under GATS, which
means the rules on service investment have been integrated into the rules on service trade.
But many FTAs establish two different sets of disciplines on service investment. Service
investment is not only regarded as a mode of supply in the services chapters but also be
regulated by a separate investment chapter which can apply to goods and service
investment horizontally. In general, the service investment has assumed different
obligations under these two representative “integration” and “separation” frameworks.
For example, besides foreign direct investment (FDI), the definition of investment under
the horizontal investment disciplines is extended to include portfolio investment with
many tangible and intangible properties. What’s more, some regional trade agreements
even subject investment in services (including mode 3) to extensive investment
provisions including the liberalization clause (e.g. pre-establishment National Treatment
clause), protection clause (expropriation, transfer of funds, umbrella clause, domestic
regulation etc) and investor-state dispute settlements mechanism.

3、Trade Effects of Service RTAs: Gravity Regression Analysis

3.1 Model Specification
   The gravity model is an important ex post method to estimate the determinants of
trade flows. The model posits that bilateral trade flows are positively related to trading
economies’ size (GDP) but negatively related to the distance (Dist) between them. Recent
years the gravity model has been applied to explore whether the formation of an RTA
will change the bilateral trade flows. When doing so, the key and difficult challenge is
how to correct for the biases emanating from the omission of the unobserved
heterogeneity characterizing trading partner samples. Among all the omitted factors that
can influence trade between pairs of countries, the most important one is the average
trade cost of exporter and importer, the so-called “multilateral resistance term” (MRT)
which was introduced by Anderson and van Wincoop (2003). However, given the


                                            14
difficulties of implementing the MRT, it has not been widely adopted in empirical
research. Feenstra (2004) suggested taking it into account by including the country-
specific fixed effects in the gravity equation, which is a computationally easier route for
the inclusion of multilateral price measures.
  The MRT derived by Anderson and van Wincoop (2003) can only be applied in cross-
section. Because cross-section analysis does not address the endogeneity bias of RTAs
(the factors which affect trade flows can also affect the formation of a regional trade
agreement，this means that the formation and deepening of an agreement and the trade
flow might be correlated in case of self-selection) and no appropriate exogenous
instrumental variables have been found to cope with this endogeneity bias. As a
consequence, any gravity equation using cross-sectional data would tend to overstate or
understate the true effect of the agreements. Under this condition, more and more recent
research is resorting to panel data. Baldwin and Taglioni (2006) suggest generalizing the
MRT in a panel setting by introducing the time-varying dummies to account for it.
Considering the trade between any two countries depends on the multilateral resistance of
both importers and exporters, following the idea of Baier and Bergstrand (2007) and
Subramanian and Wei (2007) our paper uses time-varying fixed effects for both importers
and exporters to account for factors specific to each country. The basic gravity equation
of our paper is established as (1).


   ln X ijt  1 ln(GDPit )  2 ln(GDPjt )  3 ln(DISTij )  4 ( LANGij )  5 ( RTAijt )  i ,t   j ,t   ijt (1)



 Where i and j denote particular countries and t denotes time. X ijt denotes nominal

bilateral exports in services from i to j at time t, GDPit , GDP jt are gross domestic product

of country i and j, DISTij is the distance between i and j, LANG ij is a common language

dummy, RTAijt is a binary variable that is unity if i and j belong to the same RTA. As

mentioned above, it ,  jt in equation (1) are time-varying exporter and importer fixed

effect which used to describe the multilateral trade resistance factor of Anderson and van
Wincoop (2003) but which would vary over time.


                                                            15
   In the gravity equation (1), the main variable of interest is the time-varying dummy
variable RTAijt which takes a value of one if both countries are a member of the RTA and

zero otherwise. In our paper only RTAs that were notified to WTO are included. If
countries have only signed RTAs as a trading bloc, as in the case of the EU, each member
economy is assumed to have formed a bilateral RTA. In order to distill the trade effects
of RTAijt on bilateral services trade into those emanating from “only goods” and

“services” agreements, in gravity equation (2) we separate RTAijt into RTAgoodsijt and

RTAservijt . RTAgoodsijt refers to RTAs which just cover the good trade liberalization, while

the RTAservijt cover service trade liberalization and notify GATT/WTO under Article V of
the GATS. Depending on the economic status of the two trading partners, this paper
                                                        SS                     NS
further divides RTAservijt into RTAserv                      ijt

                                                                        serv
                                                                                    ijt   which indicates the service RTA

signed between developing economies and between developed and developing economies
separately.

   The gravity models (4) and (5) are used to do empirical research on the trade effect
from the perspective of the commitment of market access and national treatment
separately. As mentioned previously, “GATS-Plus” and “GATS-Minus” have become the
distinctive characteristics of RTAs and this paper aims to make a contribution at the
empirical level by investigating and distinguishing the different effect of the “GATS-Plus”
and “GATS-Minus” components of RTAs on the service trade .

3.2 Sample and Data

3.2.1 Sample Economies
   This paper chooses 2000-2009 as the research period and selects 25 developed
economies (Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Czech Republic，Denmark, Finland,
France, Germany，Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Netherlands,
New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom,
and United States) and 21 developing economies (Brazil, China,                                       Chile,       Egypt,
Hongkong China ，India, Indonesia, Israel , Korea，Macao China , Malaysia, Mexico ，
Russian, Singapore, South Africa, Taipei Chinese, Thailand，Turkey, Peru, Philippine
and Viet Nam) as the sample economies. These 46 economies are all regarded as both
home economies and trading partner. Each home economy in our sample is paired with a
trading partner. So the unit of analysis is a trading pair.

    When deciding which economy should be selected for the sample, the following two
important factors are considered: (1) in recent years the leading service exporters and
importers of the world ( United States, Germany, United Kingdom, China, France,


                                                           17
Japan, Spain, Singapore, Netherlands, India, Hongkong China, Italy, Ireland, Korea,
Belgium, Switzerland, Luxembourg, Canada, Sweden, Denmark, Austria, Australia,
Russian, Taipei Chinese, Norway, Greece, Thailand, Turkey, Malaysia,              Poland,
Brazil ,Macao China, Finland, Egypt, Portugal) and the most important bilateral service
trade partners in the world(United States- United Kingdom， United States- Japan，
United Kingdom -United States ， United States- Canada ， Canada -United States ，
Japan- United States，Germany- United States，United States -Germany， France -
United States，United States- Mexico，Australia-Germany，France - United Kingdom，
Italy- Germany, United States- France，Hongkong China- China, Germany- United
Kingdom，United Kingdom- Germany) should be covered.(2) Because the key variable

in our research is RTAijt especially RTAservijt , the active members which participate in

the process of regional service liberalization should also be covered. According to the
WTO database, 133 RTAs covering services have been notified under GATS Article V at
the end of January 2014, of which 118 RTAs were in force. The sample economies had
taken part in 109 of them (occupied more than 90%).

3.2.2 Data
   The dependant variable of the gravity equation represents either exports or imports
between countries, but exports are generally better recorded and more widely adopted by
researchers. So this paper chooses bilateral exports in services as the dependant variable
which is drawn from the OECD statistics database on international trade in services
(http://stats.oecd.org/wbos/Index.aspx?DatasetCode=TISP). The exports of Australia,
Belgium, Canada, Czech Republic ， Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece,
Hongkong China, Hungry , Ireland, Italy, Japan, Korea, Russia, Poland, Portugal, Spain,
Sweden, Luxembourg, Netherland, New Zealand, Norway, United Kingdom, United
States are all downloaded from the OECD database directly while the export of other
economies are deducted from the import of its trading partner. Services exports are
expressed in millions of US $.




                                           18
      GDP data measured at current prices and also expressed in million US $. GDP data
comes from IMF World Economic Outlook Database2. GDP of Macao China comes from
Statistics and Census Service of Macao Special Administrative Region 3 . Followed
Baldwin and Taglioni (2006) which highlight the importance of using nominal trade and
nominal GDPs instead of the real one in order to avoid the bias due to conversion factors
between US dollars in different years, our paper also choose nominal trade flows and
nominal GDPs. Geographical distance between two economies is calculated by
measuring the distance between the capitals of two economies which take from Indocom
(http://www.indocom.com/distance). LANG ij is a dummy variable that takes the value 1 if

two countries have the same language .Sample economies’ official language is taken
from the CIA’s Fact book. The value of a series of dummy variables including RTAijt ,

take NT GATS  it , j , NT GATS it , j , NT GATS it , j , MAGATS  it , j , MAGATS it , j , MAGATS it , j for examples
to explain the rules how to value these variables in several different cases4.

                        The gravity regression analysis in our study uses annual data consisting of
                       20700(46*45*10 ） trading-pairs in total. The dataset features a panel structure by
                       covering 46 economies for ten years from 2000 to 2009. The number of observations
                       varies per year. Preliminary evaluation of the data revealed that 30 trading partners report
                       negative services exports. These observations were excluded from the sample. In addition,
                       data on services exports was found missing for 7305 observations over 2000-2009, which
                       effectively reduces the sample size by that number. After dropping the observations with
                       missing data, 13161 observations with complete data left. Table 4 shows the mean value
                       for our sample variables, along with the minimum, maximum and the standard deviation.
                           Through investigation of the data, the following findings can be noted：
                            (1)Of all the 13161 observations, 4954 trading-pairs (37.64percent) belong to RTAs,
                        4888 trading-pairs (37.14percent) belong to goods RTAs and 3458 trading-pairs (26.28
                        percent) belong to service RTAs. Among all the service RTAs, 18.21 percent (630
                        trading-pairs) of which were signed between developed economies and developing
                        economies, while 1.7351percent (60 country-pairs) were signed between developing
                        economies.

                the “GATS-” component( either in market access commitment or in nation treatment ) in
                the framework of RTAs may not reduce the bilateral service export which is out of our
                expectation.
                      The above observations seemed reasonable but they are subject to some limitations.
                When the trade effect of the RTAs and specific commitments are interpreted, other
                variables are not appropriately controlled so the result may be biased as a consequence
                and should be tested further.

                4. Results
                    In order to investigate the determinants of bilateral service trade, we use the gravity
                equation with time-varying exporter and importer fixed effect ( i ,t and j , t ) as the main

                regression model and apply the gravity equation with specific exporter and importer fixed
                effect (i ,  j ) and year fixed effect (t ) to do the robustness test( see table 7 and 8). The

                regression results of these two methods indicate GDPs of both home and partner
                economy and a shared language between trading partners can all hold a significantly
                positive relationship with exports in services, while the distance between trading partners
                hold statistically negative relationship (row 1-4 of table 7 and 8). These findings conform
                to the basic gravity theory and previous work in the literature.

                             When it comes to how the membership of regional trade agreement can impact trade in
                          services, according to the columns (1-2) of Table 7, the coefficient of RTA in model 1 is
                          positive (0.2099441 and 0.300722) and statistically significant, which means belong to a
                          RTA can increase the bilateral service export from economy i to j by 23-35%. This result
                          supports the findings of most previous literatures e.g. Grünfeld and Moxnes (2003),
                          Kimura and Lee (2006), Baier and Bergstrand (2007) and Guillin (2013).

importer fixed effect (i ,  j ) and year fixed effect (t )(column 4 of table 7)are 27.73%

and 17.06%. Though these results do not allow us to conclude precisely whether
RTAgoodsijt or RTAservijt can have larger effect on bilateral service export. The most
important thing to note is the positive and significant coefficients of both variables. The
effect of RTAgoodsijt appears to reflect the impact of bilateral trade in goods on services
trade, which means service export can be promoted by the “only goods” RTAs through
raising member’s bilateral goods trade.
    When taking the economic development level of the members into account, RTAservijt

4.2 “GATS+”“GATS=”and “GATS‐” Commitments in RTAs and Trade in Services
   In order to decide on trade policies, it is useful to better understand the real impact of
“GATS-Plus”, “GATS-neutral” and “GATS-Minus” components of RTAs on trade in
services. According to Table 8, the following conclusions can be drawn from the
regression results.
    (1) Almost all the “GATS-plus” and “GATS-neutral” commitments either on market
access or on national treatment made by trading-pairs with each other can have a
significantly positive effect on bilateral service export, which complied with our
expectation. It should be noted that Table 8 also shows the trade creating effect of
“GATS-neutral” commitments are comparatively larger than that of “GATS-plus”
commitments. Two factors may lead to this result.                                                               First, though the “GATS-plus”
commitment cannot be ignored, the most protected services activities in large countries
especially the developed ones remain largely unaffected by RTAs despite some
improvements on the fringes (Roy et.al, 2006). As a result, the commitments of “GATS-

                                                                                   25
neutral” nature remains the main rules which regulate the global services trade. “GATS-
plus” commitments are the minority part of the service trading system and of course can
have comparative limited effects. Second, though some economies have made the
commitments which surpass the GATS by either making an improvement in existing
commitments or new sectors scheduled. The “GATS-plus” commitments just indicate the
bound level of discrimination permitted within the RTA and do not describe the actual
trade regime. Because actual trade barriers in services are often known to be different
from the bound level of non-discrimination. In brief, a “GATS-plus” commitment does
not always lead to the preferential treatment in practice, which would nullify the trade
creating effect.
   (2)The commitments of “GATS-minus” characteristics on market access and national
treatment under RTAs do not have a significant effect on bilateral service exports. Why
do the negative commitments not reduce the trade flow as we have expected? In sum,
“GATS-minus” commitments can be neutralized to some extent by two main
mechanisms under the RTAs: “liberal rule of origin” and “the non-party MFN
provisions”. The rules of origin for services providers under the RTAs are generally
portrayed as liberal, which potentially enables non-parties to indirectly benefit from the
more favorable treatment granted in RTAs to services providers of the parties (Baldwin
and Harrigan, 2008; Fink and Molinuevo, 2007). Indeed, adopting liberal rules of origin
can to some extent be a way of reintroducing the MFN principle back into the RTAs.
What’s more, as pointed out in section 2, more and more RTAs include the MFN
provisions with respect to non-parties which can provide a mechanism to extend the
preferential treatment of the most ambitious agreements to more parties , of which of
course includes the members which have been given the “GATS-minus” treatments.
  Now the problem comes to why the RTAs are willing to include these two preference
erosion mechanism, the following several factors may help to explain. First, the rationale
for doing so is to overcome the economic distortions and productivity loss which caused
by letting the less competitive service provider first enters the market on a preference
basis. Because of sunk costs and the first mover advantage, the entry of the more
competitive firms at a later stage can be compromised even if the market would be
liberalized on an MFN basis at last (Miroudot et.al, 2010）.Second, many services

restrictions are embedded in regulatory regimes and place different regulatory regimes
for suppliers from different economies would cause high enforcement cost. In fact, the
liberalization basis of service sector is the increase of the competitiveness level of this
service sector. Once the service sector has been opened to one member, government may
be confident to open it to other economes, which means the propensity to de facto extend
the preferences granted in RTAs to others is likely greater. The nature of the service

                                                                  27
regulation determined once one kind of service restriction had been removed for some
economies then would not apply to others. Giving “GATS-minus” treatment to specific
several objectives would create large administrative costs, so chances are that kind of
negative commitments to some extent will just remain in the document instead of being
put into practice.

5. Conclusion
  The results of empirical research using the gravity equation either with time-varying
exporter and importer fixed effect ( i ,t and j , t ) or with the specific exporter and importer

fixed effect (i ,  j ) and year fixed effect (t ) both indicate that belonging to a RTA can

increase the bilateral service export between the trading-pairs significantly. It should be
pointed that “only goods” RTAs and “service” RTAs can both have positive and
significant effects on bilateral service trade, whose effect is larger cannot be determined
precisely now. The effect of the “only goods” RTAs means service export can be
promoted by raising member’s bilateral goods trade. When taking the development level
of the members into account, results show the trade-enhancing effects inducing from
South-South “service” RTAs and North-South “service” RTAs are both significant and
almost the same.
   What’s more, just as we have expected, almost all the “GATS-plus” and “GATS-
neutral” commitments either on market access or on national treatment made by trading-
pairs with each other under the RTAs have significantly positive effects on bilateral
service exports. Meanwhile the commitments of “GATS-minus” characteristic do not
have significant negative effects on bilateral service exports because “GATS-minus”
commitments can be neutralized to some extent by two main mechanisms under the
RTAs: “liberal rule of origin” and “the non-party MFN provisions”. The rationale to
include these two preference erosion mechanism in the RTAs is to overcome the
economic distortions and productivity loss caused by liberalization of service market on a
preference basis and the large administrative and enforcement cost caused by using
different regulatory regimes for different service supplier.
