                    The Role of Overlapping—Generations
                        Models in ionetary Economics
                                Abstract


     The main arguments of this paper can be summarized as follows.     (1)

The overlapping-generations (OG) structure provides a useful framework for

the analysis of macroeconomic issues involving intertemporal allocation.

(2) As a "model of money," the basic OG setup--which excludes cash-in-

advance or money-in-the-utility-function (MIUF) features--is inadequate and

misleading because it neglects the medium-of-exchange property that is the

distinguishing characteristic of money. (3) That this neglect obtains is

verified by noting that, in contrast with an axiomatic "traditional

presumption," the same aggregate leisure/consumption bundles are available

in equilibria in which "money" is valued and valueless. (4) That the model

may be misleading is demonstrated by examples in which three of its most

striking properties--tenuousness of monetary equilibrium, optimality of

zero money growth, and price level invariance to open-market exchanges--

disappear in the presence of modifications designed to reflect the medium-

of-exchange property. (5) There is no compelling reason why cash-in-

advance, MIUF, or other appendages should not be used in conjunction with

the OG framework.

I. Introduction
    A substantial and soDhisticated body of research has grown up, over

the past few years, in which the overlapping-generations framework of

Samuelson (1958) has served as the analytical basis for models designed

to explain monetary phenomena. A far-from complete list of examples

might include papers by Bryant (1981), Bryant and Wallace (1979) (1980a),
Kareken and Wallace (1981), Martins (1980), Peled (1982), Sargent and

Wallace (1981), Wallace (1980) (1981), and Walsh (1982). In fact, the

profoundly influential analysis of Lucas (1972) falls into this category.

     Proponents of the overlapping generations or "OG" approach have

argued vigorously not only that it is useful for monetary analysis, but

also that ocher existing approaches are highly unsatisfactory--see, for

example, Kareken and Wallace (1980), Bryant (1980), and Cass and Shell

(1980). In Wallace's words, the OG theory "includes what's essential for

a good theory of money, Economists should recognize it as the •best

available, and the Fed should not ignore its policy implications" (1977,

p. 2).

     Other leading theorists have disputed these suggestions. Most prom-

inently, Tobin (1980) has expressed disbelief that nlthe overlapping

generations model is the key to the theory of money.7' Indeed, he suggests,

its analytical parable "should not be taken seriously as an explanation

of the existence of money in human society" (1980, p.33). More recently,

Hahn (1981, p. Il)    has   remarked "how very bad these models are." Arid, of

course, crucial implications of prominent OG models conflict sharply with

those of   ocher   types. For example, Wallace (1980) (1981) finds that the
                                    2




method of financing government deficits has no impact on subsequent

inflation rates, while Friedman (1974) and Barro (1981) suggest that the

method of finance is of central importance.

     The purpose of the present paper is to examine the issues underlying

this controversy and develop tentative conclusions regarding the appro-

priate role of the OG framework in macro and monetary economics. We

begin in Section II with a discussion of some general features of OG

models and an exposition of two examples, both non-monetary in nature.

Then in Section III the basic monetary OG model, as described by Wallace

(1980),   is   discussed together with some important implications. The

extent to which this model reflects the medium-of-exchange role of

money is considered next, in Section IV, while related methodological

controversies are taken up in Section V. A brief discussion of some

more elaborate models is included in Section VI, and a conclusion

appears in Section VII.

II. The Overlapping Generations Framework

     The distinguishing characteristic of an OG model is that agents

in an everlasting economy have finite life spans of two or more periods.

These agents change as they age in the sense that behavior during youth

becomes sunk and choices are made with regard to consumption, leisure,

etc., in fewer remaining periods of life. Also, agents' endowments and

wealth may change as they grow older. At any point in time, then, the

economy includes agents of different ages who have different perspectives

on the accumulation of wealth, even if all agents are alike "before

birth"--if the lifetime utility functions and endowments are the same

for all generations. This feature provides a cogent rationale for some

kinds of economic activity that are hard to justify in other types of

models, without, that is, introducing the complication of agents that

are heterogeneous before birth. Thus OG models help to avoid analytical

difficulties that may be of no importance for various important topics

in monetary or macro economics. They do so, moreover, in a context in

which some agents--as yet unborn--cannot possibly meet in a marketplace

with those currently alive. This rules out certain types of exchanges

and thereby introduces an explicit and understandable "friction," some

type of which is widely considered to be necessary for providing a sound

foundation for the analysis of monetary phenomena.

     In addition, OG models are typically characterized by the assumption

of perfect foresight or rational expectations, depending on whether the

analysis is deterministic or stochastic. While this characteristic is

not inevitable--one can imagine an OG model in which agents have static or

adaptive expectations--there seems to be something of a natural
                                  4



 relationship: the motivation for models with the virtues described above

arises more clearly in the presence of the severe discipline imposed

by the assumption of rationality. In any event, perfect foresight or

 rational expectations will be presumed throughout the following discussion.

     A large fraction of the OG literature employs the assumption that

agents live for but two periods, with a new generation born each period.

Clearly, it is not possible to explain high-frequency empirical phenomena--

with a periodicity of (say) 10 years or less--with such models. They

can be used, nevertheless, to acquire understanding of various types of

dynamic behavior of macroeconomic variables. Furthermore, some quali-

tative properties of two-period OG models will carry over to versions in

which a larger number of phases of life are recognized. For most of the

issues discussed below, it does not matter how many periods an agent

lives, so for simplicity a two-period lifetime will be used in all that

follows.

     At this point it should be useful to describe a sample OG model, so

as to fix some notation and provide a warmup for subsequent discussion.

Since the more controversial aspects of OG analysis concern monetary

applications, it will be best to begin with a model involving only real

magnitudes. A notable example is provided by the model of Diamond (1965),

a version of which we now describe.

     Let c be consumption during period t   (t = 1,2,...)   by a represen-
                                                                             1/
tative young person and let x be consumption during t   by an old person.
When young, a person born in t   seeks to maximize u(c,x1), where u(.,.)
is a utility function that yields unique differentiable demand functions

for c and         It is assumed that c and x1 are normal goods and
                                               5




 that the marginal rate of substitution u1/u2 approaches zero (infinity)

 as c1/c2 approaches infinity (zero). This assures that positive

 quantities of
                       c   arid        will be chosen whenever possible. Each young

 person is endowed with one unit of labor, each old person with none.

 When old, a person's only object is to consume as much as possible.


        Production is carried out by old persons according to


 (1)             =



where n and              are the labor employed and capital held in t by a repre-
sentative old person, with y the resulting output. The production

function f(.,.,) has positive but diminishing marginal products, constant

returns to scale, and satisfies the Inada conditions (which assure that

positive quantities of n and                       will be chosen). Capital, which is

stored output, depreciates at the rate 8.

        In this setting, the consumption of an old person in period t is


             =
(2)
                     f(nt,k) — wn          +


where      is the real wage. Since the only choice variable is

labor is employed so that


(3)       fi(n,k) -           w   =   0.


Given the degree-one homogeneity of f(.,.), then, f(n,k) =


r1f1(ri,k)       +    ktf2(ri ,k )    so that


(4)          =                        + (l-)k.

        At the same time, each young person seeks to maximize u(c,xi)

subject to

              w = c +

                          x1/(l    +

where the left-hand side reflects the inelastic supply of one unit of

labor.        To determine the optimum choices, we form the Lagrangian function

        L =
              u(c,   x+i) +    \[w c x+i/(l +
                                            -     —

              ui(c, x+i) =     u,(c,            x+i) [1 +

Demand functions for c and x1 are implied by (5) and (6); the former we

write as


(7)           c = c(w,

      Market equilibrium requires n = 1 (and also                               =   l)   so w and

are determined as functions of the predetermined variable k by relation-

ships (3) and (4). Equilibrium also requires that the rate of interest

satisfy

                =
                     2'   k+i) —        6



and that consumption plus investment equals output, viz.,

(9)           c +   x + kt÷l   —   (1       —
                                                6)k    =   f(l,   ku).


Thus ecuilibrium values of c, ' and k+1 are determined by (7), (8), and

(9), again as functions of the state variable kt. Given an initial per-
       4/
capita    stock of capital, k1, the model in principle defines time paths

for t =   1,2,...    for all of the system's variables.

       While the foregoing describes an extremely simple model, it has

some substantial analytical merits. In         particular,   it is an internally

consistent model in which optimizing agents make non-trivial inter-

temporal allocation (saving) decisions, in which expectations are

correct, and in which markets clear. Since utility and production

functions are clearly specified, it is in principle possible to use

 the model to obtain answers to questions in welfare economics--

answers expressed, it should be emphasized, in terms of the utility of
                     5/
individual agents.


     Before turning to monetary applications, let us briefly consider
                                                     6/
another simple model involving only real magnitudes.    In

particular, consider the model of Calvo (1978), in which the second

factor of production is not capital but land: i.e., a commodity that

is non-augmentable, non-depreciable, and non-consumable, but which is

useful in production. Output, moreover, is nonstorable.

       In this model preferences are as above and (2) again describes

production possibilities but with kt ao denoting the number of land

units held during t by a representative old person. The per-capita

stock of land is fixed at k (say), but k÷i is nevertheless a choice

variable to each individual young person in period t. Claims to land

parcels, which are transferred after production takes place, are

bought from old persons (who supply them inelastically) at the market-

determined (real) price       As before, old persons hire labor from

the young at the real wage rate
                                  w.
       In this economy, consumption of   the   old during t is


(10)       x =   f(n,k)   -     +
                                      qtk
                                             8


Again       is an old agent's only choice variable so (3) holds as before

and with constant returns to scale we have


(11)           x,        kt{f2(n,k) +

        With   Pt =                         taken parametrically as before, the
                         f2(nt+i,1t÷i)
relevant Lagrangian expression for a young person is now




(12)           L =
                        u(c,xt      l + X[wt -         c   -
                                                               x÷1qI(P     +


After   elimination of X1, the first-order conditions imply



(13)
               u2(cx÷i)              —   ____________
                                              +   Pt


and the budget constraint is


(14)           w -      c x1 /(÷1
                             -
                                                    +          = 0.

These imply demand functions for ct and                               with those choices

dependent upon                       ' and    the expectation of


       Market equilibrium in this model requires k =
                                                                            k+1
                                                                                  =   k   as well

as      =
            n1      =   1.       Thus (3) and the definition of Pt imply that
                                                                                             w
and Pt are constants, say w and p. The other equilibrium condition

is that the per-capita supply of land, k, equals the demand, which

from (11) is


                                            + p).
(15)           kt+l =        x÷1/(q1
                                   9



Equations (13), (14), and (15) then determine              c and x1 as
functions of             Thus we write


(16)           =


an equation that is analogous to the "pseudo reduced form" expresthions
                                                                            7 /
that   appear in linear stochastic rational expectations models.

Such an equation need not be treated as an ordinary difference

equation in        for       is in fact the expectation formed at t of the

price of land that will obtain in t+l, an expectation that happens to

equal the realization only because of the absence of stochastic

elements in the present model. In other words, equation (16) does not

describe the market determination of        ÷1 given         but   instead the

market determination of        given the period-t expectation of

       In light of this discussion, it is natural to look for a solution

expression that relates        to the relevant state variables. The per-

capita stock of land in existence, kt, is a state variable just as in

the previous model but now its value is constant through time.

Consequently, the solution for           is also a constant, say        =    q.
Accordingly, the expectation of            equals -q also, and we evaluate

q in terms of the model's basic parameters by solving q =            0(q).        Under

our assumptions there will be a single solution to this equation.

       Nevertheless, the solution path for q that we have just described

may not be unique: for some admissible u(.,.) and f(.,.) specifications

there will be time paths other than          = q   (t =   1,2,...)   that satisfy

(13)-(l5).      Indeed, Calvo's development of this model was designed

to show that it is possible to have a multiplicity of rational
                                        10


expectations solutions in a non-monetary model with optimizing agents.

This multiplicity arises, however, because Calvo treats (16) as an
                                   9/
ordinary difference equation.           In McCallum (1981) it is argued at

length that such a treatment amounts to assuming that agents use

extraneous state variables in forming expectations of future values,

thereby inducing effects that occur only because they are arbitrarily

expected to occur. In a wide class of models, however, there is only

one solution that excludes such "bootstrap" or "bubble" effects. To

avoid the analytical paralysis that would result from the admission of

an infinity of solutions, therefore, it         is   often desirable to focus

attention   on the single "minimal state variable" solution that is free
                        10/
of bootstrap effects.         In the present case that happens to be the
stationary solution    = q but, in general, minimal-state-variable

solutions will not be constants. Focussing attention on minimal-state-

variable solutions conforms to the practice and recommendation of

Wallace (1980, p.55), so it seems doubly appropriate for the discussion
                                                                  iLl
of   monetary OG models of the type championed by Wallace.

III. The Basic Overlapping-Generations Model of Money

       We now turn to the more controversial class of OG models, that

in which there is a non-productive and "intrinsically useless"

entity identified as fiat money. Since Neil Wallace has been an

influential leader in the development and application of such models,

we shall begin with an exposition of the basic setup in his 1980

paper. Substantively, this model is modified only by taking popu-

lation growth to be zero, but our notation will differ considerably

from Wallace's.

       In this model, as in those of Section II, young persons endowed

with one unit of labor seek to maximize u(c,x÷i). Now, however,

labor is the only input to the productive process, which is

characterized by


(17)        y =   f(n).
Consequently, production will be effected by the young and there will

be no loss in proceeding as if their endowments were directly in the

form of output, in the amount y =   f(l)   units per young person. This

output is in general storable, but depreciates at the rate 6. More

specifically, y     1/(1 + 8) units are available in period t÷l for

each unit stored in t. By letting 6--, we can then represent a

completely perishable commodity. We permit negative values for 6,

reflecting autonomous reproduction of output, but require that

8 > -1.

       Let k denote the amount of output stored in t by a representative

young person. Output neither consumed nor stored can be traded for
                                              12

money; the money price of a unit of output is                          The real quantity of
                                                                 P.
money held by a young person at the end of t is denoted

        Old persons have zero endowments but each receives, in period t,

a lump-sum monetary transfer payment from the government of real

magnitude v. Consequently, each old person is able to purchase output
in the amount
                   v ÷ mt 1Pi/P in period t; per capita consumption by
the old is

(18)                         + v + miPi/P.

        Given the present setup, the choice problem of a young person is

to select c,                   and m to maximize u(ct,x+1) subject to


(19)           c+k+m =y
and to a version of (18) applicable to t+1. Our assumptions on

u(.,.) guarantee that c will be strictly positive, but non-negativity

        Market equilibrium in the model at hand requires that supplies

we can express equilibrium in terms of the single condition

where Mt is the per-capita supply of money. Following Wallace, we

limit our attention to monetary policies of the form

with      constant. Then we can write

       The task of this equilibrium condition is to determine                 the

variable           is (as described above) an expectation. The sole state

If we guess that this function                is of the form


(28)           Pt =

(29)           't+i =    M1       =   T(l4)   Mt

Cancelling          from the latter results in a single equation that

determines the value of IT as a function of .                   Consequently, we
verify the guess reflected in (28) and conclude that (28) in fact

governs the behavior of P, when                    is finite, in the model at hand.

         The possibility must be emphasized, however, that money will be

valueless in the model's equilibrium, i.e., that l/P = 0 for all t.

In this case we can nevertheless utilize the equations written above

if we define              as equal to l-, an equality which also holds

when l/P > 0. Let us consider, then, what conditions lead to monetary

and non-monetary equilibria--i.e., to equilibria in which money is

valuable and valueless, respectively, for all t = 1,2
                                  15




    First, consider the case in which money-stock growth is slow

relative to physical depreciation; that is, in which p < 8. Then

X2/(l+ó) < X2/(l-) so (21f) implies that (21d) holds as a strict

inequality. Equation (21e) then requires kt =       0;   i.e., that no

storage take place. But in this case x1 can be positive only if

money has value, and our conditions on u(c,x+i) imply the existence

of a solution with x1 > 0--see Wallace (1980, pp.54-55).
                                                                                13 /
Consequently, we see that a monetary equilibrium will prevail if         < 8.

    By contrast, when > 8, we have X2/(l+iS) > X2/(l-) so that

(2lf) is required by (21d) to hold as a strict inequality. Then

(21g) implies that m = 0 so that the equilibrium is one in which

money is not valued. More generally, if population grows steadily

at the rate v, money will be valueless whenever > V             + V5•

    Clearly, this "tenuousness" of monetary equilibria is an unusual

and striking feature of the OG model. In the case in which there is

no population growth or depreciation, the foregoing result implies

that money will be valueless if policy makes the money stock growth

rate any number greater than zero And even with growth and

depreciation taken into account, a money stock growth rate in excess

of (say) 107 per year would be predicted to result in a non-monetary
            15!
equilibrium.
    For many persons, a first reaction to this result might be, I

would guess, to conclude that the OG model is "obscenely at variance"
                          16/
with actual experience.         Kareken and Wallace (1981) have emphasized,

however, that such results presume that all agents confidently

believe that the constant money growth policy will be maintained
                                      16



permanently. Furthermore, the result would be weakened by the intro-

duction of stochastic elements--see, e.g., Peled (1982). So it is

actually not a straightforward matter to bring evidence to bear on

the empirical validity of the basic OG model. Let us then continue to

explore its properties, reserving judgment for the moment on its

merits as a model of money.

        Doing so, we find that other striking implications are readily

obtainable. Prominent in Wallace's (1980) discussion, in particular,

are several strong propositions concerning the efficiency--that is,

Pareto-optimality--of monetary and non-monetary equilibria.

Consider, for example, Wallace's Propositions 5 and 6. These pertain

to the case in which p < 8, so that the stationary equilibrium has

valued money, and assert that this monetary equilibrium is efficient

if .i       < 0 and inefficient if > 0.

        To demonstrate the latter result, let us designate the equilib-

rium values of c, x1, and                      c, x, m and note that, since
                                      :t a:
k = 0, c + x = y.              These c ,   x   values refer to young persons

alive during each period of the economy's evolution, t = 1,2

Also relevant to the Pareto-optimality criterion is the consumption

of the old during period 1, the initial period under con-
                17/
sideratioti.           Now, for each period t =    1,2,...   the feasible values

of c and x              are those on or below the dotted line extending from
        t        t+1
   =        y to x1 = y in Figure 1. The budget line as seen by a young
person is, however, c = y + (P÷i/P)(v÷1 -                    x+1).   Thus choices

are made relative to a budget line with slope -(l--), such as the

one shown in Figure 1. Thus with               > 0 there will exist consumption

preferred         by the young of each period to their chosen values,

        and x .     Furthermore, the old of period 1 would prefer a larger
value for x1, which is implied by c1 <                      cj', so     the equilibrium

c ,      x •is not efficient,

          If, by contrast, we had            =   0,    the budget line faced by the

young would coincide with the socially-feasible tradeoff and the

equilibrium position would be optimal. And if p < 0 the budget line

would be less steep than the feasibility frontier so that feasible

reallocations           away from c ,   x    that are desired by the young would

involve c > c* and x1 < x, which would diminish the utility of

the old in period 1.

          The results of these last two paragraphs are not affected, it

should be added, by population growth:                       it is the aggregate, not

the per-capita, growth rate of money that is relevant. The slope

of the socially-feasible budget line differs from that perceived by

a young person when p differs from zero, not when the inflation rate
                            iof
differs      from zero.

          Thus monetary equilibria with positive money-stock growth rates

are socially inferior, in the OC model, to monetary equilibria with

constant or decreasing quantities of (nominal) money. But how do

the latter compare with non-monetary equilibria, in which money is

valueless and intertemporal consumption patterns differ from
                                              *
endowments because of storage (k >                     0) of the consumable commodity?
The basic answer is extremely simple: unless the commodity grows

while in storage (8 < 0), storage is inefficient. That is, barring
                             19



6 < 0, intertemporal reallocations away from endowment patterns can

be brought about by the use of money as a store of value. None of

the good needs to be kept in storage, so depreciation (if any) can

be avoided and a one-time increase in consumption effected. Thus

any non-monetary equilibrium with 6 > 0 is inefficient.

     Taken together, these results suggest, as Wallace points out

(1980, p. 58), "that the quantity of fiat money should not be

increased. For [they] imply that if [ < 01,   then   an optimal

monetary equilibrium exists whenever the nonmonetary (equilibrium]

is nonoptimal" (p. 58). This is, as Wallace emphasizes, a rather

drastic conclusion--one that contrasts sharply with the conduct of

monetary policy in most actual economics. The obvious question--

indeed, the main issue of this paper--is, then, whether it is

reasonable to use the OG model as a basis for reaching conclusions

regarding monetary issues.

     In this regard, some critics might be inclined to reject the

OG model simply because it does not incorporate labor or product

market disequilibria; i.e., because it is an equilibrium model.

But that reason for rejection seems unwarranted. Whether pure,

flexible-price equilibrium models--as opposed to sticky-price

equilibrium models of the type mentioned by Lucas (1980a, 712,

n. 14)--will ultimately prove fruitful f or the analysis of

cyclical fluctuations and stabilization policy is at present

unclear. But even if flexible-price equilibrium models do not

prove adequate for cyclical issues, they may nevertheless provide

a useful basis for issues involving inflation, monetary growth

rates, etc. There are various issues in monetary economics that
                           20



have traditionally been examined in full-employment models.

    More serious, perhaps, is the question--mentioned by Kareken

and Wallace (1980, p. 8), Tobin (1980, p. 87), and many others--

of whether the analytical entity called "fiat money" functions in

the OG model as a medium of exchange. That this entity serves only

as a store of value is suggested both by the OG model's structure

and by the tenuousness property described above. To investigate

this issue is the next task on our agenda.
                                  21



IV. The Functions of Money

     Let us begin the discussion by recalling that it has long been

agreed, by economists and laymen alike, that for something to be called

"money" it should function both as a store of value and as a medium of
            19/
exchange.    Indeed, as Wicksell (1935) observed, it is only the latter
                             2Q/
function that is distinctive;    many assets serve as stores of value.

But the important issue is not, of course, terminological. It is, rather,

the entirely substantive matter of whether the OG model can provide

useful answers to questions regarding the behavior of actual economies

in which there is a medium of exchange.

     To approach this issue let us first try to establish whether the

entity called fiat money does or does not serve as a medium of exchange

in the OG model. Now it might be thought that the answer to this question

is obvious; that one can simply look at the specification of the model
                                                         21'
and immediately see that there is rio medium of exchange.    Lucas (1972,

p. 107) has suggested, however, that the matter is not so simple--

indeed, that the model is not rich enough to justify an answer one way

or the other. Presumably the idea is that the absence of an explicit

description of some activity is not enough to iriiply that this activity is

nonexistent in the modelled economy. A one-good model, for example, can

be given a many-good interpretation, as is done in Lucas's (l980b)

colored-marbles economy. That example, furthermore, shows that a one-

good economy can reasonably be thought of as possessing a medium of ex-

change, one that serves to facilitate transactions of types--say, among

the members of a single generation--that are invisible in the OG framework.
                                   22



     This notion--that activities may exist even if not explicitly

described--may be accepted, however, without      agreement that it is
impossible   to make progress on the issue at hand. What the notion

implies is that the approach must be indirect: instead of merely

looking at the model, w must look at its implications. If some can be

found that are inconsistent with the absence (or presence) of a medium

of exchange, then we can conclude that the model's money does (or does

not) function in that capacity.

     Taking that approach, it appears that a reasonably satisfactory

argument   can in fact be developed. This argument builds upon the
traditional presumption   that an economy   with a medium of exchange will
 •                                                                 22'
be more productive than it would be if no such medium existed.

More specifically, the presumption is that leisure-consumption possi-

bilities that would be unavailable under barter conditions become

feasible in the presence of a medium of exchange. The relevant cocnpari-

son, it should be noted, is one that holds constant (or corrects for)

the stock of capital: extra consumption or leisure resulting from a

larger capital stock does not reflect any medium-of-exchange effects.

For a given value of k, then, agents in the aggregate are able to enjoy

more leisure and/or consumption (without loss of the other) than would

be possible under barter. Given this condition, it becomes clear

that money in the basic OG model does not serve as a medium of exchange,

for precisely the same leisure-consumption totals are available in the

monetary and non-monetary equilibria when k is the same in each. This

is clearest in the no-storage case in which v      = 0.   More generally,

consumption c+x equals y +   (y-l)k   regardless of the value of 'y.
                               23



 Correcting for the magnitude of k, then, c+x is the same in monetary

 and non-monetary equilibria. And to complete the argument, we note

 that the entity called money certainly does not function as a medium

 of exchange in the latter type of equilibrium, for its exchange value

 is zero.

      To the foregoing it might be objected by OG advocates that the

 traditional presumption--that economies with a medium of exchange are

more productive than without--has not been firmly established by

evidence or analysis. In response, it must be admitted that conclusive

direct evidence is not available: the experiment of switching abruptly

from barter to monetary exchange has probably not been performed on an

economy-wide basis. And it might even be granted that the analyses of the

presumption carried out by Bruriner and Meltzer (1971), Clower (1970),

and Neihans (1978, pp. 99-117) are not marked by formal rigor and

explicitness to the extent that is typical in the OG literature. But

it is difficult to believe that any reader of these three items-or, for

that matter, of Jevoris (1875) or Pigou (l949)--would doubt the validity

of the presumption. The objection seems to me    unsustainable;
consequently, I contend that it is necessary to conclude that the OG

model's money does not serve as a medium of exchange.

     Parenthetically, it might be noted that, while Wallace (1980) does

not mention the presumption,   it is implicitly denied by his "confession"

that, to him, non-monetary equilibria and commodity-money equilibria "are

simply different names for the same thing." 1ore specifically, in models

with several equilibria in which      =   0, "there will in general be rio
                                                     24


basis for classifying these into ... commodity money equilibria and

barter euiLibria' (1980, p. 52). Wallace attempts to justify this

position by suggesting that the main difference between commodity-

money and barter equilibria is in the differing patterns of transaction

velocities and conjecturing that 'most models with frictions are likely

to display some intermediate pattern" (p. 52). But while the pattern

of transaction velocities is directly and definitionally related to the

distinction under consideration, that does not rule out the possibility

of identification by means of implications for leisure—consumption


bundles (a possibility that may remain in settings in which transaction
velocities cannot be observed). Thus Wallace's denial of the presumption

seems unwarranted.

       Next we turn to the question of whether it matters if the monetary

entity in OG models is riot a medium of exchange. But evidently it does

matter; some of the most striking properties of these models are cru-

exchange function, for example, that accounts for the tenuousness of

monetary equilibria in the model of Section III. For if the model's

money served as a medium of exchange, it would provide its holders with

enhanced leisure-consumption possibilities by reducing transaction costs.

And this would induce agents to demand the asset even when its rate of

return is exceeded by that of other equally-riskless assets; thus

  > 5 does not require                =   0.

        In   order to demonstrate this particular claim, let us provisionally

adopt the artifice of making real balances
                                                                          t   ttP /p an argument of

Now in this case,                  > 6 implies 2/(1+5) > \2/(1+_) as before, but the

presence of u3(c,x+i,) > 0 in (31f) makes it possible for (31f) to

hold as an equality nevertheless. Thus m = 0 is not required by

.   > 5;     money may be valued when the money stock growth rate exceeds

the depreciation rate. In particular, money may be valued even though

    > 0 and    5 < 0.
                                        26


        The claim of the last two paragraphs-- that tenuousness obtains in

the OG nodel because of the absence of the medium-of-exchange function--

has been disputed by Scheinkmaci (1980). In particular, Scheinkman

examines OG, cash-in-advance, and money-in-the-utility-function models,

and finds that 'the mathematical conditions that insure the absence of

tenuousness are very similar in all three classes of models" (1980,
            25 /
p.   91).          The basis for this statement is Scheinkman.'s demonstration

that all three types of models may have solution paths along which

        0 as t-*        unless utility and production functions are such that

money   is in some sense 'essential" or "necessary to the system"
(1980, p. 95). It is important to recognize, therefore, that these
equilibria in which             0 are quite different from the non-monetary
equilibria         emphasized by Wallace and described above. Specifically,

ci = 0 for all t =         1,2,...   in the latter, while m > 0 for all finite t

in   Scheirikman's examples. In fact, examination indicates that the solu-

tion paths discussed by Scheirikman are bootstrap or bubble paths in

the sense defined in Section Il--paths along which effects arise only

because they are arbitrarily expected to arise. Those discussed by

Wallace, by contrast, are bubble-free, stationary paths along which

money is valueless in each period, Thus Wallace's tenuousness is much

more severe than the "asymptotic" variety considered by Scheirikman.

Consequently, the latter's examples shed no light on conditions

tending to bring about tenuousness of the relevant type.
                                   27


       It is of course a matter of considerable interest whether Wallace's

optimality conclusions are also invalidated by changing the young

agents' utility function to u(ct, x, cnP/P1). In considering this

issue it seems appropriate, given our argument concerning tenuousness,

to interpret Wallace's Propositions 5 and 6 as being applicable when-

ever money is valuable, a less restrictive condition than <8.

Doing so, we find that the former proposition-—that any monetary

equilibrium is efficient if       < 0--is not valid in the modified model.

This conclusion follows from consideration of a monetary equilibrium

in which storage is productive (8 < 0) and       satisfies 6 < .   <   0.

Starting from such an equilibrium, it is possible to increase the

stationary value of m without reducing c or x, since the relevant

physical constraint,


(32)       y + (-l) k = c + x,


does not involve m. Thus young agents' utility can be increased for
each t =    1,2,...   without any reduction in x1. Indeed, it is shown in

the Appendix that optimality of a monetary equilibrium with k > 0

requires     = , just    as in Friedman's (1969) essay on the "optimum

quantity of money."


       It would obviously be possible to object to the reinterpretation

utilized in the last paragraph, but to do so would make the propo-

sitions too model-specific to be of much interest. It seems more

likely that objections by OG theorists would focus upon the use of

a specification in which real money balances are treated as an

argument of agents' utility functions. We need, then, to address

the implied issue in some detail.

V.     Methodological Issues

       It is no doubt widely known that most OG theorists object strenuously

to the use of money-in-the-utility-function or 'NITJF" models.            In fact.,

the objection is shared by some monetary theorists who are not proponents

of the OG framework (e.g., Tobin (1980, p.86)); yet MIUF models continue

to be widely used. Let us consider why.

       The rationale that users of MIUF models have in mind is presumably
                                    26 /
something like the following.              Individuals do riot derive utility directly

from money balances; the only arguments of the direct utility function

pertain to consumption of commodities and leisure. Thus an individual

who lives for two periods (beginning with t) has a utility function such

as u(c,2,ci,2i). (Note that the notation is different from that

of previous sections.) But in order to obtain consumption goods, this

individual must acquire them in the marketplace--here a multigood inter-

pretatiort like that in Lucas (1980b) is helpful--arid shopping takes time.

Thus leisure in t       is   constrained by


(33)           = 1 -
                        n s,  -



where n and         are amounts of time spent working and shopping, measured

in units that make the total time endowment per period equal to 1.

Finally, shopping time per unit of consumption is constrained by a

technological relationship that reflects the transaction-facilitating

properties of the medium of exchange. Specifically, we assume


(34)                =
            St/ct
                                              29




with - < . < 0 and 0 < '() < '(O) < , where m is t±e quantity of real
                                                                    27/
money balances held at some point of time in period t.                     Then sub-

stitution readily yields


(35)        ulc,                            c1, n÷1 -         ct+i(mi/ci)j
             =
                       t t t t+l
                 U(C ,fl ,m   ,C   ,Z1
                                         t+l,Lflt+l

and it is a function analogous to 'ri'          that   appears in the MITJF models.

       There are, of course, a number of issues concerning the specifi-

cation of 'i.     In   addition to the timing ambiguity mentioned in foot-

note 26, there is the question of why this transaction specification is
                                     28/
not as in the cash-in-advance models.   More fundamentally, Kareken and

Wallace (1980) have argued that such specifications involve implicit

theorizing, which makes it difficult or impossible to examine all aspects

of the model for logical consistency. Furthermore, the approach implies

a failure of the analysis to explainwhich physical objects are used as

the medium of exchange--something, they suggest, that should be determined

endogenously.

       It is, I think, clear that the Kareken-Wallace criticisms of this

sort of approach have considerable merit. But there are several responses

that can be made. First, analogous criticisms are applicable to virtually

all of the "fundamental" relationships employed in neoclassical (and other)

economic theory. StRndard production-function specifications, for example,

are not actually dependent only upon the laws of              physics.      There is implicit

theorizing involved with the treatment of "capital services" and "tech-
                                                                    29 /
nical progress," even at the purely theoretical level.                   And at the
                                      30



 level of empirical application, the task of selecting a recorded time

 series to represent "labor services' is not greatly different than when

 the task is required for "money." Thus it appears that whole-hearted

 adoption of the Kareken-Wallace principles would eliminate most existing

 neoclassical analysis.   Second, whatever their merits, the criticisms

 do not provide much support for the basic OG specification.   Specifically,
 it is difficult to believe that the description of the medium-of-exchange

 role of money provided by equation (34) could be more inaccurate than

 one that requires this role to be nonexistent. To adopt the latter

condition would seem to be rather like erecting a theory of the firm

upon an assumption that makes output insensitive to the quantity of labor

services employed. In addition, one cannot explain what physical objects

serve as media of exchange by requiring that none do.

     The upshot of this discussion seems to be that the use of MIUF models
                                               31/
is not as unreasonable as some have suggested.     But it should be kept in

mind that the underlying rationale is provided by some sort of specifi-

cations like (33)-(35), and the implied properties of the indirect utility

function should be observed. Thus, for example, equations (33)-(35)

imply that /m =      -(u/)'/c,        which is inconsistent with an assump-

tion such as /m__.1. as          0.   With (0) < , the shopping-time
approach therefore implies that the medium of exchange may be abandoned

if its holding costs become too great. Also, a specification such as

that used to obtain equation (31) can be justified only with some very

special assumptions; more generally, one would expect labor time to enter

as an additional variable. More positively, the approach suggests that

agents can become satiated with finite magnitudes of cn.
                                          31



       Now it should be cLear that the foregoing argument has nothing to do

with the essential generational structure of OG models; it concerns in-

stead the methodological predilections of some economists who happen to

be leading proponents of the OG framework. Thus there is no reason,

according to this argument, why OG models should not incorporate shopping-

time constraints such as (34)-(35) or even--if care is exercised--MItJF

specifications. Indeed, given the substantial merits of the OG structure

as a vehicle for the analysis of certain intertemporal issues, such a

combination seems attractive.

       In fact, Helpman and Sadka (1979) have used a model of precisely

that type: an OG model in which young agents' utility depends upon cnn-

sumption while young and old, Labor while young, and real money balances
                    32/
carried into old age. A question that immediately arises, given the

foregoing discussion, is whether that particular specification is con-

sistent with the shopping-time approach. As it happens, an affirmative

answer can be obtained if it is specified that persons cannot supply

labor services (or that they are unproductive) when old. Then if each

person begins life without money, equation (35) will specialize to


(36)        uLct, l-n-c(O), ct+1,


                  t   t t+l ,m t+1
             =u(c ,n ,c              ).



And since Helpman and Sadka make no explicit assumptions regarding

derivatives with respect to m+i they do not violate any properties

implied by u and .

       This may be an appropriate point at which to consider, as suggested
                                    32




by Wallace (1980, p. 77), whether giving money a medium-of-exchange role

recuires abandonment of the idea that money is intrinsically useless.'

The answer to this question must depend, obviously, on precisely what is

meant by intrinsic uselessness. Presumably, it would require that money

not directly appear in any person's utility function. But what about

specifications like (33)-(35), which make money balances an argument of

indirect utility functions? It is my impression that most economists

would not consider such a specification as inconsistent with intrinsic

uselessness; even the store-of-value role can, after all, be utility—

enhancing. But if it were agreed that a proper definition makes intrinsic

uselessness inconsistent with a medium-of-exchange role for money, then

it has to be the former that is abandoned if one wishes to understand

the workings of a monetary economy.

        It might also be said--perhaps unnecessarily-—that this paper's

disagreements with certain specific positions taken by Wallace should not

VI. Other Monetary OG Models

     Thus far, our discussion of monetary issues has concentrated on the

basic model of Section III. It has, consequently, neglected some more

elaborate OG setups that have been developed and utilized in a number of

notable papers. A brief discussion of a few of these richer monetary

models will accordingly be presented in this section.

     One of the more striking results in the OG literature is provided

by Wallace's (1980, pp. 71-73) (1981) "Modigliani-Miller theorem for open-

market operations," which suggests that changes in the money stock brought

about by open-market operations will have rio effect on the price level.

Analytically, an open-market operation is defined in these papers as a
                      33!
government purchase         with money of some other asset, together with the

associated adjustments in (lump-sum) transfer payments that are needed
                                                         34/
to keep the path of government consumption unchanged.          For such an

exchange to be of interest, it is of course necessary that both money and

the second asset be valued in equilibrium. Of necessity, then, the model

must be richer than that of Section III. In fact, the main discussion

in Wallace's cited papers utilizes a model that is quite similar to that

of Section III but in which the outcome of storage activity is stochastic.

Specifically, for each unit of output stored in period               units are

available in period t+l, where t+1 is random and drawn from a stationary

distribution with mean greater than 1.0. Then with the aggregate money

stock held constant over time, risk-averse young agents will--for some 'y

distributions--wish to both hold money and store positive quantities of

output. The stochastic aspect of the model therefore makes it applicable
                                      34



to issues that cannot be addressed with the basic version.

     In this model the government can also store output, subject to the

same stochastic technology, which it obtains in exchange for money.

Let k and k denote the per-capita quantities stored by young persons

and by the government at the end of period t. The formal counterpart

of an open—market operation is then a comparison of alternative

stationary equilibria in which the government stores different amounts

of output, with the quantities related by the condition dM = P

Here dM and       refer to differences across equilibria, while P is the

price of output in the "initial" equilibrium.

     The result that the same value of P is consistent with both equi-

libria may be explained as follows. Since interest earned on govern-

ment storage is returned to the private sector via transfer payments

(positive or negative), the ultimate constraints on c and x are the

same whether the government chooses a large or small value for

vided that this value does not exceed the quantity that young agents
                                                     ,,.   I
would choose in the absence of government storage.             Thus young agents'

choices for c and x will be the same for different settings of               which

requires that total storage k +      be invariant to k. But the young

agents' first-period budget constraint is y = c+m+k.            Thus with c in-

variant to       so must be m+k. Consequently, real balances m must be

directly related to      unit-for-unit across steady states: dm =

But this is consistent with the open-market purchase condition
dM = P       together with dP = 0.   So the same price level satisfies

equilibrium requirements in both steady states.
                                  35



     The foregoing argument can be modified to show that the price-level

invariance result will riot obtain if real money balances provide trans-

action services. For in that sort of an economy, young agents care about

the nagnitude of m, as well as c and x. So these agents will not be in-

different to changes in m brought about by changes in      aridwill

accordingly adjust their choices of c,x, and k. And that adjustment

process will prevent m from moving unit-for-unit with M and      changes

in P will be required. In particular, m will tend to move less than M:

an increase in N will induce art increase in P.

     Reflection upon the relative usefulness of assets in Wallace's model

makes his price-level invariance result less surprising than it seems at

first glance. Thus, the result can be restated more generally as follows:

an open-market exchange of a productive asset for an unproductive asset

will leave the relevant real quantity of the former unchanged, with the

real quantity of the latter adjusting as required. When stated in this

manner, the result becomes consistent with the predictions of "Ricardian"

models in which open-market operations in government bonds induce price
                                                                  36/
level changes proportional to changes in the nominal money stock.     To

see this note that in Ricardiart models money provides transaction services

and so is useful, while government bonds are--because agents take account

of associated future tax payments--of no consequence; useless. Thus the

Ricardian application is simple: the real quantity of the useful asset,

money, is unaffected by an open-market exchange for a useless asset.

Finally, note that our restatement of the result is also consistent with

the predictions of non-Ricardian models in which both money and bonds are

useful: the real quantities of both must then adjust in response to an
                                    36


open-market exchange.

       A different way of providing room for two assets has been suggested

by Bryant and Wallace (1980b) and utilized (with modifications) by Sargent

arid Wallace (1981). In the models of these papers, the second asset is

interest-bearing government or private debt, i.e., bonds that are issued

only in large denominations. Young agents who are potential lenders are

of two types: ones with relatively large endowments (termed "rich") and

ones   with small endowments ("poor"). Rich lenders are obviously motivated
to   hold bonds rather than money in order to obtain interest payments--there

is no other difference (except denomination of issue) in the two paper

assets. Poor lenders, however, can not hold bonds because each one's

endowment   is too small to permit the purchase of a single bond and it is
by   assumption illegal for individuals to share ownership of a bond. Thus

there may exist (possibly deterministic) equilibria in which both bonds and

money are valued.

       Without going into the details of the models in question, one can, I

think, conclude from the foregoing description and the discussion of

Section IV that "money" in these models does not serve as a medium of exchange.

Each of the paper assets functions as does "money" in the basic OG model;

both are valued in equilibrium only because of the rather arbitrary assumptions

that keep poor lenders from holding bonds. This conclusion is supported,

moreover, by application of the criterion proposed in Section IV--aggregate

consumption/leisure possibilities are not enhanced by the existence of

valued money.
                                   37



       Next, let us consider an ambitious attempt by Peled (1982) to

generate, without resorting to a ?UP or cash-in-advance specification,

a more comprehensive role for money than exists in the basic OG structure.

In Peled's model, in which each young person has the same endowment of

a completely perishable consumption good and the same risk-averse utility

function, there are two spatially-separated islands to which are assigned

randomly-determined fractions of each new generation. In addition,

there is a second source of randomness: at the end of each period half

of the occupants of each island are selected at random and relocated

(with their money holdings) to the other island for the next period.

The agents thus selected will then spend their old age in a location

with conditions that, because of the random assignment of newly-born

persons, are different from those faced by their contemporaries who stay

on their island of birth. Since this selection process is random, there

is a certain type of risk that young agents on an island can (if they wish)

agree to share. They can do so by negotiating bilateral contracts

specifying money transfers that are contingent upon the second-period

population of the islands on which each party will spend his or her old
    37/
age.

       Consequently, Peled's model is one in which money serves to facili-

tate intragenerational communication, something that appears to be non-

existent in the basic OG model and its variants with random endowments

or storage processes. Under certain conditions the existence of money

therefore shifts outward the "utility possibility frontier;" if risk-

avoidance were a commodity it could be said that money makes feasible
                                   38


aggregate consumption bundles not available in its absence.     Nevertheless,

 it would appear that money still does not serve as a medium of exchange.

It is a transportable store of value which makes possible a type of

insurance contract, but there is no evidence that it serves to facilitate
                           39/
exchange of commodities.

      Finally, let us consider Townsend's (1980) models in which money

serves to facilitate exchange among spatially-separated agents. In

particular, consider Townsend's version of the Cass-Yaari (1967) "circle"

model. This is not itself an overlapping-generations model, but is

related in the sense that it involves a highly-stylized setting in which

the role of money in facilitating certain desirable transactions is
                                  40/
described with great explicitness.    In Townsend's version, the model

features a countable infinity of infinite-lived agents, indexed by the
                                                                          41/
integers, and a countable infinity of different perishable commodities.

In each period household i, which is endowed with a positive quantity of

good i only, is physically able to make contact only with households i-l

and i.+1.   The tastes of household i are such that it obtains satisfaction

from consumption of goods i and i+l. Similarly, household i+l is endowed

only with good i+l and desires to consume goods. i+l and i+2, etc. Thus there

is no possibility of barter exchange, since there is no pair of agents

each of which has a commodity that the other values. In the absence of

money, each household simply consumes its own endowment. But if agents

hold positive quantities of fiat money--some physical entity that can be

stored and transferred costlessly--they can use these holdings to make

purchases of the second desired commodity. Townsend shows that a monetary

equilibrium exists in this setting and is Pareto superior to the nonmonetary,

autarkic equilibrium.
                                 39



     Providing a full discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of this

model as a vehicle for monetary analysis is beyond the scope of the present

paper. A few comments are nevertheless in order. First, as Sargent (1982)

has noted, Townsend's models are somewhat less tractable than OG models.

Second, the type of exchange facilitation provided by money in the Cass-

Yaari-To'wnsend model is more extreme than in the traditional literature,

where the absence of a medium of exchange makes trades more costly rather

than impossible. As a result, the criterion of my Section IV would suggest

that money does not serve as a medium of exchange in this model. But that

conclusion would not hold under a less extreme specification of transaction

costs. Indeed, it does not hold when the production technology described

by Cass and Yaari (1967, pp.364-365) is used instead of fixed endowments.

Third, the continued development of models emphasizing spatial separation

seems desirable.

VII. Conclusion

     The arguments of the present paper can be briefly summarized as

follows. The overlapping-generations structure provides an attractive

framework for the analysis of macroeconomic issues involving the inter-

temporal allocation of resources. The attractiveness of the OG frame-

work is a consequence of the essential generational feature that permits

an everlasting economy to be populated with agents who live for only a

limited number of periods. By assuming that agents are alike before birth,

one obtains a model in which it is possible to have a competitive equi-

librium that is time-stationary although the economy is populated at each

point of time with agents that are unalike with respect to wealth and

incentives to save. The stationarity facilitates analysis, while the

point-in-time heterogeneity of agents increases the types of economic

activity that can be considered.

     As a "model of money,'t the basic OG structure--which excludes cash-

in-advance or money-in-the-utility-function (MIUF) appendages--seems

inadequate and potentially misleading, the reason being that it neglects

the medium-of-exchange property of money. That this type of model does,

in fact, neglect the medium-of-exchange property is argued in the following

way: an economy that possesses a medium of exchange can attain aggregate
                                                                        2i
consumption/leisure bundles that would be unattainable in its absence;

in the basic OG model the same bundles are attainable (with a given

capital stock) in equilibria in which "money" is valuable and valueless;

hence this money does not serve as a medium of exchange. That the models

may be misleading is demonstrated by examples in which three of their most

striking properties--tenuousness of monetary equilibria, optimality of
                                  41




a constant money supply, and invariance of the price level to open-

market asset purchases--disappear in the presence of modifications

designed to reflect the medium-of-exchange property.


     The paper also contends that, as the previous sentence implicitly

suggests, there is no particular reason why cash-in-advance, NIIJF, or

other appendages designed to reflect the medium-of-exchange property

should not be used in conjunction with the OG framework.   The useful-

ness of each potential appendage or elaboration is a distinct issue

that may involve difficult and important methodological considerations,

but in most cases these considerations have nothing to do with the

essential generational structure of OC models.

        In       the MIUF model of Section IV, conditions for Pareto optimality

of a stationary equilibrium can be obtainedby maximizing

u(c,x,) + (x1), where                            is any positive constant arid (x1) is the

utility of the               initial old,        subject to the constraints y                 +   (y-l)k   C -   x       0,
                                                                             43 /

Lagrangiari multipliers, the optimality couditlDns include the following:

(A-i)                u1(c,x,) -                    =0


(A-2)                u2(c,x,) -        Xi             0


(A-3)                u3(c,x,) < 0,                        u3(c,x,)                  =    0


                                 -
(A-4)             e(x1)                     0,            x1[9(x1) - x21                 0




(A-5)             X1(y-l) —             <   0,            k(X1(y—l) - X2]           =    0.


Now   consider a monetary equilibrium in which storage is positive, i.e.,
a case with > 0 and k > 0. From (A-3) we see that a satiation level of
money balances must be held, i.e., that u3(c,x,) = 0. From (A-5) we
further see that X2 = 1(y-l), which with (A-i) and (A-2) implies

(A-6)                u1(c,x,) = u2(c,x,)              +   ('y-l)u2(c,x,).


But   from equations (31g), (31a), and (31b)                          in Section IV we see that

agents'          behavior implies

(A-7)                                                         + u3(c,x,).
                     (l4) u1(c,x,) =              u2(c,x,)
Thus with u3(c,x,) = 0 it is clear that (A-6) and (A-7) together require

  =   l/(l),             which immediately reduces             to -   = 5.     This is the Friedman-type

result       mentioned           toward the end of Section IV.

1.   Note that this notational convention differs from that typically found

     in the OG literature, where t indexes generations rather than time.

2. With homogeneous young agents the loan market will be inactive but,

     as in Diamond (1965), we assume that    is taken parametrically never-

     theless. In (5), and throughout the paper, inequality constraints are

     written as equalities when they are certain to be binding in equilibrium.


3. Under the stated conditions, these will be necessary and sufficient

     for optimality.


4. Here and in what follows, "per capita" refers to quantities per member

     of the relevant generation, not per person alive.


5. Barro (1974) has shown the existence of an operative bequest motive will

     under some conditions make an OG model analytically equivalent to one

     with agents with infinite planning horizons. Drazen (1978) has described

     one set of conditions under which this equivalence does not obtain.

     In my opinion, there is ample reason to believe that the continued

     development of both types of models--infinite-horizon and no-bequest

     OG models--is appropriate. Barro's result is important but does not

     warrant a dismissal of no-bequest OG models.


6. The reason for including this second example is to demonstrate that

     multiple solutions may obtain in non-monetary OG models, thereby indi-

     cating that solution multiplicities are not necessarily related to

     monetary issues of interest.
  7. See, for example, Sargent and Wallace (1975, p.247).


  8. See Calvo (1978, pp.322-324). These otherpaths are such that

                as t—.°; they thus arise when Øt is large, making its

       reciprocal less than 1.0.


  9. When (16) is viewed as a difference equation,                appears to be

      a state variable relevant to the determination of                 or, equivalently,

              as a state variable relevant to the determination of                That
      viewpoint suggests a solution of the form              =
                                                                 Q(1)   and substitution

      into (16) gives Q(q1)                        which "verifies" the guess.


10. That this strategy is feasible is demonstrated in McCallum (1981).

      It will be desirable if,     as   in   the   present case, the issues at hand

      are   not directly concerned with the possible existence of bubbles.

11. Wallace's argument is compatible with, but less complete than, the one
      in McCallum (1981). In particular, Wallace does not            consider the

      possibility   of extraneous state variables other than time         and does not

      offer   any procedure   for selection of the appropriate solution in cases

      in   which the solution to undetermined-coefficient identities is not

      unique.


12.   There are, as in the Calvo model, other solution paths. We shall ignore

      them, however, for the reasons given in Section II.


13. To be precise, the theory implies only that a monetary equilibrium will

      exist--there is also an autarkic equilibrium in which i/pt = 0 for all t.
14. In the case in which ..   = u,   there is a continuum of equilibria in

      which money is valued and goods are stored. Since      and ô are

      parameters of independent processes, I will devote no attention to

      this borderline case.



 15. Here 10% is simply an order-of-magnitude figure reflecting a

      depreciation rate of about 0.06 and an output growth rate--resul-

      tirig from population growth and technical progress--of about 0.04.

16.   The phrase is taken from Sargent (1976).

17.   Here period 1 is simply the point of reference for the optimality

      calculation--a period within which a reallocation is contemplated.

      If it is also the first period of the economy's existence, and

      the latter begins without old persons, then < 0 is not optimal--

      as consideration of the next paragraph in the text will reveal.




l8 In the case in which population grows at the rate v,       the   per-

      capita notation employed above becomes inadequate for repre-

      senting the transfer-payment injections of money. The slope

      of an individual's budget line remains -+i/' which now

      equals -(l.+.)/(1+\'), while the feasible values satisfy

         =   y   -




19.   To quote Wicksell (1935, p. 6), "The conception of money is

      involved in its functions ...: as a measure of value, as a

      store of value, and as a medium of exchange .. .   ." Also    see

      Schumpeter (1954, pp. 62-63) and Jevons (1875).
 20.    "Of the three main functions, only the last is in a true sense

        characteristic of money" (Wicksell, 1935, pp. 6-7). According

        to Schumpeter (1954, pp. 62-63), a similar view was held by

        Aristotle. Also see Clover (1970, p. 14).

 21.    This seems to be the view of Hahn (1981) and Helpman and Sadka

        (1979, p. 156).

 22.    See, for example, Clover (1970, pp. 8-14), Neihans (1978, p. 1-3),

        and Pigou (1949, pp. 25-26).

23.     Wallace's discussion on p. 52 is concerned with the relative

        efficiency of fiat vs. commodity money, a concern that is

        significant but entirely different. On p. 78, he denies or over-

        looks the presumption in his assertion that "not a single proposi-

        tion in monetary theory makes use of" the distinction between the

        medium-of-exchange and store-of-value roles of money.

24.    Whether there exists a reasonable justification for this procedure

       is discussed below. Note that equations (31) also apply if the

       real-balance term    is defined as v1 +
                                           rJ    mP/P1.
                                                 L I.. LIL


25.    Scheinkman explicitly interprets his cash-in-advance model

       as one in which money serves as a medium of exchange. To

       represent that function of money is the usual reason for the

       MIUF. assumption.

26.    The development in this paragraph reflects influences from

       a number of sources. These include Brock (1974), Dorribusch and

       Frenkel (1973), DuttQn and Gramm (1973), Fischer (1974), ard Saving

       (170). There are doubtless other relevant references; I have

       listed only those that have had an influence on my own views.
27.   Most writers would probably specify real balances at the

      start of period t. Some formulations in the literature

      imply, however, that it is the end-of-period balances that

      matter (Brock, 1975). Some average over the period is another

      possibility.

28.   One answer is that the cash-in-advance specification is a

      special case, one with   = 0 for m/c < 1 and     =    for

      m/c .   1.


29.   Implicit theorizing must be involved, for example, in Wallacets

      (1980) storage technology--especially in the case 6 < 0. Note that

      this argument is more general than that of Jensen and Meckling (1979),

      which hinges on a distinction between firms and other agents.

30.   That does not imply that the principles are necessarily misguided,

      but it does suggest that one proceed cautiously in embracing them.

31.   Use for some problems, it should be added. Obviously such models

      are not going to explain which objects serve as the medium of exchange.


32.   Another example is provided by Weiss (198O.


33.   Purchase quantities may of course be positive or negative for

      individual operations.

34    These transfer-payment adjustments are, I believe, implicit in

      traditional analyses of open-market operations. Their explicit

      recognition is not the reason for Wallace's result.

35•   Here and in what follows we drop the time subscripts since

      steady-state equilibria are being discussed.

 37. Old persons' money will be more valuable on islands in which there

       is a high ratio of young to old persons.

 38. Compare the argument of Section IV.

 39. This view is supported by application of the criterion of Section IV,

       conditional upon realizations of the random shocks. Details of the

       timing or transactional assumptions of the model are also open to

       objection. In particular, newly-born young agents arrive before the

      selected old agents are relocated--otherwise, how could their

      number be known?--but trades with them are not permitted.

40. Sargent (1982) states that Townsend's models and OG models "embody

      the same sort of impediment to private borrowing and lending which

      provided a role for currency." (Townsend's Section 3 describes a

      generalized OG setup; that will not be discussed here.)

41. Townsend's device of arranging agents in an infinite sequence rather

      than a closed finite "circle," seems to me unconstructive. The

      object of this device is to provide an "endogenous" exclusion of

      private loans. But this exclusion results because of an analytical

      condition--an infinity of agents at each point of time--that must

      be literally untrue. If it matters whether one takes the number of

      agents to be infinite, as opposed to large and finite, then to do

      so is inappropriate.

42. This "classical presumption" is taken to be axiomatic.
43. It would not affect the following argument if we used
                                                            i(x1,1)   as

      the   utility of the initial old.

44. To avoid clutter, the discussion proceeds under the condition x > 0.
