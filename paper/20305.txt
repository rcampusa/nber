Firms' Sickness Costs and Workers' Sickness Absences

                                              ABSTRACT

In many countries, social security insures firms against their workers' sickness absences. The insurance
may create a moral hazard for firms, leading to inefficient monitoring of absences or to an underinvestment
in the prevention of absences. We exploit an administrative threshold in the Austrian social security
that defined whether a firm had to pay a deductible for its blue-collar workers sicknesses or not. The
quasi-experimental situation around the threshold provides causal evidence on the extent of moral
hazard induced by the deductible. We apply a regression discontinuity design to estimate the differences
in the incidences and durations of sicknesses for firms that faced the deductible and those who did
not. We find that the deductible did not lead to different sickness outcomes and conclude that relatively
low deductibles have little impact on forms' management of sicknesses.

1      Introduction

Sickness absences are costly. In France and Germany, the cost of lost pro-
ductivity due to influenza, which accounts for about 10 percent of all sick-
ness absences, is in the range of USD 9.3 billion to 14.1 billion per year
(OECD, 2011). Moreover, there is a clear link between temporary sick-leave
and permanent disability (Wallman et al., 2009). Institutional settings and
sick leave regulations influence the incidence and duration of sick leave (Fe-
vang, Markussen and Røed, 2011; Johansson and Palme, 2005; Johansson,
1996; Puhani and Sonderhof, 2010; Westergaard-Nielsen and Pertold, 2012;
Ziebarth and Karlsson, 2010). They also affect the monetary costs resulting
from sick leave as well as the distribution of these costs between individual
workers, employers and social insurance institutions. This paper contributes
to our understanding of how firms respond to changes in sick leave costs by
investigating an insurance scheme that covered firms in Austria until 2000.

    Firms face direct and indirect costs caused by absences, but in most OECD
countries they are, at least to some extent, insured against their workers’
sicknesses, either because the amount or the period of sick pay is limited, or
because firms are refunded for their costs. In Austria, sick workers continue to
receive their wages from their employer for a duration of up to twelve weeks,
depending on their tenure. Until September 2000, firms were insured in case
they had to pay wages for their sick blue-collar workers. The insurance was
compulsory and financed by employers’ premiums based on their blue-collar
workers’ wages. If a firm’s total monthly wage bill exceeded a threshold, it
was considered a large firm and as such had to pay a deductible of 30 percent.


                                       2
Small firms, in contrast, received the full amount of paid wages. We exploit
this discontinuity using administrative social security data to identify the
causal effect of the deductible on sickness absences in firms.

  Earlier work has demonstrated that the abolition of this insurance reduced
sickness absences, indicating a considerable moral hazard effect (Böheim and
Leoni, 2011). By focusing on firms in the vicinity of the administrative thresh-
old, we are able to investigate firms’ reactions to higher absence costs as the
workers’ incentives were not affected by whether the firm was small or large.
Because of the higher costs, we expect that in the vicinity of the threshold
blue-collar workers in large firms were sick less often (and for shorter periods)
than blue-collar workers in small firms. Detailed analyses show that small
and large firms near the threshold do not differ in the composition of their
workforces, their wage rates or their employment growth rates.

  Our results show that, in contrast to our expectations, the deductible
did not result in different sicknesses in small and large firms. We interpret
our findings that the deductible was too moderate to induce management
responses. Our results can be linked to earlier research on the efficacy of
deductibles on health care outcomes, for example, Chiappori, Durand and
Geoffard (1998). In general, a firm will become active to reduce the number
of its workers’ sickness absences only if the expected gains from activities
such as increased monitoring and workplace health promotion are higher
than the resulting costs. A relatively small deductible might be dominated
by the direct costs for these activities as well as by other costs, for example,
separations if the monitoring of absences is deemed unfair by workers.



                                       3
    To better assess the implications of our results based on Austrian data,
we provide a comparison of sick leave regulations and absence rates in Aus-
tria and the United States in the Appendix. These two countries represent
diverse, almost antithetic, approaches to health-related absences from the
workplace. In Austria, insurance that protects workers against income risks
associated with sickness absences is universal and its costs are shared by
employers and social insurance agencies. In the United States, there is no
minimum level of guaranteed paid sick leave and the system relies almost
entirely on the voluntary provision of benefits by employers. The Austrian
approach to sick leave is representative for the sick leave provisions that are in
force in many other European countries, particularly Germany. These insti-
tutional differences are mirrored in marked differences in the absence rates.
Insights coming from these countries may represent an informative bench-
mark for the United States, where we can currently observe a lively debate
on the opportunity to introduce changes to the existing sick leave legislation,
reflected in the fact that since 2006 several United States jurisdictions have
passed local paid sick leave laws.



2      Background

In recent years, economic research gathered a large body of evidence on
the distribution and causes of sick leave, with significant contributions com-
ing from studies that use administrative social insurance data. In their in-
vestigation of the “anatomy of absenteeism” based on rich Norwegian data
Markussen, Røed, Røgeberg and Gaure (2011) show that employee hetero-

                                        4
geneity explains a large share of the variation in absenteeism that we observe
at the cross-sectional level within a country. Part of this heterogeneity can
be explained by observed characteristics: It is well-known, for instance, that
women have a higher propensity than men to be absent from work because of
their health (Bridges and Mumford, 2001; Ichino and Moretti, 2009; Paringer,
1983). Part of the heterogeneity is reflected in the unequal distribution of se-
rious diseases with long absence periods, which remains largely unexplained
even when large sets of explanatory variables are available.

  Differences in absence levels across firms are however not driven only
by worker heterogeneity, but also by workplace-specific effects. Drago and
Wooden (1992) and Ichino and Maggi (2000) highlight the role of social norms
and peer-group dynamics as determinants of sick leave and Markussen et al.
(2011) confirm that a worker’s absence behavior is affected by the character-
istics of her colleagues. Barmby and Larguem (2009) find that with respect
to infectious illnesses significant contagion effects can be observed at the
workplace. Another strand of the literature has studied the impact of labor
market conditions and employment security on workers’ sickness absences.
Both older and more recent studies show the existence of an inverse rela-
tionship between sickness absence and changes in the unemployment rate.
Unemployment seems to work as a “disciplining device” which influences the
absence behavior of employed workers (Askildsen, Bratberg and Nilsen, 2005;
Leigh, 1985). Numerous other studies reach the conclusion that insecure job
positions, such as temporary contracts or probation periods, induce workers
to keep their absence levels low (Cristini, Origo and Pinoli, 2012; Ichino and
Riphahn, 2005; Riphahn, 2004).

                                       5
  Institutional settings and social security regulations represent another set
of sick leave determinants and are of particular relevance for the explanation
of international differences in absence levels. So far, the economic literature
has predominantly studied the effect of regulations and incentives on the
behavior of employees. Worker insurance through sickness benefits has been
found to generate moral hazard and to influence absenteeism. Johansson
(1996), Johansson and Palme (2005) and Hall and Hartman (2010) find such
a moral hazard for Swedish workers. Similarly, Ziebarth and Karlsson (2010)
and Puhani and Sonderhof (2010) show that a reduction in the replacement
rate for sick workers in Germany led to a substantial decrease in sick leave
and a drop in hospitalization days. Ziebarth and Karlsson (2013) evaluate
the repeal of this reform and come to the conclusion that increasing the
generosity of the federally mandated sick pay scheme (from 80 percent to
100 percent) increased sick leave by at least one day per year and employee
among the reform’s target group. For the United States, where workers are
not universally covered by sickness insurance, numerous studies investigate
the moral hazard associated with worker compensation schemes (WC).1 A
higher level of replacement rate represents only a first step towards a moral
hazard problem, with further important aspects concerning the assessment
process of illness and the monitoring of absentees during a sickness spell.2

  Only limited research is available on the behavior of firms with respect
   1
     Krueger (1990) and Hirsch, Macpherson and Dumond (1997), among others, find that
these insurance schemes have large incentive effects on workers’ behavior, although more
recently Bronchetti and McInerney (2012) challenge the prevailing wisdom that workers
are highly responsive to changes in WC benefit levels.
   2
     Markussen et al. (2011), for instance, show that physicians’ certification practices have
a significant impact on patients’ absence behavior.

to their workers’ sickness absences. Böheim and Leoni (2011) investigate
Austrian firms’ reactions to an exogenous increase in the cost of sickness
absences and find that sickness absences decreased more in firms that had
faced a larger increase in costs than in those with a more moderate increase
in costs. Westergaard-Nielsen and Pertold (2012) analyze the behavior of
Danish firms and find strong and robust evidence of moral hazard – substan-
tially higher incidences of sickness absences – in firms which select to buy
insurance against their workers’ sickness absences. Such incentives have been
explicitly recognized in the design of unemployment insurance systems, where
experience rating is used to penalize employers for imposing a higher cost on
the system (e.g., Anderson and Meyer, 2000). Fevang et al. (2011) analyze a
Norwegian sick leave reform which exempted employers from refunding sick
pay only for pregnancy-related absences. They show that this exemption led
to approximately 5 percent more sickness absence spells of pregnant women.



3    Institutional settings

Austria belongs to the group of countries where all workers are insured against
sicknesses with generous benefit schemes and high income replacement rates
(Scheil-Adlung and Sandner, 2010). A two-stage system is in place, where
employers are required to pay wages for an initial period of sick leave, after
which the social insurance pays sick pay if the worker is still ill or disabled.
Numerous European countries, e.g., Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Norway,
Spain and Sweden, have similar institutional settings. The Austrian system
bears a particularly strong resemblance with the German one, given that

                                       7
the two countries share similar sick leave regulations as well as related labor
market institutions.

  In Austria, a sick worker needs to see a medical doctor who certifies the
sickness and informs the social security administration. Workers are required
to inform their employer about the expected period of sickness leave. The
duration of continued wage payment by the employer depends on work tenure.
At the present time continued wage payment by the employer ranges from
6 weeks for tenures shorter than 5 years to a maximum of 12 weeks for
tenures longer than 25 years. This regulation applies to both blue- and
white-collar workers.3 After that period, workers continue to receive their
wages for another four weeks; however, during these four weeks, the wage is
split equally between the firm and the social security. After these four weeks,
the worker receives sick pay from the social security for up to one year, which
is 50 percent of the wage for the first 42 days and 60 percent thereafter. In
cases of prolonged or permanent inability to work, workers may apply for
disability benefits.

  With the exception of the short period between September 2000 and Jan-
uary 2002, social insurance in Austria has been treating small firms differ-
   3
     Private sector workers in Austria are employed either as blue-collar or as white-collar
workers depending on the types of tasks that they carry out. According to Austrian
law, white-collar workers are employees who carry out commercial tasks (kaufmännische
Dienste), non-commercial higher tasks (höhere, nicht kaufmännische Dienste) or clerical
work (Bürotätigkeiten). Until 2000 labor law provisions were generally more favorable for
white-collar workers than for blue-collar workers. In particular, white-collar workers were
entitled to two weeks more continued wage payment than blue-collar workers (at each level
of tenure). Since 2001, the sick pay legislation for blue-collar and white-collar workers are
virtually the same, the only difference being that in case of multiple sickness spells within
the same work year the entitlement to continued wage payment remains fixed for blue-
collar workers, but not for white-collar workers. Other differences between the two groups
are summarised in Table 8 in Appendix.


                                             8
ently than large firms. Austria is not an exception in this respect, since
in numerous countries, including the United States (see Appendix A), sick
leave-related regulation is more favorable for small firms than for large firms.
This differential treatment can be justified on the grounds of differing sick
leave costs for small and large firms, as the amount of disruption caused by
absences might be lower for larger firms (Weiss, 1985). Arguably, large firms
face lower costs from an absence because they can redistribute the tasks of
the absent worker more easily on the remaining workforce than small firms
and need to hold a relatively smaller buffer stock of workers. Barmby and
Stephan (2000) show that the cost advantage of larger firms over smaller ones
increases with increasing absence rates.

  We study a compulsory insurance scheme for firms that included different
provisions for firms of different size and that was in place between 1974 and
September 2000. During this period, firms received a refund for the wages
they had to pay their sick blue-collar workers. Until 2000 small firms received
a 100 percent and large firms received a 70 percent refund of the wages paid to
sick blue-collar workers. In other words, larger firms had to pay a deductible
of 30 percent, which small firms did not have to pay.

  The insurance (Entgeltfortzahlungsfond ) was compulsory and financed by
employers’ contributions of 2.1 percent of their blue-collar workers’ wages.
The fund was managed by the Austrian social security administration and
the refund was paid automatically within three months. The amount of
the refund depended on a firm’s total wage bill from two months ago. If a
firm’s total wages in month t − 2 exceeded a threshold, namely 180 times



                                       9
the maximum daily social security contribution, it was considered a large
firm in month t. Although the refund compensated firms only for blue-collar
workers’ absences, the definition of firm size was based on the wages of both
blue-collar and white-collar workers.

  Although the insurance scheme was abolished altogether in 2000, since
2002 small firms receive a refund of the costs resulting from worker absences
caused by workplace accidents, including accidents while commuting.4




   4
   In 2005 a partial refund (for sick leaves of more than 10 days) was reintroduced for
small firms only.

4      Empirical approach

4.1     Data and identification strategy

We use register data from the Austrian Social Security Database (ASSD;
Zweimüller, Winter-Ebmer, Lalive, Kuhn, Wuellrich, Ruf and Büchi (2009)).
The data are matched employer-employee data, augmented with informa-
tion from the statutory health insurance for 1998 and 1999, which provide
information on the days on paid sick leave. The data cover all workers in
one large province, Upper Austria, which accounted for approximately 17.5
percent of workers and 18 percent of firms (NACE C-E) in Austria in 2000
(Statistik Austria, 2009). The data provide information on all employees in
dependent employment but do not include the self-employed or civil servants
and consist of 39,860 firms with monthly observations for January 1998 to
December 1999. During this period, small firms received a full refund for the
wage costs sustained for their sick blue-collar workers, whereas large firms
had to pay a deductible of 30 percent.

    In 1998 (1999), the threshold was e18,313.56 (e18,575.16), which corre-
sponded to approximately 10 full-time blue-collar workers if they were paid
the monthly median wage (e1,822). The regulation intentionally favored
smaller firms because they were assumed to have more problems and higher
costs covering sickness absences compared with larger firms. Figure 1 shows
the distribution of firms by their monthly social security payments. There
are relatively more small firms than large firms, the average firm has about
13 employees (median: 3) and the average social security payment (which is


                                     11
used to classify a firm as small or large) is e22,325 (median: e3,214).

Note: Observations are on the firm×month level. Threshold level in 1998:
e18,313.56; 1999: e18,575.16.



  We will estimate the causal effect of having to pay the deductible on sick-
ness behavior using a regression discontinuity design. A regression discon-
tinuity exploits that firms can only, if at all, imprecisely manipulate an as-
signment variable which determines treatment, in our case, the payment of
a deductible, or no treatment. The variation in the vicinity of the threshold
can be interpreted as if obtained from a randomized experiment (Imbens and
Lemieux, 2008). The approach identifies a local treatment effect which may
not apply to observations that are farther from the threshold.


                                     12
  We choose an interval of e1,500 on either side of the cut-off, this is some-
what greater than the mean blue-collar worker’s wage (e1,350). This results
in an estimating sample of 12,424 observations (firms × months).5

  Firms in which the total wage sum of two months’ earlier, the “assignment
variable”, exceeded the threshold were considered large firms. This discon-
tinuity will identify the causal effect of co-payments on sicknesses for firms
in the vicinity of the threshold. If there is no endogenous sorting of firms
around the threshold, any difference in sicknesses between small and large
firms can be attributed to the firms’ reactions to the deductible.

  The key identifying assumption for the causal interpretation of any dif-
ference in the vicinity of the threshold is that firms do not remain small to
avoid the deductible. While the deductible is sizeable—30 percent of direct
costs—we argue that firms have only imprecise control over the classification.
The classification of being a small or a large firm depended on the threshold,
which varied over time, and the firm’s wage bill from two months earlier.
Because a wage bill depends not only on the number of workers, but also
on promotions, industry-wide wage bargaining, and on turnover, firms have
only incomplete control over their classification.6
   5
      Figure 10 in the Appendix provides a comparison of the number of observations (firms
× months) in the vicinity of the threshold. Narrowing the interval from e1,500 on either
side of the cut-off to e1,000 lowers the number of available observations to about 10,000.
    6
      Industry-wide bargaining in Austria has a coverage rate of close to 100 percent, which
is exceptionally high in international comparison (Visser, 2011); this reduces the scope for
strategic (downward) wage flexibility considerably.




                                            13
4.2      Endogenous sorting

Endogenous sorting of firms would result in relatively more firms just below
the threshold than just above it, because the difference in the refund rate may
create an incentive to remain below the threshold, creating a discontinuity
in the density of the assignment variable. Figure 2 plots the density of the
assignment variable around the threshold for an interval of e5,000 on each
side of the threshold, with separate local polynomial regressions overlaid for
each side of the threshold.7 (We will restrict our analyses below to a more
narrow interval and will be using observations within e1,500 of the threshold
only.)

  The graph indicates that there is no discontinuity in the assignment vari-
able around the threshold. Lalive, Wuellrich and Zweimüller (2013) make
similar arguments and find no evidence of sorting in their sample.8 We be-
lieve that sorting is even less likely in our case because the wage bill is more
difficult to target than the number of workers, e.g., because of separations or
industry-wide collective bargaining.

  In addition, if firms sorted below the threshold, we would observe these
firms to grow more slowly than firms just above the threshold, in order to
remain in the more beneficial region. Formal tests for differences in the
growth rates show no statistically significant differences. A Wilcoxon-test
for the equality of the monthly growth rates of blue-collar (all) workers has a
   7
     We use Kovak’s and McCrary’s (2008) Stata program. Note that the continuous
density of the assignment variable is neither necessary nor sufficient for identification
except under auxiliary assumptions (McCrary, 2008).
   8
     Lalive et al. (2013) consider a threshold of 25 workers that requires firms to hire a
disabled worker (or pay a fine).

employment change of blue-collar workers in small and large firms around
the threshold is plotted in Figure 3. The graph plots the month-on-month
change in the number of blue-collar workers in percent, averaged for all firms
in each e50 interval on either side of the threshold, as well as separate local
polynomial regressions and their 95 percent confidence intervals. A graph
that plots the changes in the employment rates of all workers provides a
similar pattern, see Figure 11 in the Appendix.

tion of blue-collar workers in small firms might be greater than in large firms.
Figure 4 plots the average fractions in the vicinity of the threshold. The data
indicate that the fraction of blue-collar workers was about the same in both
small and large firms. The average fraction of blue-collar workers was 46.4
percent in small firms (SD: 35.4 percent; N=6,623) and 47.1 percent (SD: 35.3
percent; N=5,801) in large firms. A formal test cannot reject the equality of
means (Wilcoxon p-value: 0.28).

  Because firms get refunded for the wages paid to sick blue-collar workers,
they are likely to base their strategies not on the number of blue-collar work-
ers, but on the expected costs of sicknesses. The expected costs of sicknesses
for small firms consist of all indirect costs of a sickness absence, for example,

the hiring of temporary substitutes. For large firms, it is the sum of all indi-
rect costs plus the deductible, which is based on the number of sick days times
the workers’ wages. If firms react strategically to the threshold, we expect
that blue-collar workers obtain a greater wage share in small than in large
firms. The wage share is the fraction of wages that are paid to blue-collar
workers of all wages paid by the firm. We plot the distribution of blue-collar
workers’ wage shares in Figure 5, for all firms that are at most e1,500 from
the cut-off. The graph indicates no visible difference between small and large
firms. A formal test indicates that the blue-collar workers’ wage share is
about the same in both small (mean: 0.432 (SD: 0.36; N=6,623)) and large
firms (mean: 0.44 (SD: 0.36; N=5,801)), p-value of 0.14.


                                                     18
  Overall, the empirical evidence suggests that small firms did not remain
small strategically to avoid the deductible, nor did they hire strategically
more, or more expensive, blue-collar workers than large firms.

4.3    Descriptive statistics

We tabulate indicators of sickness in Table 2. The sickness indicators are
weighted by the blue-collar workers’ wage shares to account for differences
in the firms’ workforce compositions and wages. The weighting procedure
has the aim to reflect differences in the (potential) relevance of the refund

                                        19
scheme for the cost structure of firms.9 In Section 5 we present estimation
results using both weighted and unweighted data.

  We consider incidences, i.e., the sum of spells, and durations, i.e., the sum
of absent days, separately. We distinguish between a broad and a strict defi-
nition as it is not clear a prior whether firms react only to sickness days for
which wages have to be paid (strict definition), or also to sickness days for
which the workers receive sickness benefits from the social security (broad
definition). Under the broad definition, although a firm does not incur direct
costs through paid wages, greater indirect costs could result due to restruc-
turing or the hiring of replacement workers. In addition, we take into consid-
eration spells with different duration. Because four weeks was the minimum
period of paid sick leave (for blue-collar workers with tenure of less than five
years) we calculate a separate indicator for spells that lasted up to 28 days.
Since the moral hazard might be larger in the case of short sick leave spells,
whereas long absences are the result of severe illnesses or injuries and there-
fore difficult to influence, we provide a further indicator for spells that lasted
up to 14 days.

  Economic theory suggests that the deductible is an incentive for firms to
reduce their workers’ sickness absences and we expect to observe fewer or
shorter sickness spells in large than in small firms. All indicators in Table 2
indicate that, in contrast to our expectations, larger firms have on average
   9
     The intuition behind this approach is that the strength of the incentive for firms to
influence their workers’ sick leave is a function of their blue-collar workers’ wage share.
This becomes evident if we think of two firms that have exactly the same wage bill, but
where one firm has only one blue-collar worker on its payroll whereas the other firm
employs only blue-collar workers.

5      Results

Figures 6 and 7 plot the average incidences and durations in intervals for
observations within e1,500 of the threshold. Only spells where firms pay
wages while a worker is on sickness absence are considered and we do not
impose an upper limit on the spells. The interval around the threshold is
segmented into smaller intervals of e50 width, “bins”, and the mean value
for each bin is represented by a dot. For each side of the threshold, we plot a
fourth-order polynomial and the 95 percent confidence interval. The figures
indicate that there are no differences between small and large firms as there
is considerable overlap of the CI at the threshold.

    Local linear estimates (using a triangle kernel) for each side of the threshold
confirm that small and large firms do not differ in their blue-collar workers’
sickness incidences or durations. The estimates of the discontinuity are tab-
ulated in Table 3 for different bandwidths and for different distances to the
threshold. The optimal bandwidths are calculated according to Imbens and
Kalyanaraman (2012) and differ for each interval and indicator. To gauge
sensitivity to the choice of bandwidth, estimates using the optimal band-
width, half the optimal bandwidth, and twice the optimal bandwidth are
tabulated. Figures 8 and 9 plot estimated treatment effects and their 95
percent confidence intervals for a range of different bandwidths.

    Most estimates are not statistically significant at conventional error levels;
those that are statistically significant estimate that large firms, not small
firms, had more and longer sickness absences. We estimate that the de-
ductible causes about 4 more sickness days in large firms (however, this effect

                                         23
is imprecisely estimated) and does not lead to a different number of incidents.

blue-collar workers’ wage share.




  Table 4 indicates that it is neither the chosen indicator nor the choice of
weighting the indicator that leads to this result. The estimated treatment
effects are similar to those described above, i.e., most are not statistically
significant at conventional levels and indicate rather that large firms have
more and longer absences than small firms.

  We interpret our findings that the deductible is too low to induce manage-
ment responses. The deductible is based on the wages paid to sick workers.

per day was, averaged over the two years for these firms, about e44.3. The
deductible for the total yearly sickness costs, some e3,988, amounts to about
e1,196. This corresponds to 7.4 percent of an average blue-collar worker’s
annual wage (12 × 1,347.78), or 1.1 percent of the average total blue-collar

6      Summary and Conclusion

Using detailed administrative data for Austria, we examined the effect of a
deductible on the sickness incidences and durations in firms near an admin-
istrative threshold. Austria is representative for other European countries
which have universal social security and provides an instructive benchmark
for the design of sick leave insurance. Compulsory social insurance insured
firms for the wages they were required to pay their blue-collar workers in
case of sickness. Based on an administrative threshold, small firms received
all of the paid wages, while large firms were required to pay a deductible of
30 percent. Under the assumption that firms near the threshold have only
imperfect control over whether they are regarded as a small or a large firm,
our empirical approach allows us to detect causal changes in sicknesses due
to a change in the deductible.

    Detailed empirical analyses indicate that small firms did neither hire rela-
tively more blue-collar workers than large firms, nor do we detect any differ-
ences in firms’ growth rates by whether they are large or small. In addition,
all other characteristics, for example, the number of female workers or the
fraction of workers who were older than 55, do not systematically differ by
firm size.

    Our empirical results do not indicate any causal effect of the deductible on
the sickness absences. This finding is robust to different indicators of sick-
ness, i.e., the number of spells and the number of sickness days, and to the
distinction whether a firm had to continue to pay wages or not. We inter-
pret our findings that the deductible is too moderate to induce management

                                       30
responses. The deductible is based on the wages paid to sick workers and,
for the firms in our sample, amounts to 1.1 percent of the average total blue-
collar wage bill in a firm. A different interpretation of our results is that,
because workers have to undergo a medical check to examine their sickness,
there is very little room for moral hazard. We reject this explanation, be-
cause Böheim and Leoni (2011) show that once the insurance was removed,
sickness incidences (and days on paid sick leave) were reduced.

  Our results can be linked to earlier research on the effect of insurance
deductibles on health care utilization. Aron-Dine, Einav and Finkelstein
(2013), in a re-appraisal of the RAND insurance experiment, stress that
perhaps the single robust finding of this landmark experiment is to show
that the design of health insurance contracts impacts medical spending. The
price elasticity of demand for health care and therefore the magnitude of the
moral hazard effect of insurance is however an unsettled empirical question.
Chiappori et al. (1998), for example, find that the introduction of a small
copayment rate in France did not lead to fewer GP office consultations.10
Evidence on the moral hazard effects of deductibles is however mixed (Gerfin
and Schellhorn, 2006).

  In our case, the deductible must be contrasted with the total costs resulting
from work loss due to absence, which might be substantially larger than the
wage (Pauly et al., 2002). Finally, the relatively small deductible might be
dominated by other costs a firm might face if it were to (aggressively) lower
sickness absences, such as increased monitoring costs and possible negative
 10
      Although they do estimate a small negative effect on the number of GP home visits.

effects on worker motivation. In a laboratory experiment, Duersch, Oechssler
and Vadovic (2012) show that workers reciprocate generous sick pay with
higher effort.

  Before drawing policy conclusions, it has to be kept in mind that our results
are based on a comparison of firms within a narrow range of the threshold,
firms that lie outside this range might exhibit different reactions to the de-
ductible. (However, given the small monetary amounts involved, we consider
this unlikely.) Moreover, we must be careful when generalizing findings to
other countries as different sick leave regulations and institutional comple-
mentarities might lead to different responses by both firms and workers.

A      Comparison Austria - USA

A.1      Institutional differences
Austria and the United States have substantially different regulations of em-
ployees’ sick leaves. The United States are one of the few OECD countries
without nation-wide legal requirements for paid sick leave (Heymann, Rho,
Schmitt and Earle, 2010).11 In recent years, a handful of jurisdictions in
the United States passed local paid sick time laws.12 In addition, five of
the 50 States passed temporary disability legislation that ensures pay during
absences only for long-term illnesses (i.e., in cases where workers need to ad-
dress serious health conditions that require lengthier treatment and recovery
periods). There are however no federal legal requirements for paid sick leave.
Unlike Austria, in the United States it is essentially the employer’s decision
to provide workers with paid sick leave provisions.
   This fundamental difference determines a large gap in worker benefit cov-
erage rates between Austria and United States. Whereas in Austria virtually
all workers are entitled to continued wage payment and sick pay, paid sick
leave coverage in the US is limited and varies greatly depending on firm and
worker characteristics.
   In 2012, 66 percent of civilian workers (61 percent of private and 89 percent
of state and local government workers) were covered by paid sick leave (Bu-
reau of Labor Statistics, 2012).13 High-skilled, full-time, and unionized work-
ers as well as those working in large establishments are much more likely than
other types of workers to receive compensation while on sick leave. Whereas
almost 90 percent of workers in managerial or professional occupations are
covered by paid sick leave, the share drops to 54 percent for production work-
ers and 47 percent of service workers. Only 25 percent of part-time workers
are entitled to paid sick leave, against 79 percent of full-time workers. These
differences are mirrored in a strong gradient along the wage distribution: 90
percent of workers in the top decile, but only 20 percent in the bottom decile
of the wage distribution are entitled to paid sick leave.
  Moreover, there is considerable heterogeneity in the type of sick leave pro-
  11
     According to Scheil-Adlung and Sandner (2010) as many as 145 countries provide for
paid sick leave.
  12
     San Francisco, Washington D.C., Portland, Seattle, and recently New York passed
paid sick leave ordinances at the city level. Connecticut has the only statewide paid sick
leave policy, although the Connecticut law applies only to employers with at least 50
employees and eligibility is restricted to service workers.

visions. Most entitled workers participate in paid sick leave plans in which a
fixed number of days of paid sick leave are provided each year. These work-
ers typically receive 5 to 9 days of sick leave per year. About one fifth of
workers with paid sick leave receive this benefit through a “consolidated leave
plan”14 , whereas a minority of workers (10 percent) receive paid sick leave on
an as-needed basis, in plans that do not specify the maximum number of sick
days that could be taken (Barthold and Ford, 2012). In Austria, the only
differences in sick pay entitlement arise from different tenures. Until 2000,
blue-collar workers were entitled to two weeks less continued wage payment
than white-collar workers at each level of tenure (see Section 4). Since 2001,
the sick pay legislation for blue-collar and white-collar workers are virtually
the same, the only difference being that the overall number of sick days in a
given calender year is fixed for blue-collar workers, but not for white-collar
workers.
   Part of the American workforce is covered by federal provisions that allow
for unpaid health-related leave periods. The most important legislation in
this respect is the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) of 1993. Under the
FMLA, eligible workers can take unpaid leave to recover from a serious illness.
Employees are eligible to take FMLA leave if they have worked full-time for
their employer for at least 12 months, and work at a location where at least
50 employees are employed by the employer within 75 miles. According to
survey information from the year 2012, close to 60 percent of all employees are
eligible for the Act (Klerman, Daley and Pozniak, 2012). The Americans with
Disability Act (ADA) of 1990 (amended 2008), requires covered employers to
provide reasonable accommodations to qualified individuals with disabilities.
Reasonable accommodations may include unpaid leave, as employers may
have to allow disabled employees to take more unpaid leave than is provided
by their leave policy. The ADA is applicable to employers with 15 or more
employees.
   Interestingly, in spite of all the differences there exist some parallels in the
treatment of sick leave in Austria and the USA, particularly when we look at
strategies to differentiate the impact of negative effects from sickness absence
across firms of different size. Both in the United States and in Austria sick
leave regulations tend to be more favorable for small than for large employers.
In Austria this differential treatment is expressed by the fact that since 1974
(and with exception of the short period between September 2000 and January
2002), small firms receive a preferential treatment in the reimbursement of
costs sustained for sick employees.

    In which multiple forms of leave are combined into one plan and workers can allocate
days between various uses as they choose.

                                          39
   In the United States, small employers are exempted from both FMLA and
ADA. In addition, employees in small firms are significantly less likely to be
eligible for paid sick days and paid sick leave coverage increases with firm size.
The variation of paid sick pay coverage with firm size can be seen in Table 5.
The coverage rate in firms with 500 or more workers is about 86 percent and
exceeds that for small firms (less than 50 workers) by 35 percentage points.
The difference is more pronounced in the private sector than in the public
sector. As a general rule, access to employer-provided benefits is greater in
medium and large private firms than in small establishments (see for instance
Diaz and Wallick 2009), but the availability of paid sick leave varies more
over firm size than the availability of other benefits such as paid holidays and
paid vacation.15

A.2      Sick leave rates in Austria and the United States
In spite of the economic relevance of health-related absenteeism, there is no
standardized definition for the measurement of sickness absences and inter-
nationally comparable data are scarce. Existing evidence for industrialized
countries suggests that sickness absence rates in the United States tend to be
low by international standards, although the exact ranking between countries
can vary considerably depending on the data source (Bonato and Lusinyan,
  15
    Paid vacation and paid holidays are available to 67 percent of workers in small and
78 percent (paid vacation) and 82 percent (paid holidays) in large establishments. Source:

2007; Osterkamp and Roehn, 2007; Rae, 2005; Scheil-Adlung and Sandner,
2010; Ziebarth and Karlsson, 2010). Austria is usually found in the middle
of international rankings, whereas Scandinavian countries such as Sweden
and Norway as well as some Eastern European countries such as the Czech
Republic typically display the highest absence rates.
   We compare official statistics from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)
with equivalent data for the Austrian workforce to provide a first glance on
how institutions might shape sickness absences. The BLS publishes regu-
larly Labor Force Statistics from the Current Population Survey (CPS) that
contain information on different types of absence from work. One of these
categories is related to absences due to illness, injury, and medical problems
and can be interpreted as synthetic measure for health-related absences. The
BLS provides two indicators, the absence rate and the lost worktime rate,
which serve to indicate the extent of sickness related absences. The absence
rate is the ratio of workers with absences to total full-time wage and salary
employees and indicates the incidence of health-related absences in a reference
week. The lost worktime rate is the number of hours absent as a percentage
of hours usually worked. This is a measure for the total volume of absences.
Following the definitions provided by the BLS, we have constructed analo-
gous indicators for Austria using micro-data from the Austrian Labor Force
Survey (AKE).
   The results of our calculations are tabulated and compared to the BLS
data in Tables 6 and 7. Please note however that the surveys provide only
partial information on the total volume of sick leave because the data is
right-censored: absences that began in the reference week but continued in
the following week enter the statistic only with the fraction of worktime lost
in the reference week.
   As we can see from the Tables, health-related absences are more frequent
in Austria than in the United States. In particular, over the period 2006–
2012 the absence rate of the total workforce aged 16 years+ in Austria has
risen from about 2.3 percent to about 2.8 percent, while it has been falling
in the US from 2.3 percent to 2.1 percent. Confirming findings from previous
research, we can observe that in both countries women are sick more often
than men and workers in the public sector more often than those in the
private sector.
   However, the difference between the two countries is more pronounced
when we consider the volume of hours lost due to absences. The data indicate
that, depending on the year, two to three times as many working hours were
lost due to sickness absences in Austria than in the US. Similarly to the


                                      41
absence rate, the lost worktime rates has increased in Austria and decreased
in the US during 2006–2012. This divergent development over time could
be related to a number of factors, such as differences in business cycle or
changes in workforce composition, but we do not have enough elements to
verify these possible explanations.
   Several studies have documented that the availability and level of sick pay
benefits have an impact on sick leave incidences and durations. For a recent
survey of the literature on this issue see Ziebarth and Karlsson (2010), who
come to the conclusion that “all [of the aforementioned studies] find that
employees adapt their absence behavior to increases and decreases in benefit
levels” (p.1108). In this respect, the difference in sick leave that we observe
according to Labor Force Statistics falls in line with expectations.
   For the purpose of our research, it would be particularly interesting to
compare differences in absence rates across firm size in the two countries, but
no data on sickness absences by firm size are published by an official source
for either the United States or Austria. For Austria, our own calculations
(see Table 2) do however show that absence rates are substantially lower in
small firms than in large firms (i.e., sickness absences are inversely related to
firm size). This finding corroborates the expectations from economic theory
as well as previous empirical findings for Austria (Böheim and Leoni, 2011)
and other countries (e.g., Winkelmann 1999, Ercolani 2006, Barmby, Ercolani
and Treble 2002). Evidence for the United States by Vistnes (1997) shows
that men and women in firms of less than 10 employees were significantly
less likely to miss work than workers in firms with more than 500 workers.

Note: Absence rates due to illness or injury. Based on full-time workers only. Absences are
defined as instances when persons who usually work 35 or more hours per week (full-time)
worked fewer than 35 hours during the reference week because of own illness, injury or
medical problems. For multiple jobholders, absence data refer only to work missed at their
main jobs. The absence rate is the ratio of workers with absences to total full-time wage
and salary employment and expresses the incidence of sickness absence in the reference
week. Data for USA: CPS, BLS calculations; data for Austria: AKE, WIFO calculations.
