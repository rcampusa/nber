                                                ABSTRACT

A decision maker constructs a convex set of nonnegative martingales to use as likelihood ratios that
represent parametric alternatives to a baseline model and also non-parametric models statistically close
to both the baseline model and the parametric alternatives. Max-min expected utility over that set gives
rise to equilibrium prices of model uncertainty expressed as worst-case distortions to drifts in a representative
investor's baseline model. We offer quantitative illustrations for baseline models of consumption dynamics
that display long-run risk. We describe a set of parametric alternatives that generates countercyclical
prices of uncertainty.

        In what circumstances is a minimax solution reasonable? I suggest that it is
        reasonable if and only if the least favorable initial distribution is reasonable
        according to your body of beliefs. Good (1952)


1       Introduction
Acknowledging that a model is an approximation concedes that one of a myriad of statisti-
cally similar alternative models might be correct. This paper proposes a new way to imagine
how a decision maker forms that set of alternative models and then provides an application
to equilibrium asset pricing.1 We extend work by Hansen and Sargent (2001) and Hansen
et al. (2006) that described a decision maker who expresses distrust of a single baseline
probability model having a finite number of parameters by surrounding it with an infinite
dimensional family of difficult-to-learn-about alternative models. The decision maker rep-
resents these alternative models by multiplying baseline probabilities with likelihood ratios
whose entropies relative to the baseline model are less than a bound that makes alternative
models stay statistically close to the baseline model. He wants to evaluate outcomes under
these alternative models.2
    This paper differs from Hansen et al. (2006) by refining how a decision maker forms a
set of models surrounding a baseline model. A new object appears here: a quadratic func-
tion of a Markov state that describes alternative parametric models that we use to “tilt”
discrepancy measures so that statistical neighborhoods include these alternative parametric
models. The decision maker wants valuations that are robust to these models in addition
to unspecified models expressed as before by multiplying the baseline model by likelihood
ratios. The quadratic function can be constructed to include alternatives with either fixed
or time varying parameters, and also less structured models inside a convex set Z of martin-
gales that we use to pose a robust decision problem. We offer a quantitative example that
illustrates how the set Z more concisely expresses concerns about particular parametric
alternatives than does a set Z ˚ used by Hansen et al. (2006).

     Tractable ways to specify priors and compute posteriors facilitated a revolution in applied Bayesian
statistics. We require an analogous practical science if the max-min expected utility decision theory ele-
gantly axiomatized by Gilboa and Schmeidler (1989), Maccheroni et al. (2006a,b), and Strzalecki (2011) is
to enlist a community of applied researchers. Viewing a set of models as a decision maker’s way of coping
with approximation issues is a perspective that complements theoretical work about axioms.
   2
     Applications of what Hansen and Sargent (2001) and Maccheroni et al. (2006a,b) call multiplier pref-
erences to macroeconomic policy design and dynamic incentive problems include Karantounias (2013) and
Bhandari (2014).


                                                    2
    We apply our approach to an investor who represents “the market” and whose specifi-
cation uncertainty affects prices of exposures to underlying economic shocks. We describe
how our tilted discrepancy method for constructing the set of probability models Z affects
uncertainty components of these shock exposures. Our continuous-time specification sim-
plifies asset pricing. A key object is an endogenously determined vector of worst-case drift
distortions to a baseline model.3 The negative of the drift distortion vector equals the vec-
tor of market prices of model uncertainty that compensate investors for facing ambiguity
about probabilities that describe random fluctuations.
    A new mechanism amplifies and makes uncertainty prices fluctuate. We introduce no
new risks associated with stochastic volatility.4 Instead, we amplify the prices of exposures
to the “original” shocks. Fluctuations in those prices reflect investors’ struggles to confront
doubts about the baseline model. We study how uncertainty prices vary across investment
horizons.
    Section 2 specifies an investor’s baseline probability model and martingale perturbations
to it. Section 3 describes statistical measures of discrepancies between martingales and uses
one such measure to construct and characterize a convex set of probability measures. This
set contains neighborhoods around both a baseline probability model and members of a
family of parametric alternatives to the baseline model. We express the set of probabilities
in terms of a set Z of martingales. This martingale representation proves to be a tractable
way for us to formulate robust decision problems in sections 5 and 8.
    Section 4 uses Chernoff entropy to construct a set of martingales Zq associated with
discriminating between competing specifications of probabilities. Section 5 formulates a
robust planning problem that generates a worst-case model that we use in conjunction
with the Chernoff entropy set Zq to calibrate key parameters of the convex set Z. By ex-
tending estimates from Hansen and Sargent (2010) and Hansen et al. (2008), respectively,
section 6 calculates key objects for two quantitative versions of a baseline model together
with convex sets of alternative models that concern a robust investor and a robust plan-
ner. Section 7 uses one of our quantitative models to compare the convex set Z with two
other sets featured in Anderson et al. (2003) and Hansen and Sargent (2010), the set Zq
based on Chernoff entropy, and a set Z ˚ based on relative entropy. Section 8 constructs a
   3
    That object also played a central role in the analysis of Hansen and Sargent (2010).

    By way of contrast, models in which a representative investor’s consumption process has innovations
with stochastic volatility introduce new risk exposures in the form of the shocks to volatilities. Their
presence induces time variation in equilibrium compensations for exposures to shocks that include both
the stochastic volatility shocks as well as the “original” shocks whose volatilities now move.

recursive representation of a competitive equilibrium of an economy with a representative
investor.5 Then it links the worst-case model that emerges from a robust planning prob-
lem to equilibrium compensations that the representative investor earns for bearing model
uncertainty. Section 9 describes a term structure of market prices of uncertainty. Our equi-
librium features an exponential quadratic stochastic discount factor whose mathematical
form closely resembles one that Ang and Piazzesi (2003) used in a no-arbitrage statistical
model of asset prices and macroeconomic variables. Section 10 explains why our approach
differs in conceptually and practically important ways from one advocated by Epstein and
Schneider (2003). Section 11 offers concluding remarks. Six technical appendices include
formulas that we used to create quantitative examples.


2       Models and perturbations
This section describes nonnegative martingales that perturb a probability model. Section 3
then describes how we use a family of parametric alternative to the baseline model to form
a convex set of martingales that in later sections we use to pose robust decision problems.


2.1     Mathematical framework
For concreteness, we use a specific benchmark model here and then in section 3 a specific
                                                                                  .

The sextet pµ̂, φ̂, β̂, κ̂, α, σq characterizes the baseline model.7

     In earlier papers, we sometimes referred to what we now call the baseline model as the decision maker’s
approximating model or benchmark model.

Imposing the initial condition Z0H “ 1, we express the solution of a stochastic differential
equation (2) as the stochastic exponential:

The stochastic exponential is a local martingale, but not necessarily a martingale.9

Definition 2.1. Z denotes the set of all martingales Z H constructed as a stochastic
exponential via representation (5) with some progressively measurable H relative to to
F “ tFt : t ě 0u and satisfying (4).

    Starting from the probability distribution associated with the baseline model (1), H
represents another probability distribution conditioned on F0 . To construct this alternative
probability measure, take any Ft -measurable random variable Yt and multiply it by ZtH
before computing expectations conditioned on X0 . Associated with H are probabilities
defined by
                                                 “           ‰

     8
    James (1992), Chen and Epstein (2002), and Hansen et al. (2006) used this representation.

    While there are sufficient conditions for the stochastic exponential to be a martingale such as Kaza-
maki’s or Novikov’s, they are not convenient here. Instead we will verify that an extremum does indeed
result in a martingale.

for any t ě 0 and any bounded Ft -measurable random variable Bt . Thus, the positive ran-
dom variable ZtH acts as a Radon-Nikodym derivative for the date t conditional expectation
operator E H r ¨ |X0 s. The martingale property of the process Z H ensures that conditional
expectations operators for different dates satisfy a Law of Iterated Expectations. Moreover,
                                     şt
under the Z H probability measure, 0 |Hu |2 du is finite with probability one for each T .
    Although W is a standard Brownian motion under the baseline model, under the alter-
native H model it has increments

                                       dWt “ Ht dt ` dWtH ,                                       (6)

where W H is a now standard Brownian motion. Moreover, under the Z H probability mea-
      şt
sure, 0 |Hu |2 du is finite with probability one for each t. While (3) expresses the evolution
of log Z H in terms of increment dW , the evolution in terms of dW H is:

                                                       1
                                d log ZtH “ Ht ¨ dWtH ` |Ht |2 dt.                                (7)
                                                       2

In light of (7), we can write model (1) as:
                                 ´         ¯
                 d log Ct “ p.01q µ̂ ` β̂Xt dt ` p.01qα ¨ Ht dt ` p.01qα ¨ dWtH

                                                                               .01
which implies that C has a (local) growth rate µ̂ ` β̂Xt ` α ¨ Ht `             2

model.10


3      Quantifying probability distortions
We retreat cautiously from rational expectations by assuming that because agents bear
model uncertainty they want to evaluate outcomes under alternative models that are diffi-
cult to distinguish on the basis of a finite history of data.11 We formulate families of models
by using measures of statistical discrepancy around a baseline model. By characterizing
alternatives to a baseline model in terms of likelihood ratio processes sufficiently close to
unity, we include a vast set of models with nonlinearities, time-varying parameters, history

   The growth rate includes a multiplication by 100 that offsets one of the .01’s.
  11
   Rational expectations assumes that something (an infinite history of data?) has eliminated decision
makers’ model uncertainty.

dependence, and other difficult-to-learn features.


3.1    Measures of discrepancy
We construct discounted versions of statistical discrepancy measures. Consider a martingale
Z H in Z and a twice differentiable convex function f pzq defined for z ě 0 and satisfying
f p1q “ 0 and f 2 p1q “ 1. By Jensen’s Inequality
                                         “ ` ˘     ‰
                                        E f ZtH |F0 ě 0,                                 (8)

which holds with equality when ZtH is one with probability one conditioned on F0 . Exam-
ples of f include a family suggested by Cressie and Read (1984):

                                                   1    ` r`1 ˘
                                     f pzq “             z ´1                            (9)
                                               rp1 ` rq

for alternative choices of r.
    Except when r “ ´ 12 , these discrepancy measures are not metrics. Nevertheless, they
can be used to define neighborhoods of a given model. The class of discrepancies defined by
(9) contains interesting special cases. When r “ ´1, the discrepancy defined by (9) is the
negative of the expected log-likelihood. When r “ ´ 12 , we get the Hellinger discrepancy.

                                            f pzq “ z log z,

is called relative entropy and is of especial interest to us. This discrepancy is an expected
log likelihood ratio with respect to the z-perturbed model.

Later we will refer to a more rigorous justification in the context of an important special
case in which r “ 0.

where the second equality follows from integration by parts. Formula (10) quantifies how
a martingale Z H distorts baseline model probabilities. We call the r “ 0 formulation
discounted relative entropy after Hansen and Sargent (2001). Hansen et al. (2006) provide
a formal justification for (10) when r “ 0.13 The r “ 0 case is the most tractable one to
use in decision problems. Later we will compare sets of models associated with several
measures of statistical discrepancy.


3.2       Tilting the discrepancy measure
The statistical discrepancy measure defined in (10) allows a decision maker to include a
large class of statistically similar models, but it is not the most convenient way to include
particular parametric models. To do that it is better to tilt the discrepancy measure in the
following way. Let
                                      fˆpz, ζq “ f pzq ´ ζz.                             (11)

Evidently, fˆ is strictly convex in z. Construct a process
                                                       żt

      There exist a variety of sufficient conditions that justify this equality.

In section 3.3, we exhibit ξpxq functions that represent specific alternative models.
    As an initial step to form a tractable set of models for discounted dynamic control
problems, we set r “ 0 and δ to the same rate that discounts instantaneous utilities. This
yields:

is a convex set of martingales that is not empty because it contains Z 0 “ 1. We are
interested in the non degenerate case in which ξpxq satisfies
Condition 3.1.

                           2 0
One way to satisfy condition 3.1 is to set ξpxq ą 0 for all x. There are other ways too. In
some of our applications, we set ξp0q “ 0 but still satisfy condition 3.1.
    So far, we have used a convex function to build a convex set of martingales, but have
not constructed an associated tilted discrepancy. We could construct a discrepancy by
             p H |xq by choice of H. Call the minimized objective ∆˚ pxq. Since H “ 0 is
minimizing ∆pZ
a feasible choice, ∆˚ pxq satisfies
                                     ż8

                                2     0


The resulting discrepancy is :

                                         . p h

Tilting means that this discrepancy is zero at the minimizing choice of H that attains
∆˚ pxq, not at H “ 0. The convex set is the object that matters in our analysis, not the
discrepancy or the threshold used to construct the set. That means that to carry out the
                                                              p H |xq.

3.3    Alternative parametric models
We can include specific alternative models within the set Zpxq
                                                          p    defined in (14) by choosing
ξ ě 0 appropriately. Notice that ∆p1|xq
                                  p     “ 0. If

                                         |Ht |2 ď ξpXt q,                                    (15)

then
                                         p H |xq ď 0,
                                         ∆pZ                                                 (16)

so that the corresponding Z H P Zpxq.
                                 p
    We now construct ξ by specifying parametric alternatives to our baseline model. Con-
sider alternatives to baseline model (1) of the following form:

                           d log Ct “ .01 pµ ` βXt q dt ` .01α ¨ dWtH
                              dXt “ φdt ´ κXt dt ` σ ¨ dWtH ,                                (17)

where W H is a Brownian motion and (6) continues to describe the relationship between the
processes W and W H . Here pµ̂, φ̂, β̂, κ̂q are parameters of the baseline model (1), pµ, φ, β, κq
are parameters of model (17), and pα, σq are parameters common to both models. Not all
specifications included in the set of models that concern the decision maker will be of this
form. However, a worst-case model that plays an important role in shaping uncertainty
prices will be.
    Suppose that we want drift distortions H for W to represent models in the parametric
class defined by (17). We can express model (17) in terms of our section 2.1 structure by
setting
                                   Ht “ ηpXt q ” η0 ` η1 Xt

and using (1), (6), and (17) to deduce the following restrictions on η0 and η1 as functions
of pµ, φ, β, κq:
                                      « ff      «        ff
                                       α1        µ ´ µ̂
                                           η0 “
                                       σ1         φ ´ φ̂
                                      « ff      «        ff
                                         1
                                       α         β ´ β̂
                                         1
                                           η1 “             .                                (18)
                                       σ          κ̂ ´ κ

By imposing restrictions (18), we can find pairs pη0 , η1 q that represent members of a class

                                                10
of models having parametric form (17).
   We further restrict a family of parametric models by using the nonnegative quadratic
function ξpxq defined in (13) to express a collection of alternatives to a baseline model. For
example, to induce ξ to include a prespecified κ̃, form

                             .                       1
                        ξpxq “ ξ0 ` 2ξ1 x ` ξ2 x2 “     2
                                                          pκ̃ ´ κ̂q2 x2 .
                                                    |σ|

With this choice of ξ, κ “ κ̃ and κ “ 2κ̂ ´ κ̃ become alternative parameter configurations
defining models included in a neighborhood of the baseline model. More generally, we can
set pµ̃, φ̃, β̃, κ̃q and then compute η̃1 and η̃1 by solving a counterpart to (18). Then

                                     ξpxq “ |η̃0 ` η̃1 x|2 .

Definition 3.2. Z o is a set of martingales Z H constructed by (i) selecting a pair pη0 , η1 q
that satisfies (18) for some pµ, φ, β, κq, (ii) pinning down an associated Ht “ η0 ` η1 Xt ,
(iii) constructing an implied martingale Z H via (2), and (iv) restricting |Ht |2 ď ξpXt q.

By in effect setting ξ to a constant, Hansen and Sargent (2001) and Hansen et al. (2006)
included only parametric alternatives that alter µ̂ and φ̂.
    Next we shall construct a larger convex set of martingales that contains Z o as well as
models that depart from the parametric structure (17). Applying Bayes’ rule to mixture
models provides one motivation for being interested in a larger set.


3.4    Convexity and Bayes rule
Convexity of a set of martingales allows us to use Bayes rule to update probabilities and
motivates our interest in weighted averages of martingales. We now apply Bayes’ rule to
                                                     1         2
two models characterized by H 1 and H 2 for which Z H and Z H are in Zpxq;
                                                                       p     for example,
  1       2
H and H might both be affine functions of X and correspond to two time invariant
parameter models. Let π01 be a prior probability on model H 1 and π02 “ 1 ´ π01 be a prior
on model H 2 . A martingale
                                             1         2
                                 M “ π01 M H ` π02 M H
                                                                  1         2
corresponds to a mixture of the H 1 and H 2 models. Like M H and M H , the mathematical
expectation of M conditioned on date zero information equals unity. The law of motion



                                               11

                                   “Mt pπt1 Ht1 ` πt2 Ht2 q ¨ dWt

where πtj is the date t posterior

The drift distortion

associated with the mixture model is typically not an affine function of X even when both
H1 and H2 are.
   To construct a larger convex set of martingales that contains Z o as well as models that
depart from the parametric structure (17) we define:

Definition 3.3.
                                                                 (
                                   Zr “ Z H P Z : |Ht |2 ď ξpXt q                                      (19)

for all t with probability one.

While martingales Z H in Z o represent models with time-invariant parameters, martingales
Z H in Zr represent models whose parameters vary over time. We want also to include
models that statistically are arbitrarily close to models implied by martingales in Z,r nany
of which don’t satisfy an instant-by-instant constraint like the inequality on the right side
of (3.3). For this reason, we construct a larger family of martingales by replacing the
instant-by-instant inequality in the definition (19) of Zr with restrictions cast in terms of
intertemporal probability-weighted averages of |Ht |2 that allow the intertemporal trade-offs
associated with likelihood-ratio statistical model discrimination criteria.14
  14
     The ambiguity averse decision maker of Chen and Epstein (2002) considers a set of models characterized
by martingales that are generated by h processes that satisfy instant-by-instant constraints on h like (19).
Anderson et al. (1998) also explored consequences of this type of constraint without the state dependence
in ξ.




                                                    12
3.5     Relative entropy neighborhoods
Building on Petersen et al. (2000), we constructed the set Zpxq
                                                              p      to include relative entropy
neighborhoods of alternative parametric models as well as of a baseline model. This differ-
entiates our approach from work by James (1992), Hansen and Sargent (2001), and Hansen
et al. (2006), who constructed a set of models as a relative entropy neighborhood of a
baseline model only.
   To construct relative entropy with respect to the probability model affiliated with a
martingale Z Ĥ , we use a likelihood ratio log ZtH ´ log ZtH with respect to the ZtH model
                                                            p                           p

We have recycled the notation ∆ to include two martingales as arguments. Implicitly the
second argument Z H was set to one in our previous analysis.

   Given this measure, we form relative entropy neighborhoods about a martingale Z H :

measures that are statistically close to the measure implied by Z H . The set Zpxq includes

3.6    Averaging over an initial state distribution
So far we have conditioned on the initial state x, as was often done in previous research. In
this paper, we will have cause to average of the this state using a probability distribution
Q over initial states:                     ż
                                    H        p H |xqQpdxq.
                               ∆pZ q ” ∆pZ                                               (20)

The probability distribution Q can be a point mass at some initial state or it can be a
stationary probability distribution of X under the baseline model. Later we suggest yet
other ways to choose Q.
    We construct a convex set Z of martingales Z H :

Definition 3.5.
                                                        (
                               Z “ Z H P Z : ∆pZ H q ď 0 .                               (21)

Choosing ξpxq appropriately makes Z include martingales that are associated with paramet-
ric probability models like those studied in this section as well as many other specifications
that are not included in a parametric family and that may not be Markovian.
    In section 8, we pose a robust decision problem in which Z serves as a set of positive
martingales multiplying baseline model probabilities. Evidently, both the baseline model
(1) and the alternative models captured by the quadratic function ξpxq play important
roles in constructing the set Z. The quadratic function ξpxq also shapes another convex
set Zp that we use to calibrate plausible sets of models in section 4.
    The following set inclusions summarize our constructions so far:

               set           Zo       Ă           Zr       Ă           Z
            contains parametric            time-varying         relative-entropy
                     alternatives           parameters           neighborhoods


4     Chernoff entropy
The set Z defined in (21) is tractable to use in decision problems, but an alternative set
Zq emerges from studying how, by disguising probability distortions of a baseline model,
Brownian motions make it challenging to distinguish models statistically. To construct

                                             14
Zq we use Chernoff (1952) entropy, which differs from discounted relative entropy. While
Chernoff entropy’s connection to a statistical decision problem makes it interesting, it is
less tractable than relative entropy for formulating robust decision problems.
    In the spirit of Anderson et al. (2003), we use Chernoff (1952) entropy to measure
a distortion Z to a baseline model. Think of a pairwise model selection problem that
statistically compares the baseline model (1) with a model generated by the martingale
Z H . The logarithm of the martingale evolves according to

                                             1
                                d log ZtH “ ´ |Ht |2 dt ` Ht ¨ dWt .
                                             2

Consider a statistical model selection rule based on a data history of length t that takes the
form log ZtH ě log τ , where ZtH is the likelihood ratio associated with the alternative model
for a sample size t. Consider a model selection rule that incorrectly chooses the alternative
model when the baseline model governs the data. We bound the probably of this outcome
by using an argument from large deviations theory that starts from

           1tlog Z H ěτ u “ 1t´sτ `s log Z H ě0u “ 1texpp´sτ qpZ H qs ě1u ď expp´sτ qpZtH qs .
                  t                       t                     t



This inequality holds for 0 ď s ď 1. The expectation of the term on the left side equals
the probability of mistakenly selecting the alternative model when the data are a sample
of size t generated by the baseline model. We bound this mistake probability for large t by
following Donsker and Varadhan (1976) and Newman and Stuck (1979) and studying

                 1      “         ` ˘s        ‰         1     “` ˘s        ‰
       lim sup     log E expp´sτ q ZtH |X0 “ x “ lim sup log E ZtH |X0 “ x
         tÑ8     t                                 tÑ8  t

for alternative choices of r. The threshold τ does not affect this limit. Furthermore, the
limit is often independent of the initial state X0 “ x. To get the best bound, we compute

                                              1      “` ˘s       ‰
                               inf lim sup      log E ZtH |X0 “ x ,
                             0ďsď1    tÑ8     t

a limit that is typically negative because mistake probabilities decay with sample size.
Chernoff entropy is then

                                                        1      “` ˘s       ‰

                                                   15
Appendix B describes how to compute Chernoff entropy for competing parametric models.
These calculations produce no dependence on the initial state x. This is to be expected
for models with sufficient stationarity because discounting plays no role in constructing
Chernoff entropy.
    Setting χpZ H , xq “ 0 would mean including only alternative models that cannot be
distinguished on the basis of histories of infinite length. In effect, that is what is done
in papers on self-confirming equilibria that extend the rational expectations equilibrium
concept to allow probability models to be wrong off equilibrium paths, i.e., for events that do
not occur infinitely often.15 Because we want to include alternative parametric probability
models associated with the martingales in Z ` , we entertain positive values of χpZ H , xq.
Our decision theory differs from that typically used for self confirming equilibria because
our decision makers formally acknowledge model uncertainty and adjust their decisions
accordingly.
    To help interpret χpZ H , xq, consider the following argument. If the decay rate of mistake
probabilities were constant, then mistake probabilities for two sample sizes Ti , i “ 1, 2,
would be
                                                       1
                              mistake probabilityi “ exp p´Ti ρ̄q
                                                       2
for ρ̄ “ χpZ H , xq. We define a ‘half-life’ as an increase in sample size T2 ´ T1 ą 0 that
multiplies the mistake probability by a factor of one half:

                             1   mistake probability2   exp p´T2 ρ̄q
                               “                      “              .
                             2   mistake probability1   exp p´T1 ρ̄q

So the half-life is approximately
                                                       log 2
                                           T2 ´ T1 “         .                            (23)
                                                         ρ̄
The preceding back-of-the-envelope calculation justifies the detection error bound com-
puted by Anderson et al. (2003). The bound on the decay rate should be interpreted
cautiously because it is constant but the actual decay rate is not. Furthermore, the pair-
wise comparison oversimplifies the challenge truly facing a robust decision maker, which is
statistically to discriminate among multiple models.
    We can make a symmetrical calculation that reverses the roles of the two models and
instead conditions on the perturbed model implied by martingale Z H . It is straightforward
to show that the limiting rate remains the same. Thus, when we select a model by com-

paring a log likelihood ratio to a constant threshold, the two types of mistakes share the
same asymptotic decay rate.
    Chernoff (1952) entropy is related to the Cressie and Read (1984) discrepancy measures
discussed in section 3. Notice that

                                 1     ` “` H ˘s    ‰   ˘
                                        E Zt |X0 “ x ´ 1
                              ps ´ 1qs

is the special case r “ 1 ` s of the Cressie and Read family of discrepancies. When Chernoff
                                  “` ˘s          ‰
entropy is strictly positive, E ZtH |X0 “ x tends to zero for some 0 ă s ă 1 as t tends
to infinity. Thus, the corresponding Cressie and Read discrepancy converges to a positive
            1
number sp1´sq   at an exponential rate as t gets large. The Chernoff entropy measure looks
across these rates to obtain the best bound on mistake probabilities.
    Our second convex set is a ball formed using Chernoff entropy (22).

Definition 4.1.

We attain a specified half-life by adjusting the radius ρq of the ball.


5     Robust planning problem
To illustrate our formulation of sets of models, we deliberately consider a simple setup. We
posit an exogenous consumption process and deduce the implied shadow prices of risk and
uncertainty. Richer models would include production, capital accumulation, and distinct
classes of decision makers with differential access to financial markets. Before adding such
complications, we want to understand uncertainty in our simple environment. To con-
struct uncertainty prices, we compute worst-case probabilities associated with martingales
in the set Z. To do this, we solve a continuous-time optimization problem that leads to a
Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation.
    In subsections 5.1 and 5.2, we formulate a robust planning problem for an economy with
a representative consumer having an instantaneous utility function that is logarithmic in
consumption. Associated with the worst-case probability from the robust planning problem
is a greatest lower bound on expected discounted utility over the family Z of alternative
probability distributions. In subsection 5.3, we represent the worst-case probability with
a drift distortion to the multivariate Brownian motion in the baseline model (1). We use


                                              17
that drift distortion to guide the calibration of parameters that determine the size of the
set Z. In section 8, we show how that same worst-case drift distortion appears in a recur-
sive representation of competitive equilibrium prices for an economy with a representative
investor that participates in decentralized security markets. We deduce uncertainty prices
and connect them to the worst-case drift distortion from our robust planning problem.


5.1    Parametric alternatives
Consider the baseline consumption process for C specified in equation (1). Guess a value
function υpx, θ, γq ` log c where c is a realized value of the consumption process. We use
the family of martingales in the set Z to represent alternative probabilities. We define the
function ξ to be                            #
                                                  ˆ

where ξpxq
Whether we choose an additive or a multiplicative scaling will depend on the application
at hand. Eventually, we will calibrate γ to produce a model detection probability half-life
defined in terms of Chernoff entropy. By bringing in other sources of information to help
with calibration, we could allow both additive and multiplicative adjustments.

Let θ be a multiplier on constraint (25). In subsection 5.2, for a given pθ, γq we construct
a recursive representation of a worst-case drift distortion. The distribution Q of the initial

Alternatively, we can view this HJB equation as associated with a weak solution to an
optimization problem in which a drift distortion to a Brownian motion is the control process
that holds under the probability distribution implied by Z H . In this case, we would push
the martingale into the background and instead make distributional statements about the
implied Brownian motion.
   The solution υ of HJB equation (26) is derived in Appendix C and is quadratic in x:

                                      1“                                     ‰

which implies that the minimizing h is affine in x:

5.3    Determining θ and γ
To set θ, we must decide how to model the initial state. Papers by Petersen et al. (2000)
and Hansen et al. (2006) effectively conditioned on an initial state by setting Q to be a
mass point at a single value of x. Here we suggest an alternative approach.
    Under the baseline model, X has a stationary distribution Q   p having density q̂ with
mean φ̂{κ̂ and variance |σ|2 {p2κ̂q. Let g be a density that we use to alter Q.
                                                                             p Formally,

By refining a suggestion of Anderson et al. (2003), we use a half-life for a model detection

entropy. Then adjust γ to match a target half-life as given by (23).17 Call the resulting γ,

6      Quantitative examples
We present two quantitative examples in which an Xt process contributes a predictable
component of consumption growth.18 We explore examples in which evidence for long-
term predictability of consumption growth is intrinsically fragile, making ut plausible that
investors would want to explore alternative models. Chernoff entropy guides the magnitudes
of the doubts that we impute to investors.
    Our first example is patterned after Bansal and Yaron (2004), but like Hansen and
Sargent (2010), we use data only on aggregate consumption. We use updated data to
estimate parameters of the baseline model (1). We assume that Xt is hidden to us as
econometricians, but that it is observed by both the planner and the representative investor.
    Our second example blends Bansal and Yaron (2004) with Hansen et al. (2008). We
estimate a VAR that builds in cointegrating relationships. Along with consumption, our
VAR includes personal dividend income, a variable that we regard as a broad measure of
business income. We use the VAR estimates to construct another quantitative version of our
baseline model (1). We build this simplified model to approximate responses to permanent
shocks. In contrast to Bansal and Yaron (2004), we introduce no stochastic volatility in
order to focus on fluctuations in the endogenously determined uncertainty prices induced
by the representative investor’s model uncertainty.
  17
     We expect but haven’t proved that the half-life is monotone in γ.
  18
     While we appreciate the value of a more comprehensive empirical investigation with multiple macroe-
conomic time series, here our aim is to illustrate a mechanism within the context of relatively simple time
series models of predictable consumption growth.

    We study Chernoff entropy balls associated with half-lives of 60 quarters, 80 quarters,
and 120 quarters. For comparison, we include a model with no concern for robustness,
which is equivalent to a half-life equal to infinity. We let ξpx, γq “ γx2 in contrast to
Hansen and Sargent (2001) or Hansen et al. (2006), who in effect set ξpx, γq “ γ. When ξ
does not depend on x, the worst-case drift distortions and the implied uncertainty prices
are both constant.
    Table 1 reports worst-case models that emerge from the robust planner’s HJB equation
(26). The worst-case models reduce µ and impart a negative mean φκ to X . We report the
composite outcome for the growth rate of consumption µ` βφ  κ
                                                              ; β turns out to be unity in all
                          βφ
cases. The quantity µ ` κ ´ µ̂ traces out the implied long-term consequences of an adverse
shift in the drift vector of the Brownian motion at a given date. Because an adverse shift
can occur at any moment, the implied worst-case parameters reflect what would happen if
an adverse drift shift occurred at every future moment.
    As we reduce the half-life, the worst-case model makes the constant parameter adjust-
ment smaller. When ξpx, γq “ γx2 , the worst-case model also increases the persistence of
the growth-rate process. Although the minimizing agent could choose to increase persis-
tence further, he instead chooses to allocate some of the entropy distortion to the constant
terms.

    The estimates are for per capita using consumption of nondurables and services for aggregate U.S.
quarterly data over the period 1948 Q2 to 2015 Q2.

    Figure 1 displays interdecile ranges of the distribution for consumption growth over
alternative horizons. We depict deciles for both the baseline model and the worst-case
model associated with a half-life of 80 according to formulas in Appendix E.2. The regions
between the deciles describe risk in the consumption distribution. Variations across the
baseline and worst-case models reflect uncertainty driven by skepticism about the baseline
model. The upper decile of the worst-case model overlaps the lower decile of the baseline
model.

    For the VAR construction, we follow Hansen et al. (2008) and use additional macroe-
conomic time series to infer information about long-term consumption growth. We report
a calibration of our baseline model (1) constructed from a trivariate VAR for log consump-
tion, log business income, and log personal dividend income. Business income is measured
as proprietor’s income plus corporate profits per capita. Dividends are personal dividend
income per capita. We fit a vector autoregression (VAR) to the consumption growth rate,
the difference between logs of business income and consumption, and the difference between
logs of personal dividend income and consumption.20 By including proprietors’ income in
addition to corporate profits, we use a broader measure of business income than Hansen
et al. (2008) who used only corporate profits. Moreoever, Hansen et al. (2008) did not

There are two important differences between this specification and the preceding one that
uses consumptoin alone. First, now there is cross correlation between shocks. Second, since
the baseline κ is much smaller, there is more persistence, leaving less room for a worst-
case model to move away from the baseline before encountering a so-called breakdown
probability model at which the objective is minus infinity. Even prior to attaining the
breakdown point, we find that κ becomes negative. To avoid these outcomes, we proceed
as follows. First we compute
                                     ξ2 “ min η1 ¨ η1
                                             r

where the minimization is subject to

                                     α1           r
                                         η1 “           .
                                     σ1        κ̂ ´ κ

In this way we allow the continuous-time autoregressive coefficient to be as low as κ without
taking a stand on the magnitude of β. We then choose half-lives by picking γ so that

                                  ξpxq “ γ ` pκ̂ ´ κq2 x2 .

This construction makes κ a feasible choice.
    In table 2, we fix κ “ .005 then set γ according to three half-lives. The minimizing
decision maker sets κ̂ ą κ ą κ and thereby increases the persistence of state variable
relative to the baseline model, but less than he could. The minimization also appends
adverse constant shifts to the Brownian increments. These adverse shifts in the Brownian

increments have long-lasting effects on the growth rate of consumption determined by the
worst-case persistence parameter κ. An associated increase in the slope coefficient β in
the consumption evolution equation magnifies these effects. Reducing the half-life of the
probability decay enhances all of these effects. Since κ is smaller under the worst-case model
than under the approximating model, the long-term consequence of a mean distortion to the
shock vector is further amplified. Unlike the approximating model, the worst-case model
implies that µ ` βφκ
                     is negative, a consequence of allowing the mean of the shock vector to
be misspecified and permitting this misspecification to recur in all future time periods.
    In table 3 we explore the consequences of changing κ. We fix and the half-life to be
eighty quarters and consider three κ’s: .0075. .0050, and .0025. The worst-case κ becomes
smaller as we decrease κ, but it exceeds κ. The slope β also increases. To maintain the
same half-life, the implied worst-case values for µ and φ become larger.
    Figure 2 is a counterpart to figure 1 for our second model model calibration. Once
again, especially near term, the grey and red shaded areas depicting interquartile ranges
for the baseline and worst-case model share much coverage.

7    Comparing sets of models
The set Z of martingales from definition 3.5 describes our robust representative investor’s
concerns about misspecification of his baseline model (1). In this section, we compare Z
to an associated Chernoff entropy ball Zq and also to another set Z ˚ , the smallest entropy
ball of the type used by Hansen and Sargent (2001) and Hansen et al. (2006) that contains
Z. We illustrate these comparisons using parameter values that emerged from our first
method for calibrating the baseline model (1). A comparison of these sets provides a
practical answer to the question: instead of using the set Z, why not simply expand the
entropy ball Z ˚ used by Hansen and Sargent (2001) and Hansen et al. (2006) enough to
include the alternative parametric models that concern our decision maker? The answer is
that doing that would lead to an entropy ball that is too big when measured by Chernoff-

                                             27
entropy. We also show that for our example a Chernoff entropy ball closely approximates
the set Z that we use to pose our robust planning problem.


7.1       A set Z ˚ that contains Z
In contrast to what we do in this paper, Anderson et al. (2003) and Hansen and Sargent
(2010) formulated robust control problems in terms of discounted entropy balls surrounding
baseline model like (1). To help understand the differences between those robust control
problems and the ones posed in this paper, we construct a new set Z ˚ defined as the
smallest entropy ball that contains Z. An entropy ball surrounding a baseline model is a
family of Z H s that satisfy21

                                                 Z Ă Z ˚.

By constructing an entropy ball Z ˚ that contains Z, we discover how large relative entropy
can be for martingales in the set Z. By comparing Z and Z ˚ with a Chernoff entropy
ball that we use to calibrate Z, as we shall do in figure 4 below, we can appreciate some
of the consequences of formulating robust control problems as we do in this paper rather
than as we did in Hansen et al. (2006) and Hansen and Sargent (2001). We describe how
to compute ξ ˚ in Appendix D using recursive methods.


7.2       Alternative sets
We compare intersections of Z o defined in (3.2) with each of the three sets Z ˚ , Z, and
 q While it is tractable to use the sets Z ˚ and Z to formulate robust decision problems,
Z.
these sets are not directly linked to statistical discrimination problems. The set Zq is closely
linked to “statistical discrimination,” but for forming robust decision problems it is not as
tractable as the other two. It would be comforting if Z ˚ were to approximate Zp closely,
at least in regions near the worst-case model that emerges from the robust planner’s HJB
equation (26).
 21
      We use the term ball loosely because typically a ball in mathematics is defined using a metric.

in Z ˚ . But large values

Z ˚ would have to be to contain the set Z used in the robust planning problem affiliated
with HJB equation (26). The figures on the right side compare the Chernoff balls Zq to the
smallest entropy balls Z ˚ that contain Z. These figures convey the message that the worst-
case model associated with the entropy ball Z ˚ that contains Z differs from the worst-case
model affiliated with Z and that it also lies outside the Chernoff ball Zq that we use to
calibrate Z. The half lives associated with the worst-case models for the sets Z ˚ in figure
4 are 71, 43, and 30, roughly half of values for their Z counterparts. Figure 4 and these
reduced half lives thus confirm the claim made in section 1 that the set Z more concisely
expresses concerns about particular parametric alternatives than would the bigger set Z ˚
used in the robust control problem posed by Hansen et al. (2006).


8    Robust portfolio choice and pricing
In this section, we describe equilibrium prices that make a representative consumer willing
to bear risks presented by the environment described by baseline model (1) in light of his
concerns about model misspecification as expressed with the set Z ˚ . We construct equilib-
rium prices by appropriately extracting shadow prices from the robust planning problem of
subsection 5.1. We decompose equilibrium risk prices into distinct compensations for bear-
ing risk and for bearing model uncertainty. We also describe an equilibrium term structure
of compensations for bearing model uncertainty. We begin by posing the representative
investor’s portfolio choice problem.

8.1    Robust investor portfolio problem
A representative investor faces a continuous-time Merton portfolio problem in which indi-
vidual wealth K evolves as

            dKt “ ´Ct dt ` p.01qKt ιpXt qdt ` Kt At ¨ dWt ` p.01qKt πpXt q ¨ At dt,                   (35)

where At “ a is a vector of chosen risk exposures, ιpxq is the instantaneous risk free rate
expressed as a percent, and πpxq is the vector of risk prices evaluated at state Xt “ x.
Initial wealth is K0 . The investor has discounted logarithmic preferences and distrusts his
probability model.
    Key inputs to a representative investor’s robust portfolio problem are the baseline model
(1), the wealth evolution equation (35), the vector of risk prices πpxq, and the quadratic
function ξ in (13) that defines the alternative explicit models that concern the representative
investor. As in the robust planners problem analyzed in section 5.1, let θ be a penalty
parameter or a Lagrange multiplier on the constraint (25). For the recursive competitive
equilibrium, we take pθ, γq as given. We calibrated these parameters as described in section
5.
    Under a guess that the value function takes the form υ̃px, θ, γq ` log k ` log δ, the HJB
equation for the robust portfolio allocation problem is

                                                                        c

vestor’s unitary elasticity of intertemporal substitution. First-order conditions for a and h

We can appeal to arguments like those in Hansen and Sargent (2008, ch. 7) to justify
stacking first-order conditions as a way to collect equilibrium conditions for the two-person
zero-sum game.22


8.2     Competitive equilibrium prices
We show here that the drift distortion h˚ that emerges from the robust planner’s problem of
subsection 5.1 determines prices that a competitive equilibrium awards to people who bear
model uncertainty. To compute a vector πpxq of competitive equilibrium risk prices, we
find a robust planner’s marginal valuations of exposures to the W shocks. We decompose
that price vector into separate compensations for bearing risk and for accepting model
uncertainty.
    Noting from the robust plannering problem that the shock exposure vectors for log K
and log C must coincide implies
                                        a˚ “ p.01qα.

From (37b),
                                            h˚ “ η ˚ px, θ, γq

where η ˚ is the worst-case drift from the robust planning problem provided that we show
that ῡ “ υ, where υ is the value function for the robust planning problem. Thus, from
(37a), π “ π ˚ , where

                             π ˚ pxq “ α ´ 100η ˚ px, θ, γq “ α ´ 100h˚ .                            (38)

   Similarly, in the problem for a representative investor within a competitive equilibrium,
the drifts for log K and log C must coincide:

                                                                 .0001

     If we were to use a timing protocol that allows the maximizing player to take account of the impact
of its decisions on the minimizing agent, we would obtain the same equilibrium decision rules described in
the text.

We use these formulas for equilibrium prices to construct a solution to the HJB equation
of a representative investor in a competitive equilibrium by letting ῡ “ υ.


8.3    Reinterpreting worst-case portfolio problem
Hansen et al. (2006) described an ordinary (i.e., non-robust) portfolio selection problem
for a representative investor who has a completely trusted model for the exogenous state
dynamics and whose decision rule attains the value function ψ associated with the HJB
equation (36) for a robust representative investor portfolio problem. This investor’s com-
pletely trusted model of course differs from the baseline model (1) and is associated with
what Hansen et al. (2006) called an ex post problem because it comes from exchanging
orders of maximization and minimization in the two-person zero-sum game that gives rise
to the robust portfolio choice rule. This ex post portfolio problem is a special case of a
Merton problem with a state evolution that is distorted relative to the baseline model. The
distorted evolution imputes to the process W a drift η ˚ pXq so that

                                     dWt “ η ˚ pXt qdt ` dWt˚

equilibrium prices as the robust portfolio problem, so that π “ π ˚ and ι “ ι˚ , as given by

9     Term structure of uncertainty prices
In a continuous-time formulation, a pertinent notion of a shock that occurs during a “next
instant” is an incremental change that carries with it incremental effects on all future
outcomes, which for us include cash flows, stochastic discounts, and asset prices. This
section applies a type of nonlinear impulse response function defined by Borovička et al.
(2011) and Borovička et al. (2014) to describe how competitive equilibrium uncertainty
prices vary over investment horizons. Borovička et al.’s (2014) counterpart of an impulse
response function is a state- and horizon-dependent elasticity of an outcome at date t ` j to
a shock at date t, a collection of objects they call “shock elasticities.” The joint nonlinear
dynamics of stochastic discount factor processes, payout processes, and asset prices make
these elasticities depend both on the horizon and the Markov state, which in our application
is a growth state. In this section, we compute these elasticities and use them to construct
what we regard as a dynamic value decomposition. We present quantitative examples in
subsections 9.3 and 9.4.




                                                35
9.1    Local uncertainty prices
The equilibrium stochastic discount factor process for our robust representative investor
economy is
                              ´         ¯                             1

The log stochastic discount factor has a linear local mean and a quadratic local variance.
Such exponential-quadratic specification have been used extensively in empirical asset pric-
ing applications. A leading example is the work of Ang and Piazzesi (2003) who estimated
a term structure model with an exponential quadratic stochastic discount factor process
driven by macroeconomic state variables.
    Components of the vector π ˚ pXt q given by (38) equal minus the local exposures to
the Brownian shocks. These are usually interpreted as local “risk prices,” but we shall
reinterpret them. Motivated by the decomposition

we prefer to think of .01α as risk prices induced by the curvature of log utility and ´Ht˚
as “uncertainty” prices induced by a representative investor’s doubts about the baseline
model. Here Ht˚ “ η0˚ ` η1˚ Xt , as described in equation (27). When η1˚ “ 0, Ht˚ is constant;
but when η1˚ differs from zero, the uncertainty prices ´Ht˚ “ ´h˚ pXt q are time varying
and depend linearly on the growth state Xt . When h˚ depends positively on x, uncertainty
prices are higher in bad times than in good times. Countercyclical uncertainty prices emerge
endogenously from a baseline model that excludes stochastic volatility in the underlying
consumption risk as an exogenous input. Such fluctuations emerge endogenously from a
baseline model that excludes stochastic volatility in the underlying consumption risk as
an exogenous input. Stochastic volatility models introduce new risks to be priced while
also inducing fluctuations in the prices of the “original” risks. The mechanism in this
paper simultaneously enhances and induces fluctuations in the uncertainty prices, but it
introduces no new sources of risk. Instead, the mechanism features investors’ responses to
their uncertainty about those risks.

9.2    Uncertainty prices over alternative investment horizons
In the context of our quantitative models, we now report the price-shock elasticities that
Borovička et al. (2014) showed are horizon-dependent uncertainty prices of risk exposures.
Shock price elasticities describe the dependence of logarithms of expected returns on an
investment horizon. The logarithm of the expected return from a consumption payoff at
date t consists of two terms:
                            ˜ ˇ         ¸        « ˆ ˙ˇ             ff
                             Ct ˇˇ                     Ct ˇˇ
                      log E      ˇX0 “ x ´ log E St         ˇX 0 “ x .                 (41)
                             C0 ˇ                      C0 ˇ

The first term is the expected payoff and the second is the cost of purchasing that pay-
off. Malliavin derivatives tell how a shock in the next instance affects consumption and
stochastic discount factor processes. There is one Malliavin derivative for each Brownian
increment. Following Borovička et al. (2014), we call the Malliavin derivatives of expected
returns across horizons with respect to a shock in the next instant the price elasticity func-
tion, and the Malliavin derivatives of expected payoffs across horizons with respect to a
shock in the next instant a payoff exposure elasticity. For our model, we give quasi-analytical
formulas for these two elasticities in Appendix E.1.


9.3    Shock price elasticities for quantitative example 1
Red lines and areas in figure 5 displays shock elasticities evaluated at the median and
the two deciles of the stationary distribution for X when ξpxq   ˆ     “ x2 ; blue circles show
shock elasticities when ξˆ “ 1. As for the red lines associated with ξˆ “ x2 , interdecile
ranges between .1 and .9 are shaded. The uncertainty price elasticities for the second
shock but not the first depend on the initial state x. The price elasticity trajectories are
larger for second shock, the one to the consumption growth rate, than for the first shock,
which directly hits the level of log consumption. Both price elasticity trajectories are nearly
constant across horizons. Increasing the concern for robustness, i.e., lowering the associated
Chernoff half-lives, makes the elasticities larger and increases their variation across horizons
for the growth rate shock.
    For comparison, figure 5 also includes the Hansen and Sargent (2001)–Hansen et al.
(2006) formulation of concerns about robustness that sets ξˆ “ 1. Here even the price
elasticities for the growth shock are constant and are larger than the corresponding median
elasticities when ξˆ “ x2 . Evidently, an interesting trade-off between variability and levels

hits the consumption growth rate. The uncertainty shock affiliated with the second shock
makes uncertainty prices increase during times of diminished consumption growth.
    We have structured our quantitative examples to investigate a particular mechanism
for generating fluctuations in uncertainty prices from statistically plausible amounts of
uncertainty. We inferred the baseline parameters for these examples solely from time series
of macroeconomic quantities, thus completely ignoring asset prices during calibration. As
a consequence, we not expect to track closely the high frequency movements in financial
markets. By limiting our empirical inputs, we consciously set aside concerns that Hansen
(2007) and Chen et al. (2015) expressed about using asset market data to calibrate macro-
finance models that assign a special role to investors’ beliefs about the future asset prices.24
An alternative approach would have been to calibrate partly to capture variations over
time in cross-sectional distributions of asset returns, an approach that would impose cross-
equation restrictions between time series of macroeconomic quantities and a vector of asset
returns. We recognize that exploring cross-equations restrictions promises a fuller analysis
of connections between financial markets and aggregate quantities. We would want to add
features to our model including exogenous stochastic contributions to the volatilities of
shocks to macroeconomic quantities and financial markets.


9.4     Shock price elasticities for quantitative example 2
In figure 7 we display the shock elasticities evaluated at the median and the two quartiles
of the stationary distribution for X. We shade in interquartile ranges. Now uncertainty
price elasticities for both shocks depend on the initial state x. Recall that for this param-
eterization the first shock has a direct impact on consumption and on the consumption
growth rate. For the second quantitative example, there is state dependence in elasticities
for the first shock and these elasticities are notably larger than those for the second shock.
Allowing a greater range of κ with lower values of κ enhances the state dependence in the
elasticities.

    Hansen (2007) and Chen et al. (2015) describe situations in which it is the behavior of rates of return
on assets that, through the cross-equation restrictions, lead an econometrician to make confident inferences
about the behavior of macroeconomic quantities like consumption that are much more confident than can
be made from the quantity data alone. That opens questions about how the investors who are supposedly
putting those cross-equation restrictions into returns came to know those quantity processes before they
observed returns.

10      Rectangularity
Chen and Epstein (2002) advocated what they called rectangular sets of probabilities in
the context of continuous-time specifications with ambiguity aversion. Epstein and Schnei-
der (2003) formulated decision theoretic axioms that justified rectangular sets of models.

                                              42
Proposition 3.4 shows that the set Z that we have used to pose robust decision prob-
lems contains relative entropy neighborhoods centered on alternative parametric models
described with a function ξpxq. If we had instead imposed only the restrictions

                                            Ht ¨ Ht ď ξpXt q                               (42)

on drift distortions Ht , then our set of alternative probabilities would have been rectangular.
In this section, we revisit the point made by Hansen et al. (2006) that any set like ours that
includes relative entropy neighborhoods violates Epstein and Schneider’s rectangularity
property.
    We did not follow Epstein and Schneider’s recommendation to expand our set to become
rectangular because we share a point of view expressed by Good (1952) in the quotation
with which we began this paper. Good’s perspective guides how we construct convex sets
of models.25 As in Anderson et al. (2003), in section 4 we use statistical model selection
criteria to evaluate the plausibility of least favorable models. Epstein and Schneider (2003)
criticize robust control theory for violating a notion of dynamic consistency and propose a
remedy that expands the set of models beyond those typically employed in robust control
problems. They propose adding enough models to attain a rectangular set of models (or
priors over models). They construct this larger set of models to represent preferences that
satisfy axioms that they like. They state that

        there is an important conceptual distinction between the set of probability laws
        that the decision maker views as possible, such as P rob, and the set of priors
        P that is part of the representation of preference.

We now show that Epstein and Schneider’s set expansion proposal results in an implemen-
tation of max-min utility theory that is not subjectively reasonable even when we apply it
to an original set of models that is reasonable in Good’s sense.
    Epstein and Schneider’s procedure for achieving rectangularity focuses attention on
restrictions that a set like Z imposes on implied local state transitions. In our setting, these
transitions are completely specified by local drift distortions. Rectangularity conditions
(42) impose restrictions on drift distortions that are disconnected over time as in Chen and
Epstein (2002) and in section 4.2 of Anderson et al. (1998). The set Z necessarily contains
martingales of the following type. For a fixed date τ , consider a random vector H τ that is

Evidently, relative entropy ∆pZ H |xq can be made arbitrarily small by shrinking u to zero.
This means that any rectangular set that contains Z must allow for a drift distortion h̄τ
at date τ . We summarize this argument in the following proposition:

Proposition 10.1. Any rectangular set of probabilities that contains the probabilities in-
duced by martingales in a conditional relative entropy neighborhood
                                                 ` u ˘
                                     tZ H P Z : ∆ Z H |x ă u

for some  ą 0 must also contain the probabilities induced by martingales in Z.

This proposition targets neighborhoods of baseline model, but it is straightforward to
extend it to relative entropy neighborhoods of other centering points.
    Confining ourselves to any such rectangular set of martingales allows us too much free-
dom in setting both the date τ and the random vector h̄τ . Restriction (43) implies instant-
by-instant drift distortions that are just too flexible: they need satisfy only measurability
and second-moment restrictions. In particular, all martingales in the set Z identified in
definition 2.1 are included in the rectangular set. That set is too big to use as part of a
meaningful robust decision problem.
    Despite the fact that we decline to use the rectangular embedding that Epstein and
Schneider (2003) advocate in order to satisfy their notion of dynamic consistency, it re-

                                                 44
mains true that the dynamic decision problems that we formulate give rise to optimization
problems associated with two-person zero-sum games solvable via dynamic programming.


11     Concluding remarks
This paper formulates and applies a tractable model of the effects on equilibrium prices
of exposures to macroeconomic uncertainties. Our analysis uses models’ consequences for
discounted expected utilities to quantify traders’ concerns about model misspecification.
We characterize the effects of concerns about misspecification of a baseline stochastic pro-
cess for individual consumption as shadow prices for a planner’s problem that supports
competitive equilibrium prices.
    To illustrate our approach, we have focused on the growth rate uncertainty featured
in the “long-run risk” literature initiated by Bansal and Yaron (2004). Other applications
seem natural. For example, the tools developed here could shed light on a recent public
debate between two groups of macroeconomists, one prophesizing secular stagnation be-
cause of technology growth slowdowns, the other dismissing those pessimistic forecasts.
The tools that we describe can be used, first, to quantify how challenging it is to infer
persistent changes in growth rates, and, second, to guide macroeconomic policy design in
light of available empirical evidence.
    Specifically, we have produced a quadratic model (40) of the log stochastic discount fac-
tor whose uncertainty prices reflect a robust planner’s worst-case drift distortions Ht˚ . We
have argued that these drift distortions should be interpreted as prices of model uncertainty.
The dependency of these uncertainty prices Ht˚ on the growth state x, and thus whether
                                                                           ˆ
they are pro cyclical or countercyclical, is shaped partly by a function ξpxq  that describes
parametric alternatives to a baseline model. In this way, the theory of countercyclical risk
premia in this paper is all about how our robust investor responds to the presence of the
alternative parametric models among a huge set of unspecified alternative models that also
concern him. We have demonstrated that this is a simple way of generating countercyclical
risk premia.
    It is worthwhile comparing this paper’s way of inducing countercyclical risk premia with
three other macro/finance models that also get them. Campbell and Cochrane (1999) pro-
ceed in the standard rational expectations single-known-probability-model tradition and so
exclude any fears of model misspecification from the mind of their representative investor.
They construct a history-dependent utility function in which the history of consumption

                                             45
expresses an externality. This history dependence makes the investor’s local risk aversion
depend in a countercyclical way on the economy’s growth state. Ang and Piazzesi (2003)
use an exponential quadratic stochastic discount factor in a no-arbitrage statistical model
and explore links between the term structure of interest rates and other macroeconomic
variables. Their approach allows movements in risk prices to be consistent with historical
evidence without specifying an explicit general equilibrium model. A third approach intro-
duces stochastic volatility into the macroeconomy by positing that the volatilities of shocks
driving consumption growth are themselves stochastic processes. A stochastic volatility
model induces time variation in risk prices via exogenous movements in the conditional
volatilities impinging on macroeconomic variables.
    In Hansen and Sargent (2010), countercyclical risk prices are driven by a representative
investor’s robust model averaging. The investor carries along two difficult-to-distinguish
models of consumption growth, one asserting i.i.d. log consumption growth, the other
asserting that the growth in log consumption is a process with a slowly moving conditional
mean.26 The investor uses observations on consumption growth to update a Bayesian prior
over these two models, starting from an initial prior probability of .5. The prior wanders
over a post WWII sample period, but ends where it started. Each period, the Hansen
and Sargent representative investor expresses his specification distrust by pessimistically
exponentially twisting a posterior over the two baseline models. That leads the investor
to interpret good news as temporary and bad news as persistent, causing him to put
countercyclical uncertainty components into equilibrium “risk” prices.
    In this paper, we propose a different way to make risk prices vary. We exclude learning
and instead consider alternative models with parameters whose future variations cannot
be inferred from historical data. These time-varying parameter models differ from the
decision maker’s baseline model, a fixed parameter model whose parameters can be well
estimated from historical data. The alternative models include ones that allow parameters
persistently to deviate from those of the baseline model in statistically subtle and time-
varying ways. In addition to this particular class of alternative models, the decision maker
also includes other statistical specifications in the set of models that concern him. The
   26
      Bansal and Yaron (2004) and Hansen and Sargent (2010) both start from the observation that two such
models are difficult to distinguish empirically, but they draw different conclusions from that observation.
Bansal and Yaron use the observation to justify a representative consumer who with complete confidence
embraces one of the models (the long-run risk model with persistent log consumption growth), while Hansen
and Sargent use the observation to justify a representative consumer who initially puts prior probability
.5 on both models and who continues to carry along both models when evaluating prospective outcomes.

robust planner’s worst-case model responds to these forms of model ambiguity partly by
having more persistence than the baseline models. Our approach acquires tractability
because the worst-case model turns out to be a time-invariant model in which projections
for long-term growth are more cautious and stochastic growth is more persistent than in
the baseline model. Worst-case shock distributions shift adversely and imply additional
persistence that gives rise to enduring effects on uncertainty prices. Adverse shifts in the
shock distribution that drive up the absolute magnitudes of uncertainty prices were also
present in some of our earlier work (for example, see Hansen et al. (1999) and Anderson
et al. (2003)). In this paper, we induce state dependence in uncertainty prices in a different
way, namely, by specifying a set of alternative models to capture concerns about the baseline
model’s specification of persistence in consumption growth.
    Relative to rational expectations models, models of robustness and ambiguity aversion
bring new parameters. In this paper, we extend work by Anderson et al. (2003) that cali-
brated those additional parameters by exploiting connections between models of statistical
model discrimination and our way of formulating robustness. We build on mathematical
formulations of Newman and Stuck (1979), Petersen et al. (2000), and Hansen et al. (2006).
We pose an ex ante robustness problem that pins down a robustness penalty parameter θ
by linking it to an asymptotic measure of statistical discrimination between models. This
asymptotic measure allows us to quantify a half-life for reducing the mistakes in selecting
between competing models based on historical evidence. A large statistical discrimination
rate implies a short half-life for reducing discrimination mistake probabilities. Anderson
et al. (2003) and Hansen (2007) had studied the connection between conditional discrimi-
nation rates and uncertainty prices that clear security markets. By following Newman and
Stuck (1979) and studying asymptotic discrimination rates, we link statistical discrimina-
tion half-lives to calibrated equilibrium uncertainty prices.

implied Brownian motion.

   For each x, the function υ̃ px, ¨q of θ is decreasing and strictly convex. Moreover, the

   The next step in solving optimization problem (47)-(48) is to set θ to satisfy constraint
(48) at equality. The function υ̃ is convex in θ with a finite limit as θ tends to 8. We solve

                                         min υ̃ px, θq ` θ.                             (51)

Decreasing  increases the minimizing θ. As  approaches zero, the minimizing θ necessarily
tends to 8, driving the minimized value in (51) arbitrarily close to υ̃ px, 8q. The conclusion
of Proposition 3.4 follows provided that υ̃ px, 8q ă 0.


B     Operationalizing Chernoff entropy
In this appendix we show how to compute Chernoff entropies for parametric models of the
form (17). Because the H’s associated with them take the form

                                            Ht “ ηpXt q,

these alternative models are Markovian. This allows us to compute Chernoff entropy by
using an eigenvalue approach of Donsker and Varadhan (1976) and Newman and Stuck
                                          ` ˘s
(1979). We start by computing the drift of ZtH gpXt q for 0 ď s ď 1 at t “ 0:

                                . p´s ` s2 q

                                                    2

                                                 51
where rGpsqgspxq is the drift given that X0 “ x. Next we solve the eigenvalue problem

                                rGpsqsepx, sq “ ´ρpsqepx, sq,

whose eigenfunction epx, sq is the exponential of a quadratic function of x. We compute
Chernoff entropy numerically by solving:

                               2                   2

Using formula (52), define

                               “          ‰      rGpsqgspxq
                                Gpsq log g pxq “            .
                                                   gpxq

Then we can solve

we consider Z H ’s that satisfy

We pose this as minimization problem to exploit is mathematical similarity to the robust

      where X01 “ σ ¨ u and log S01 “ ´.01α ¨ u ` h˚ pxq ¨ u. The quadratic terms in the
      evolution equation of log S make log St1 stochastic.

    2. Deterministic impulse response for log C. We solve the recursion:

      where log C01 “ p.01qα ¨ u and X01 “ σ ¨ u. Thus,

           which is also the continuous time impulse response for log C.

E.2     Consumption distributions
Starting at date zero, the expected growth rate at t is:
                                         ˜«    ff ¸ « ff
                        ”   ı              0 β       µ       βφ βφ
                         1 0 exp                 t       “µ`    ´   expp´κtq.
                                           0 ´κ      φ        κ   κ


                                                                59
Integrating this growth rate over an interval r0, ts gives a worst-case trend for log consump-
tion:                        ˆ         ˙
                                   βφ        βφ                βφ
                               µ`        t ` 2 expp´κtq ´ 2                                (54)
                                    κ        κ                 κ
Notice that the initial growth trend growth rate is µ and that the eventual growth rate is
µ ` φκ . In this calculation, we impose the distorted model starting at date zero and consider
its implications going forward. The shift in the constant term for the evolution of X has
no immediate impact on the growth of log C. Its eventual impact is determined in part by
the persistence parameter κ.
    Next we consider the distributional impacts. The new information about log Ct ´ log C0
(scaled by 100) is:
