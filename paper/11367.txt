Asset Float and Speculative Bubbles

                                            ABSTRACT

We model the relationship between asset float (tradeable shares) and speculative bubbles. Investors

trade a stock with limited float because of insider lock-ups. They have heterogeneous beliefs due to

overconfidence and face short-sales constraints. A bubble arises as price overweighs optimists'

beliefs and investors anticipate the option to resell to those with even higher valuations. The bubble's

size depends on float as investors anticipate an increase in float with lock-up expirations and

speculate over the degree of insider selling. Consistent with the internet experience, the bubble,

turnover and volatility decrease with float and prices drop on the lock-up expiration date.

    The behavior of internet stock prices during the late nineties was extraordinary. On
February of 2000, this largely profitless sector of roughly four-hundred companies com-
manded valuations that represented six percent of the market capitalization and accounted
for an astounding 20% of the publicly traded volume of the U.S. stock market (see, e.g.,
Ofek and Richardson (2003)).1 These figures led many to believe that this set of stocks
was in the midst of an asset price bubble. These companies’ valuations began to collapse
shortly thereafter and by the end of the same year, they had returned to pre-1998 levels,
losing nearly 70% from the peak. Turnover and return volatility in these stocks also largely
dried up in the process.
    Many point out that the collapse of internet stock prices coincided with a dramatic ex-
pansion in the publicly tradeable shares (or float) of internet companies (see, e.g., Cochrane
(2003)). Since many internet companies were recent initial public offerings (IPO), they
typically had 80% of their shares locked up—the shares held by insiders and other pre-IPO
equity holders are not tradeable for at least six months after the IPO date.2 Ofek and
Richardson (2003) document that at around the time when internet valuations collapsed,
the float of the internet sector dramatically increased as the lock-ups of many of these stocks
expired.3 Despite such tantalizing stylized facts, there has been little formal analysis of this
issue.
    In this paper, we attempt to understand the relationship between float and stock price
bubbles. Our analysis builds on early work regarding the formation of speculative bubbles
due to the combined effects of heterogeneous beliefs (i.e. agents agreeing to disagree) and
short-sales constraints (see, e.g., Miller (1977), Harrison and Kreps (1978), Chen, Hong and
Stein (2002) and Scheinkman and Xiong (2003)). In particular, we follow Scheinkman and
Xiong (2003) in assuming that overconfidence—the belief of an agent that his information is
more accurate than what it is—is the source of disagreement. Although there are many dif-
ferent ways to generate heterogeneous beliefs, a large literature in psychology indicates that
overconfidence is a pervasive aspect of human behavior. In addition, the assumption that
investors face short-sales constraints is also eminently plausible since even most institutional
   1
     The average price-to-earnings ratio of these companies hovered around 856. And the relative valuations of
equity carveouts like Palm/3Com suggested that internet valuations were detached from fundamental value (see,
e.g., Lamont and Thaler (2003), Mitchell, Pulvino, and Stafford (2002)).
   2
     In recent years, it has become standard for some 80% of the shares of IPOs to be locked up for about six months.
Economic rationales for lock-ups include a commitment device to alleviate moral hazard problems, to signal firm
quality, or to prevent rent extraction by underwriters.
   3
     They find that, from the beginning of November 1999 to the end of April 2000, the value of unlocked shares in
the internet sector rose from 70 billion dollars to over 270 billion dollars.

investors such as mutual funds do not short.4
       More specifically, we consider a discrete-time, multi-period model in which investors
trade a stock that initially has a limited float because of lock-up restrictions but the trade-
able shares of which increase over time as insiders become free to sell their positions. We
assume that there is limited risk absorption capacity (i.e. downward sloping demand curve)
for the stock.5 Insiders and investors observe the same publicly available signals about fun-
damentals. In deciding how much to sell on the lock-up expiration date, insiders process
the same signals with the correct prior belief about the precision of these signals. However,
investors are divided into two groups and differ in two ways. First, they have different prior
beliefs about fundamentals (i.e. one group can in general be more optimistic than the other).
Second, they differ in their interpretation of these signals as each group overestimates the
informativeness of a different signal. As information flows into the market, their forecasts
change and the group that is relatively more optimistic at one point in time may become at
a later date relatively more pessimistic. These fluctuations in expectations generate trade.
Importantly, investors anticipate changes in asset supply over time due to potential insider
selling.
       When investors have heterogeneous beliefs due to overconfidence and are short-sales
constrained, the price of an asset exceeds fundamental value for two reasons. First, the price
is biased upwards because of heterogeneous initial priors—when these priors are sufficiently
different, price only reflects the beliefs of the optimistic group as the pessimistic group
simply sits out of the market because of short-sales constraints.6 We label this source of
an upward bias an optimism effect. Second, investors pay prices that exceed their own
valuation of future dividends as they anticipate finding a buyer willing to pay even more in
the future.7 We label this source of an upward bias a resale option effect.
       When there is limited risk absorption capacity, the two groups naturally want to share the
   4
     Roughly 70% of mutual funds explicitly state (in Form N-SAR that they file with the SEC) that they are not
permitted to sell short (see Almazan, Brown, Carlson and Chapman (2004)). Seventy-nine percent of equity mutual
funds make no use of derivatives whatsoever (either futures or options), suggesting that funds are also not finding
synthetic ways to take short positions (see Koski and Pontiff (1999)). These figures indicate the vast majority of
funds never take short positions.
   5
     It is best to think of the stock as the internet sector. This assumption is meant to capture the fact that many
of those who traded internet stocks were individuals with undiversified positions and that there are other frictions
which limit arbitrage. For instance, Ofek and Richardson (2003) report that the median holding of institutional
investors in internet stocks was 25.9% compared to 40.2% for non-internet stocks. For internet IPO’s, the comparable
numbers are 7.4% to 15.1%. See Shleifer and Vishny (1997) for a description for various limits of arbitrage.
   6
     This is the key insight of Miller (1997) and Chen, Hong and Stein (2001).
   7
     See Harrison and Kreps (1978) and Scheinkman and Xiong (2003).

risk of holding the supply of the asset. Hence they are unwilling to hold all of the tradeable
shares without a substantial risk discount. A larger float or a lower risk absorption capacity
naturally means that it takes a greater difference in initial priors for there to be an upward
bias in prices due to the optimism effect. More interestingly, a larger float or a lower risk
absorption capacity also means that it takes a greater divergence in opinion in the future for
an asset buyer to resell the shares, which means the less valuable the resale option is today.
So, ex ante, agents are less willing to pay a price above their assessments of fundamentals
and the smaller is the resale option. Indeed, we show that the strike price of the resale
option depends on the relative magnitudes of asset float to risk absorption capacity—the
greater is this ratio, the higher the strike price for the resale option to be in the money.
       Our model generates a number of implications absent from standard models of asset
pricing with downward sloping demand curves. For instance, the magnitude of the decrease
in price associated with greater asset supply is highly nonlinear—it is much bigger when
the ratio of float to risk bearing capacity is small than when it is large. Moreover, this
decrease in price is accompanied by lower turnover and return volatility since these two
quantities are tied to the amount of speculative trading. Perhaps the most novel feature of
our model has to do with speculation by investors about the trading positions of insiders
after lock-ups expire. Since investors are overconfident and insiders are typically thought of
as having more knowledge about their company than outsiders, it seems natural to assume
that each group of investors thinks that the insiders are “smart” like them (i.e. sharing
their expectations as opposed to the other group’s). As a result, each group of investors
expects the other group to be more aggressive in taking positions in the future since each
group expects that the insiders will eventually come in and share the risk of their positions
with them. Since agents are more aggressive in taking on speculative positions, the resale
option and hence the bubble is larger. The very event of potential insider selling at the end
of the lock-up period leads to a larger bubble than would have otherwise occurred.8
       Our theory yields a number of predictions which are consistent with stylized facts re-
garding the behavior of internet stocks during the late nineties. One such fact is that stock
prices tend to decline on the lock-up expiration date though the day of the event is known
to all in advance.9 Since investors are overconfident in our model and incorrectly believe
   8
     As long as insiders are not infinitely risk averse and decide to sell their positions based on their belief about
fundamentals, this effect will be present.

that the insiders share their beliefs, to the extent that the insiders’ belief is rational (i.e.
properly weighing the two public signals) and some investors are more optimistic than in-
siders, there will be more selling on the part of insiders on the date of lock-up expiration
than is anticipated by outside investors. Hence, the stock price tends to fall on this date.
       Our model can also rationalize why the internet bubble bursted in the Winter of 2000
when the float of the internet sector dramatically increased and why trading volume and
return volatility also dried up in the process. A key determinant of the size of the bubble
in our model is the ratio of the float to risk absorption capacity. To the extent that the risk
absorption capacity in the internet sector stayed the same but the asset supply increased, our
model predicts a bursting of the bubble for several reasons.10 The first is the optimism effect
due to initial heterogeneous priors. As float increases, the chances of optimists dominating
the market becomes smaller and hence the smaller is the bubble. Second, the larger is
the float, the smaller is the resale option and hence the smaller is the bubble. After the
expiration of lock-up restrictions, speculation regarding the degree of insider selling also
diminished, again leading to a smaller internet bubble. We show that the drop in prices
related to an increase in float can be dramatic and is related to the magnitude of the
divergence of opinion among investors. Moreover, a larger float tends to also lead to less
trading volume and volatility. Through numerical exercises, we show that both an optimism
effect and a resale effect are needed to simultaneously capture all stylized facts.
       There is a large literature on the effects of heterogeneous beliefs on asset prices.11 Miller
(1977) and Chen, Hong and Stein (2002) analyze the overvaluation generated by heteroge-
neous beliefs and short-sales constraints in a static setting. Hong and Stein (2003) consider
a model in which heterogeneous beliefs and short-sales constraints lead to market crashes.
Harrison and Kreps (1978), Morris (1996) and Scheinkman and Xiong (2003) develop mod-
els in which there is a speculative component in asset prices. However, the agents in these
last three models are risk-neutral, and so float has no effect on prices.
       There are a number of ways to generate heterogeneous beliefs. One tractable way is to
assume that agents are overconfident, i.e. they overestimate the precision of their knowledge
in a number of circumstances, especially for challenging judgment tasks. Many studies from
psychology find that people indeed exhibit overconfidence (see Alpert and Raiffa (1982)
  10
     While internet stocks had different lock-up expiration dates, a substantial fraction of these stocks had lock-ups
that expired at around the same time (see Ofek and Richardson (2003)).
  11
     A number of papers have also considered trading generated by heterogeneous beliefs (see, e.g., Harris and Raviv
(1993), Kandel and Pearson (1995), Gervais and Odean (2001), Kyle and Lin (2002), and Cao and Ou-Yang (2004)).


                                                          4
or Lichtenstein, Fischhoff, and Phillips (1982)).12 Researchers in finance have developed
models to analyze the implications of overconfidence on financial markets (see, e.g., Kyle and
Wang (1997), Odean (1998), Daniel, Hirshleifer and Subrahmanyam (1998) and Bernardo
and Welch (2001).) Like these papers, we model overconfidence as overestimation of the
precision of one’s information.
       The bubble in our model, based on the recursive expectations of traders to take advantage
of mistakes by others, is different from “rational bubbles”.13 In contrast to our set up,
rational-bubble models are incapable of connecting bubbles with asset float. In addition, in
these models, assets must have (potentially) infinite maturity to generate bubbles. While
other mechanisms have been proposed to generate asset price bubbles (see, e.g., Allen and
Gorton (1993), Allen, Morris, and Postlewaite (1993)), only one of these, Duffie, Garleanu
and Pedersen (2002), speaks to the relationship between float and asset price bubbles. They
show that the security lending fees that a stock holder expects to collect contribute an extra
component to current stock prices. An increase in float leads to lower lending fees (lower
shorting costs) and hence lower prices. Our mechanism holds even if shorting costs are
fixed.14
       The asset float effect generated by our model is different from the liquidity effect dis-
cussed in Baker and Stein (2004). Their model builds on the idea that overconfident investors
tend to underreact to the information revealed by market price. Thus, when these investors
are optimistic and are dominant in the market, liquidity improves, i.e., there is a smaller
price impact by an infinitely small trade of privately informed traders.
       Our paper proceeds as follows. A simple version of the model without insider selling is
described in Section I. The general model is presented in Section II. We calibrate our model
to the NASDAQ bubble in Section III. We discuss the empirical implications in Section IV
and conclude in Section V. All proofs are in the Appendix.
  12
      In fact, even experts can display overconfidence (see Camerer (1995)). A phenomenon related to overconfidence
is the “illusion of knowledge”—people who do not agree become more polarized when given arguments that serve
both sides (see Lord, Ross and Lepper (1979)). See Hirshleifer (2001) and Barberis and Thaler (2003) for reviews
of this literature.
   13
      See Blanchard and Watson (1982) or Santos and Woodford (1997).
   14
      Moreover, as we discuss in more detail below, the empirical evidence indicates only minor reductions in the lend-
ing fee on average after lockup expirations during the internet bubble, suggesting a need for alternative mechanisms
such as ours to explain the relationship between float and asset prices during this period.

I.      A Simple Model without Lockup Expirations

We begin by providing a simple version of our model without any insider selling. This
special case helps develop the intuition for how the relative magnitudes of the supply of
tradeable shares and investors’ risk-absorption capacity affect a speculative bubble. Below,
this version is extended to allow for time-varying float due to the expiration of insider
lock-up restrictions.
       We consider a single traded asset, which might represent a stock, a portfolio of stocks
such as the internet sector, or the market as a whole. There are three dates, t = 0, 1, 2. The
asset pays off f˜ at t = 2, where f˜ is normally distributed. A total of Q shares of the asset
are outstanding. For simplicity, the interest rate is set to zero.
       Two groups of investors, A and B, trade the asset at t = 0 and t = 1. Investors within
each group are identical. They maximize a per-period objective of the following form:
                                                     1
                                          E[W ] −      V ar[W ],                                              (1)
                                                    2η
where η is the risk-bearing capacity of each group. In order to obtain closed-form solutions,
we need to use these (myopic) preferences so as to abstract away from dynamic hedging
considerations. While unappetizing, it will become clear from our analysis that our results
are unlikely to change qualitatively when we admit dynamic hedging possibilities. We
further assume that there is limited risk absorption capacity in the stock.15
    At t = 0, the prior beliefs of the two groups of investors about f˜ are normally distributed,
and denoted by N (fˆ0A , 1/τ0 ) and N (fˆ0B , 1/τ0 ). The two groups share the same precision τ0 ,
but the means fˆ0A and fˆ0B can be potentially different. At t = 1, they receive two public
signals:

                                     sA   ˜ A       B   ˜ B
                                      f = f + ²f , sf = f + ²f ,                                              (2)

where ²A      B
       f and ²f are noises in the signals. The noises are independent and normally dis-

tributed, denoted by N (0, 1/τ² ), where τ² is the precision of the two signals. Due to over-
confidence, group A over-estimates the precision of signal A as φτ² , where φ is a constant
parameter larger than one. In contrast, group B over-estimates the precision of signal B as
φτ² .
  15
   In other words, the asset demand curve is downward sloping. This is meant to simultaneously capture the
undiversified positions of individual investors and frictions that limits arbitrage among institutional investors.



                                                        6
   We first solve for the beliefs of the two groups at t = 1. Using standard Bayesian
updating formulas, they are easily characterized in the following lemma.

Lemma 1 The beliefs of the two groups of investors at t = 1 are normally distributed,
denoted by N (fˆ1A , 1/τ ) and N (fˆ1B , 1/τ ), where the precision is given by

                                       τ = τ0 + (1 + φ)τ² ,                                 (3)

and the means are given by
                                         φτ² A ˆA        τ²
                           fˆ1A = fˆ0A +    (sf − f0 ) + (sB    − fˆ0A ),                   (4)
                                          τ              τ f
                                         τ²             φτ² B
                           fˆ1B = fˆ0B + (sA     ˆB
                                             f − f0 ) +     (sf − fˆ0B ).                   (5)
                                         τ               τ
Investors’ beliefs differ at t = 1 due to two reasons. First, they have different prior beliefs.
Second, they place too much weight on different signals. The second source of disagreement
disappears in the limit as φ approaches one.
   Given the forecasts in Lemma 1, we proceed to solve for the equilibrium holdings and
price at t = 1. With mean-variance preferences and short-sales constraints, it is easy to
show that, given the price p1 , the demands of investors (xA    B
                                                           1 , x1 ) for the asset are given by


                 xA           ˆA              B           ˆB
                  1 = max[ητ (f1 − p1 ), 0], x1 = max[ητ (f1 − p1 ), 0].                    (6)

Consider the demand of the group A investors. Since they have mean-variance preferences,
their demand for the asset without short-sales constraints is simply ητ (fˆA −p1 ). When their
                                                                            1

beliefs are less than the market price, they would ideally want to short the asset. Since they
cannot, they simply sit out of the market and submit a demand of zero. The intuition for
B’s demand is similar.
   Imposing the market clearing condition, xA    B
                                            1 + x1 = Q, gives us the following lemma:


Lemma 2 Let l1 = fˆ1A − fˆ1B be the difference in opinion between the investors in groups A
and B at t = 1. The solution for the stock holdings and price on this date are given by the
following three cases:

Lemma 2 is simply a re-statement of the results in Miller (1977) and Chen, Hong and Stein
(2002). Since the investors are risk-averse, they naturally want to share the risks of holding
the Q shares of the asset. So, unless their opinions are dramatically different, both groups
of investors will be long the asset. This is the situation described in Case 2. In this case, the
                                                                                                                      Q
asset price is determined by the average belief of the two groups, and the risk premium                              2ητ
is determined by the total risk-bearing capacity. When group A’s valuation is significantly
greater than that of B’s (as in Case 1), investors in group A hold all Q shares, and those in B
sit out of the market. As a result, the asset price is determined purely by group A’s opinion,
fˆA , adjusted for a risk discount, Q , reflecting the fact that this one group is bearing all the
 1                                              ητ
risks of the Q shares. The situation in Case 3 is symmetric to that of Case 1 except that
group B’s valuation is greater than that of A’s.
     We next solve for the equilibrium at t = 0. Given investors’ mean-variance preferences,
the demand of the agents at t = 0 are given by

   The intuition behind Lemma 3 is similar to that of Lemma 2. The equilibrium price at
t = 0 is upwardly biased because of short-ales constraints as the optimistic belief (either
EA        B
 0 p1 or E0 p1 ) carries more weight in the price (either Case 1 or Case 3). In other words,

the optimism effect identified in Miller (1977) and Chen, Hong and Stein (2002) holds at
time 0. We are unable to explicitly solve for EA        B
                                               0 p1 or E0 p1 . However, we can solve for these

values numerically, along with ΣA and ΣB .
   Moreover, we can provide some intuition for the resulting equilibrium by first considering
the case in which fˆA and fˆB are identical (the case of homogeneous priors). In the case
                       0          0

of homogeneous priors, we are able to obtain closed form solutions. In this case, EA
                                                                                   0 p1 and

EB
 0 p1 are identical and so there is no optimism effect in the time-0 price. However, we show

that there will still be a bubble at t = 0 because investors anticipate the option to resale
their shares at t = 1 in a market with optimistic buyers and short-sales constraints. In
other words, investors anticipate that there will be an optimism effect at t = 1 and properly
take this into account in their valuations at t = 0. We then consider the general case of
heterogeneous priors and show that the t = 0 price depends on both the optimism effect
and this resale-option effect.

A. The case of homogeneous priors

In this subsection, we will illustrate the effects of asset float by considering the case in which
the prior beliefs fˆA and fˆB are identical. We denote the prior belief by fˆ0 .

   The following theorem summarizes the expectation of A- and B-investors at t = 0 and
the resulting asset price for the case of homogeneous prior beliefs.

Proposition 1 If A-investors and B-investors have identical prior beliefs at t = 0, their
conditional expectations of p1 are identical:
                                                                "Ã             !             #

                 0 [p1 ]   =   EB

Their conditional variances of p1 are also identical: Σ = ΣA = ΣB . The asset price at time
0 is
                                                           "Ã             !             #
                             Σ     Q                                Q
                   p0 = fˆ0 − Q −     +E                       l1 −           I{l1 > Q } .         (18)

   There are four parts in the price. The first part, fˆ0 , is the expected value of the funda-

                                               Q

                                                  ,   represents the risk premium for holding the asset
from t = 1 to t = 2. The last term

represents the option value from selling the asset to investors in the other group when they
have higher beliefs.
   Intuitively, with differences of opinion and short-sales constraints, the possibility of sell-
ing shares when other investors have higher beliefs provides a resale option to the asset
owners (see Harrison and Kreps (1978) and Scheinkman and Xiong (2003)). If φ = 1, the
possibility does not exist. Otherwise, the payoff from the resale option depends on the
potential deviation of one group’s belief from that of the other group.
   The format of the resale option is similar to a call option the underlying asset as the
difference in beliefs l1 . From Lemma 1, it is easy to show that
                                                  (φ − 1)τ² A
                                          l1 =             (²f − ²B
                                                                  f ).                             (20)
                                                      τ
So l1 has a Gaussian distribution with a mean of zero and a variance of σl2 :

                                                      (φ − 1)2 (φ + 1)τ²
                                          σl2 =                                                    (21)

under the beliefs of either group B (or A) agents. The strike price of the resale option is

   .   Therefore, an increase in Q or a decrease in η would raise the strike price of the resale
option, and will reduce the option value. Direct integration provides that

where N is the cumulative probability function of a standard normal distribution.

Proposition 2 The size of the bubble decreases with the relative magnitudes of supply Q
to risk absorption capacity η, and increases with the overconfidence parameter φ.

Intuitively, when agents are risk averse, the two groups naturally want to share the risk
of holding the shares of the asset. Hence they are unwilling to hold the float without a
substantial price discount. A larger float means that it takes a greater divergence in opinion
in the future for an asset buyer to resell the shares, which means a less valuable resale
option today. So, ex ante, agents are less willing to pay a price above their assessments of
fundamentals and the smaller is the bubble.
       Since there is limited risk absorption capacity, price naturally declines with supply even in
the absence of speculative trading. But when there is speculative trading, price becomes even
more sensitive to asset supply—i.e. a multiplier effect arises. To see this, consider two firms
with the same share price, except that one’s price is determined entirely by fundamentals
whereas the other includes a speculative bubble component as described above. The firm
with a bubble component has a smaller fundamental value than the firm without to give
them the same share price. We show that the elasticity of price to supply for the firm with a
speculative bubble is greater than that of the otherwise comparable firm without a bubble.
This multiplier effect is highly nonlinear—it is much bigger when the ratio of supply to risk
bearing capacity is small than when it is large. The reason follows from the fact that the
strike price of the resale option is proportional to Q. These results are formally stated in
the following proposition:

Proposition 3 Consider two otherwise comparable stocks with the same share price, except
that one’s value includes a bubble component whereas the other does not. The elasticity of
price to supply for the stock with a speculative bubble is greater than the otherwise comparable
stock. The difference in these elasticities is given by |∂B/∂Q|. This difference peaks when
                           1
Q = 0 (at a value of      2ητ
                              )   and monotonically diminishes when Q becomes large.

                                                   11
   Moreover, since share turnover and share return volatility are tied to the amount of
speculative trading, these two quantities also decrease with the ratio of asset float to risk
absorption capacity.

Proposition 4 The expected turnover rate from t = 0 to t = 1 decreases with the ratio of
supply Q to risk-bearing capacity η and increases with φ. The sum of return variance across
the two periods decreases with the ratio of supply Q to risk-bearing capacity.

   To see why expected share turnover decreases with Q, note that at t = 0, both groups
share the same belief regarding fundamentals and both hold one-half of the shares of the
float. (This is also what one expects on average since both groups of investors’ prior beliefs
about fundamentals is identical.) The maximum share turnover from this period to the next
is for one group to become much more optimistic and end up holding all the shares—this
would yield a turnover ratio of one-half. But the larger is the float, the greater a divergence
of opinion it will take for the optimistic group to hold all the shares tomorrow and therefore
the lower is average share turnover.
   The intuition for return volatility is similar. Imagine that the two groups of investors
have the same prior belief at t = 0 and each holds one-half of the shares of the float. Next
period, if one group buys all the shares from the other, the stock’s price depends only on the
optimists’ belief. In contrast, if both groups are still in the market, then the price depends
on the average of the two groups’ beliefs. Since the variance of the average of the two beliefs
is less than the variance of a single group’s belief alone, it follows that the greater the float,
the less likely it will be for one group to hold all the shares and hence the lower is price
volatility.

B. The case of heterogeneous priors

We now develop intuition for the equilibrium price at t = 0 in the general case of heteroge-
nous priors. We first define a function

                                                           <l

Let l1B ≡ fˆ1A − fˆ1B and l1A ≡ fˆ1B − fˆ1A . Following the discussion in the section on the case
of homogeneous priors, if l = l1B , then H(l1B ) is the payoff of investor B’s resale option at

                                                 12

   The key thing to focus on is bubble component given in equation (26). In Case 1, investor
A is the optimist at t = 0 and owns all the shares. The bubble component in this case has
                f0A −f0B
two parts:          2
                         , which is the             upward bias due to heterogeneous priors or the optimism
effect, and     E0A [H(l1A )], which is             investor A’s expected value of his resale option at t = 1.
                                                                                                                   f0B −f0A
In Case 3, investor B is the optimist and so the optimism bias is now given by                                         2
                                                                                                                            and
the resale option component of the bubble is now determined by investor B,                                    E0B [H(l1B )]. In


                                                                  13
Case 2, both groups of investors are long the stock at t = 0 and so the bubble component
is a weighted average of the resale options of groups A and B, but the bias in price due to
initial different priors is ambiguous, depending on other factors such as the difference in the
perceived variances of the two groups for holding the stock between t = 0 and t = 1.
   For the most part, the comparative statics derived in the case of homogeneous priors
will hold in the general case of heterogeneous, as we show below with numerical exercises
calibrated to the NASDAQ experiences. But there is an important caveat to this statement.
When the difference in initial beliefs is big enough, share turnover can increase (rather than
decrease) with asset float when float is small (counter to the result regarding share turnover
in Proposition 4). To see why, suppose that asset float is small to begin with and gro
upAismuchmoreoptimisticthanB.ThenAis likely to hold all the shares at date (1, 0). As a
result, expected turnover in Stage 1 is small because the chances of a switch in opinions is
low. Now imagine that asset float is slightly higher. Then both investors will be holding a
share of the asset at t = 1 and any change in their relative beliefs will generate turnover
at t = 1. Hence, an increase in asset float will increase rather than decrease turnover. In
our numerical exercises, we find this reverse effect of float on turnover only when initial
differences in beliefs are very big and when the change in float is very small. For moderate
changes in float or for moderate levels of initially different priors, turnover decreases with
float. When we calibrate our numerical exercises to NASDAQ experience, this effect does
not show up.


II.   A Model with Lockup Expirations
A. Set-up

We now extend the simple model of the previous section to allow for time-varying float
due to insider selling. Investors trade an asset that initially has a limited float because of
lock-up restrictions but the tradeable shares of which increase over time as insiders become
free to sell their positions. In practice, the lock-up period lasts around six months after a
firm’s initial public offering date. During this period, most of the shares of the company are
not tradeable by the general public. The lock-up expiration date (the date when insiders
are free to trade their shares) is known to all in advance.

                                 [ Insert Figure 1 here ]


                                              14
    The model has infinitely many stages marked by i = 1, 2, 3, · · · , ∞. The timeline is
described in Figure 1. Stage 1 contains three periods denoted by (1, 0), (1, 1), and (1,
2). Stage 1 represents the dates around the relaxation of the lockup restrictions. The rest
of the stages, i = 2, 3, · · · , ∞, capture the time after insiders have sold all their shares to
outsiders. Each of these stages has two periods, denoted by (i, 0) and (i, 1).16
    The asset pays a stream of dividends, denoted by D1 , D2 , · · · , Di , · · ·. The dividends
are independent, identically and normally distributed; their distributions are given by
N (D̄, 1/τ0 ). Each dividend is paid out at the beginning of the next stage. There are
two groups of outside investors A and B (as before) and a group of insiders who all share
the same information. So there is no information asymmetry between insiders and outsiders
in this model. And we assume that all agents in the model, including the insiders, are price
takers (i.e. we rule out any sort of strategic behavior).17
    In Stage 1, investors start with a float of Qf on date (1, 0). For generality, we assume
that the prior beliefs of the two groups of investors about D1 are normally distributed and
denoted by N (D̄A , τ0 ) and N (D̄B , τ0 ). D̄A and D̄B can be potentially different. On date
(1, 1), two signals on the first dividend component become available

                                    sA         A    B         B
                                     1 = D1 + ²1 , s1 = D1 + ²1 ,                                              (27)

where ²A      B
       1 and ²1 are also independent signal noises with identical normal distributions of

zero mean and precision of τ² . On date (1, 2), some of the insiders’ shares, denoted by Qin ,
become floating—this is known to all in advance. So the total asset supply on this date is
Qf + Qin ≤ Q̄. At the lock-up expiration date, insiders rarely are able to trade all their
shares for price impact reasons. The assumption that only Qin shares are tradeable is meant
to capture this. In other words, it typically takes a while after the expiration of lock-ups
for all the shares of the firm to be floating. Importantly, the insiders can also trade on this
date based on their assessment of the fundamental. The exact value of D1 is announced
and paid out before the beginning of the n extstage.
  16
     In the context of the internet bubble, take the stock to be the internet sector and the lock-up expiration date
corresponds to the Winter of 2000 when the asset float increased dramatically as the result of many internet lock-ups
expiring and insiders being able to trade their shares (see Ofek and Richardson (2003), Cochrane (2003)).
  17
     Our assumption that there is symmetric information among insiders and outsiders is clearly an abstraction from
reality. But we want to see what results we can get in the simplest setting possible. If we allowed insiders to have
private information and the chance to manipulate prices, our results are likely to remain since insiders have an
incentive to create bubbles and to cash out of their shares when price is high. See our discussion in the conclusion
for some preliminary ways in which our model can be imbedded into a richer model of initial public offerings and
strategic behavior on the part of insiders.


                                                         15
      At the beginning of Stage 2, date (2, 0), we assume, for simplicity, that the insiders
are forced to liquidate their positions from Stage 1. The market price on this date is
determined by the demands of the outside investors and the total asset supply of Q̄. Insiders’
positions are marked and liquidated at this price and they are no longer relevant for price
determination during this stage. We assume that the prior beliefs of the two groups of
investors about D2 are again normally distributed and denoted by N (D̄A , τ0 ) and N (D̄B , τ0 ).
D̄A and D̄B can be potentially different. On date (2, 1), two signals become available on
the second dividend component:

                              sA         A    B         B
                               2 = D2 + ²2 , s2 = D2 + ²2 ,                                 (28)

where ²A      B
       2 and ²2 are independent signal noises with identical normal distributions of zero

mean and precision of τ² . D2 is paid out before the beginning of Stage 3. Stages 3 and other
stages afterward all have an identical structure to Stage 2.
      Insiders are assumed to have mean-variance preferences with a total risk tolerance of
ηin . They correctly process all the information pertaining to fundamentals. At date (1,
2), insiders trade to maximize their terminal utility at date (2, 0), when they are forced
to liquidate all their positions. Investors in groups A and B also have per-period mean-
variance preferences, where η is the risk tolerance of each group. Unlike the insiders, due to
overconfidence, group A over-estimates the precision of the A-signals at each stage as φτ² ,
while group B over-estimates the precision of the B-signals at each stage as φτ² .
      Since investors are overconfident, each group of investors think that they are rational
and smarter than the other group. Since insiders are typically thought of as having more
knowledge about their company than outsiders, it seems natural to assume that each group
of investors thinks that the insiders are “smart” or “rational” like them. In other words, each
group believes that the insiders are more likely to share their expectations of fundamentals
and hence be on the same side of the trade than the insiders are to be like the other group.
We assume that they agree to disagree about this proposition. Thus, on date (2, 1), both
group-A and group-B investors believe that insiders will trade like themselves on date (1,
2).
      Another important assumption that buys tractability but does not change our conclu-
sions is that we do not allow insiders to be active in the market in Stage 2 and stages
afterward. We think this is a reasonable assumption in practice since insiders, because of
various insider trading rules, are not likely to be speculators in the market on par with

                                               16
outside investors in the steady state of a company. And we think of Stage 2 as being a time
when insiders have largely cashed out of the company for liquidity reasons. We solve the
model by backward induction.

B. Solution
B.1.      Stages after the lock up expiration

As we described above, all the stages after the lock up expiration are independent and have
an identical structure as our basic model in the previous section. At date (2, 0), insiders
are forced to liquidate their positions from Stage 1 and they are no longer relevant for price
determination from then on. Thus the market price is determined by the demands of the
outside investors and the total asset supply of Q̄. Moreover, outsiders’ decisions from this
point forward depend only on the dividend of the current period as dividend components of
earlier periods have been paid out. As such, we do not have to deal with what the outside
investors learned about D1 and that insiders may not have taken the same positions as them
at date (1, 2). In fact there is no need to assume that an individual outsider stays in the
same group after each stage. If individuals are randomly relocated across groups at the end
of each stage, our results are not changed. In addition, we assume a constant discount factor
R to discount cashflows across different stages, and there is no discount within a stage.
   Without loss of generality, we discuss the price formation in Stage i, (i = 2, 3, · · · , ∞).
At date (i, 0), the prior beliefs of the two groups of investors about the dividend Di
are N (D̄A , 1/τ0 ) and N (D̄B , 1/τ0 ), respectively. We denote their beliefs at date (i, 1)
by N (D̂iA , 1/τ ) and N (D̂iB , 1/τ ), respectively. Applying the results from Lemma 1, the
precision is given by equation (3) and the means by
                                      φτ² A            τ²
                          D̂iA = D̄A +   (si − D̄A ) + (sB    − D̄B ),                     (29)

   The solution for equilibrium prices is nearly identical to that obtained from our simple
model of the previous section. Applying Lemmas 2 and 4, we have the following equilibrium
prices:

where Π and BH are defined in equations (25) and (26). On date (i, 0), the asset price is
purely determined by investors’ prior beliefs of Di , and therefore is deterministic. On date
(i, 1), price depends on the divergence of opinion among A and B investors. If their opinions
                              Q̄
differ enough (greater than   ητ
                                 ),   then short-sales constraints bind and one group’s valuation
dominates the market.

B.2.   Stage 1: Around-the-lock-up expiration date

During this stage, trading is driven entirely by the investors’ and the insiders’ expectations
of D1 because D1 is independent of future dividends. In other words, information about D1
tells agents nothing about future dividends. As a result, the demand functions of agents in
this stage mirror the simple mean-variance optimization rules of the previous section.
   We begin by specifying the beliefs of the investors after observing the signals at date (1,
1). The rational belief of the insider is given by
                                      τ²                   τ²
                    D̂1in = D̄ +            (sA
                                              1 − D̄) +         (sB − D̄).                    (33)
                                   τ0 + 2τ²             τ0 + 2τ² 1
Due to overconfidence, the beliefs of the two groups of investors at date (1, 1) regarding D1
are given by N (D̂A , 1/τ ) and N (D̂B , 1/τ ), where the precision of their beliefs τ is given by
equation (3) and the means of their beliefs by
                                    φτ² A            τ²
                       D̂1A = D̄A +    (s1 − D̄A ) + (sB        A
                                                          1 − D̄ ),                           (34)
                                     τ               τ
                                    τ²              φτ ² B
                        D̂1B = D̄B + (sA      B
                                        1 − D̄ ) +      (s − D̄B ).                           (35)
                                    τ                τ 1
   We next specify the investors’ beliefs at date (1, 1) about what the insiders will do at
date (1, 2). Recall that each group of investors thinks that the insiders are smart like them
and will share their beliefs at date (1, 2). As a result, the investors will have different beliefs
at date (1, 1) about the prevailing price at date (1, 2), p1,2 . These beliefs, denoted by pA
                                                                                            1,2

and pB
     1,2 , are calculated in the Appendix.

   The price at (1, 1) is determined by the differential expectations of A- and B- investors
about the price at (1, 2). If Qin is perfectly known at (1, 1), there is no uncertainty between
dates (1, 1) and (1, 2). Thus, group-A investors are willing to buy an infinite amount if the
price p1,1 is less than pA
                         1,2 , while group-B investors are willing to buy an infinite amount if


                                                  18
the price p1,1 is less than pB
                             1,2 . As a result, at (1, 1), the asset price is determined by the

maximum of pA        B
            1,2 and p1,2 .

as the payoff from the resale option on date (1,1). It is a piecewise linear function with
four segments of the difference in beliefs. This piecewise linear function is analogous to
the triplet function of the previous section, except that speculation about insider selling
makes the function more complicated. Let lB ≡ fˆA − fˆB and lA ≡ fˆB − fˆA . Following the

discussion in the section on the case of homogeneous priors, if l =                              l1B ,   then H(l1B ) is the
payoff of investor B’s resale option at t = 1. If l = l1A , then H(l1A ) is the payoff of investor
A’s resale option at t = 1.
   Armed with this observation, we derive the equilibrium price on date (1,0) in the lemma
below.

now includes speculation about insider selling.

C. Results
C.1.   Price change across the lock-up expiration date

One such outstanding stylized fact involves price dynamics across the lock-up expiration
date. Empirical evidence suggests that stock prices tend to decline on the day of the event
(see Brav and Gompers (2003), Bradley et al (2001), Field and Hanka (2001) and Ofek and
Richardson (2000)). This finding is puzzling since the date of this event is known to all in
advance.
   However, our model is able to rationalize it with the following proposition.

Proposition 5 When the belief of the optimistic group in Stage 1 is higher than the insiders’
belief, the stock price falls on the lock-up expiration date.

At (1, 1), right before the lock-up expiration at (1, 2), agents from the more optimistic
group anticipate that insiders will share their belief after the lock-up expiration. Since
insiders are rational (i.e. properly weighing the two public signals), they have a different
belief than the overconfident investors. We show that their belief will be lower than that
of the optimistic investors. As a result, there will be more selling on the part of insiders on
the lock-up expiration date than is anticipated by the optimistic group holding the asset
before the lock-up expiration. Hence, the stock price falls on this date.

                                                    20
     Based on the initial beliefs of the two groups, we can provide some sufficient conditions
for D̂1o to be higher than D̂1in and therefore for the stock price to fall on the lockup expiration
date.
     First, consider the general case of heterogeneous priors. Without loss of generality, we
assume that the prior belief of group A, D̄A , is higher than D̄, the unconditional mean of
each dividend. Since group-A investors start out as overly optimistic, most likely they will
remain more optimistic than the rational belief of insiders. As we show more explicitly in
the appendix, this occurs if

               −          (sA
                            1 − D̄) +   −          (sB
                                                     1 − D̄) > −      (D̄A − D̄).             (41)
             τ   τ0 + 2τ²             τ   τ0 + 2τ²               τ τ²
Since both sA           B
            1 − D̄ and s1 − D̄ have Gaussian distributions with a mean of zero, a lin-

ear combination of these two is likely to be larger than a negative number for more than
half of the time. Thus, if we were to draw these signals infinitely many times (assuming
independence in the cross-section), the sufficient condition holds over fifty percent of the
time.
     If we assume that the two groups start with identical priors, then we can state more
precise sufficient conditions. If the two groups of investors start with the same prior belief
equal to D̄, the optimistic one can still have a belief higher than the insiders’ after the
investors overreact to the observed signals. As we show in the appendix, the optimistic
group’s belief is higher than the insiders’ belief if

                                     max(sA    B
                                          1 , s1 ) > D̄.                                      (42)

When this condition is satisfied, the group that overreacts to the larger signal becomes too
optimistic relative to the insiders. Since the signals sA      B
                                                        1 and s1 are symmetrically distributed

around D̄ (in objective measure), it follows that the maximum of the two signals will be
greater than D̄ for more than half of the time. Indeed, we can derive the probability of this
as

             P r[max(sA    B                              A              B
                      1 , s1 ) > D̄] = P r[max(D1 − D̄ + ²1 , D1 − D̄ + ²1 ) > 0]

                                    = 1 − P r[D1 − D̄ + ²A ≤ 0, D1 − D̄ + ²B
                                                                           1 ≤ 0]
                                                      Ã 1        !

where ρ, the correlation parameter between sA       B
                                             1 and s1 , is given by

                                                21
This correlation parameter ρ is between 0 and 1. As ρ increases from 0 to 1, the probability
decreases from 75% to 50%. This range well captures the typical finding in empirical studies
that among IPOs, around sixty-percent of them exhibit negative abnormal returns on the
lock-up expiration date (see, e.g., Brav and Gompers (2003)).

C.2.   Speculation about insider selling and the cross-section of expected returns

Since investors are overconfident, each group of investors naturally believes that the insiders
are “smart” like them. As a result, each group of investors expects the other group to be
more aggressive in taking positions in the future since the other group expects that the
insiders will eventually come in and share the risk of their positions with them. As a result,
each group believes that they can profit more from their resale option when the other group
has a higher belief.
   As we show in the proposition below, it turns out that the bubble is, all else equal, larger
as a result of the outsiders believing that the insiders are smart like them. So just as long
as insiders decide how to sell their positions based on their belief about fundamentals (they
have a positive risk bearing capacity), this effect will be present. This result is summarized
in the following proposition.

Proposition 6 For any given initial prior beliefs of investors on date (1,0), the value of the
resale option in Stage 1 increases with the insiders’ risk bearing capacity from the perspective
of each group of investors.

   Proposition 6 shows that speculation about insider selling leads to an even bigger specu-
lative component in prices before the lockup expiration, thus a larger price reduction across
the period of lockup expiration.
   The exact amount of the price reduction also depends on the volatility of the difference
in beliefs. To make this point more precise, we derive the an analytical expression of the
speculative component in the case when investors have identical prior beliefs.

Proposition 7 When investors have identical prior beliefs, the value of the resale option
in Stage 1 is
                                                          Ã            !

where B is given in equation (22). As the asset float increases after the lockup expiration,
the reduction in the resale option component increases with σl .

       The calibration exercises of the next section provide a precise assessment of the price
reduction across the lock-up expiration in the presence of heterogeneous prior beliefs. We
will rely on the calibration exercises to discuss the associated drops in share turnover and
return volatility.

III.       Calibration and the NASDAQ Bubble

Despite our model being highly stylized, it is worthwhile to get a sense of the magnitudes
that it can achieve for various parameters of interest. We readily acknowledge that there
are of course a number of other plausible reasons for why the collapse of the internet bubble
coincided with the expansion of float in the sector. The two most articulated is that short-
sales constraints became more relaxed with the expansion of float and that investors learned
after lock-ups expired that the companies may not have been as valuable as they once
thought. However, our model provides a compelling and distinct third alternative worth
exploring in depth. A bubble bursts with an expansion of asset supply in our model without
any change in the cost of short-selling. This is one of the virtues of our model, for while
short-selling costs are lower for stocks with higher float, empirical evidence indicates that it is
difficult to tie the decline in internet valuations in the Winter of 2000 merely to a relaxation
of short-sales constraints.18 Moreover, neither a relaxation of short-sales-constraints story
nor a representative-agent learning story can easily explain why trading volume and return
volatility also dried up after the bubble bursted.
       We begin our calibration exercises by picking a set of benchmark parameter values,
around which we will focus our discussion. First, we set τ0 , the prior precision of the
fundamental, to one without lost of generality. We then let τ² , the precision of the public
signals be equal to 0.4. In other words, we are assuming that the precision of the public signal
is forty-percent that of the fundamental. We also assume that the fundamental component
accounts for 20% of the pre-lock-up price (this is given by a parameter a) and that the
bubble component accounts for the remaining 80% (1 − a). We set R = 1.1 and we let the
ratio between asset float and risk bearing capacity during the lock-up stage, k1 = Qf /η, be
10.
       To complete our numerical exercises, we need to specify the fraction of the bubble during
the lock-up stage (stage 1) that is due to the optimism effect and the fraction due to the resale
  18
    See Ofek and Richardson (2003). Indeed, it is difficult to account for differences, at a given point in time, in the
valuations of the internet sector and their non-internet counterpart to differences in the cost-of-short-selling alone.


                                                          23
option effect. These fractions are determined by varying two parameters: l0 = |D̄A − D̄B |,
the initial difference in priors and φ, the overconfidence parameter. Let α represent the
fraction of the bubble due to the optimism effect. In the numerical exercises presented
below, we will consider various values of α. In these exercises, we are interested in the
effects of an increase in asset float after the lockup expiration, given by k2 = Q̄/η. Hence,
we present results for the change in price, volatility and turnover for various values of k2 .
   Finally, to evaluate these effects, we first set ηin = 0, i.e. insiders are pure liquidity
traders. Thus, there is no room for investors to speculate over insider selling after the
lockup expiration, and the bias in price in stage 1 comes only from the differences in priors
and the resale option. We will evaluate the effect of speculation about insider selling later
by considering non-zero values of ηin .
   Based on these parameters, we calculate the change in price, share turnover and return
volatility across lock-up expiration in Table I. In Panel A, we assume that α = 1 – the
bubble is purely due to the optimism effect. First, consider how the change in price varies
with k2 . A price drop is defined as the ratio of the after lock-up price (p2,0 ) to the price
before lock-up expiration (p1,0 ) minus one. When k2 = k1 = 10, there is no drop in price.
As k2 gradually increases, the drop in price rises steadily. When k2 reaches 40 (four times
the initial float), the price drop by about 22%. We next report the changes in turnover
and volatility. When the bubble is 100% due to the optimism effect, there is no change
in turnover and volatility across the lock-up expiration. The reason is that when φ = 1,
the optimistic group at the start of each stage remains the optimistic group at the end of
each stage. As a result, there is no turnover in each stage and hence no change in turnover
across stages. Similarly, volatility depends on by whether the price is determined by the
expectation of the optimistic group or by the expectations of both groups. Since we assume
that the degree of initial heterogeneous priors, l0 , remains the same across stages, there is
no change in volatility across stages. These findings suggest that a bubble due purely to
the optimism effect is not able to account for the empirical findings related to turnover and
volatility.

                                  [ Insert Table I here ]

   In Panel B, we let 75% of the Stage 1 bubble (during the lock-up stage) be due to
the optimism effect and the other 25% due to the resale option effect. First, notice that
we get a bigger drop in price for each value of k2 . Apparently, the resale option is more

                                              24
sensitive to float than is the optimism effect. We begin to see drops in turnoverandvolatil-
ity.Noticethateventhoughonly 25% of the bubble during the lock-up stage is due to the
resale option, we are able to generate a substantial drop in turnover due to an increase in
float. Moreover, we are even able to get a reasonable drop in volatility. For instance, when
k2 = 40, we get a price drop of 74%, a drop in turnover of 53% and a drop in volatility of
7%. We get similar results in Panel C, where we set α to 0.5 — so 50% of the bubble is
initially due to the optimism effect and 50% due to the resale option effect. When k2 = 40,
we get a price drop of nearly 76% and a drop in turnover of in excess of 55% and a drop in
volatility of greater than 14%.
   In Panels D and E, we increase α to 0.75 and 1 respectively. In these two cases, we get
bigger drops in price and turnover but the drop in volatility is less pronounced. Indeed,
without any initial difference in prior beliefs (α = 0), an increase in k2 from 10 to 40 causes
the volatility to drop by a modest 6%. It is interesting to note that the difference in prior
beliefs can make the drop in volatility much more significant. This is due to the fact that
the price in Stage 1 is more likely to be determined by the optimist’s belief, rather than
the less volatile average belief. This finding highlights the importance of incorporating the
difference of prior beliefs in understanding the burst of the NASDAQ bubble.
   Taking stock of the results in Table I, our preferred specification to simultaneously
match price, turnover and volatility patterns is for α to be near 0.5. We need to incorporate
heterogeneous priors to better match the findings of a significant drop in volatility following
the bursting of the Nasdaq bubble. Interestingly, empirical findings indicate that following
the busting of the bubble, price and turnover dropped significantly, whereas return volatility
only dropped modestly. Our model delivers such a message—we are able to get very big
drops in price and share turnover with an increase in float but only modest drops in volatility.

                                    [ Insert Table II here ]

   In Table II, we evaluate the price effect caused by investors’ speculation over insider
selling. For simplicity, we take the parameter values from Panel C of Table I and focus on
the case of k2 = 30. We measure the insiders’ risk bearing capacity by its fraction in the
                      ηin
whole market: h =   2η+ηin
                           .   As h increases from 0 to 50%, the magnitude of the drop in price
goes up from 50.7% to over 59.9%. As we discussed earlier, as the insiders’ risk bearing
capacity ηin increases, there is more room for outside investors to speculate, thus causing an
even larger resale option component in the initial price before the lockup expiration. This

                                                25
in turn will lead to a larger price drop in price across the lockup expiration.

                                 [ Insert Table III here ]

   Finally, our model is capable of accommodating the possibility that investors with het-
erogeneous priors might no longer have different priors after the lock-up expiration. This will
naturally lead to a drop in prices after lock-up expiration. We label this effect a waking-up
effect. In Table III, we introduce this waking up effect into our numerical exercises and see
how our results are changed. We take Panel C of Table I and additionally assume that after
Stage 1, investors have homogeneous priors. Not surprisingly, we see that there is a bigger
drop in prices as a result of this waking up effect but they are not significantly bigger once
a reasonable amount of float increase, for example k2 = 40, is accounted for. The upshot is
that we are able to do quite well in matching stylized facts simply using asset float.


IV.     Empirical Relevance

Up to this point, we have tried to motivate our model using the dot-com bubble of the late
nineties. In this section, we provide evidence (beyond the dot-come experience) in support
of our model. Following the suggestions of the referee, we first review accounts of earlier
speculative bubbles in the US stock market to see if asset float also played a key role in these
experiences. Second, we describe empirical research undertaken by Mei, Scheinkman and
Xiong (2004) that tests the simple model in Section 3 using unique data from the Chinese
stock market.
   It is not difficult to find fairly detailed accounts of other speculative manias in the US
stock market (see, e.g., Malkiel (2003), Shiller (2000), Kindleberger (1996), Nairn (2002)).
A striking theme in all these accounts is the similarity of the dot-com experience to earlier
speculative manias. One key similarity is that all the speculative episodes were engendered
by excitement over new technologies at the time. Examples include the electronics craze
of 1959-1964 and the microelectronics and biotechnology excitement of 1980s. Indeed, just
as in the dot-com era, the changing of company names were enough to lead to temporarily
inflated valuations during these other episodes.
   Another key similarity is the importance of speculation along the lines described in this
paper as a driver of price movements. For instance, Malkiel (2003, p.53) writes: “And yet
professional investors participated in several distinct speculative movements from the 1960s


                                              26
through the 1990s. In each case, professional institutions bid actively for stocks not because
they felt such stocks were undervalued under the firm-foundation principle, but because
they anticipated that some greater fools would take the shares off their hands at even more
inflated prices.”
   But probably most relevant from our perspective is that most of the speculative manias
were most prominent for IPOs with limited asset float. Malkiel (2003) describes as common
during earlier speculative episodes for the mania to take off for issues with limited float. In
describing the environment during the electronics bubble of the 60s, Malkiel (2003, p.54-
55) writes: “For example, some investment bankers, especially those who underwrote the
smaller new issues, would often hold a substantial volume of securities off the market. This
made the market so “thin” at the start that the price would rise quickly in the after market.
In one “hot issue” that almost doubled in price on the first day of trading, the SEC found
that a considerable portion of the entire offering was sold to broker-dealers, many of whom
held on to their allotments for a period until the shares could be sold at much higher prices.”
These descriptions fit well with our analysis in Section 3 that bubbles are larger when asset
float is limited.
   Beyond these anecdotal accounts, research under taken by Mei, Scheinkman and Xiong
(2004) provides direct evidence in support of our simple model of Section 3. They test
our model using unique data from the Chinese stock market during the period of 1994-
2000. This market, with stringent short-sales constraints, lots of inexperienced individual
investors, a small asset float and heavy share turnover (500% a year) is ideal for testing our
model.
   More specifically, they analyze the prices of several dozen Chinese firms that offer two
classes of shares: class A, which could only be held by domestic investors, and class B,
which could only be traded by foreigners. Despite identical rights, A-share prices were on
average 400% higher than the corresponding B-shares and A-shares turned over at a much
higher rate, 500% versus 100% per year for B shares. This dataset is ideal to test our
model because B-share prices and other characteristics allow us to untangle the speculative
component of prices. The tradeable shares of these Chinese companies comprise about one-
third of all shares (the remaining two-thirds are non-tradeable, state-owned shares). The
market capitalization (or asset float) of these companies are calculated using only tradeable
shares.
   The paper finds a negative and significant cross-sectional relationship between share

                                              27
turnover and asset float in A-share markets but a positive and significant relationship in
B-share markets. Since our model predicts a negative correlation between turnover and
float, and liquidity usually improves with larger float, these results suggest that trading in
A-shares is driven by speculation, while trading in B-shares is more consistent with liquidity.
Moreover, asset float affects share premium. The asset float or market cap of A-shares has a
negative and highly significant effect on A-B share premium—higher asset float of A-shares
controlling for a host of contemporaneous variables including turnover leads to lower prices
of A-shares relative to its B counterpart. In contrast, the market cap of B-shares has a
negative and highly significant effect on A-B share premium—higher float leads to high B
prices and a smaller A-B premium, consistent with higher float leading to more liquid B
shares and higher B prices. These findings provide out of sample empirical support for our
model.


V.      Conclusion

In this paper, we develop a discrete-time, multi-period model to understand the relationship
between the float of an asset (the publicly tradeable shares) and the propensity for spec-
ulative bubbles to form. Investors trade a stock that initially has a limited float because
of insider lock-up restrictions but the tradeable shares of which increase over time as these
restrictions expire. They are assumed to have heterogeneous beliefs due to overconfidence
and are short-sales constrained. As a result, they pay prices that exceed their own valuation
of future dividends because they anticipate finding a buyer willing to pay even more in the
future. This resale option imparts a bubble component in asset prices. With limited risk
absorption capacity, this resale option depends on float as investors anticipate the change
in asset supply over time and speculate over the degree of insider selling.
     Our model yields a number of empirical implications that are consistent with stylized
accounts of the importance of float for the behavior of internet stock prices during the late
nineties. These implications include: 1) a stock price bubble dramatically decreases with
float; 2) share turnover and return volatility also decrease with float; and 3) the stock price
tends to decline on the lock-up expiration date even though it is known to all in advance.
     One potentially interesting avenue for future work is to embed our trading model into
a more general model of initial public offerings in which the lock-up and offer price is
endogenized. Doing so would allow us to address additional issues such as why we observe


                                              28
under-pricing in initial public offerings. For instance, in the context of our model, under-
pricing, to the extent it attracts a greater number of market participants to the stock, may
make sense for insiders. In our model, more investors means better risk-sharing and hence
naturally leads to a bigger bubble. More investors may also mean bigger divergence of
opinion, which again means a bigger bubble.19 We leave the clarification of these issues for
future work.

                             Appendix. Technical Proofs

Proof of Lemma 1
   See DeGroot (1970).

Proof of Lemmas 2 and 3
   Proof follows from substituting in the equilibrium price into demands given in equations
(6) and (10) and checking that the market clears at both t = 1 and t = 0.

Proof of Proposition 1
   When investors in group A and group B have the same prior, ΣA equals ΣB . We denote
them as Σ. (Moreover, note that EA          B
                                 0 [p1 ] = E0 [p1 ] as well.) It then follows from Lemma 3

that the equilibrium price at t = 0 is
                                   1                        Σ
                               p0 = (EA          B
                                      0 [p1 ] + E0 [p1 ]) −    Q.                           (A1)

   The key to understanding this price is to evaluate the expectation of p1 at t = 0 under
either of the investors’ beliefs (since they will also be the same, we will calculate EB
                                                                                       0 [p1 ]

without loss of generality). To do this, it is helpful to re-write the equilibrium price from
Lemma 2 (equations (7)-(9)) in the following form:

where l1 = fˆ1A − fˆ1B .
   For the expectation of B-investors at t = 0, there are two uncertain terms in equation
(A2), fˆB and a piecewise linear function of the difference in beliefs l1 . This piecewise linear
        1

function has three linear segments, as shown by the solid line in Figure 2. The expectation
of fˆ1B at t = 0 is simply fˆ0 . This is simply the investors’ valuation for the asset if they
were not allowed to sell their shares at t = 1. The three-piece function represents the value
from being able to trade at t = 1. Calculating its expectation amounts to integrating the
area between the solid line and the horizontal axis in Figure 2 (weighting by the probability
density of l1 ). Since the difference in beliefs l1 has a symmetric distribution around zero,
this expectation is simply determined by the shaded area, which is positive.

Similarly, one can show that     ∂η

     The size of the bubble also depends on investor overconfidence φ, the determinant of the
underlying asset – the difference in beliefs. φ has two effects on the speculative components.
     First, the volatility of l1 increases with φ. It is direct to verify that σl2 in equation (21)
strictly increases with φ:
                 ∂σl2   τ² (φ − 1)[(2φ2 + φ + 1)τ0 + (φ + 1)(3φ + 1)τ² ]
                      =                                                  > 0.                       (A8)
                 ∂φ                    φ2 [τ0 + (1 + φ)τ² ]3
Second, an increase in φ raises the belief precision τ , which in turn reduces the “strike price”
Q
ητ
     of the resale option t = 1. Therefore, the speculative component increases with φ.

Proof of Proposition 3
     Direct differentiation yields

                               ∂Q2      2πη 2 τ 2 σl
Thus, B is convex with respect to Q. It is direct to see that ∂B/∂Q is always negative. Its
                                                               1
magnitude |∂B/∂Q| peaks at Q = 0 with a value of              2ητ
                                                                  ,    and it monotonically diminishes as
Q becomes large.
     The asset price elasticity with respect to share supply, from equation (18), is given by
                                      "                                         #

                     p0 ∂Q    p0     2η      2ητ

For two otherwise comparable firms, i.e., they share identical Q, p0 , η, Σ and ∂Σ/∂Q, except
that one has the bubble component in price, then this firm also has a greater price elasticity
to asset supply.

   It is easy to see that as Q increases, the distribution of m becomes more centered around
zero. In the mean time ρ0→1 has a bigger value away from zero, therefore E0 [ρ0→1 ] decreases
with Q. Intuitively, when more shares are floating, it takes a bigger difference in beliefs
to turn all the shares over. Fixing all the other things, the expected share turnover rate
decreases with float.
   Similarly, as φ increases, the distribution of m becomes more dispersed. As a result,
E0 [ρ0→1 ] rises. Intuitively, when agents are more overconfident, there is more dispersion in
beliefs, and therefore more turnover.

Thus, the sum of return variance across the two periods is

Notice that from A’s perspective, the insiders’ demand function is determined by D̂1A . This
is the sense in which A thinks that the insiders are like them. The market clearing condition
is given by

                                   xin     A      B
                                    1,2 + x1,2 + x1,2 = Qf + Qin .                                    (A43)

Depending on the difference in the two groups’ expectations about fundamentals, three
possible cases arise.

                             1
Case 1: D̂1A − D̂1B >    τ (η+ηin )
                                    (Qf   + Qin ). In this case, A-investors value the asset much more
than B-investors. Therefore, A-investors expect that they and the insiders will hold all the
shares at (1, 2):

                                 xA      in                B
                                  1,2 + x1,2 = Qf + Qin , x1,2 = 0.                                   (A44)

As a result, the price on date (1, 2) is determined by A-investors’ belief D̂1A and a risk
premium:
                                   1                    1
                          pA
                           1,2 =     p2,0 + D̂1A −              (Qf + Qin ).                          (A45)
                                   R               τ (η + ηin )

We put a superscript A on price pA
                                 1,2 to emphasize that this is the price expected by group-A

investors at (1, 1). The realized price on (1, 2) might be different since insiders do not share
the same belief as group-A investors in reality. Since A-investors expect insiders to share
the risk with them, the risk premium is determined by the total risk bearing capacity of
A-investors and insiders.

Case 2: − τ1η (Qf +Qin ) ≤ D̂1A − D̂1B ≤           1
                                               τ (η+ηin )
                                                          (Qf +Qin ).   In this case, the two groups’ beliefs
are not too far apart and both hold some of the assets at (1, 2). The market equilibrium at
(1, 2) is given by

                                  τ η(η + ηin ) A               η + ηin
               xA      in
                1,2 + x1,2 =                   (D̂1 − D̂1B ) +          (Qf + Qin ),                  (A46)
                                    2η + ηin                   2η + ηin
                                  τ η(η + ηin ) B                  η
                         xB
                          1,2   =              (D̂1 − D̂1A ) +          (Qf + Qin ).                  (A47)
                                    2η + ηin                   2η + ηin
And the equilibrium price is simply
                        1        η + ηin A         η                  1

            1,2 =         p2,0 +          D̂1 +          D̂1B −               (Qf + Qin ).            (A48)
                        R        2η + ηin       2η + ηin        τ (2η + ηin )


                                                       37
Since both groups participate in the market, the price is determined by a weighted average of
the two groups’ beliefs. The weights are related to the risk-bearing capacities of each group.
Notice that A-investors’ beliefs receive a larger weight in the price because A-investors
expect insiders to take the same positions as them on date (1, 2). The risk premium term
depends on total risk-bearing capacity in the market.

Case 3: D̂1A − D̂1B < − τ1η (Qf + Qin ). In this case, A-investors’ belief is much lower than that
of the B-investors’. Thus, A-investors stay out of market at (1, 2). Since they also believe
that insiders share their beliefs, A-investors anticipate that all the shares of the company
will be held by B-investors. In other words, we have that

                                   xA      in        B
                                    1,2 + x1,2 = 0, x1,2 = Qf + Qin .                                           (A49)

The asset price is determined solely by B-investors’ belief:
                                          1               1
                               pA
                                1,2 =       p2,0 + D̂1B − (Qf + Qin ).                                          (A50)
                                          R              τη
And the risk premium term only depends on B-investors’ risk-bearing capacity.

B. Calculating B-investors’ belief about p1,2

Following a similar procedure as for group-A investors, we can derive what B-investors
expect the price at date (1, 2) to be. This price pB
                                                   1,2 is given by :

                                                                                              f    in

Notice that pB                          A
             1,2 is similar in form to p1,2 except that the price weights the belief of B-

investors, D̂1B , more than that of A-investors’ since B-investors think that the insiders share
their expectations.

C. The equilibrium price p1,2

The price at (1, 1) is given by

                                           p1,1 = max(pA      B
                                                       1,2 , p1,2 )                                             (A52)

By comparing pA        B
              1,2 and p1,2 , we obtain Lemma 5.


                                                            38
Proof of Lemma 6
   We can express p1,1 in Lemma 5 from group-A investors’ perspective as
                                      p2,0           Qf + Qin
                             p1,1 =        + D̂1A −               + H1 (l1A )                        (A53)
                                       R            τ (2η + ηin )

where l1A ≡ D̂1B − D̂1A . Thus, the expectation of group-A investors is

                    A                 p2,0           Qf + Qin
                   E1,0 (p1,1 ) =          + D̂0A −                  A
                                                                  + E1,0 [H1 (l1A )].                (A54)
                                       R            τ (2η + ηin )
Symmetrically, we can derive the expectation of group-B investors:

                    B                 p2,0           Qf + Qin
                   E1,0 (p1,1 ) =          + D̂0B −                  B
                                                                  + E1,0 [H1 (l1B )],                (A55)
                                       R            τ (2η + ηin )

where l1B ≡ D̂1A − D̂1B . In addition, we define

                    ΣA       A                    B       B
                     1 = V ar1,0 [p1,1 − p1,0 ], Σ1 = V ar1,0 [p1,1 − p1,0 ].                        (A56)

   The market clearing condition on date (1,0) implies the following three cases:

   By substituting expectations of group-A and group-B investors in equations (A54) and
(A55) into the equilibrium prices in these three cases, we obtain Lemma 6.

Proof of Proposition 5
   Let o ∈ {A, B} be the group with the more optimistic belief in Stage 1, i.e., D̂1o ≥ D̂1ō .
The stock price on (1, 1) is determined by the market clearing condition for period (1, 2)
in the group-o investors’ mind, who think that insiders share their belief when they start to
trade at (1, 2):
                              1                                 1
                   η in τ max( p2,0 + D̂1o − p1,1 , 0) + ητ max( p2,0 + D̂1o − p1,1 , 0)
                              R                                 R
                              1
                   +ητ max( p2,0 + D̂1ō − p1,1 , 0) = Qf + Qin .                            (A62)
                              R
The stock price on (1, 2) is determined by the actual market clearing at that time when
insiders start to trade based on their actual belief:
                                   1                                  1
              η in (τ0 + 2τ² ) max( p2,0 + D̂1in − p1,2 , 0) + ητ max( p2,0 + D̂1o − p1,2 , 0)
                                   R                                  R
                           1
              +ητ max( p2,0 + D̂1ō − p1,2 , 0) = Qf + Qin .                                   (A63)
                          R
Note that equations (A62) and (A63) are strictly decreasing with p1,1 and p1,2 , respectively.
Since τ0 + 2τ² < τ and D̂1in < D̂1o , equations (A62) and (A63) imply that p1,2 < p1,1 .
   Depending on the initial beliefs of the two groups, we can provide some sufficient condi-
tions for D̂1o to be higher than D̂1in .

Case 1: The two groups start with heterogeneous priors.
   Without loss of generality, we assume that the prior belief of group A, D̄A , is higher than
D̄, the unconditional mean of each dividend. Given the beliefs of the insiders and group-A
investors in equations (33) and (34), we can derive the difference between them as

             D̂1A − D̂1in
                Ã                !                µ              ¶

           = τ²     −              (s1 − D̄) + τ²     −            (sB
                                                                     1 − D̄) +   (D̄ − D̄) (A64)

the group-o investors’ belief is higher than the insiders’ belief:

                                  D̂1o − D̂1in ≥ D̂1A − D̂1in > 0.                           (A66)


                                                   40
Case 2: The two groups start with identical priors.
   Since D̄A = D̄B , by directly comparing beliefs in equations (34) and (35), we have that
so1 ≥ sō1 . Given that so1 > D̄, we can show that D̂1in < D̂1o :

Proof of Proposition 6
   According to Lemma 5, the payoff function of the resale option is H1 defined in equation
(37). It is direct to verify that this payoff function increases monotonically with the insiders’
risk bearing capacity ηin , for any given level of difference in beliefs. Thus, the value of the
resale option on date (1,0) is increasing with ηin from the perspective of either group of
investors.

Proof of Proposition 7
   When investors have identical prior beliefs, l1 = D̂1A − D̂1B has a symmetric Gaussian
distribution with a zero mean and a variance of σl2 from B-investors’ perspective. The
symmetry implies that

         The effects of asset float across the lockup expiration

   This table reports the change in price, share turnover and return volatility across lock-
up expiration, for different values of k2 (the ratio between asset float and each investor
group’s risk bearing capacity after the lockup expiration). Panels A-E are based on five
different values of α (the fraction of bubble due to the optimism effect). These panels share
the following model parameters: the fraction of fundamental component in the initial price
a = 0.2, the prior precision of the fundamental τ0 = 1, the precision of the public signal
τ² = 0.4, the discount rate R = 1.1, the ratio between asset float and each investor group’s
risk bearing capacity before the lockup expiration k1 = 10, and the risk bearing capacity of
the insiders ηin = 0.

                 Price effect of speculating insider selling

   This table reports the price effect of investors’ speculation over insider selling. We use
the following model parameters: the fraction of bubble due to optimism effect α = 0.5, the
fraction of fundamental component in the initial price a = 0.2, the prior precision of the
fundamental τ0 = 1, the precision of the public signal τ² = 0.4, the discount rate R = 1.1,
the ratio between asset float and each investor group’s risk bearing capacity before the
lockup expiration k1 = 10, and the ratio between asset float and each investor group’s risk
bearing capacity after the lockup expiration k2 = 30.

                          Additional waking-up effects

   This table reports the additional waking-up effects on the change in price, share turnover
and return volatility across lock-up expiration, for different values of k2 (the ratio between
asset float and each investor group’s risk bearing capacity after the lockup expiration). We
use the following model parameters: the fraction of bubble due to optimism effect α = 0.5,
the fraction of fundamental component in the initial price a = 0.2, the prior precision of the
fundamental τ0 = 1, the precision of the public signal τ² = 0.4, the discount rate R = 1.1,
the ratio between asset float and each investor group’s risk bearing capacity before the
lockup expiration k1 = 10, and the insiders’ risk bearing capacity ηin = 0.
