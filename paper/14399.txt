                                              ABSTRACT

The debate between "structural" and "reduced-form" approaches has generated substantial controversy
in applied economics. This article reviews a recent literature in public economics that combines the
advantages of reduced-form strategies -- transparent and credible identification -- with an important
advantage of structural models -- the ability to make predictions about counterfactual outcomes and
welfare. This recent work has developed formulas for the welfare consequences of various policies
that are functions of high-level elasticities rather than deep primitives. These formulas provide theoretical
guidance for the measurement of treatment effects using program evaluation methods. I present a
general framework that shows how many policy questions can be answered by identifying a small
set of sufficient statistics. I use this framework to synthesize the modern literature on taxation, social
insurance, and behavioral welfare economics. Finally, I discuss topics in labor economics, industrial
organization, and macroeconomics that can be tackled using the sufficient statistic approach.

   There are two competing paradigms for policy evaluation and welfare analysis in eco-
nomics: the “structural” approach and “reduced-form” approach (also known as the “pro-
gram evaluation” or “treatment e¤ect” approach).             The division between structural and
reduced-form approaches has split the economics profession into two camps whose research
programs have evolved almost independently despite focusing on similar questions.                  The
structural approach speci…es complete models of economic behavior and estimates the prim-
itives of such models. Armed with the fully estimated model, these studies then simulate the
e¤ects of counterfactual changes in policies and the economic environment on behavior and
welfare. This powerful methodology has been applied to an array of topics, ranging from
the optimal design of tax and transfer policies in public …nance to the sources of inequality
in labor economics and optimal antitrust policy in industrial organization.
   Critics of the structural approach argue that it is di¢ cult to identify all primitive para-
meters in an empirically compelling manner because of selection e¤ects, simultaneity bias,
and omitted variables. These researchers instead advocate “reduced-form” strategies that
estimate statistical relationships, paying particular attention to identi…cation concerns using
research designs that exploit quasi-experimental exogenous variation. Reduced-form studies
have identi…ed a variety of important empirical regularities, especially in labor economics,
public economics, and development.           Advocates of the structural paradigm criticize the
reduced-form approach for estimating statistics that are not policy invariant parameters of
economic models, and therefore have limited relevance for welfare analysis (Rosenzweig and
Wolpin 2000, Heckman and Vytlacil 2005).1
   This paper argues that a set of papers in public economics written over the past decade
(see Table 1) provide a middle ground between the two methods. These papers develop “su¢ -
cient statistic”formulas that combine the advantages of reduced-form empirics –transparent
and credible identi…cation –with an important advantage of structural models –the ability
to make precise statements about welfare. The central concept of the su¢ cient statistic ap-
proach (illustrated in Figure 1) is to derive formulas for the welfare consequences of policies
that are functions of high-level elasticities estimated in the program evaluation literature

rather than deep primitives.          Even though there are multiple combinations of primitives
that are consistent with the inputs to the formulas, all such combinations have the same
welfare implications.2 For example, Feldstein (1999) shows that the marginal welfare gain
from raising the income tax rate can be expressed purely as a function of the elasticity of
taxable income even though taxable income may be a complex function of choices such as
hours, training, and e¤ort. Saez (2001) shows that labor supply elasticity estimates can be
used to makes inferences about the optimal progressive income tax schedule in the Mirrlees
(1971) model.       Chetty (2008a) shows that the welfare gains from social insurance can be
expressed purely in terms of the liquidity and moral hazard e¤ects of the program in a broad
class of dynamic, stochastic models.           The goal of this survey is to elucidate the concepts
of this new su¢ cient statistic methodology by codifying the steps needed to implement it,
and thereby encourage its use as a bridge between structural and reduced-form methods in
future work.
       The idea that it is adequate to estimate su¢ cient statistics rather than primitive structure
to answer certain questions is not new; it was well understood by Marschak (1954), Koopmans
(1954), and other pioneers of structural estimation. Structural methods were preferred in
early microeconometric work because the parameters of the simple models that were being
studied could in principle be easily identi…ed. There was relatively little value to searching for
su¢ cient statistics in that class of models. In the 1980s, it became clear that identi…cation of
primitives was di¢ cult once one introduced plausible dynamics, heterogeneity, and selection
e¤ects. Concerns about the identi…cation of parameters in these richer models led a large
group of empirical researchers to abandon structural methods in favor of more transparent
program evaluation strategies (see e.g. Imbens and Wooldridge 2008 for a review of these
methods). A large library of treatment e¤ect estimates was developed in the 1980s and 1990s.
The recent su¢ cient statistic literature essentially maps such treatment e¤ect estimates into
statements about welfare in modern structural models that incorporate realistic features
such as dynamics and heterogeneity.

   2
    The term “su¢ cient statistic”is borrowed from the statistics literature: conditional on the statistics that
appear in the formula, other statistics that can be calculated from the same sample provide no additional
information about the welfare consequences of the policy.



                                                       2
       The structural and su¢ cient statistic approaches to welfare analysis should be viewed as
complements rather than substitutes because each approach has certain advantages. The
su¢ cient statistic method has three bene…ts. First, it is simpler to implement empirically
because less data and variation are needed to identify marginal treatment e¤ects than to fully
identify a structural model. This is especially relevant in models that allow heterogeneity
and discrete choice, where the set of primitives is very large but the set of marginal treatment
e¤ects needed for welfare evaluation remains fairly small. By estimating the relevant mar-
ginal treatment e¤ects as a function of the policy instrument, one can integrate the formula
for the marginal welfare gain between any two observed values to evaluate policy changes.
Second, identi…cation of structural models often requires strong assumptions – such as no
borrowing or no private insurance – given available data and variation. Since it is unnec-
essary to identify all primitives, su¢ cient statistic approaches typically do not require such
stark assumptions and therefore are less model dependent.                  Third, the su¢ cient statistic
approach can be applied even when one is uncertain about the positive model that gener-
ates observed behavior – as in recent studies in the behavioral economics literature which
document deviations from perfect rationality.              In such cases, welfare analysis based on a
structural model may be impossible, whereas the more agnostic su¢ cient statistic approach
permits some progress. For instance, Chetty, Looney, and Kroft (2008) derive formulas for
the deadweight cost of taxation in terms of price and tax elasticities in a model where agents
make arbitrary optimization errors with respect to taxes.
       The parsimony of the su¢ cient statistic approach naturally comes with costs.3                     The
…rst relates to out-of-sample predictions.          Structural methods can in principle be used to
simulate the e¤ect of any policy change, since the primitives are by de…nition policy invariant.
Because the inputs to the formulas are generally endogenous to the policy, one must estimate
marginal treatment e¤ects as a function of the policy instrument and extrapolate to make
out-of-sample predictions using the su¢ cient statistic approach. Such extrapolations may
be less reliable than those from a structural model because they are guided by a statistical

   3
   A practical cost of the su¢ cient statistic approach is the analytical work required to develop the formula.
The costs of the structural approach are to some extent computational once identi…cation problems are solved,
making it a versatile tool in an age where computation is inexpensive.



                                                      3
model rather than an economic model.4               A second and more important weakness of the
su¢ cient statistic method is that it is a “black box.” Because one does not identify the
primitives of the model, one cannot be sure whether the data are consistent with the model
underlying the welfare analysis. Although su¢ cient statistic approaches do not require full
speci…cation of the model, they do require some modelling assumptions; it is impossible to
make theory-free statements about welfare. For example, Chetty (2008b) points out that
Feldstein’s (1999) in‡uential formula for the excess burden of income taxation is based on a
model that makes assumptions about the costs of evasion and avoidance that may not be fully
consistent with the data. In contrast, because structural methods require full estimation of
the model prior to welfare analysis, a rejection of the model by the data would be evident.
       There are several ways to combine the structural and su¢ cient statistic methods to ad-
dress the shortcomings of each strategy. For instance, a structural model can be evaluated
by checking whether its predictions for local welfare changes match those obtained from
a su¢ cient statistic formula.       Conversely, when making out-of-sample predictions using a
su¢ cient statistic formula, a structural model can be used to guide the choice of functional
forms used to extrapolate the key elasticities.            Structural estimates can also be used for
“overidenti…cation tests”of the general modelling framework. By combining the two meth-
ods in this manner, researchers can pick a point in the interior of the continuum between
program evaluation and structural estimation, without being pinned to one endpoint or the
other.
       The paper is organized as follows. The next section discusses a precursor to the modern
literature on su¢ cient statistics: Harberger’s (1964) “triangle” formula for the deadweight
cost of taxation.5 I show that Harberger’s formula can be easily extended to setting with
heterogeneity and discrete choice –two of the hallmarks of modern structural models. Using

     See Lumsdaine, Stock, and Wise (1992) and Keane and Wolpin (1997) for comparisons of reduced-form
statistical extrapolations and model-based structural extrapolations. They …nd that structural predictions
are more accurate, but statistical extrapolations that include the key variables suggested by the economic
model come quite close.
   5
     Another precursor is the asset price approach to incidence (e.g. Summers 1981, Roback 1982), which
shows that changes in asset values are su¢ cient statistics for the distributional incidence of government
policies and changes in other exogenous variables in dynamic equilibrium models. I focus on the Harberger
result here because it is more closely related to the applications in the recent literature, which concentrate
on e¢ ciency and aggregate welfare rather than incidence.



                                                      4
these results as motivating examples, in Section II, I develop a general framework which
provides a “recipe” for deriving su¢ cient statistic formulas. This framework explains why
a small set of elasticities are su¢ cient for welfare analysis in many problems. Sections III
to V present three applications of the su¢ cient statistic method: income taxation, social
insurance, and behavior (non-rational) models.        These three sections provide a synthesis
of the modern public …nance literature, showing how a dozen seemingly unrelated papers
are essentially variants on the theme of …nding su¢ cient statistics. The paper concludes in
section VI with a discussion of potential applications of the su¢ cient statistic approach to
other types of counterfactual analysis beyond changes in policy.



I    A Precedent: Measuring Deadweight Loss
Harberger (1964) popularized the measurement of the excess burden of a commodity tax
using a simple elasticity-based formula.      This result can be viewed as a precedent to the
modern literature on su¢ cient statistics, and provides a starting point from which to build
intuition about the more sophisticated applications discussed below.
    Consider an economy in which an individual is endowed with Z units of the numeraire
(y), whose price is normalized to 1.     Firms convert the numeraire good y (which can be
interpreted as labor) into J other consumption goods, x = (x1 ; :::; xJ ). Producing xj units
of good j requires an input of cj (xj ) units of y, where cj is a weakly convex function. Let
       P
c(x) = Jj=1 cj (xj ) denote the total cost of producing a vector x. Production is perfectly
competitive. The government levies a unit tax t on good 1. Let p = (p1 ; :::; pJ ) the vector
of pre tax prices for the produced goods.
    To simplify the exposition, ignore income e¤ects by assuming that utility is quasilinear
in y. The consumer takes the price vector as given and solves:


                                       max u(x1 ; :::; xJ ) + y                            (1)
                                        x;y

                                       s.t. px + tx1 + y = Z




                                                5
The representative …rm takes prices as given and solves


                                       max px       c(x)                                    (2)
                                         x



These two problems de…ne maps from the price vector p to demand and supply of the J goods,
xD (p) and xS (p). The model is closed by the market clearing condition xD (p) = xS (p).
   Suppose the policy maker wants to measure the e¢ ciency cost of the tax t. The e¢ ciency
(or “deadweight”) cost of a tax increase equals the loss in surplus from the transactions that
fail to occur because of the tax. To calculate the e¢ ciency cost, the conceptual experiment
is to measure the net loss in welfare from raising the tax rate and returning the tax revenue
to the taxpayer through a lump-sum rebate.         With quasi-linear utility, the consumer will
always choose to allocate the lump-sum rebate to consumption of the numeraire good y.
Social welfare can therefore be written as the sum of the consumer’s utility (which is a
money metric given quasilinearity), producer pro…ts, and tax revenue:

                         n                           o n                 o
             W (t) =      max u(x) + Z       tx1   px + max px       c(x) + tx1
                         n x                           o    x

                       = max u(x) + Z        tx1   c(x) + tx1                               (3)
                            x



where the second equation e¤ectively recasts the decentralized equilibrium as a planner’s
allocation problem. In this expression, the term in curly brackets measures private surplus,
while the tx1 term measures tax revenue. The individual treats tax revenue as …xed when
choosing x, failing to internalize the e¤ects of his behavior on the lump-sum transfer he
ultimately receives.    This assumption, which is standard in e¢ ciency cost calculations,
captures the intuition that in an economy populated by a large number of individuals, any
one individual has a negligible impact on the government revenue and therefore treats it as
…xed.
   There are two approaches to estimating the e¤ect of an increase in the tax on social welfare
( dW
   dt
      ). The …rst is to estimate a J good demand and supply system to recover the utility
function u(x) and cost function c(x). Once u and c are known, one can directly compute
W (t).   Preferences can be recovered using the parametric demand systems proposed, for

instance, by Stone (1954) or Deaton and Muellbauer (1980).                          Alternatively, one can …t
a supply and demand system to the data and then integrate to obtain the expenditure
function, as in Hausman (1981) or Hausman and Newey (1994). The econometric challenge
in implementing any of these structural methods is simultaneity: identi…cation of the slope
of the supply and demand curves requires 2J instruments.
       Harberger (1964) suggested another solution.6 Recognizing that the behavioral responses
( dx
  dt
     ) in the curly brackets of (3) can be ignored when calculating                dW
                                                                                    dt
                                                                                         because of the envelope
conditions from maximization of utility and pro…ts. Therefore, di¤erentiating (3) yields

                                     dW (t)                       dx1    dx1 (t)
                                            =       x1 + x1 + t       =t                                     (4)
                                      dt                           dt      dt

                                  dx1 (t)
This formula shows that             dt
                                            is a “su¢ cient statistic” for welfare analysis. By estimating
dx1
 dt
    (t)   for di¤erent values of t, one can calculate the welfare consequences of any policy
change that lies within the observed support of t by integrating (4): W = W (t2 ) W (t1 ) =
R t2 dx1
 t1
    t dt (t)dt. The full system of supply and demand curves does not have to be identi…ed
to compute the welfare change                 W.
                      dW                           dx1
       The reason      dt
                              depends only on       dt
                                                         is that the government is optimizing a function
that has already been optimized by individuals and …rms (subject to constraints imposed
by the government). Although the tax induces changes in behavior and equilibrium prices,
these behavioral responses cannot have a …rst-order e¤ect on private welfare; if they did,
consumers or …rms would not be optimizing.                     The loss in social surplus from the tax is
therefore determined purely by the di¤erence between the agent’s willingness to pay for
good x1 and the cost of producing good x1 . The di¤erence can be measured by the area
between the supply and demand curves and the initial and post-tax quantities, which is
                      dx1
proportional to        dt
                          .
       The tradeo¤s between the su¢ cient statistic and structural approaches are apparent in
the debate that followed Harberger’s work.                  One limitation of (4) is that it requires that
there are no pre-existing distortions in the other markets; otherwise the spillover e¤ects would
have …rst-order e¤ects on welfare. This limitation can be addressed by an extension of the

   6
       Hines (1999) colorfully recounts the intellectual history of the deadweight loss triangle.


                                                           7
formula that includes cross-price elasticities, as shown in Harberger’s original analysis. The
more complex formula can be implemented by making plausible approximations about the
structure of the distortions that allow the formula to be written purely in terms of own-price
elasticities (Goulder and Williams 2003).7
       A second limitation of (4) is that it cannot be used to evaluate counterfactual policy
changes such as the imposition of a large new tax on good x1 .                  This limitation can be
                             dx1
addressed by estimating       dt
                                 (t)   for various values of t and integrating (4) between any two
tax rates of interest, making functional-form assumptions to extrapolate out-of-sample if
necessary.     In practice, the Harberger formula is typically implemented under a linear or
                                                   dx1
log-linear approximation to demand (e.g.            dt
                                                         constant) because data limitations preclude
estimation of higher-order properties of the demand curve. Structural simulations indicate
that linear approximations are fairly accurate, presumably because the demand functions
implied by standard models are not very curved (Shoven 1976, Ballard, Shoven, and Whalley
1985). Thus, despite its limitations, the simple Harberger “triangle” formula has become
central to applied welfare analysis and has inspired a vast literature estimating tax elasticities.
       The bene…ts of Harberger’s approach are especially evident in modern structural models
that permit heterogeneity across individuals and discrete choice. I now extend Harberger’s
analysis to incorporate these features.
   Extension 1: Heterogeneity. Now suppose the economy has N individuals with hetero-
                                                                           P
geneous preferences. Let xi denote individual i’s vector of demands and x = N    i
                                                                            i=1 x denote

aggregate demand. Individual i is endowed with Z i units of the numeraire and has utility


                                                ui (xi ) + y                                            (5)

   7
     The practical concern is that one may inadvertently ignore some pre-existing distortions and apply an
inaccurate version of the Harberger formula. Indeed, Goulder and Williams argue that previous applications
of the simple formula in (4) to assess the deadweight costs of commodity taxation are biased by an order-of-
magnitude because they fail to account for interactions with the labor income tax. This mistake would not
have been made in a properly speci…ed structural model.

The structural approach requires identi…cation of the demand functions and utilities for all
i agents. The su¢ cient statistic approach simpli…es the identi…cation problem substantially
here.      Because there is an envelope condition for xi for every agent, we can ignore all
behavioral responses within the curly brackets when di¤erentiating (6) to obtain

burden of a tax; there is no need to characterize the underlying heterogeneity in the pop-
ulation to implement (7). Intuitively, even though each individual has a di¤erent demand
elasticity, what matters for government revenue and aggregate welfare is the total change in
behavior induced by the tax.8
                                                                             dx1

the individuals at the margin will di¤er with the tax rate. Hence, it is especially important

       Extension 2: Discrete Choice. Now suppose individuals can only choose one of the J
products f1; :::; Jg. These products might represent models of cars, modes of transportation,
or neighborhoods. Each product is characterized by a vector of K attributes xj = (x1j;:::; xKj )
observed by the econometrician and an unobservable attribute                                       j.   If agent i chooses product

    Of course, to analyze a policy that has heterogeneous impacts across groups, such as a progressive income
tax, one needs group-speci…c elasticity estimates to calculate dW
                                                                dt . The key point, however, is that the only
heterogeneity that matters is at the level of the policy impact; any additional heterogeneity within groups
can be ignored. For instance, heterogeneous labor supply responses within an income group need to not be
characterized when analyzing optimal progressive income taxation.

where "ij is a random unobserved taste shock. Let Pij denote the probability that individual
                          P
i chooses option j, Pj = i Pij denote total (expected) demand for product j, and P =
(P1 ; :::; PJ ) the vector of aggregate product demands. Product j is produced by competitive

…rms using cj (Pj ) units of the numeraire good y. Let c(P ) = j cj (Pj ). This model di¤ers
from that above in two respects: (1) utility over the consumption goods is replaced by utility
                                i
over the product attributes         (xj ) +   j   + "ij and (2) the attributes can only be consumed in
discrete bundles.
    Assume that "ij has a type 1 extreme value distribution. Then it is well known from
the multinomial logit literature (see e.g. Train 2003) that the probability that a utility-
maximizing individual i chooses product j is

                                                     exp(vij )

and that agent i’s expected utility from a vector of prices p = (p1 ; :::; pJ ) is

Since utility is quasilinear, we can add producer pro…ts to this expression to obtain social
welfare:

                            W =            log(  exp(vij )) + pP                      c(P )          (9)
                                       i              j

The classical approach to policy analysis in these models is to estimate the primitives          i   and


                                                            10
, j , and simulate total surplus before and after a policy change (see e.g., Train 2003, p60).
Identi…cation of such models can be challenging, especially if the econometrician does not
observe all product attributes, since         j   will be correlated with pj in equilibrium (Berry 1994;
Berry, Levinsohn, and Pakes 1995).9
       Su¢ cient statistic approaches o¤er a means of policy analysis that does not require
identi…cation of       i   and   j.    For example, suppose the government levies a tax t on good
1, raising its price to p1 + t.          The government returns the proceeds to agents through a
lump-sum transfer T so that yi becomes yi + T .                 As above, agents do not internalize the
e¤ects of their behavior on the size of the transfer T . Using the envelope condition for pro…t
maximization,

          dW (t)   X    exp(vi1 )                 X dpj     exp(vij )       X dpj              dP1
                 =   [ P                                   P             ]+       P j + P1 + t         (10)
           dt      i     j exp(vij )               j
                                                        dt   j exp(vij )    j
                                                                              dt                dt
                           dP1 (t)
                  = t
                             dt

where the second equality follows from (8). Identi…cation of the welfare loss from taxation
of good 1 requires estimation of only the e¤ect of the tax on the aggregate market share
( dP
   dt
     1
       ), as in the standard Harberger formula.
       Now suppose that an ad-valorem tax              is levied on all the products except the numeraire
good, raising the price of product j to (1 + )pj . Again, tax revenue is returned to agents
through a lump sum grant. Following a similar derivation,

                                      dW ( )   X dPj ( )   dEP ( )
                                             =   pj      =
                                       d       j
                                                    d        d

                P
where Ep =        j   pj Pj denotes total pre tax expenditure in the market for the taxed good.
The e¢ ciency cost of a tax on all products depends on the aggregate expenditure elasticity
for the taxed market; it does not require estimation of the substitution patterns within that
market.
       Intuitively, even though the microeconomic demand functions are not continuous in dis-

    This model nests mixed logit speci…cations that permit preference heterogeneity; for instance, one could
allow i (xj ) = ( + i )xj where i is a random e¤ect.

crete choice models, the social welfare function is smooth because the distribution of valua-
tions for the goods is smooth. Since a small tax change induces a behavioral response only
among those who are indi¤erent between products, behavioral responses have a second-order
e¤ect on social welfare. As a result, one obtains a formula for excess burden that requires
estimation of only one reduced-form elasticity.10
       The modern su¢ cient statistic literature builds on Harberger’s idea of only identifying
the aspects of the model relevant for the question at hand.                   Before describing speci…c
applications of this approach, I present a general framework that nests the papers in this
literature and provides a “recipe”for developing such formulas.



II        General Framework
Abstractly, many government policies amount to levying a tax t to …nance a transfer T (t).
In the context of redistributive taxation, the transfer is to another agent in the economy; in
the context of social insurance, it is to another state of the economy; and in the context of
excess burden calculations above, the transfer can be thought of as being used to …nance a
public good. I now present a six step rubric for calculating the welfare gain from raising
the tax rate t (and the accompanying transfer T (t)) using su¢ cient statistics.
       To simplify exposition, the rubric is formally presented in a static model with a single
agent.      The same sequence of steps can be applied to obtain formulas for multi-agent
problems with heterogeneous preferences and discrete choice if U ( ) is viewed as a (smooth)
social welfare function aggregating the utilities of all the agents, as in (6) and (9). Similarly,
dynamics can be incorporated by integrating the utility function over multiple periods.
       Step 1: Specify the general structure of the model. Let x = (x1 ; :::; xJ ) denote the
vector of choices for the representative agent in the private sector. A unit tax t is levied on
choice x1 and the transfer T (t) is paid in units of xJ . Let fG1 (x; t; T ); :::; GM (x; t; T )g denote
the M < J constraints faced by the agent, which include budget constraints, restrictions on
insurance or borrowing, hours constraints, etc. The agent takes t and T as given and makes

  10
    This result does not rely on the assumption that the "ij errors have an extreme value distribution. The
distributional assumption simpli…es the algebra by yielding a closed-form solution for total surplus, but the
envelope conditions used to derive (10) hold with any distribution.

                                                     12
his choices by solving:


                             max U (x) s.t. G1 (x; t; T ) = 0; :::; GM (x; t; T ) = 0                                 (11)


The solution to (11) gives social welfare as a function of the policy instrument:

                                                                X
                                                                M
                                     W (t) = max U (x) +              m Gm (x; t; T )
                                                x
                                                                m=1


This speci…cation nests competitive production because any equilibrium allocation can be
viewed as the choice of a benevolent planner seeking to maximize total private surplus subject
to technological constraints.             For example, in the single agent Harberger model analyzed
above,


                                    U (x) = u(x1 ; :::; xJ      1)   + xJ

                         G1 (x; t; T ) = T + Z             t1 x1      c(x1 ; :::; xJ   1)    xJ .                     (12)


The researcher has considerable choice in specifying the general model used to derive the
su¢ cient statistic formula, and must tailor the model to the application of interest given
the parameters he can identify empirically. A more general speci…cation of preferences and
constraints will yield a formula that is more robust but harder to implement empirically.

   The critical unknowns are the                m   multipliers.        In the excess burden application,                1

measures the marginal value of relaxing the budget constraint. In a social insurance appli-
cation,    1   could represent the marginal value of relaxing the constraint that limits the extent
to which agents can transfer consumption across states. If                       1   is small, there is little value
                                                       dW
to social insurance, whereas if it is large,            dt
                                                             could be large.
       Step 3: Substitute multipliers by marginal utilities.                             The     m   multipliers are
recovered by exploiting restrictions from the agent’s …rst-order-conditions.                          Optimization
leads agents to equate marginal utilities with linear combinations of the multipliers:

                                                             X
                                                             M
                                                                       @Gm
                                              0
                                            u (xj ) =              m
                                                             m=1
                                                                       @xj

Inverting this system of equations generates a map from the multipliers into the marginal
utilities. To simplify this mapping, it is helpful to impose the following assumption on the
structure of the constraints.

Assumption 1. The tax t enters all the constraints in the same way as the good on which
it is levied (x1 ) and the transfer T enters all the constraints in the same way as the good in
which it is paid (xJ ). Formally, there exist functions kt (x; t; T ), kT (x; t; T ) such that

                                @Gm                 @Gm
                                    = kt (x; t; T )     8m = 1; :::; M
                                 @t                 @x1
                                @Gm                   @Gm
                                    =   kT (x; t; T )     8m = 1; :::; M
                                 @T                   @xJ

Assumption 1 requires that x1 and t enter every constraint interchangeably (up to a scale
factor kt ).11 That is, increasing t by $1 and reducing x1 by $kt would leave all constraints
una¤ected. A similar interchangeability condition is required for xJ and T . In models with
only one constraint per agent, Assumption 1 is satis…ed by de…nition.                            In the Harberger
model, where the only constraint is the budget constraint, kt corresponds to the mechanical
increase in expenditure caused by a $1 increase in t ($x1 ) vs. a $1 increase in x1 ($p1 + t).
                   x1
Hence, kt =       p1 +t
                          in that model.          Since increasing the transfer by $1 a¤ects the budget
constraint in the same way as reducing consumption of xJ by $1, kT = 1.

  11
    If the tax t is levied on multiple goods (x1 ; :::; xt ) as in Feldstein (1999), the requirement is that it enters
                                                                                                Pt                 @Gj
the constraints in the same way as the combination of all the taxed goods, i.e. @G        @t =
                                                                                            i
                                                                                                 i=1 kt (x; t; T ) @xi .


                                                             14
       Models where the private sector choices are second-best e¢ cient subject to the resource
constraints in the economy typically satisfy the conditions in Assumption 1. This is because
fungibility of resources ensures that the taxed good and tax rate enter all constraints in
the same way (see Chetty (2006) for details).               The su¢ cient statistic approach can be
implemented in models that violate Assumption 1 (see section IV for an example), but the
algebra is much simpler when this assumption holds.                  This is because the conditions in
Assumption 1 permit direct substitution into (13) to obtain:

                                                                                 @x1

                            dt          dt

This expression captures a simple and general intuition: increasing the tax t is equivalent
to reducing consumption of x1 by kt units, which reduces the agent’s utility by kt u0 (x1 (t)).
                                                                                   dT
The additional transfer that the agent gets from the tax increase is                  k
                                                                                   dt T

which raises his utility by kT dT

                                                                                  are known based on the
speci…cation of the model, this expression distills local welfare analysis to recovering a pair
of marginal utilities.12
       In models with heterogeneity, the aggregate welfare gain is a function of a pair of average
marginal utilities across agents. In dynamic models, the welfare gain is also a function of a
pair of average marginal utilities, but with the mean taken over the lifecycle for a given agent.
This result is obtained using envelope conditions when di¤erentiating the value function.
       Step 4: Recover marginal utilities from observed choices.                          The …nal step in
                                                                   dW

utilities. There is no canned procedure for this step. Di¤erent formulas can be obtained by
recovering the marginal utilities in di¤erent ways. The applications below provide several
illustrations of this step. The trick that is typically exploited is that the marginal utilities

  12
    In many applications, steps 2 and 3 are consolidated into a single step because the constraints can be
substituted directly into the objective function.

are elements in …rst-order conditions for various choices. As a result, they can be backed out
from the comparative statics of behavior. For instance, in the single agent Harberger model
above, the assumption of no income e¤ects implies u0 (xJ ) = 1. To identify u0 (x1 ), exploit
the …rst-order condition for x1 , which is u0 (x1 ) = p1 + t. Plugging in these expressions and
the other parameters above into (14), we obtain (4):

                     dW (t)             dx1                       x1                dx1 (t)
                            = 1 (x1 + t     )                          (p1 + t) = t         .
                      dt                 dt                     p1 + t                dt

   Step 5: Empirical Implementation.                                Suppose the su¢ cient statistic formula one
derives has the following form:

                                         dW            dx1 dx1
                                             (t) = f (    ;    ; t).                                               (15)
                                          dt            dt dZ

The ideal way to implement (15) is to estimate the inputs as non-parametric functions of the
                                                   dx1                dx1
policy instrument t. With estimates of              dt
                                                       (t)     and    dZ
                                                                          (t),   one can integrate (15) between any
two tax rates t1 and t2 that lie within the support of observed policies to evaluate the welfare
gain   W for a policy change of interest.                  This procedure is similar in spirit to Heckman
and Vytlacil’s (2001, 2005) recommendation that researchers estimate a complete schedule
of marginal treatment e¤ects (MTE), and then integrate that distribution over the desired
range to obtain policy relevant treatment e¤ects. In the present case, the marginal welfare
gain at t depends on the MTE at t; analysis of non-marginal changes requires estimation of
the MTE as a function of t.
   In most applications, limitations in power make it di¢ cult to estimate x1 (t) non-parametrically.
Instead, typical reduced-form studies estimate the e¤ect of a discrete change in the tax rate

                                                                                        W (t2 ) W (t1 )

Intuitively, the excess burden of taxation depends on the slope of the demand curve between
t1 and t2 , multiplied by the height of the “Harberger trapezoid” at each point. When one
observes only the average slope between the two tax rates, bounds on excess burden can be
obtained by setting the height to the lowest and highest points over the interval.
   The second option is to use an approximation to the demand curve to calculate dW=dt.
For instance, if one can estimate only the …rst-order properties of demand precisely, making
                                dx1
the approximation that           dt

be estimated accurately at the current level of t, one can at least determine the direction in
which the policy instrument should be shifted to improve welfare.
   The bottom line is that the precision of a su¢ cient statistic formula is determined by
the precision of the information available about the su¢ cient statistics as a function of the
policy instrument. In all three applications discussed below, the data and variation available
only permit estimation of …rst-order properties of the inputs, and the authors are therefore


                                                         17
constrained to calculating a …rst-order approximation of dW=dt.           The potential error in
this linear approximation can be assessed using the bounds proposed above or a structural
model.
   Step 6. Structural Evaluation and Extrapolation. The …nal step is to evaluate
the accuracy of the su¢ cient statistic formula as implemented in Step 5 using a structural
model. Unfortunately, this step is frequently neglected in existing su¢ cient statistic studies.
The structural evaluation begins by …nding a vector of structural parameters ! that is
consistent with the su¢ cient statistics estimated in step 5.      If the empirical estimates of
the su¢ cient statistics are internally consistent with the model – which may not occur
because the estimates are typically high-level elasticities (see Chetty (2006) for an example
of inconsistency) –there must be at least one ! that matches the estimated statistics. The
validity of the model can be assessed by evaluating whether the set of !’s that matches the
moments contains at least one plausible set of primitives, where plausibility is judged using
information beyond the estimated su¢ cient statistics themselves.
   The parameterized structural model is then used to run three types of simulations. First,
one compares the exact welfare gain from the simulation to the welfare gain implied by a
su¢ cient statistic formula as implemented using approximations. In many practical applica-
                                                                           x1
tions, one will likely …nd that the standard errors in the estimates of     t
                                                                                dwarf the potential
errors from ignoring the second-order properties of the inputs. A second simulation is to
explore how the su¢ cient statistics vary with the policy instrument – e.g. evaluating the
           dx1
shape of    dt
               (t).   If certain behaviors are highly non-linear functions of t, the higher-order
terms implied by either the structural model or empirical estimates can be included in the
su¢ cient statistic formula. Finally, one can use structural simulations to guide the func-
tional forms used to make extrapolations using the su¢ cient statistic formula outside the
observed support of policies. Conversely, one can make out-of-sample predictions and solve
for the globally optimal policy using the structural model, having the con…dence that the
model has been calibrated to match the moments relevant for local welfare analysis. Note
that there will generally be more than one value of ! will be consistent with the su¢ cient
statistics. In such cases, the simulations should be repeated with multiple values of ! to
assess robustness, using additional data beyond the su¢ cient statistic estimates to narrow


                                                 18
the set of permissible ! vectors.
   The next three sections show how a variety of recent papers in public economics can be
interpreted as applications of this framework. Each application illustrates di¤erent strengths
and weaknesses of the su¢ cient statistic approach and demonstrates the techniques that are
helpful in deriving such formulas.



III     Application 1: Income Taxation
Since the seminal work of Mirrlees (1971) and others, there has been a large structural
literature investigating the optimal design of income tax and transfer systems.       Several
studies have simulated optimal tax rates in calibrated versions of the Mirrlees model (see
Tuomala 1990 for a survey). A related literature uses microsimulation methods to calculate
the e¤ects of changes in transfer policies on behavior and welfare. The most recent structural
work in this area has generalized the Mirrlees model to dynamic settings and simulated the
optimal design of tax policies in such environments using calibrated models. Parallel to this
literature, a large body of work in labor economics has investigated the e¤ects of tax and
transfer programs on behavior using program evaluation methods. See Table 1 for examples
of structural and reduced-form studies.
   Recent work in public economics has shown that the elasticities estimated by labor econo-
mists can be mapped into statements about optimal tax policy in the models that have been
analyzed using structural methods. This su¢ cient statistic method has been widely applied
in the context of income taxation in the past decade, with contributions by Feldstein (1995,
1999), Piketty (1997), Diamond (1998), Saez (2001), Gruber and Saez (2002), Goulder and
Williams (2003), Chetty (2008b), and others. All of these papers can be embedded in the
general framework proposed above.      I focus on two papers here in the interest of space:
Feldstein (1999) and Saez (2001).
   Feldstein (1999). Traditional empirical work on labor supply did not incorporate the
potential e¤ects of taxes on choices other than hours of work. For instance, income taxes
could a¤ect an individual’s choice of training, e¤ort, or occupational choice.     Moreover,
individuals may be induced to shelter income from taxation by evading or avoiding tax


                                             19
payments (e.g. taking fringe bene…ts, underreporting earnings). While some studies have
attempted to directly examine the e¤ects of taxes on each of these margins, it is di¢ cult
to account for all potential behavioral responses to taxation by measuring each channel
separately.
   Feldstein proposes an elegant solution to the problem of calculating the e¢ ciency costs
of taxation in a model with multi-dimensional labor supply choices.                      His insight is the
elasticity of taxable income with respect to the tax rate is a su¢ cient statistic for calculating
deadweight loss. Feldstein considers a model in which an individual makes J labor supply
choices (x1 ; :::; xJ ) that generate earnings.    Let wj denote the wage paid for choice j and

 j (xj )   denote the disutility of labor supply through margin xj . In addition, suppose that
the agent can shelter $e of earnings from the tax authority (via sheltering or evasion) by
                                                   P
paying a cost g(e). Total taxable income is T I = Jj=1 wj xj e. Let c = (1 t)T I + e
denote consumption.        For simplicity, assume that utility is linear in c to abstract from
income e¤ects. Feldstein shows that it is straightforward to allow for income e¤ects. As
in the Harberger model, we calculate the excess burden of the tax by assuming that the
government returns the tax revenue to the agent as a lump sum transfer T (t). Using the
notation introduced in section II, we can write this model formally as:

                                                            X
                                                            J
                                 u(c; x; e) = c     g(e)           j (xj )
                                                            j=1
                                      T (t) = t T I

                                G1 (c; x; t) = T + (1      t)T I + e        c

where the last equality follows from the de…nition of T I. Plugging these expressions into
(18) and collecting terms yields the following expression for the marginal welfare gain from
raising the tax rate from an initial rate of t:

                                               dW (t)    dT I(t)
                                                      =t         .                                                     (20)
                                                dt         dt

A simpler, but less instructive, derivation of (20) is to di¤erentiate (17), recognizing that
behavioral responses have no …rst-order e¤ect on private surplus (the term in curly brackets)
                                                                                    dW
because of the envelope conditions. This immediately yields                          dt
                                                                                          =    T I + T I + t dTdtI .
   Equation (20) shows that we simply need to measure how taxable income responds to
changes in the tax rate to calculate the deadweight cost of income taxation.                                 It does not
matter whether T I changes because of hours responses, changes in occupation, or avoidance
behaviors. Intuitively, the agent supplies labor on every margin (x1 ; :::; xJ ) up to the point
where his marginal disutility of earning another dollar through that margin equals 1                                     t.
The marginal social value of earning an extra dollar net of the disutility of labor is therefore
t for all margins. Likewise, the agent optimally sets the marginal cost of reporting $1 less

                                                          21
to the tax authority (g 0 (e)) equal to the marginal private value of doing so (t). Hence, the
marginal social costs of reducing earnings (via any margin) and reporting less income via
avoidance are the same at the individual’s optimal allocation. This makes it irrelevant which
mechanism underlies the change in T I for e¢ ciency purposes.

about e¢ ciency costs without requiring identi…cation of the potentially complex e¤ects of
taxes on numerous labor supply, evasion, and avoidance behaviors.                             Moreover, data on

Feldstein implements (20) by estimating the changes in reported taxable income around the
Tax Reform Act of 1986 (Feldstein 1995), implicitly using the linear approximation described
in step 5 of the rubric. He concludes based on these estimates that the excess burden of
taxing high income individuals is very large, possibly as large as $2 per $1 of revenue raised.
This result has been in‡uential in policy discussions by suggesting that top income tax rates
should be lowered (see e.g., Joint Economic Committee 2001). Subsequent empirical work
                                                                                dT I
motivated by Feldstein’s result has found smaller values of                      dt
                                                                                     ,   and the academic debate
about the value of this central parameter remains active.
   The sixth step of the rubric –structural evaluation –has only been partially implemented
in the context of Feldstein’s formula. Slemrod (1995) and several other authors have found
                              dT I
that the large estimates of    dt
                                     are driven primarily by evasion and avoidance behaviors ( de
                                                                                               dt
                                                                                                  ).
However, these structural parameters (g(e);                 j (xj ))   of the model have not been directly
evaluated. Chetty (2008b) gives an example of the danger in not investigating the structural
parameters. Chetty argues that the marginal social cost of tax avoidance may not be equal
to the tax rate at the optimum – violating the …rst-order-condition (19) that is critical to
derive (20) –for two reasons. First, some of the costs of evasion and avoidance constitute
transfers, such as the payment of …nes for tax evasion, rather than resource costs. Second,
there is considerable evidence that individuals overestimate the true penalties for evasion.
Using a su¢ cient statistic approach analogous to that above, Chetty relaxes the g 0 (e) = t
restriction and obtains the following generalization of Feldstein’s formula:

                         dW (t)          dT I(t)                               dLI(t)
                                = tf (t)         + (1                   (t))          g                     (21)
                          dt               dt                                    dt

where LI =       j=1   wj xj represents total earned income and (t) =           t
                                                                                        measures the gap
between social marginal costs of avoidance and the tax rate.            Intuitively, deadweight loss
is a weighted average of the taxable income elasticity ( dTdtI ) and the total earned income
elasticity ( dLI
              dt
                 ), with the weight determined by the resource cost of sheltering. If avoidance
does not have a large resource cost, changes in e have little e¢ ciency cost, and thus it is only
dLI
 dt
      –the “real”labor supply response –that matters for deadweight loss.
      Not surprisingly, implementing Chetty’s more general formula requires identi…cation of
more parameters than Feldstein’s formula. The most di¢ cult parameter to identify is g 0 (e),
which is a marginal utility. By leaving g 0 (e) in the formula, Chetty does not complete step 4
of the rubric above; as a result, further work is required to implement (21). Gorodnichenko
et al. (2008) provide a method of recovering g 0 (e) from consumption behavior. Their insight
is that real resource costs expended on evasion should be evident in consumption data; thus,
the gap between income and consumption measures can be used to infer g 0 (e). Implementing
this method to analyze the e¢ ciency costs of a large reduction in income tax rates in Russia,
                                                                 dT I                                dLI
Gorodnichenko et al. …nd that g 0 (e) is quite small and that     dt
                                                                        is substantial, whereas       dt

is not. They show that Feldstein’s formula substantially overestimates the e¢ ciency costs
of taxation relative to Chetty’s more general measure. Intuitively, reported taxable incomes
are highly sensitive to tax rates, but the sensitivity is driven by avoidance behavior that has
little social cost at the margin and hence does not reduce the total size of the pie signi…cantly.
      The general lesson from this work is that su¢ cient statistic approaches are not model
                                                                                                     dW
free. It is critical to evaluate the structure of the model, even though the formula for              dt

can be implemented without the last step of the rubric. In the taxable income application,
estimating g 0 (e) has value instead of simply assuming that g 0 (e) = t given plausible concerns
that this condition does not hold in practice. Successful application of the su¢ cient statistic
approach requires judicious choice of which restrictions to exploit – that is, assessing how
general a class of models to consider –based on an evaluation of the structural parameters.
      Saez (2001). Harberger and Feldstein study the e¢ ciency e¤ects and optimal design of
a linear tax. Much of the literature on optimal income taxation has focused on non-linear
income tax models and the optimal progressivity of such systems. Mirrlees (1971) formalizes
this question as a mechanism design problem, and provides a solution in di¤erential equations


                                               23
that are functions of primitive parameters. The Mirrlees solution o¤ers little intuition into
the forces that determine optimal tax rates.      Building on the work of Diamond (1998),
Saez (2001) expresses the optimality conditions in the Mirrlees model in terms of empirically
estimable su¢ cient statistics.
   Saez analyzes a model in which individuals choose hours of work, l, and have heteroge-
neous wage rates w distributed according to a distribution F (w). Wage rates (skills) are
unobservable to the government. Let pre tax earnings be denoted by z = wl. For simplicity,
I again restrict attention to the case without income e¤ects, as in Diamond (1998).
   Saez begins by analyzing the optimal tax rate on top incomes.       He considers a model
where the government levies a linear tax   on earnings above a threshold z and characterizes
the properties of the optimal tax rate     as z ! 1. For a given z, individuals maximize
utility


                           u(c; l) = c     (l)

                     s.t. G1 (c; l) = (1    ) max(wl    z; 0) + z   c=0


Let c(w; ) and l(w; ) denote an agent’s optimal choices as a function of his wage and
the tax rate and z(w; ) = wl(w; ) denote the optimized earnings function. Let zm (z) =
E[wl(w; )jz(w; ) > z] denote the mean level of earnings for individuals in the top bracket.
Let w denote the wage threshold that corresponds to an earnings threshold of z when the tax
rate is : wl(w; ) = z. The tax revenue generated by the top bracket tax is R = (zm (z) z).
The planner uses this tax revenue to fund a project that has a (normalized) value of $1 per
dollar spent.
   The social planner’s objective is to maximize a weighted average of individual’s utilities,
                  e
where the weights G(u) are “social welfare weights”that re‡ect the redistributive preferences
of the planner:

                          R1
                   W =       e
                            G(u(c(w; ); wl(w; )))dF (w) + (zm (z)        z)
                           0


In this equation, the …rst term (in curly brackets) represents private surplus and the second

below z are una¤ected by the tax increase.       Normalize the measure of individuals in the
top bracket to 1. Utility maximization implies that behavioral responses ( @@l ) have no …rst-

weight placed by the planner on individuals in the top tax bracket.                 The parameter g
measures the social value of giving $1 more income to individuals in the top bracket relative
to the value of public expenditure.      If g = 1, the government weighs the consumption of
the individuals it taxes and public expenditure equally, and (22) collapses to the Harberger
formula for excess burden in (4). When g < 1, the …rst term in (22) captures the welfare
loss to individuals in the top tax bracket from having to pay more taxes. The second term
re‡ects the gain in revenue to the government, which consists of two familiar components:
the mechanical gain in revenue and the o¤set due to the behavioral response.
   Equation (22) shows that three parameters are together su¢ cient statistics for the wel-
fare gain of increasing top income tax rates: (1) the e¤ect of tax rates on earnings ( dzd m ),
which quanti…es the distortions created by the tax; (2) the shape of the earnings distribution
(zm (z)), which measures the mass of individuals whose behavior is distorted by the marginal
tax, and (3) the marginal social welfare weight (g), which measures the planner’s redistrib-
utive preferences.    Note that Saez does not implement step 4 of the rubric – recovery of
marginal utilities from observed behavior – because he views the relevant marginal utility
in this case (g) as a feature of the planner’s social welfare function that is external to the
choice environment. Thus, g is determined by the shape of the earnings distribution and
the (exogenous) speci…cation of the social welfare function (e.g. utilitarian or Rawlsian).
   The advantage of (22) relative to a structural approach is that one does not need to
identify preferences ( ) or the shape of the skill distribution F (w) to calculate dW=d .

                                               25
Moreover, one can permit arbitrary heterogeneity across skill types in preferences without
                                                                                     dzm

         dW
Hence,    d
            (   ) measures only the marginal welfare gain at a given tax rate                       and must be
estimated at all values of         to calculate the tax rate            that maximizes W . To simplify em-
pirical implementation and derive an explicit formula for the optimal tax rate, Saez observes
                 zm (z)
that the ratio     z
                          is approximately constant in the upper tail of the empirical distribution
of earnings in the U.S.: that is, the upper tail of the income distribution is well described
                                                                                       zm (z)        a
by a Pareto distribution. A Pareto distribution with parameter a has                     z
                                                                                                =   a 1
                                                                                                          for all z.
Hence, (22) can be expressed as

                                         dW    (1      g)    dzm

where " =   d(1 ) zm
                          denotes the taxable income elasticity in the top bracket. In the Mirrlees
model, a and " converge to constants (invariant to ) in the limit as z ! 1.                               Equation
(23) is therefore an explicit formula for the optimal asymptotic top income tax rate if the
social welfare weight g is taken as exogenous. For example, one plausible assumption is that
g ! 0 as z ! 1: Saez exploits this property of (23) to calculate optimal top income tax
rates using reduced-form estimates of the taxable income elasticity for high incomes (Gruber
and Saez 2002) and a Pareto parameter of a = 2 consistent with the earnings distribution
in the U.S. He …nds that optimal top income tax rates are generally above 50% when the
formula is calibrated using plausible elasticities.
   Building on this su¢ cient statistic approach, Saez characterizes the optimal tax rate
at any income level z in a non-linear tax system.                       Let E denote the …xed amount of
government expenditure that must be …nanced through taxation. Let T (z) denote the total
tax paid by an individual who earns income z, so that net of tax income is z                         T (z). Let

                                                      26

                                         e
earnings distribution at z. Finally, let G(u(z)) denote the weight that the planner places
                                            eu uc (z) the corresponding marginal social
on an individual with earnings z and g(z) = G

   The government chooses the schedule T (Z) that maximizes social welfare

Exploiting envelope conditions and perturbation arguments as above, the …rst order condi-
tions for the optimal tax rates can be expressed in terms of su¢ cient statistics. In the case
without income e¤ects, the optimal tax schedule satis…es the following condition at all z:

                             T (z)        1     R1
                                    =             (1              g(z 0 ))h(z 0 )dz 0         (24)
                            1 T (z)   "(z)zh(z) z
Equation (24) depends on the same three parameters as (22): the taxable income elasticity,
the shape of the earnings distribution, and the social welfare weights. It is again important
to recognize that all three of these parameters are endogenous to the tax regime itself, and
hence (24) is not an explicit formula for optimal taxation. Unfortunately, the techniques
used to obtain the explicit formula for the asymptotic top income tax rate in (23) cannot
be applied at an arbitrary income level z because there are no analogous limit convergence
results. Hence, interpreted literally, (24) can only be used to test whether a given tax system
T (z) happens to be optimal.
   Because of this limitation, Saez couples the su¢ cient statistic formula with a structural
approach to calibrate the optimal income tax schedule. Based on (24), he infers that the key
parameters that should be matched by a structural model for evaluation of optimal taxation
are the distribution of taxable income elasticities and the earnings distribution. He speci…es


                                                     27
primitives (skill distributions and utility functions) that match empirical estimates of these
moments.       He then simulates the optimal tax schedule in the calibrated model.                        The
resulting optimal income tax schedule is inverse-U shaped, with a large lump sum grant to
non-workers and marginal rates ranging from 50-80%. This technique – which recognizes
the limitations of the su¢ cient statistic approach and uses extrapolation based on structural
methods to address those limitations –is an exemplary illustration of step 6 in the rubric.13



IV        Application 2: Social Insurance
Programs such as unemployment insurance, health insurance, social security, workers com-
pensation, and disability insurance account for the majority of government expenditure in
many countries. Starting with the seminal work of Wolpin (1987) and others, a large lit-
erature has studied the optimal design of social insurance programs in dynamic structural
models.     Parallel to this literature, a large body of reduced-form empirical work has in-
vestigated the impacts of social insurance programs on health expenditures, unemployment
durations, consumption, disability claims, etc. See Table 1 for examples of structural and
reduced-form studies.
    In the context of social insurance, an important harbinger to the su¢ cient statistic ap-
proach is the work of Baily (1978), who showed that the optimal level of unemployment
bene…ts can be expressed as a function of a small set of parameters in a static model. Baily’s
result was viewed as being of limited practical relevance because of the strong assumptions
made in deriving the formula. However, recent work has shown that the parameters Baily
identi…ed are actually su¢ cient statistics for welfare analysis of social insurance in a rich class
of dynamic models. Studies in this literature include Gruber (1997), Chetty (2006), Shimer
and Werning (2007), Chetty (2008a), Einav, Finkelstein, and Cullen (2008), and Chetty and
Saez (2008a). I now embed these papers in the general framework above, focusing primarily
on the …rst four papers.14

  13
     The limitation of this approach is that there are many potential structures consistent with the su¢ cient
statistics observed at current tax rates, and each structure may imply di¤erent optimal tax rates. A full
structural estimation is needed to discriminate between the ! vectors consistent with the su¢ cient statistics.

     The tax and social insurance problems are closely related because social insurance is e¤ectively state-

    Baily (1978) and Chetty (2006). For simplicity, consider a static model with two states:
high and low. Let wh denote the individual’s income in the high state and wl < wh income
in the low state. Let A denote wealth. Let ch denote consumption in the high state and cl
consumption in the low state. The low state can be thought of as corresponding to job loss,
injury, disability, natural disaster, etc. The agent can control the probability of being in the
bad state by exerting e¤ort e at a cost            (e). For instance, “e¤ort” could re‡ect searching
for a job, taking precautions to avoid injury, or locating a house away from areas prone to
natural disasters.      Choose units of e so that the probability of being in the high state is
given by p(e) = e.
    Individuals may have some ability to insure against shocks through informal private
sector arrangements, such as transfers between relatives. To model such informal private-
insurance arrangements, suppose that the agent can transfer $bp between states at a cost
q(bp ), so that increasing consumption by bp in the low state requires payment of a premium
1 e
 e p
    b   + q(bp ) in the high state. The loading factor q(bp ) can be interpreted as the degree of
incompleteness in private insurance. If q(bp ) = 0, private insurance markets are complete; if
q(bp ) = 1, there is no capacity for private insurance.
    The government pays a bene…t b in the low state that is …nanced by an actuarially fair

tax t(b) =    e
                 b   in the high state. The model can be formally speci…ed using the notation
in section II as follows.15


                         U (cl ; ch ; e) = eu(ch ) + (1 e)u(cl )     (e)                                    (25)

                                    t(b) =       b

                                                 1 e
                         G1 (cl ; ch ; t) = ch +      bp + q(bp ) + t wh              A
                                                   e
                        G2 (cl ; ch ; ; t) = cl bp b wl A


Substituting the constraints into the utility function yields social welfare as a function of the

contingent taxation. Rather than levying taxes on the basis of income, taxes and transfers are levied on the
basis of a state (joblessness, sickness, injury, disability, etc.). Conversely, redistributive taxation is social
insurance against uncertain skill realizations behind the veil of ignorance.
  15
     I follow the convention in the social insurance literature of specifying the problem in terms of the transfer
bene…t b rather than the tax t.

This expression, which is Baily’s (1978) formula, corresponds to the marginal utility expres-
sion obtained after the third step of the rubric in section II. The …rst term in (26) measures
the gap in marginal utilities between the high and low states, which quanti…es the welfare
gain from transferring an additional dollar from the high to low state.                        The second term
measures the cost of transferring this $1 due to behavioral responses.
   Chetty (2006) establishes that the parameters in (26) are “su¢ cient statistics” in that
they are adequate to calculate MW (b) in a general class of dynamic models that nest existing
structural models of insurance. Chetty analyzes a dynamic model where transitions from
the good state to the bad state follow an arbitrary stochastic process.                         Agents make J


                                                               30
choices and are subject to M constraints.                       The choices could include variables such as
reservation wages, savings behavior, labor supply, or human capital investments. Subject
to a regularity condition analogous to Assumption 1, Chetty shows that (26) holds in this
general model, with the di¤erence in marginal utilities replaced by the di¤erence between the
average marginal utilities in the high and low states over the agent’s life. This result distills
the calculation of welfare gains in complex dynamic models to two parameters: the gap in
average marginal utilities and the elasticity that enters the government’s budget constraint

the structural studies for tractability, such as no private insurance or no borrowing (Hansen
and Imrohoglu 1992, Hopenhayn and Nicolini 1997).16
       Equation (26) is not directly implementable because the gap in marginal utilities must
be recovered from choice data. The recent literature has proposed the use of three types of
choice data to recover the marginal utility gap: consumption (Gruber 1997), liquidity and
substitution e¤ects in e¤ort (Chetty 2008a), and reservation wages (Shimer and Werning
2007).
       Gruber (1997). Taking a quadratic approximation to the utility function, Gruber observes
that
                                             u0 (cl ) u0 (ch )          c
                                                               =            (b)                          (27)
                                                   u0 (cl )          ch

                           c   is the coe¢ cient of relative risk aversion evaluated at ch and     c = ch cl .
Gruber posits that the e¤ect of UI bene…ts on consumption is linear (an assumption that
should ideally be evaluated using a structural simulation):

                                                    c
                                                        (b) =     + b
                                                  ch

In this speci…cation,            measures the consumption-drop that would occur absent government

  16
    In dynamic models, su¢ cient statistic formulas are generally functions of behavioral responses to perma-
nent changes in policy, starting at the beginning of the agent’s life. In practice, program evaluation studies
estimate the e¤ect of changes in policies in the middle of individual’s life. These short-run treatment e¤ects
could potentially di¤er from the relevant permanent e¤ects (Lucas 1976, Rosenzweig and Wolpin 2000).
Estimating the long-run responses is likely to require some structural assumptions.

for the marginal welfare gain from increasing the bene…t level:

                                                                 "1        e;b

Building on work by Hamermesh (1982), Gruber estimates the consumption-smoothing e¤ect
of unemployment insurance (UI) bene…ts by exploiting changes in UI bene…t laws across
states in the U.S. coupled with panel data on consumption.                           He estimates        = 0:24 and
  =      0:28, and then calibrates the welfare gain from raising UI bene…ts using estimates
of "1   e;b   from Meyer (1990). He …nds that at conventional levels of risk aversion ( < 2),
increasing the UI bene…t level above the levels observed in his data (roughly 50% of the
wage) would lead to substantial welfare losses.

   Gruber proceeds to solve for the b such that                db

close to zero.       These calculations of the optimal bene…t level assume that                     c
                                                                                                         is linear in
b and         (b) and "1   e;b (b)   do not vary with b.    This application of the su¢ cient statistic
formula – which is not guided by a structural model – could be very inaccurate, because
it uses ad hoc assumptions to make predictions about counterfactuals that are well out-of-
sample. Equation (28) should not be used to make statements about global optima unless
one can estimate the su¢ cient statistics for a range of di¤erent bene…t levels. Lacking such
estimates, a more reliable method of inferring b would be to calibrate a structural model to
match the su¢ cient statistics and simulate the optimal b in that model, as in Saez (2001).
   A di¢ culty with (28) is that risk aversion ( ) is known to vary substantially across
contexts (Rabin 2000, Chetty and Szeidl 2007). Chetty (2003) uses a structural model to
show that Gruber’s choice of              = 2 is inconsistent with data on the e¤ects of UI bene…ts on
search behavior. With his preferred estimate of              = 4, (28) implies a small positive welfare
gain from raising unemployment bene…t levels. In light of the sensitivity of the results to
the value of , more recent studies have sought alternative ways of recovering the gap in
marginal utilities that do not require an estimate of .
   Chetty (2008a). Chetty (2008a) shows that the gap in marginal utilities in (26) can be


                                                       32
backed out from the comparative statics of e¤ort choice. To see this, observe that the …rst
order condition for e¤ort is
                                        0
                                            (e) = u(ch )    u(cl ).                               (29)

Now consider the e¤ect of an exogenous cash grant (such as a severance payment to job
losers) on e¤ort, holding …xed the private insurance level bp :

                                                                      00
                               @e=@A = fu0 (ch )      u0 (cl )g=           (e)            0       (30)


The e¤ect of increasing the bene…t level on e¤ort (again holding bp …xed) is:

                                                                00
                                      @e=@b =       u0 (cl )=        (e)                          (31)


Combining (30) and (31), we see that the ratio of the “liquidity” e¤ect (@e=@A) to the
“substitution”e¤ect (@e=@wh = @e=@A              @e=@b) recovers the gap in marginal utilities:

                                 u0 (cl ) u0 (ch )       @e=@A
                                                   =
                                       u0 (ch )      @e=@A @e=@b

Plugging this into (26) yields the following expression for the welfare gain from increasing
the bene…t level:
                                                 @e=@A                     "1       e;b
                                MW (b) =                                                          (32)
                                             @e=@A @e=@b                        e
The intuition for this formula is that the gap between marginal utilities in the good and bad
states can be inferred from the extent to which e¤ort is a¤ected by liquidity vs. moral hazard.
In a model with perfect consumption smoothing (ch = cl ), the liquidity e¤ect @e=@A = 0,
because a cash grant raises u(ch ) and u(cl ) by the same amount. Chetty implements (32) by
estimating the e¤ects of unemployment bene…ts and severance payments on search intensity
using hazard models for unemployment durations.                  He …nds that the welfare gains from
raising the unemployment bene…t level are small but positive, suggesting that the current
bene…t level is below the optimum given concavity of W (b).
   Chetty evaluates the ability to extrapolate from the su¢ cient statistic formula using a
structural job search model calibrated to match his moral hazard and liquidity elasticity


                                                    33

estimates. He …nds that           db
                                     (b)   declines sharply with b in the structural simulation because
                       @e
the liquidity e¤ect    @A
                          (b)   falls substantially as b rises (see Figures 1 and 2 in Chetty (2008a)).
Based on this structural simulation, he concludes that the optimal bene…t level is likely to
be close to the current wage replacement rate of approximately 50% since MW (b = 0:5w) is
small but positive. Finally, Chetty uses the calibrated structural model to study the welfare
gains from new policy instruments –such as the direct provision of liquidity through loans.
These results illustrate how combining su¢ cient statistic formulas with structural methods
expands the domain of policy questions one can answer beyond local welfare analysis.
       Shimer and Werning (2007).             Shimer and Werning (2007) infer the gap in marginal
utilities from the comparative statics of reservation wages instead of e¤ort in a model of job
search. They consider a model where the probability of …nding a job, e, is determined by
the agent’s decision to accept or reject a wage o¤er rather than by search intensity. Wage
o¤ers are drawn from a distribution F (w).                  If the agent rejects the job o¤er, he receives
income of wl + b as in the model above. For simplicity, assume that the agent has no private
insurance (q = 1); allowing q < 1 complicates the algebra but does not a¤ect the …nal
formula. The remainder of the model is speci…ed as in (25).
       The agent rejects any net-of-tax wage o¤er w             t below his outside option wl + b. There-
fore, e = 1     F (wl + b + t) and the agent’s expected value upon job loss is


                      W (b) = eE[u(w           t)jw    t > wl + b] + (1     e)u(wl + b)


Note that even though the microeconomic choices of accepting or rejecting wage o¤ers are
discrete, the welfare function is smooth because of aggregation, as in (9).
                                                      dW
       Shimer and Werning’s insight is that            db
                                                             can be calculated using information on the
agent’s reservation wage.           Suppose we ask the agent what wage he would be willing to
accept with certainty prior to the start of job search.17 De…ne the agent’s reservation wage
prior to job search as the wage w0 that would make the agent indi¤erent about accepting
a job immediately to avoid having to take a random draw from the wage o¤er distribution.

  17
     Shimer and Werning study a stationary dynamic model with CARA utility where the reservation wage
is …xed over time, in which case it does not matter at what point of the spell the reservation wage is elicited.

Intuitively,    db
                     encodes the marginal value of insurance because the agent’s reservation wage
directly measures his expected value when unemployed. Shimer and Werning implement (33)
                          dw0
using an estimate of       db
                                from Feldstein and Poterba (1984) and …nd a large, positive value
for MW (b) at current bene…t levels. However, they caution that the credibility of existing
reservation wage elasticity estimates is questionable, particularly in view of evidence that UI
bene…t levels have little impact on subsequent wage rates (e.g. Card, Chetty, Weber 2007,
van Ours and Vodopivec 2008).
       The multiplicity of formulas for MW (b) illustrates a general feature of the su¢ cient-
statistic approach: since the model is not fully identi…ed by the inputs to the formula, there
are generally several representations of the formula for welfare gains.19                   This ‡exibility
allows the researcher to apply the representation most suitable for his application given the
available variation and data. For example, in analyzing disability insurance, it may be easiest

  18
      This corresponds to equation (12) in Shimer and Werning (2007), where the unemployment rate is
u = 1 e. The slight di¤erence between the formulas (the 1 1 u factor in the denominator) arises because
Shimer and Werning write the formula in terms of a partial-derivative-based elasticity. Here, "1 e;b is the
elasticity including the UI tax response needed to balance the budget; in Shimer and Werning’s notation, it
is holding the tax …xed.
   19
      All three formulas hold in models that allow both reservation wage and search intensity choices. Chetty’s
(2006) generalization of Baily’s formula nests the model with stochastic wages. If agents control the arrival
rate of o¤ers via search e¤ort, the …rst order condition for search e¤ort remains the same as in (29), with
Eu0 (ch ) replacing u0 (ch ). It follows that Chetty’s (2008a) formula also holds with stochastic wages.

liquidity and moral hazard e¤ects (Autor and Duggan 2007).
   Ine¢ ciencies in Private Insurance. An important assumption made in all three formulas
above is that the choices within the private sector are constrained Pareto e¢ cient – that
is, total surplus is maximized in the private sector subject to the constraints. In practice,
private insurance contracts are likely to be second-best ine¢ cient as well because of adverse
selection and moral hazard in private markets. In this case, the envelope condition invoked
in deriving (26) is violated because of externalities on the private insurer’s budget constraint
that are not taken into account by the individual.
   Recent work by Einav, Finkelstein, and Cullen (2008) and Chetty and Saez (2008a)
identi…es su¢ cient statistics for the welfare gains from social insurance in environments with
adverse selection and moral hazard in private insurance markets.       Einav et al. develop a
method of characterizing the welfare gain from government intervention that uses information
about insurance purchase decisions. They show that the demand curve for private insurance
and the cost of providing insurance as a function of the price are together su¢ cient statistics
for welfare. The …rst parameter captures consumers’willingness to pay for insurance while
the latter captures how the marginal costs of providing insurance varies with the pool of the
insured via selection e¤ects. Einav et al. implement their method using quasi-experimental
price variation in health insurance policies and …nd that the welfare gains from government
intervention in health insurance markets is small.
   Chetty and Saez focus on ex-post behaviors, namely how marginal utilities vary across the
high and low states, as in the Baily formula. They develop a simple extension to Gruber’s
(1997) implementation of the formula that includes two more parameters – the size of the
private insurance market and the crowdout of private insurance by public insurance. Intu-
itively, the government exacerbates the moral hazard distortion created by private insurance,
and must therefore take into account the amount of private insurance and degree of crowdout
to calculate the welfare gains from intervention.    Chetty and Saez apply their formula to
analyze health insurance, and show that naively applying (26) dramatically overstates the
welfare gains from government intervention in this case.
   These examples illustrate that the su¢ cient statistic approach can be extended to en-


                                              36
vironments where private sector choices are not second-best e¢ cient. One has to deviate
slightly from the general rubric to handle such second-best ine¢ ciencies because the incen-
tive compatibility constraints for private insurance violate Assumption 1. These constraints
lead to additional terms in the su¢ cient statistic formula, increasing the number of moments
that need to be estimated for welfare analysis.



V      Application 3: Behavioral Models
There is now considerable reduced-form evidence that individuals’behavior deviates system-
atically from the predictions of neoclassical perfect optimization models; see Table 1 for a
few examples and DellaVigna’s (2008) review for many more. In light of this evidence, an
important new challenge is normative analysis in models where agent’s choices deviate from
perfect optimization.   The budding literature on this topic has proposed some structural
approaches to this issue, primarily in the context of time discounting. An early example is
Feldstein’s (1985) model of social security with myopic agents, in which individuals have a
higher discount rate than the social planner. Feldstein numerically calculates the welfare
gains from social security policies under various assumptions about the primitives. More re-
cently, a series of papers have using calibrations of Laibson’s (1997) - model of hyperbolic
discounting to make numerical predictions about optimal policy for agents who are impa-
tient (see Table 1). Another set of studies has modelled the behavioral patterns identi…ed
in earlier work –such as “ironing”and “spotlighting”e¤ects in responses to non-linear price
schedules –and simulated optimal tax policy in such models (Liebman and Zeckhauser 2004,
Feldman and Katuscak 2006).
    The di¢ culty with the structural approach in behavioral applications is that there are
often multiple positive models which can explain deviations from rationality, and each of
these models can lead to di¤erent welfare predictions. The su¢ cient statistic approach can
be very useful in such situations, because welfare analysis does not require full speci…cation of
the positive model underlying observed choices (Bernheim and Rangel 2007). In applications
where agents optimize, the main bene…t of the su¢ cient statistic approach is that it simpli…es
identi…cation. If one had unlimited power to identify primitives, there would be no advantage


                                               37
to using the su¢ cient statistic approach in such models. In non-optimizing models, however,
the su¢ cient statistic strategy has value even if identi…cation is not a problem because there
is no consensus alternative to the neoclassical model.
   Given the infancy of this area, there is currently very little work applying su¢ cient sta-
tistic approaches to behavioral models. However, this is a fertile area for further research,
as illustrated by Chetty, Looney, and Kroft’s (2008) recent analysis of the welfare conse-
quences of taxation when agents optimize imperfectly with respect to taxes. Chetty et al.
present evidence that the e¤ect of commodity taxes on demand depend on whether the tax
is included in posted prices or not. Taxes that are not included in posted prices –and are
hence less salient to consumers – induce smaller demand reductions.         Chetty et al. note
that there are various psychological and economic theories which could explain why salience
a¤ects behavioral responses to taxation, including bounded rationality, forgetfulness, and
cue theories of attention. They therefore develop an su¢ cient-statistic approach to welfare
analysis that is robust to speci…cations of the positive theory of tax salience.
   Chetty et al. characterize the e¢ ciency costs and incidence of taxation in a two-good
model analogous to the Harberger model presented in section I of this paper. Let x denote
the taxed good and y the numeraire. Let demand for x as a function of its pretax price and
tax rate be denoted by x(p; t). I assume here that utility is quasilinear in y and production is
constant-returns-to-scale. These assumptions simplify the exposition by eliminating income
e¤ects and changes in producer prices; Chetty et al. shows that similar results are obtained
when these assumptions are dropped.
   The agent’s true ranking of the consumption bundles (x; y) is described by a smooth,
quasiconcave utility function


                                U (x; y) = u(x) + y

                                        = u(x) + Z       (p + t)x


where the second line imposes that the allocation (x; y) the agent chooses must satisfy
the true budget constraint (p + t)x + y = Z.       Chetty et al. depart from the traditional
Harberger analysis by dropping the assumption that the consumption bundle (x; y) is chosen


                                              38
to maximize U (x; y).     Instead, they take the demand function x(p; t) as an empirically
                                                                                         @x        @x
estimated object generated by a model unknown to the policy maker, permitting            @p
                                                                                              6=   @t
                                                                                                      .
     To calculate excess burden, assume that tax revenue is returned to the agent lump-sum.
Then, under the assumption that individual’s utility is a function purely of their ultimate
consumption bundle, social welfare is given by


                            W (p; t) = fu(x) + Z      (p + t)xg + T (t)


where T (t) = tx(t). In non-optimizing models, one must deviate from step 2 of the rubric
in section II at this point because the envelope condition used to derive (13) does not hold.
Instead, totally di¤erentiate the social welfare function to obtain

                                      dW                     dx
                                          = [u0 (x)     p]                                         (34)
                                       dt                    dt

This marginal-utility based expression captures a simple intuition. An in…nitesimal tax
                                          dx
increase reduces consumption of x by      dt
                                             .   The loss in surplus from this reduction in con-
sumption of x is given by the di¤erent between willingness to pay for x (u0 (x)) and the cost
of producing x, which equals the price p under the constant-returns-to-scale assumption.
     Equation (34) applies in any model, irrespective of how x(p; t) is chosen.        Given that
dx                                                                 dW
dt
     can be estimated empirically, the challenge in calculating     dt
                                                                          – which re‡ects the main
challenge in behavioral public economics more generally – is the recovery of the true pref-
erences (u0 (x)).   In neoclassical models, we use the optimality condition u0 (x) = p + t to
recover marginal utility and immediately obtain the Harberger formula in (4).            Since we
do not know how x is chosen, we cannot use this condition here. Chetty et al. tackle this
problem by making the following assumption.

Assumption 2 When tax inclusive prices are fully salient, the agent chooses the same
allocation as a fully-optimizing agent:


                      x(p; 0) = x(p; 0) = arg max u(x(p; 0)) + Z     px(p; 0)


This assumption requires that the agent only makes mistakes with respect to taxes, and

                                                 39
not fully salient prices. To see why this assumption su¢ ces to calculate welfare, let P (x) =
x 1 (p; 0) denote the agent’s inverse-price-demand curve. Assumption 2 implies that P (x) =
u0 (x) via the …rst order condition for x(p; 0). Plugging this into (34) yields

                                          dW                  dx
                                              = [P (x)   p]
                                           dt                 dt

                     dW
This formula for      dt
                           can be implemented using an estimate of the inverse-price-demand curve
P (x).   To simplify implementation, Chetty et al. make the approximation that demand
x(p; t) is linear in both arguments to obtain

                                   dW        dp                   dx
                                         = [    (x(p; t) x(p; 0)]
                                    dt       dx                   dt

where    =     =
             dt dp
                     measures the degree of underreaction to the tax relative to the price. This
expression, which nests the Harberger formula as the case where         = 1, shows that the price
and tax elasticities of demand are together su¢ cient statistics to calculate excess burden in
behavioral economics models. Intuitively, the tax-demand curve ( dx
                                                                 dt
                                                                    ) is used to determine
the actual e¤ect of the tax on behavior.          Then, the price-demand curve ( dx
                                                                                 dp
                                                                                    ) is used to
calculate the e¤ect of that change in behavior on welfare.          The price-demand curve can
be used to recover the agent’s preferences and calculate welfare changes because it is (by
assumption) generated by optimizing behavior.
   Because it does not rely on a speci…c structural model, (35) accommodates all errors in
optimization with respect to taxes, and is hence easily adaptable to other applications. For
example, confusion between average and marginal income tax rates (Liebman and Zeckhauser
(2004), Feldman and Katušµcák (2006)) or overestimation of estate tax rates (Slemrod 2006)
can be handled using the same formula, without requiring knowledge of individuals’ tax
perceptions or rules of thumb. Any such behaviors are re‡ected in the empirically observed
tax and price elasticities.
   In sum, one can make progress in behavioral welfare economics by making assumptions
that narrow the class of models under consideration without full speci…cying one particular


                                                  40
model. One is e¤ectively forced to make stronger assumptions about the class of models in
exchange for relaxing the full optimization assumption. These stronger assumptions make
it especially valuable to pair the su¢ cient statistic approach with structural methods in
behavioral models.      For instance, identifying the structural reasons for why tax salience
matters would cast light on the plausibility of Assumption 2.



VI         Conclusion: Other Applications
In an e¤ort to unite theoretical models of optimal policy with evidence from program eval-
uation, the modern public economics literature has uncovered a potential “middle ground”
between pure reduced-form and structural methods.         Su¢ cient statistic formulas provide
theoretical guidance for reduced-form empirical work, highlighting the parameters of great-
est interest for a given question. Although su¢ cient statistic formulas are sometimes applied
as a substitute for structural analysis, their results are most compelling when accompanied
by a structural evaluation of the formula’s accuracy and the plausibility of the model and
primitives underlying the su¢ cient statistics. Hence, the su¢ cient statistic approach should
be viewed as a complement to rather than a substitute for structural estimation.
       This review has focused on the welfare consequences of policies that change prices via
taxes or transfer bene…ts.      A natural next step for the application of su¢ cient statistic
methods is to other types of counterfactual analysis, such as changes in regulations or ex-
ogenous ‡uctuations in state variables. I conclude by brie‡y discussing such applications in
macroeconomics, labor economics, and industrial organization.
       Macroeconomics. A central debate in the macroeconomics literature is whether house-
holds optimize intertemporally as predicted by standard permanent income hypothesis mod-
els.     The structural approach to answering this question, taken for example by Scholz et
al. (2006), is to specify a dynamic model of optimization and determine whether observed
consumption and savings patterns and consistent with those predicted by the model. The
su¢ cient statistic counterpart to this approach is to isolate one moment –such as the drop in
consumption at retirement or the sensitivity of behavior to cash-on-hand –that is adequate
to test between models (see e.g., Aguiar and Hurst 2005; Card, Chetty, and Weber 2007).


                                               41
A second application is to models of business cycles and growth, where di¤erent models can
again be compared by identifying a single moment, as in Shimer’s (2008) analysis of the “la-
bor wedge.” Trade is another natural area of application, where the reduced-form impacts
of changes in quotas and tari¤s on prices and quantities can presumably be used to inform
policy decisions as in the literature on taxation.
   Labor Economics. Labor economists have long been interested in the e¤ects of minimum
wages on the economy.      The su¢ cient statistic approach o¤ers a method of translating
evidence on the impacts of minimum wages on employment and wages into statements about
optimal policy (Lee and Saez 2008).      Another potential application is to the analysis of
returns to schooling. Many studies have investigated the e¤ects of schooling on behaviors
such as job mobility, occupation choice, and health. A su¢ cient statistic approach would
intuitively suggest that examining e¤ects on total earnings is adequate in a model where
agents optimize.
   Industrial Organization.    The discrete choice analysis in Section I indicates that the
e¤ects of price intervention policies on welfare in the class of models commonly studied
in the industrial organization (IO) literature can be characterized using su¢ cient statistic
formulas. There are two challenges in applying su¢ cient statistic methods to other common
questions in IO. First, many policies of interest in IO tend to be non-marginal changes such
as antitrust policy or the introduction of a new product. Second, much of the IO literature
focuses on models of strategic interaction rather than price theory models. In games, small
changes in exogenous parameters can lead to jumps in behavior, violating the smoothness
properties used to derive the formulas. Discontinuous changes in behavior could perhaps be
handled using su¢ cient statistic formulas that provide bounds for welfare instead of exact
values. These are important topics for further methodological research at the interface of
structural and reduced-form methods.

Notes: Categories used to classify papers are defined as follows. Structural: estimate or specify primitives to make predictions about welfare. Reduced
form: estimate high-level behavioral elasticities qualitatively relevant for policy analysis, but do not provide quantitative welfare results. Sufficient
statistic: make predictions about welfare without estimating or specifying primitives. This list includes only selected examples that relate to the topics
discussed in the text, and omits many important contributions in each category.

NOTE–The structural approach maps the primitives () directly to statements about
welfare ( dW
           dt
              ). The sufficient statistic approach leaves  identified and instead
identifies a smaller set of parameters () using program evaluation methods, e.g. via
a regression of an outcome y on exogenous variables X. The  vector is “sufficient”
for marginal welfare analysis in that any vector  consistent with  implies the same
value of dW
          dt
             . Identifying  does not identify  because there are multiple  vectors
consistent with a single  vector.
