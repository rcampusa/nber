                                           ABSTRACT

Knowledge of how science is consumed in public domains is essential for a deeper understanding
of the role of science in human society. While science is heavily supported by public funding,
common depictions suggest that scientific research remains an isolated or `ivory tower' activity,
with weak connectivity to public use, little relationship between the quality of research and its
public use, and little correspondence between the funding of science and its public use. This
paper introduces a measurement framework to examine public good features of science, allowing
us to study public uses of science, the public funding of science, and how use and funding relate.
Specifically, we integrate five large-scale datasets that link scientific publications from all
scientific fields to their upstream funding support and downstream public uses across three public
domains ­ government documents, the news media, and marketplace invention. We find that the
public uses of science are extremely diverse, with different public domains drawing distinctively
across scientific fields. Yet amidst these differences, we find key forms of alignment in the
interface between science and society. First, despite concerns that the public does not engage
high-quality science, we find universal alignment, in each scientific field and public domain,
between what the public consumes and what is highly impactful within science. Second, despite
myriad factors underpinning the public funding of science, the resulting allocation across fields
presents a striking alignment with the field's collective public use. Overall, public uses of science
present a rich landscape of specialized consumption, yet collectively science and society interface
with remarkable, quantifiable alignment between scientific use, public use, and funding.

Science is often seen to provide substantial impacts beyond the community of scientists
themselves -- for technological progress, government function, basic human curiosity, and
more1-7. Given the potential benefits, many nations have built institutional architectures to
support science through public investment, following the logic of public goods8-10. Like a public
park, which is funded by the government and can be visited for free, scientific research is
substantially funded by governments with its results placed in the public domain. This
institutional design, which depends upon taxing the public (rather than market-based
mechanisms), relies on the idea that public investment in science can match the public interest in
science.

Although the idea of science as a public good is foundational to the scientific ecosystem9-11,
empirically testing the key premise of alignment between public funding and public use has
remained elusive, mainly due to the difficulty in collecting systematic data. Moreover, the lack
of measurement has invited substantial skepticism. Indeed, many observers view scientific
research as a cloistered or `ivory tower' activity that rarely corresponds to the public interest12-16.
For example, the "two communities" and "two cultures" theories highlight substantial knowledge
and interest gaps between scientists and policymakers, disconnecting scientific research from
policy insights17-20 and suggesting little relationship between the quality of research and its
public usage18,21,22. Meanwhile, scientists may have peculiar interests, with little exposure to real
world problems or incentives to tackle them6,23. These potential gaps further animate root
concerns over the public funding of science and its proper allocation24-27. For example,
policymakers have long criticized the National Science Foundation (NSF) for funding frivolous
research and have called for greater transparency around the relevance of science24,25. Some
prominent academics and commentators, including Nobel-Prize winner Milton Friedman, have
taken the position that the government should not fund science, favoring purely private sector
research instead26,27.

This paper introduces a measurement framework to examine public good features of science,
allowing us to study public uses of science, the public funding of science, and how public use
and public funding relate. Building on prior research that considers the use of science within a
given public domain28-33, here we integrate five large-scale datasets that link scientific
publications from all scientific fields to their upstream funding support and downstream public



                                                                                                      2
uses across three public domains. Our first dataset (D1) is scientific publications, using the
Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG)34, which is one of the largest bibliometric databases of
scientific research in the world (SI S1.1). Our second dataset (D2) leverages the Microsoft Bing
search engine to collect over 6 million government documents available online across all
branches of the U.S. government35. Using a machine reading technology, we systematically
identify academic publications that are referenced in these government documents and match
these references to the MAG. This novel pipeline allows us to collect a wide-scale dataset on
how government documents consume scientific knowledge (SI S1.2). In total, we identify
353,977 unique academic publications cited by 39,618 government documents. Our third dataset
(D3) uses the Altmetric data29,30 to track academic publications covered by mainstream media
reports. Matching these publications to the MAG data yields 548,962 unique papers covered by
2,417 media outlets (SI S1.3). Building on prior work31-33, our fourth dataset (D4) links all
patents granted by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) to the academic
papers they reference, yielding 2,726,562 papers cited by 1,314,474 patents. Here we focus on
papers published between 2005 and 2014, a common period covered by all three datasets,
resulting in 116,462, 216,657, and 764,553 papers cited in government, news, and patent
documents, respectively. Finally, we integrate funding records, using a novel dataset (D5),
Dimensions36, which includes 5 million projects funded by 400 funding agencies worldwide and
links each funded project with its resulting publications. The SI further details the construction of
each dataset and additional validations (SI S1-S2).

Our first analyses measure the usage of scientific research in the three public domains. To
conduct this analysis, we first leverage the MAG's classification of papers across 19 top-level
fields. To account for cross-field differences in publication volume, we define a Relative
Consumption Index, RCI. For a given public domain (d) and field (f), RCI measures the fraction
of papers in the field consumed by that public domain, normalized by the same fraction
calculated on all fields for that domain. That is,

                     "   # papers in field  consumed by domain d/ # papers in 
                ! =                                                            .
                          Total # papers consumed by domain d / Total # papers

We find that the public uses of science are diverse, with many fields showing substantially
specialized usage in public domains (Fig. 1). First consider science and engineering. Computer



                                                                                                   3
science, materials science, and mathematics (Fig. 1d, i-j) present substantially larger RCI values
for patents than for government or news. By contrast, environmental science and geology (Fig.
1f, h) contribute relatively strongly in government and media documents compared to patents.
Finally, physics, chemistry, medicine, and biology present a broader range of use (Fig. 1b-c, k-l).
Among all fields, biology is the only one over-represented across all three channels,
demonstrating a uniquely general relevance to these broad domains beyond science.

Social sciences, by contrast, exhibit a visibly different pattern of public use. The social sciences
are strongly consumed in government and media domains while showing systematically low
usage in patents (Fig. 1m-q). Economics sees especially strong government use, while
psychology, sociology, and political science see relatively strong media use. Arts and humanities
(philosophy, art and history, Fig. 1r-t) are relatively under-represented in all three domains.

Specialization in public use further appears at sub-domain levels (Fig. S15). For government,
different agencies consume very different scientific research. For example, the U.S. Department
of Treasury draws especially on economics and business research, the U.S. Department of
Energy draws especially on geology and engineering, and the U.S. Department of Defense draws
unusually on history. Different patenting fields further exhibit highly specialized relationships to
specific scientific fields. By contrast, in media, while the Washington Post draws unusually
heavily on political science research, mainstream media sources in general are more consistent in
the fields they report, with especially strong and widespread interest in medicine and
psychology.

Overall, these results highlight a large set of specialized relationships between specific domains
of public use and specific fields of scientific research. From a public goods perspective, if we
think of scientific fields as akin to a series of national parks, we see that each park is embedded
in particular communities of public use. Collectively, these parks spread across diverse regions
of knowledge and are accessed by diverse segments of the public. A few fields, and especially
biology, receive visitors at relatively intense rates from a broad range of public domains ­ a
"Yellowstone Park" of science.

Our second set of results examine whether the public domains tend to consume ideas that
scientists themselves consider impactful. Longstanding arguments suggest that the public is not
well equipped to evaluate science and may draw on poorly established scientific ideas, which


                                                                                                       4
would undermine the public good benefits of science18,21,22. Continuing the national parks
metaphor, scientists may be seen as primarily working in a hard-to-reach backcountry, with the
typical public visitor having neither the tools to access this terrain nor perhaps an interest in the
areas the scientists focus upon. To further examine public use, we therefore consider, at the
article level, the alignment between public use and scientific use. Specifically, we calculate the
probability of being a hit paper within science, defined as those papers in the top 1% of citations
within the same field and year, and examine the relationship to usage in the public domains (SI
S4.1, Fig. 2b). We find that papers referenced in public domains have a remarkably high
likelihood of being hit papers within science. Papers cited by government documents, news or
patents exhibit hit rates of 16.3%, 18.5% and 10.5%, respectively, all large multiples of the
baseline rate of 1%. Further, papers referenced in the intersection of different domains tend to be
exceptionally impactful in science. For papers referenced in two public domains, approximately
half are hit papers. Papers referenced by both government documents and news media have a hit
rate of 51.7%. The results are broadly similar if we examine the intersection between
government documents and patents (46.0%) or news and patents (52.1%). Lastly, a paper
consumed in all three domains is a hit paper in science at a staggering 82.8 times the baseline
rate.

The use of high-impact papers is not only common across different public domains, it also
appears universal across research areas. Papers covered by public domains tend to be highly
cited in all scientific fields, as these papers' hit rates all exceed the baseline by large multiples in
each field (Fig. 2c-e). These findings remain similar when varying the threshold for hit papers to
top 5% or 10% citations (SI S5.3, Fig. S10,11). We also repeated our analyses for papers
produced by U.S.-based researchers, arriving at the same conclusions (Fig. S12). While
government, media, and patenting documents may cite science for a variety of reasons and our
reference-based measures are proxies for uses of science20,37,38, we see that the science
referenced in public domains is not in conflict with what scientists themselves consider
important; rather, impactful papers defined by these communities show substantial overlap. This
finding stands in contrast to concerns that the government and media in particular may be poorly
positioned to distinguish between high and low impact scientific work18,21,22,29,39. Overall, the
public use of science, while marked by substantial specialization in use across research areas,




                                                                                                        5
presents a striking universality, where diverse public domains all draw on the highest-impact
scientific papers within each field.

We further fine-grain the 19 broad research fields of papers into 294 subfields as indexed by
MAG, and calculate the RCI score for each subfield in a given public domain. We visualize each
field's RCI values, locating each field within a common triangle to compare each field's
tendency toward usage in specific public domains (Fig. 3a). Fields in social science as well as
arts and humanities are mostly used in media and government, whereas fields in science and
engineering spread out widely within the triangle, again highlighting the field-level
specialization yet collective diversity in the public uses of science.

Together, these results raise a central question: To what degree does the funding input for
science relate to the field's public use? The majority of scientific research is supported by public
investment, which aims to advance not only science itself but also broader public interest38. The
NSF, for example, formally introduced broader impacts as a key criterion for evaluating grant
proposals in 1997. Here we focus on U.S.-funded projects and use D5 to calculate the average
funding per paper in a given subfield as a proxy for public investment costs per unit of output.

We find that the public investment per paper differs dramatically across fields, spanning over
five orders of magnitude. Yet comparing average funding per paper with RCI in each domain
reveals substantial correlations between funding and the use of science across all three public
domains, with R2 = 0.202 for government, 0.318 for news, and 0.373 for patents (Fig. 3b-d, SI
S4.2, Table S1). To further test if the uncovered correlation is due to the heterogeneity in field
size or parent field, we add the number of papers in the subfield as well as parent field fixed
effects (for the 19 higher-level fields) into the regression, finding the strong correlation with RCI
persists (P < 0.001 in all three cases). Although a majority of funding come from government
agencies, the correlation with funding is the weakest for government documents. Indeed, across
the three domains, the representation of subfields in government documents has the lowest
predictive power for funding, suggesting that public investments in science better reflect the
overall public interest captured by media or patents. We further include funding from non-
governmental sources, finding our conclusions remain the same (SI S5.1, Fig. S7, Table S4-5).

Most strikingly, a simple linear regression model combining the three RCI values together yields
a surprisingly high degree of agreement with funding, with an R2 of 0.672 (Fig. 3e, SI S4.2,


                                                                                                     6
Table S2), providing at minimum an 80% increase in predictive power compared with using any
of the three public domains alone. These results suggest that each public domain provides
independent predictive power for understanding the allocation of public investment in science.
The uncovered high predictive power of this analysis is especially striking given many complex
factors and processes at work in appropriations, budget setting, and grant review40-43. Although
each research field differs significantly in its relative role and contribution in science and
beyond, the combination of their impacts beyond science powerfully predicts funding,
suggesting that, ultimately, what the public uses, what scientists use, and what is funded are
remarkably consistent.

Taken together, the analysis probes quantitatively key features of the public good approach to
science and establishes systematic facts. Measuring the usage of scientific research outside
science itself, we uncover enormous diversity and specialization in how different fields of
scientific inquiry are linked to different public domains. Yet, despite these differences, the
different public domains (and subdomains) universally draw on highly cited papers within
science, indicating that public use is strongly aligned with what scientists themselves consider
impactful. And, critically, the public usage of scientific fields across the diverse domains
provides simple yet powerful predictors for the level of public investment in each field.

Note that, although the three domains each represent an important dimension of the public space,
they do not cover all domains that science may impact. Even within each of the three domains
we studied, there may be consumption of science through channels that go beyond our datasets.
For example, scientists and their ideas can appear through television, in congressional testimony,
and in private sector consulting. Nevertheless, our datasets allow us to quantitatively examine
public uses of science across all scientific fields by diverse public domains, revealing
individually specialized and collectively diverse uses, universality in impact, and a remarkable
alignment between the funding of science and its public use.

As society's support of science depends on a public goods model9,11, and as legislators have
called for more transparency in the usage and value of scientific funding44, the framework
developed in this paper provides an empirical tool, offering quantitative evidence to inform
discussions around public good features of science. The allocation of science funding involves
chains of decisions by individuals and groups with different perspectives and priorities. These


                                                                                                   7
considerations range from legislative committees and the goals of individual political
representatives, to funding agency leaders, to within-agency mechanisms that often incorporate
insights from scientists, interacting in a complex process that must bridge across distinct
communities. As such, one might expect a substantial disconnect between what is eventually
funded and forms of public interest ­ metaphorically, funding of public parks in ways weakly
related to public use. Yet, despite the massive diversity in the public uses of science and a
complex funding process, there is remarkable alignment in the end result. What the public uses
and what scientists themselves use are closely consistent. And the funding of science closely
tracks quantifiable public use. These results suggest the connections between the ivory tower and
the real world appear more aligned than is commonly imagined.

Figure captions
Fig. 1. Diversity in public use. Different scientific fields experience distinct and typically
specialized public uses. (a-t) The usage metric RCI for the three public domains, presented for
each field (b-t). The dashed triangles represent a null model where each paper has the same
chance to be used (a).


Fig. 2. Public use and scientific use. The public tends to consume exceptionally high impact
science from all fields and in all three public domains, indicating alignment between public use
and scientific use. (a) Usage by domain for papers published from 2005 to 2014. The area of
each subset is proportional to the square root of the paper count in the corresponding public
domain. (b) Hit rates for papers cited in one, two, or three public domains. Hit papers are defined
as those receiving citation counts, within science, in the top 1% within the field and year. (c-e)
Hit rates for each of the 19 fields consumed by government documents (c), news media (d) and
patents (e). In all fields, and in all three domains, the consumed papers have hit rates within
science many times larger than the baseline rate of 1% (dashed line).


Fig. 3. Public use and public funding. Amidst enormous diversity in public use across fields
and domains, scientific funding for a given field is closely aligned with the totality of its public
use. (a) Ternary plot of RCI for 294 level-1 fields together, with the location of each field
indicating its relative usage among the public domains. Circles are colored coded according to its
parent field in Fig. 1, and circle sizes reflect overall usage. (b-d) Average funding per paper
across fields is positively correlated with a field's RCI index in government (b), news (c) and
patenting (d). The relationship remains significant when combined with control variables (P <
0.001 in all three cases after controlling for the number of papers and parent field fixed effects).
(e) Collectively, public uses beyond science strongly predict field level funding per paper.

S1 Data description
S1.1 Microsoft Academic Graph (D1)
The publication and citation data are primarily obtained from Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG,
accessed Oct 2018)34,45. MAG is arguably the largest open-source citation database to date and
contains records of 209M documents. We inter-linked different data tables to obtain the author,
affiliation, year, venue and topic information for each paper. MAG includes a variety of
document types. To focus on scientific articles, we consider publications under the categories of
journal papers, conferences papers, books and book chapters, and papers with DOI information.
In other words, two kinds of publications are excluded in our analysis: patents and papers with
neither category nor DOI information. We further focus on papers published in a 10-year period
from 2005 to 2014, leading to a subset of 36M papers in total.


MAG uses a non-mutually exclusive hierarchy for research topic (field of study) mined by
semantic analysis tools. To explore major research fields, the analysis considers the level-0 (19
fields) and level-1 (294 fields) categorizations (Fig. S1a). Figure S1b and S1c show the number
of level-0 and level-1 fields that each paper is connected to, indicating both quantities are
narrowly distributed.


S1.2 US Government Documents (D2)
To quantify references to scientific articles in the government domain, one needs to construct a
large-scale dataset of government documents that can be linked to the scientific papers. The task
has been difficult in part because government documents are spread across many sources.
Despite recent efforts like govinfo46 to digitalize and standardize government publication
information, most existing sources have relatively low coverage, especially for the executive
branch. Furthermore, although a significant fraction of such documents may cite scientific
literature, such citations do not follow a common structure. To tackle both challenges, here we
develop a novel pipeline to construct the dataset.


Our data collection starts with a list of URLs under the .gov domain, which is the domain name
for government agencies and contains the vast majority of U.S. government entities. Given the
huge number of such pages, here we use a PageRank-like assessment system provided by the


                                                                                                    1
Microsoft Bing search engine, which assigns each URL with a tiered index of importance. In this
study, we focus on Tier 0 (the most important) pages to construct the sample, which contains
approximately 6M URLs within the .gov domain. We downloaded these pages using an
automatic crawler and focused on all PDF files in this set (~28% among the corpus). We also
notice that a small proportion of these documents are themselves research papers, as their urls
can be linked to MAG papers though MAG paper url table, and exclude these documents from
our analysis.


To extract the references cited in these files we apply Science-Parse47, an open-source tool for
reference string extraction developed by the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence. Science-
Parse is a state-of-art framework that scans PDF files and returns a list of all reference-like
strings. We then match this list to the MAG. Since the PDF reference extraction may contain
minor errors, exact title matching of paper items may not be the optimal approach. Specifically,
we indexed the full MAG to compile a search engine-like system using title, journal, author and
publication year information. By leveraging the Okapi BM25 measure48, one of the core
algorithms used by modern full-text search engines, we query each string to obtain a list of the
top 2 candidate paper items, each accompanied by a score representing the degree of agreement.
To find the score threshold for determining if a string is successfully matched, here we use
scores of the 2nd matched paper as a null model for score distributions (Fig. S2a). Indeed,
assuming the score is a reasonable quantification, one would expect the difference of 1st and 2nd
matched paper to be significant if and only if the 1st ranked paper is a true match of the string. To
this end, for each string we first calculate the score distribution of all 2nd matched scores of the
similar query word length as a baseline. The string is considered to be matched to the 1st ranked
paper when the score is significantly higher than a right tail cutoff of the baseline distribution (P
= 0.05). We further test this algorithm by comparing its predictions with manual validations on
100 randomly selected papers through two evaluations: (1) For a binary classification based on
whether a reference string can be matched to a MAG paper, we calculate the F1 score; and (2)
conditional on being classified as positive in (1), we measure the accuracy of the matched MAG
document ID. We find high consistency between the results returned by the algorithm and our
manual validations (Fig. S2b).




                                                                                                       2
S1.3 Altmetric dataset (D3)
To study references to scientific publications in the news media, we use a dataset offered by
Altmetric29,30,49. This dataset records approximately 19.4M papers with at least one news media
or social media mention. We then merge paper information with MAG. A vast majority (16.1M)
of publications in the Altmetric database have unique digital object identifiers (DOI), allowing us
to connect this with DOI information in MAG. We find that 13.7M (84%) of the DOIs can be
matched to records in MAG.


S1.4 USPTO patent database (D4)
To study references to scientific publications in patents, we build on prior work and use a
comprehensive list of mapping from United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO)
patents to MAG papers, which includes approximately 15M citation pairs between patents and
papers50. To classify patents into technology classes, we use the Cooperative Patent
Classification (CPC) system, drawn from PatentsView, a data platform based on USPTO bulk
data51. Combining the two files provides technology class information for 97.5% of patents that
reference scientific articles. The small share of missing technology class cases corresponds to
patents granted in late 2018, which have not been updated in our data.


S1.5 Dimensions scientific funding data (D5)
To understand how research funding from various sources is allocated into different scientific
fields, we leverage research funding data from Dimensions36,52, a novel dataset that includes
approximately 5M research projects supported by over 400 funding agencies worldwide. To be
consistent with our publication analysis, we focus on projects funded during the same ten-year
period (2005-2014). One challenge in our estimation here is that some projects are supported
both within and outside the ten-year period, for example, in year 2014, 2015 and 2016, while
only the total funding amount is available. Here we estimate funding amount in the ten-period by
multiplying the total amount with the fraction of time within the ten-year period, which equals to
1/3 in this example. We further focus on projects that have funding amount information and are
funded by US agencies.




                                                                                                  3
A unique opportunity provided by Dimensions is a linkage table between supporting grants and
resulting publications, which allows us to categorize the field of each grant according to its
resulting publications. More than 90% of the publications have DOI information which can be
further matched to items in our paper database. Here we use this table and focus on projects that
can be linked to at least one MAG paper (which allows us to estimate the research field for over
74% of U.S. research funding in this period). We then create a list of level-1 fields by combining
the fields of resulting publications supported by each grant, and evenly split funding amount of
this project to each field in this list. For example, if a grant of $15,000 supports three
publications, two in quantum physics and one in mathematical physics respectively, we assign
$10,000 to quantum physics and $5,000 to mathematical physics. Together we link 292,875
funded projects with at least one publication.


S1.6 Data limitations
Our data are not without limitations. First, our datasets only represent a subset of all possible
government documents and media news in the world, and there could be heterogeneity within
documents published by different agencies or news covered by different media. Second, the
linkage strategy between science and public uses and funding is based on automatic algorithms
and may contain some errors. While our validations in S2 and robustness checks in S5 have not
uncovered any potential biases, readers should keep in mind of the existence of these factors.
Nevertheless, despite these potential limitations, it is important to note that these data sources are
among the largest in their respective domains, and approaches for data linkages are also among
the most advanced of their kind, hence representing the state-of-art empirical basis to understand
the interaction between science and public domains.



S2 Independent data validation
S2.1 Overton policy documents (D6)
Policy documents extracted from the Bing search engine and their associated references provides
a novel data that is only possible with recent advances in information retrieval and machine
learning. Given the novelty of such applications (reference parsing in policy documents), we lack
systematic baseline methods for comparison. Here we leverage another novel dataset, Overton,



                                                                                                     4
which has just become available during the writing of this manuscript and provides an
independent validation case. Overton is among the world's largest searchable index of policy
documents, including about 3M policy-related documents from thousands of sources in different
types (government agencies, think tanks and intergovernmental organizations). Overton also
extracts scientific references in documents and maps them into DOIs. Here we retrieve all policy
documents published by U.S. governmental agencies indexed by Overton, looking at all
scientific references (published in the same ten-year period) they have ever cited, and use the
DOI to connect these papers into MAG. For comparison we calculate two fundamental
measurements that are key to our main conclusions: the relative usage (RCI) and average hit
rate28. In Fig. S3a, we compare the relative usage RCI for level-1 fields, finding high consistency
between the two sources (Spearman correlation rs = 0.94, P < 0.001). We further calculate paper
hit rates used in policy for level-0 fields across Overton and our dataset (Fig. S3b), again finding
high correlations (Spearman correlation rs = 0.60, P = 0.006). Together, these results suggest that
both dimensions studied in this paper seem reliable across different datasets. Given that these
two sources are built and developed independently, the remarkable consistency offers strong
support for the robustness of our findings.


We further use Overton data to repeat our results in Fig. 3 (Fig. S6). Although the correlation
between log of RCIGovernment and log of average funding decreases (R2 from 0.202 to 0.097,
Fig.S6A), the relationship remains significant (P < 0.001 after controlling for number of papers
and level-0 parent field fixed effect, Table S3).


S2.2 RePORTER funding dataset (D7)
The Dimensions data (D5) is a state-of-art database linking funding and associated publications,
using information from funding agencies as well as text mining from the acknowledgement
section of publications. As an alternative, we further leverage funding-paper linkage information
from two major funding sources in the U.S. ­ the National Science Foundation (NSF) and
National Institutes of Health (NIH). These two agencies are the largest federal funders for
scientific research and together account for more than half of overall federal research funding53.
Information on all projects funded by NIH over the last several decades and resulting
publications are available through NIH RePORT (Research Portfolio Online Reporting Tools),


                                                                                                     5
an open data source developed since 200854. Bulk data for NSF grants in a similar format are
available as part of Federal RePORTER, a federal effort to "create a repository of data and tools
that will be useful to assess the impact of federal R&D investments"55.


To test our data coverage, we calculated the number of publications supported by each grant
active in the ten-year period (2005-2014) from both RePORTER and Dimensions data. We find
in both NSF and NIH, the number of publications supported by each grant is highly correlated,
showing a high degree of consistency between the two data sources (Fig. S4bd). Further, we find
that Dimensions reports more resulting publications on average (Fig. S4ac). The superiority of
Dimensions may be explained by multiple reasons, including an incomplete coverage of data in
early years from Federal RePORTER and the fact that more complete paper-grant linkages can
be found through publication acknowledgements. Regardless, these results suggest Dimensions
is the preferred source for linking papers and grants for this study.



S3 Related works
S3.1 Policy uses of science
There has been a long-lasting interest in understanding uses of science in policy and decision-
making over many decades20,22, offering a rich set of conceptual models capturing policy uses of
science, ranging from two communities theory17,18 that suggest little common language and
interest between scientists and policymakers, to supply-side and demand-side models that
highlight knowledge production on the science side56 or problem solving on the policy side37 as
the primary driver of research utilization in policy, to interaction models that depicts an iterative
process where science and policy co-evolve20,57,58. Some works along this line has also examined
different types of policy uses, arguing that policy-science citations may occur for various
reasons59,60, including (i) instrumental uses (knowledge directly applied to solve problems); (ii)
conceptual uses (research that influences or informs the way policymakers think); (iii) tactical
uses (citing research to support or challenge an idea) among others, suggesting value in
understanding the semantics of the policy-science citations. Yet at the same time, it has also been
recognized that distinguishing these uses at scale remains a challenging task20. Here we develop




                                                                                                     6
a scaled approach based on citation links and leave analysis of how specifically the science is
being used to further investigation.


S3.2 Altmetrics literature
Altmetrics studies alternative or complementary indicators related to scientific
publications29,30,61 . This field leverages databases such as Altmetric and PlumX and has grown
rapidly in the last decade, deepening our empirical understanding61 of how science is covered
across different online platforms, including social media platforms, mainstream media news,
policy documents, Wikipedia and other sources. For example, several prior studies in this
literature have examined the overall coverage and reliability of such datasets62-64. Based on these
datasets, researchers have also examined how scientific papers from different fields receive
attention beyond citations65, as well as the relationship between citation metrics and altmetrics
indexes29,30. For a more detailed overview of the Altmetrics literature, readers may refer to two
recent reviews61,66.


S3.3 Scientific non-patent references
Scientific non-patent references have also been studied in the recent innovation literature, partly
due to the increasing availability of approaches and data sources for large-scale matching
between patent references and scientific publications. Recent systematic linkage efforts have
connected USPTO patents to Web of Science67 and Microsoft Academic Graph33. Existing
literature has examined meanings of such citations, suggesting these linkages as a useful signal
for association between science and technology68,69. Furthermore, scientific non-patent
references have been leveraged to construct higher-order indirect links between patenting and
science31,32.



S4 Methodology
S4.1 Citation percentiles and hit papers
Despite the widespread use of citations as a proxy for scientific impact, direct comparison of
citation counts received by papers across time and field can be problematic without
normalization70. We therefore calculate citation percentiles for papers within the same



                                                                                                      7
publication year and field. Here following prior studies31,71,72, we define `hit papers' (also known
as `home runs') as papers ranking in the top 1% of citations received. As we tune the threshold
from 1% to 5% or 10%, we find the result that high-impact papers are disproportionately used by
public domains remains robust (See SM S5.3, Fig. S10,11).


S4.2 Regression models
To understand the association between public use and funding for different scientific fields, we
use linear regression models (ordinary least squares). We first note that all three RCI measures
are highly skewed (Fig. S5a-c), prompting us we take the natural logarithm (Fig. S5d-f), ln RCI,
in our linear regressions. The same transformation is taken on the average funding per paper.


The variables are defined as follows:
Dependent variable: The dependent variable is ln! , defined as the natural logarithm of average
funding per paper.
Predictors of interest: We examine in regression the extent to which different impact measures
can predict funding, including ln " for the three public domains, as well as ln  , the natural
logarithm of mean citations received for papers in that field. To include all data points in the
regression, for the rare cases when an impact measure is 0, we add 1 to avoid 0-s in the
logarithm. We further include the natural logarithm of the number of papers published in the ten-
year period, ln , as another control variable.
Fixed effects: To control for the possible fact that fields under different broad categories may
have specific way of funding and public use and hence are not directly comparable, we introduce
# , fixed effect terms for each level-0 field. Specifically, #! = 1 if the level-1 field i is a child
field of the level-0 field f according to MAG's classification structure. Note that some level-1
fields belong to two level-0 fields simultaneously (e.g. mathematical physics is the child field of
both mathematics and physics).


We start with bivariate regressions examining the relationship between each RCI (i.e. for
government, media, or patenting) and average funding (Table S1, Models 1-3). That is,
                                        ln! =  " ln "! + !




                                                                                                        8
where i indexes a specific level-1 field, j indexes one of the three public domains, and ! is
average funding per paper in the field.


In multivariate regressions, we further include control variables to test if the uncovered
correlation is simply due to the heterogeneity in field size or parent field (Table S2, Models 4-6)

                          ln! =  " ln "! + $ ln ! + 0 # #! + !
                                                            #

Together these results indicate that funding per paper across fields is strongly positively
correlated with relative usage in any of the three domains when analyzed separately. This finding
prompts us to investigate the joint predictive power of the three RCIs (Table S2, Model 7):

                                      ln! =  0 " ln "! + !
                                              "

which shows that each measure contributes independently and substantially to explaining the
variation in funding.


Finally, we add further control variables into Models 7 (Table S2, Model 8):

                        ln! =  0 " ln "! + $ ln ! + 0 # #! + !
                                  "                             #




S5 Further robustness checks
S5.1 Including non-governmental funding
In our main regression analysis, we mainly focused on US governmental funding agencies
(defined as funding agencies under .gov or .mil domains.) Here we run further robustness checks
by considering other US funding agencies. Indeed, we find funding information recorded in
Dimensions is primarily dominated by governmental funding agencies, and our results remain
robust when considering all US funding.


The relationship documented in Fig. 3b-d remains significant (Fig. S7a-c) and significance
remains in all three cases after controlling for number of papers and level-0 parent field fixed




                                                                                                   9
effect in (P < 0.001, Table S4). We also find a similar level of predictive power, where the three
public use variables have R2 = 0.672 (Fig. S7d, Table S5).


S5.2 Changing the criterion of academic publications
As mentioned in S1.1, papers with neither document categorization nor DOI information are not
considered, since this is a noisier population that may not represent standard research
publications. Here we repeat our analysis by including these samples and calculate RCI for each
level-0 field, finding our results are broadly consistent with Fig. 1 (Fig. S8). We also try another
variant by restricting the samples used in main text to those only published in English, again
finding our results do not change (Fig. S9).


S5.3 Robustness of paper hit rate
We check our definition of hit papers by changing the threshold to top 5% (Fig. S10) or 10%
(Fig. S11) highly cited papers. Both variants show that papers used across public domains and
scientific fields are universally impactful within science.

We further repeated our analyses for papers produced by U.S.-based researchers. More
specifically, we identify U.S. institutions in MAG based on their GRID (Global Research
Identifier Database) id and limit our analysis to papers produced by scholars with these
institutional affiliations, again finding universal high impact of papers (Fig. S12).

Figure S2. Matching raw reference string to MAG records. (a) Distribution of normalized
score for papers with the first and second highest matching score. The normalization is obtained
by calculating the z-score of the raw score for the second-best matched papers for strings of
similar word length. The normalized score for second-best matched papers approximately
follows a standard Gaussian distribution, yet the first-best matched papers peak near z = 2,
indicating a large proportion of matchings are significantly more accurate than expected. (b) We
tuned the threshold and evaluated matching performance on a manually validated subset using
two step measures: (1) Whether a string can be matched into a MAG paper (binary classification
problem), measured by F1 score, and (2) Conditional on the string successfully matching into
MAG both automatically and manually, to what extent are the two matched IDs consistent (label
problem), measured by overall accuracy. We find both measures show high predictive power
near z = 2.

Figure S3. Comparing Bing data with Overton data. The x-axis represents values calculated
on all policy documents published by U.S.-based sources from the Overton dataset, while the y-
axis represents values calculated on all tier-0 .gov domain PDF pages indexed by the Bing search
engine. (a) Comparing the relative consumption index (RCI) for level-1 fields reveals high
consistency between the two sources (Spearman correlation rs = 0.94, p < 0.001). (b) The hit
rates of papers used in policy for level-0 fields study are also highly correlated across Overton
and Bing (Spearman correlation rs = 0.60, p = 0.006). More importantly, the unusually high hit
rates are also universal in Overton, where the lowest hit rate across all fields is still 6.7 times the
baseline rate of 1%.

Figure S5. Distribution of RCI index and transformations. (a-c) Histogram of RCI for level-1
fields in policy (a), news (b) and patent (c). All three distributions are highly skewed, prompting
us to take appropriate transformations before regression analysis. (d-f) Histogram of ln RCI for
level-1 fields in policy (d), news (e) and patent (f). The three distributions are closer to normal
distributions after the transformation as compared with (a-c).

Figure S6. Robustness checks on policy documents by using Overton data. (a) Average
funding per paper across fields is positively correlated with a field's RCI index in government
(based on Overton data). The relationship remains significant when combined with control
variables (P < 0.001 after controlling for the number of papers and parent field fixed effects,
Table S3). (b) Collectively, public uses beyond science strongly predict field level funding per
paper.

Figure S7. Public use of science and scientific funding by including all US funding. (a-c)
Average funding per paper across fields is positively correlated with a field's RCI index in
government (a), news (b) and patenting (c). The relationship remains significant when combined
with control variables (P < 0.001 in all three cases after controlling for the number of papers and
parent field fixed effects, Table S5). (d) Collectively, public uses beyond science strongly predict
field level funding per paper.
