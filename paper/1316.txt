                 A Reconsideration of the Effects of Unionism on
           Relative Wages and Employment in the United States, 1920—80


                                         ABSTRACT


     H. Gregg Lewis' estimates of the relative wage effect of unionism between

1920 and 1958     are   routinely cited though they have rarely been subject to

scrutiny. This paper extends Lewis' data to 1980 and, in particular, we

construct a series on union membership that links up with the data available in

the 1970's from the Current Population Surveys. We proceed to reexamine the

effects of trade unions both on relative wages and on relative manhours worked.

Our estimates of the relative wage effect are similar to Lewis' though these are

not measured with precision and a wide range of estimates are consistent with

the results. With respect to the effect of unionism on relative manhours

worked, we are not at all satisfied that the analysis of these data clearly

points to the existence of a negative effect.

                                       I.   Introduction

        When an economist publishes important, original, and potentially

contrQversial empirical results, it is usually the case that the data

and the procedures generating these results are scrutinized by other

economists.        The chains of reasoning that led to these findings are

examined, the data are inspected, and the estimates are checked to

determine whether the results claimed do, indeed, follow and, if so, to

ascertain the degree to which these results are sensitive to small

changes in the underlying assumptions.                   It is, of course, this social

character of the discipline which gives rise to any                         impartiality that
economics     can claim. As Popper (1966) expresses it,                    ".  . objectivity
is    closely bound up with the social aspect of scientific method, with

the fact that science and scientific objectivity do not (and cannot)

result from the attempts of an individual scientist to be "objective,t'

but   from the friendly—hostile cooperation of many scientists" (p. 217).
        One study in economics that appears not to have been exposed to
this collective scrutiny           is H. Gregg Lewis' (1963, l961) estimates of

the relative wage and employment effects of U.S. trade unions over the

years 1920—58.        His results have justly received widespread attention,

but   they   are cited in a routine manner and, for the most part, they have
                                 —2—




not been subject to the same critical evaluation accorded to other

empirical studies of comparable standing in economics.!' One of the

very few assessments of Lewis' estimates was   that   provided by Melvin

Reder (1965) in his insightful review of Lewis' book in the Journal of

Political Econonr for April 1965.      In this paper, Reder not only

supplied an excellent synopsis of Lewis' work, but also he clearly

identified the critical points In Lewis' empirical procedures and he

offered alternative explanantions for Lewis' findings. Indeed, some of

the most original research in measuring the effects of trade unions on

labor market variables are direct descendents of Reder's thoughtful

review articie..V

      The purpose of this paper is to resume the process of evaluating

Lewis' work.   We have extended Lewis' data and his estimates of the

relative wage effects of unions from 1959 to 1980. We determine whether

the inferences from Lewis' regressions are sensitive to alternative

specifications of the equations Including making some allowance for

serial correlation in the estimated residuals.     We also take up the

question of the effects of unions on total manhours worked.   Our proce-

dure is first to specify what we call "descriptive equations" whose

purpose is essentially to describe the underlying empirical regularities

and where little recourse is made to structural labor supply and labor

demand equations.   We then specify a structural model, estimate the

parameters of that model, and draw inferences from these estimates about

the effects of unionism on relative wages and on relative manhours

worked. We turn first to a brief description of the data and the vari-

ables that we shall be using in our empirical analysis.3/

                        II. Description    of the Data


       Lewis' purpose in Chapter VI of his book (1963) was        to   derive
 estimates of the average union—nonunion wage differential for the U.S.

 econor over the years from 1920 to 1958. Reduced to its essentials,

 his procedure was to divide the economy into two sectors and, after

 controlling for the effects of other variables, to compare the movements

 in the logarithms of relative wages in the two sectors with movements in

 the sectoral difference in the fraction of workers unionized. The two

 sectors were denoted by a and b:          sector a consisted of the mining,

 construction, manufacturing, transportation, communications, and public

utilities industries; sector b consisted of all other industries except

for government work relief and the U.S. military.        During the 1920—58
period examined by Lewis, more than 80 percent of the economy's union

workers were employed in sector a.

      The task of extending beyond 1958 the data on hourly compensation,

manhours worked, and output in the two sectors is straightforward (if

tedious) and, although there exist some differences between Lewis'

procedures and our procedures in forming these variables, these differ-

ences are very small in our judgment. This is not the case, however,

with our series on the fraction of workers covered by collective bar-

gaining contracts in the two sectors and our task in constructing these

series for the 1960's and 1970's was more forntLdable.J!J' (Our procedures

in forming these variables are given in detail in the Appendix.) For

these variables, our procedure was to start with the union coverage and

union nmbership data collected by the Current Population Surveys (cPs)
                                   _14 —




in   the 1970's and then to link these data with those published

biennually by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) in the 1960's and

late 1950's. The resulting series are likely to be quite accurate for

the 1970's, but will surely be substantially less so for the preceding

years.     We have tried to compile a series on the numbers of workers

represented by trade unions rather than a series on union membership.

In this respect, our concept is different from Lewis' although the

difference between the sectors in the fraction of workers represented by

unions (the variable to be used in most of' the empirical analysis below)

differs trivially from the sectoral difference in the fraction of

workers who are union numbers, at least for the years from 1977 to

l980.-J

         Our estimates of the thousands of workers represented by trade

unions from 1958 to 1980 are listed in Table l those for sector a are

given in column (i), for sector b in column (ii), and for the entire

economy in column (iii); the fraction of full—time equivalent employees

represented by trade unions in sectors a and b is given in columns (iv)

and (v) respectively of Table 1 and the arithmetic difference in the

unionization proportions in the two sectors is given in column (vi).

The well—known decline in the extent of unionism in the "old" industries

is revealed by the unmistakable negative trend in the series in column

(iv). This has been offset only slightly by the growth in the extent of

unionism in sector b (primarily an expansion of unionism in
government). As column (vi) of Table 1 makes clear, and is evident from

Figure 1, the unionism difference between the two sectors narrowed

considerably between 1958 and 1980: whereas the fraction of sector a's

employees represented by unions was almost 50 percent greater in 1958

than the fraction of sector b's employees, by 1980 this difference had

almost halved to 28 percent. A difference between the two sectors of

this order of magnitude had not been recorded since the late 1930's.

(See Lewis (1963), Table 53.) However, in the late 1930's, well over

percent of all union workers were employed in sector a; by comparison,

the corresponding figure in 1980 was a little over 62 percent.-'

      The mean values and standard deviation of the variables used in

the analysis are given In Table 2.      The sample data we use for the

period 1920—58 are identical to those used by Lewis except that for

several variables we altered his values for 1958 (the last observation

in his study) to take advantage of revisions in the figures by various

government agencies.L' These alterations were small and reestimating

Lewis' equations with these revised values for 1958 had trivial effects

on his estimated parameters.    As is evident in Table 2, the size of

sector a relative to sector b was smaller during the 1959—80 period than

in the 1920—58 period whether size is measured in terms of labor input

(total manhours) or in terms of output (national income). As we have

already noted, the fraction of employees represented by unions in

sector a was declining from 1958 to 1980 while that in sector b was

growing slightly.   Over the same period, the hourly compensation in

sector a relative to that in sector b traces a U—shape declining from

1.13 in 1958 to 1.29 in 1970 and then rising to 1.37 in 1980, the same

value as that in 1955.     (See Figure 1)   Although we shall sometimes

refer to the hourly compensation series as a relative wage series, it

should be emphasized that these data include not merely wages and

salaries, but also commissions, tips, bonuses, the value of payments in

kind, estimated employer contributions to pension and health plans, a.nd

compensation for injuries. However, as was the case with Levis' study

from 1920 to 1958,   these   compensation figures have not been adjusted for

changes in relative labor force composition except for shifts of

employment among large industry aggregates.         Therefore, some of the

movements in these relative compensation figures viii be attributable to

changes in the relative "quality" of the employees and, by not account-

ing for these changes in "quality," our procedures are likely to over-

estimate the true impact of unionism on relative wages. For, insofar as

unionized employers retain considerable discretion over employment

decisions, they are induced by a higher union wage to upgrade the

"quality" of their employees so that a part of what we measure as the

relative wage effect of unionism is likely to be, in fact, a wage

difference that corresponds to differences in the "quality" of the work

forces of unionized employers compared with those of nonunionized

employers. This was a limitation of Lewis' study and it applies also to

this one.

      The other two variables listed in Table 2, X. and Z, describe

two features of the econonv at the aggregate level.          Both of these

variables were used by Levis in his analysis. X. is the ratio of the

price level to the value implied by the recent trend in prices. That

is, if       is the price level in year t and             p. is a weighted

average of current and past values of            where the weights decline
                                      —9—




exponentially from the current period to earlier periods, then

X =                This variable takes on its highest values not so much in

periods of inflation, but in periods of accelerating inflation (that is,

when prices in year t are much higher than their recent values) and

these occur in 1920, 19142_1, l9I4748, and l974—8O; X takes on its

lowest values when prices in year t         fall   below the levels recorded in

years   in,mediateiy preceding year t and the extreme values are recorded
in the early 1930's.       Z. measures the unemployment rate in the labor
force..2J Once again, the post—1958 period         displays n.rked constrast to

the   1920—58 period: whereas the logarithm of X.         (which   is the form in
which    X.
                is used in the analysis below) and Z. were negatively

correlated in the years from 1920 to 1958, they were positively

correlated during the period 1959_80.121

point in an empirical analysis is to                                investigate the consequences of

assuming    that the relative wage effects of unionism within each sector
are    constants over time.                     In this case, writing                     Zn         =
                                                                                                         OY + Ut

This equation was fitted to the                      annual data described in Section II over

the period 1920—80 both by ordinary least—squares and by a generalized

least—squares procedure that adjusts the variables for first—order

serial correlation in the estimated residuals. 't was represented by a

number of different variables including the logarithm of relative output

in the two sectors                      (2.n        the logarithm of relative wages             lagged   one


year        (1.n w1), the logarithm of the ratio of the price level in

period t to its level in years in and immediately before year t

(2i x), the unemployment rate (z), the logarithm of relative manhours

worked lagged one year (n E1), and a linear time trend (Ti). A
representative sample of estimates are given in Table 3 where, from line

to lIne, the point estimates of Ba and Bb change substantially
(measured in terms of their implications for ra and rb).—" However,

these coefficients (especially Bb) are not estimated very precisely and

a wide range of values for Ba and Bb are consistent with the data.

Indeed, for most of the specifications we fitted based on equation (3),

we could not reject the null hypothesis of no difference between the

estimates of                            and     Bb.     This provides some support for Lewis'
                               Ba
procedure of focusing upon the arithmetic difference between at

bt' as we now proceed to do.

            Let                 be the following transformation of the econou—wide

average of the proportionate union—nonunion wage differential:

   =                  +   (i   —
                                    q)B         where               measures the fraction of all

unionized workers during period 5 who are employed in sector a. Then

equation (2) may be written as follows:


()     fl         =                 +

NOTES:     The mean of the dependent variable over the period 1920—80 is    0.280    and its standard deviation is 0.057.    The standard error    of estimate of the
regression equation is given by see.      OLS stands for ordinary least—squares and COOR for Cochrane and Orcutt'a iterative procedure to adjust for first—order
serial correlation in the fitted residuals.   The final value of the first—order serial correlation parameter as estimated by COOR is given by p. The
Durbin—Watson statistic (d) is reported in equations (3a), (3b), (3e). and (3r) and Durbin's   h statistic is reported for equations (3c) and (3d). When
applying COOR, the statistics reported in the  final three columns are based on the p—adjusted variables and, therefore, they are not strictly comparable
with those corresponding to the OLS estimates.

correlation although, in almost every case, the point estimates of the

parameters are not sensitive to the modelling of a simple first—order

autoregressive error process. For every specification in Table          and   in

many others whose estimates are not reported, the null hypothesis of a

zero relative wage effect of unionism can be rejected at a high level of

significance. The estimated coefficient on            falls as more variables

are added to the regression equation so that, in equations (6e) and

(6f), the implied point estimates of         r    are 18.5 percent and 21.6

percent respectively. These results for the period 1920—28 are similar

to Lewis' results for 1920—58 when he fits equations that assume              is

constant.—/
        l4

     Consider now the consequences of permitting the relative wage

effect of unionism to vary over the years from 1920 to 1980.             Lewis

conjectured that unionism tended to reduce the responsiveness of money

wages of union labor to transitory changes in the general price level

and in employment. If this is the case,            would fall when such tran-

sitory elements are positive and Bt              would rise when transitory

elements are negative; that is,       would vary with the business cycle,

being largest in the contraction phase and being smallest in the

expansionary phase of the cycle. To implement this hypothesis, return

to equation (5) and express        as a function, first, of the logarithm

of the ratio of the price level in period t to its level in and

immediately prior to year t (n x) and, second, of the unemployment

rate (Zt):    Bt = b0 + b1 £n X + b2Zt       where    b1 < 0   and      b2 > 0.

Substituting this expression for          into equation (5), we have:
                                       —i6—




(7)           £n      =
                          eY + boPt + b1(P £n x) + b2(PZ) + Vt

where v =
                   v + Ut. Table 5 presents the consequences of fitting this
equation to the annual data from 1920 to 1980 where again             is given

by Ln %' £n X, Z, and £n Eti. The null hypothesis that the value
      —                                 -
of    Bt is constant over the l920—30 period is easily rejected.±' For

each equation in Table 5, b1         is negative as conjectured and signifi-

cantly less than zero by conventiQnal criteria while b2 is negative

instead of the hypothesized positive sign.         (If a two—tailed test were

applied to         1,2, then by conventional criteria it would not be judged

significantly different from zero.)           Moreover, simply evaluating the

point estimates of b1 and b2,               is more responsive to movements in

the inflation variable than to movements in unemployment: for instance,

using equation (7d)'s estimates, estimated at the sample mean values of

n X and Z., a one standard deviation increase in Ln X (with the

unemployment rate constant) reduces the implied value of            from 23.1

percent to 9.1 percent whereas a one standard deviation increase in Z.

(holding the inflation variable constant) reduces the implied value of

      from 23.1 to i6.6 percent. These results replicate Lewis' findings

that unionism tended to make the money wages of union labor less

responsive to sudden movements in the general price level while the

evidence associating unionism's relative wage impact to the unemployment

rate is considerably weaker.

          The four equations in Table 5 imply similar movements in Bt over

the 1920—80 period. Columns (i) and (ii) of Table 6 present the point

estimates and standard errors of          corresponding to equations (Tc)

and (Td) averaged over the values of £n X and Z. in each subperiod

and in the 1920—80 period as a whole. According to these estimates, the

average relative wage effect of unionism, r, over the entire period was

between 18.5 percent and 26.0 percent, values virtually identical to

those inlied by equations (6e) and (6f) in Table 1• The point esti-

mates of    r   range widely over the six decades from a maximum in the

first half of the 1930's to a minimum in the second half of the

1970's. These fluctuations tend to be slightly greater when measured by

conventional least—squares than when estimated by generalized least—

squares. However, the standard errors attached to the point estimates

of         caution against any confident statements about the precise

magnitude of the relative wage effect in any subperiod: for instance,

according to equation (Td), a 95 percent confidence interval on

ranges from 15.3 percent to 88.3 percent in the early 1930's and from

—14.9 percent to 29.1 percent in the late 1970's. That these union wage

effects in particular subperiods are estimated very imprecisely was

noted by Lewis, but this fact is typically overlooked by others

reporting these estimates.-&!

      The point estimates of          in Table 6 for the l960's do not

differ appreciably from those for the 1950's, but those in the 1970's

are noticeably lower.    In view of the relatively high values taken by

the inflation variable, £n X, in the 1970's, these lower values of

in this decade should not occasion mich surprise. The disturbing aspect
                                    —20—




of   this result is that it does not appear to conform to the measurement

of the relative wage effects of unionism as estimated from various large

data sets on individuals. For instance, Ashenfelter's (1978) analysis

of individuals in the CPSs suggests an average value of B that rises

from 11.6 percent in 1967 to 114.8 percent in 1973 and to 16.8 percent in

1975.     Or Moore and Raisian's (1983) analysis of the Income Dynamics

Panel for male heads of households suggests either a rising trend or no

trend (depending upon the particular equation specification) in the

union—nonunion wage differential from 1967 to 1977.            George Johnson

(1983) presents more evidence against the notion of a falling union

relative wage effect in the 1970's.        The changes estimated in these

studies are not always measured very precisely, nor are those estimated

in Table 6, so not too much should be made of this difference.

Nevertheless, insofar as our point estimates of'               in the 1970's

contradict those inferred from the analysis of large data sets on

individual workers, we are inclined to place more credence in the union

wage    effects estimated from the latter than in those estimated from
highly aggregated data such as those in this paper.
        One possible reconciliation that we   considered   was that   the rela-
tionship between       on the one hand and the inflation variable and the

unemployment rate on the other hand differed in the 1920—58 period that

Lewis analyzed from that obtaining after 1958.         After all, we have

already noted in Section II that the covariance between in                 and

       is sharply different in one period compared with the other.          In

fact, a conventional test of the null hypothesis that b1 and b2 are
                                          —21--




the same in the years 1959—80 as in the years 1920—58 can be

rejected.1L'     Consider, therefore, measuring                 according to the

following specification where Dt is a dumay variable taking the value

of unity during the years from 1959 to 1980 and taking the value of zero

                 =                 £n X + b2Zt +
                                                 '3Dt £n X +
                          +                                             When this

expression for            is substituted into equation (5) and when            is

represented by a linear combination of £n Q, £n X, Z., and £n

the resulting generalized least—squares estimates of                    are those

given in column (iii) of Table 6.                 Clearly, even allowing for a

different structure for                   in the post—1958 period, our point

estimates of unionism's relative wage effect remain unchanged and, in

particular, we continue to estimate a lower relative wage effect in the

1970's compared with the preceding decade.&1'

      To conclude this section, we report briefly the consequences of

addressing two other issues. First, we examined the effects of treating

unionism and relative output as endogenous in equation (7). The union-

ism variable, F, almost certainly contains measurement error while the

relative output produced in sectors a and b, £n Q, is surely a function,

in part, of the relative wages in the two sectors: for both P and

£n Q, there exists good reason for considering instrumental variable

estimates of the relative wage equation.i2! The results were not at

variance with those reported in Tables 5 and 6 because the standard

errors of the resulting estimates were so large as to encompass a very

wide range of different values including the point estimates of

already reported. This should serve to underline the uncertainty that
                                   —22—




surrounds the point estimates of          in particular subperiods.-9J

       Second, we took up Reder's (1965) "one substantive criticism" of

Lewis' regression specifications. Reder writes, "It is unlikely- that the

effect of unemployment on relative wage rates was constant throughout

the period.   In the 1930's when unemployment was very high, New Deal

legislation and political intervention worked substantially to raise

wages In the unIon sector relative to the non—union, thereby giving a

downward bias to the estimate of the effect of unemployment on the ratio

of union to non—union wages."      We implemented Reder's hypothesis by

creating a dumny variable taking the value of unity from the years 1932

to 1941 inclusive.   Then, first, we added this variable to the vector

      in estimating equation (7) and, second, in addition, we allowed

     to be a function of this dumnr variable. Estimating these equations

left our inferences from Tables 5 and 6 unaltered and the hypothesis

that the effect of unemployment on Bt was the same in the 1930's as in

other decades could not be rejected.-'


B.    Manhours Worked

      The empirical analysis reported above concerned the effect of

unionism on relative wages.?i The results strongly suggest a positive

union—nonunion wage differential although the magnitude of this differ—

ential is not estimated with any useful precision.        Now, according to

one popular characterization of the determination of wages and employ-

ment in unionized markets, any wage increases effected by trade unions

will be associated with decreases in the utilization of the labor

input. Therefore, it seems natural to enquire whether, over the period
                                       —23—




1920—80, movements of total manhours worked in sector a relative to

sector b are negatively associated with movements in the difference in

unionism In the two sectors. For this purpose define            as the effect

on the logarithm of manhours in sector a relative to sector b of an

increase in the difference between sectors a and b in the fraction of

workers unionized.         In other words, what        is to wages,      is to

manhours. Then, consider the following equations which are the manhours

counterparts to equations (6) and (7) above:


(8)
            nEt=iYt+CPt+vit
(9)         £n     =
                       t   +      + cit X) + c2(Pz) + v

where Vit        is a stochastic disturbance term and i        is a vector of

parameters corresponding to the vector of variables Y..             In equation

(8),       is assumed to be a constant        whereas in equation            is

assumed to be a constant C whereas in equation (9)                  varies over

                                              =
time according to the expression                  c0 + c1 £n X + c2Z.i' The
results from estimating equations (8) and (9) to the annual observations

from 1920 to 1980 are presented in Table 7 with the implied values over

time of          for equations (9c) and (9d) given in columns (i) and (ii)

of Table

       In the estimates based on equation (8), unionism exerts a negative

effect on relative manhours worked in three out of four instances. The

coefficient estimates on P vary considerably from equation to equa-

tion and in those equations that allow for first—order serial correla-

tion in the residuals we cannot reject the null hypothesis that there is

no association between Pt and tn Et. The specification of equation

(9b) in Table 7   is   the same as Levis' (l961). In the estimates based on

equation (9), the estimates of the parameters c0, c1, and c2 change a

good deal from equation to equation and often they are not significantly

different from zero.       The implied point estimates of       in Table 8

tend to move in the opposite direction from those for Be__that is, the

manhours effects tend to be most negative in the early 1930's and, if

negative, are close to zero in the late 1970's——but they are almost as

frequently insignificantly different from zero as different from zero on

two—tailed t—tests. Though there are slightly more negative values of

    than positive values in columns (iv) and (v) of Table 8 and though

the negative estimates are greater in absolute value than the positive

estimates, they hardly constitute powerful evidence that unionism has

depressed the level of manhours worked in sector a relative to sector b.



                           IV. Structural   Equations

     The estimates presented in the previous section have been labelled

as those from "descriptive equations" in the sense that they have not

made explicit use of structural labor supply and demand functions. In

fact, Levis did outline a structural model although he did not estimate

all its parameters. The attractive feature of this structural approach

is that, instead of the wage effect of unionism being measured indepen-

dently of the effect of unionism on total manhours worked, the two

effects are estimated as part of a single system of equations.       It is

important to observe that Levis' structural supply and demand model
                                              —27—




assumes that, if trade unions engineer a wage increase, unionized

employers reduce manhours worked by moving back along their labor demand

functions; wages and employment do not lie on the two parties' contract

curve.

           The relative demand function for labor is assumed to take the

following simple form:


                          Zn    =        +
                                    6o                          W

where both              and 2 are expected to be positive.               The manhours

supplied is given by the following equation:


                       £ Et = 10 +           Zn      —     +


where          1 is expected to be positive.             In other words, at Zn W, the

number of manhours supplied in the absence of unionism would be

      +        2n W. However, in the presence of unionism, manhours actually

used fall short of 1 +         1     Zn W by an amount depending upon the size

of the union sector, the magnitude of the relative wage effect, and the

sum       of   the slopes of the log—linear supply and demand functions.           In

accordance with the findings of the previous section, specify Bt as a

function of the inflation variable, Zn X, and the unemployment rate,

Zt:




The equations determining the logarithms of equilibrium wage rates and

equilibrium manhours, Zn             and Zn E, respectively are as follows:

        Consider now the relationship between these equilibrium relative

wages and manhours on the one hand and the observed values of relative

wages and manhours on the other hand. Lewis argued that, even in the

absence of unionism, wage rates in each sector might not adjust to the

same supply and demand conditions (that define their equilibrium values)

at the same rate.                     In this event, transitory- changes in the general

price level (n x) and in unemployment (Z) will induce movements in

the ratio of wage rates in the two sectors relative to their equilibrium

values.-J'        If                      denotes the ratio of wages observed in the two

sectors during year                       t, then this argument concerning the relative

movements in equilibirum and in actual wage rates may be expressed as

follows:

in period t, Et, to the ratio of equilibrium manhours in period t,

According to these estimates, neither the adjustment coefficient in

manhours, A, nor the serial correlation parameter in the manhours

equation, p2 ,    is   significantly different from unity. The elasticity of

the supply of relative manhours with respect to relative wages, y, is

estimated to be 3.21 while the elasticity of the demand for relative

manhours with respect to relative wages, 2' is estimated to be

             As we found in estimating equation (7), the relative wage

effect of unionism falls with increases in the unemployment rate (in

other words, 82 is estimated to have a negative, not a positive, impact

upon L) although             is estimated to be much more sensitive to move-

ments in the inflation variable, £n X, than in unemployment.2J' The

estimated values of           in particular subperiods and averaged over the
                                      —31—




entire 1920—80 period are given in column (iv) of Table 6.            These

estimated values are similar to, although a little lover than, those in

the previous columns. Over the entire 1920—80 period, the relative wage

effect     of unionism (r) averaged l2. percent. The point estimates of

      range widely over the sixty years although for many of these periods

we are not in a position to reject the null hypothesis that Bt is

zero.        Because of our result that Bt        moves inversely with the

inflation variable, £n         once again our estimates imply lower values

of          in the 1970's than in the 1950's and l960's.

          As for the relative manhours effects of unions, the estimates of

     =            are given in column (iii) of Table 8.    By construction,
         _A2t
these estimates of           are highest (in absolute value) in those sub—

periods when the relative wage effects are greatest.Pi However, what

is   most noticeable about these values of         is that only infrequently

(l925_3l) can we reject the null hypothesis that            is significantly

different from zero. This result is consistent with the general infer-

ences from estimating the "descriptive equations" (8) and (9):        while

negative impacts of unionism on relative manhours are often estimated,

these     effects are imprecisely estimated and confident inferences about
         are unwarranted.
          Thus, the inferences from   these structural estimates are in line

with those from the "descriptive equations" in Section III.        There is

strong evidence of a positive relative wage effect of unionism for much

of the period from 1920 to 1980 and our best estimate is that it aver-

aged around 12 percent. This estimate,        however, is not measured with
                                     —32—




much confidence.      There exists less compelling evidence of a negative

effect of unionism on relative manhours worked and the null hypothesis

that there exists no effect of unionism on relative manhours is fre—

q.uently compatible with the evidence.      The proposition that unionism

depressed manhours worked in sector a below those worked in sector b can

be accepted with some assurance only in the late 1920's and early

1930's.



                               V. Conclusions


         The empirical analysis in this paper of the U.S. labor market from

1920 to 1980 leads us to conclude that, for most of this period, there

is strong evidence of a positive impact of unionism on the average wage

of union workers relative to the average wage of nonunion workers. The

magnitude of this impact appears not to have been the same over the
sixty years, but seems to have been larger than average in the early
1930's    and smaller than average in the late 1910's and late 1970's.

However, these relative wage effects are not measured with precision and

a large number of different possible values for the effect of unions on

relative wages are consistent with the evidence.        These conclusions

concerning relative wages (with the obvious exception concerning the

effects in the 1970's) including the imprecision with which the relative

wage impact of unionism is measured duplicate Lewis' findings.

     The aggregate data imply a declining relative wage effect of

unionism from the late 1960's to the late 1970's whereas the evidence

from microeconontic studies tends not to accord with this finding. This
                                  —33—




may indicate that, owing perhaps to the growth of cost—of—living escala-

tor clauses in collective bargaining contracts, the nature of the

relationship associating the relative wage impact with macroeconomic

variables (such as abnormal rates of inflation) changed in the 1960's

and 1970's from the preceding decades.     However, when we allowed for

this possibility, our estimates yielded virtually the same inferences.

Alternatively, this may indicate a mis—specification in the relationship

for the entire period:   if the sort of microeconomic studies that have

been undertaken in the past ten years or so could be conducted with data

on individuals from the 1930's and 19140's, perhaps these also would have

produced estimates at variance with those from the aggregate

It would be tempting to declare the results from the microeconomic

studies as being the correct ones and to dismiss our estimates as being

plagued with aggregation bias, but it should be noted that, if this is

the case, then this means that the point estimates for the 1970's from

the aggregate data tend towards underestimating the true impact of

unionism on relative wages.   In fact, in this literature on unions and

wages, it is more frequently argued that the use of aggregate data

produces an upward biased estimate of the true impact. We conclude that

we do not know why the implications from fitting the equations to the

aggregate time—series data do not agree with those from fitting wage

equations to individual cross—section data in different years.

      Although we are not at all confident about the precise magnitude

of the effect of unionism on relative wages over the years from 1920 to

1980, we are satisfied that a positive effect existed for most of these
years. By contrast, when it comes to the effect of unionism on relative

manhours worked, we are not at all satisfied that the analysis of these

data unambiguously points to a negative effect.        We nre frequently

estimate negative effects of unionism on relative manhours worked than

positive effects, but the estimates are disturbingly sensitive to small

changes in the specification of the estimating equation.        Even when

negative   manhour effects are calculated, our estimated standard errors
do not permit us to make any useful confident statements and quite often
we cannot reject the null hypothesis that unionism has not had any
effect on relative manhours worked.
       A fertile mind can think up a number of explanations for these

results with respect to manhours worked, but one possibility is that

Lewis' characterization of union wage behavior is not appropriate in all

labor markets.      According to Lewis' characterization, the unionized

employer remains on his wage—taking labor demand function so the union's

wage increase is achieved at the expense of a reduction in employment or

manhours worked. This is a popular model of the way in which manhours

are determined in unionized labor markets, but this popularity has not

come about because it has been corroborated in a large number of empir-

ical studies.     On the contrary, there has been little attempt to test

the   empirical relevance of this model. In   fact, by comparison with the

number of studies designed to measure the relative wage impact of

unionism, there have been few attempts to quantify the effects of union-

ism on manhours worked. This is surely an issue that deserves to be the

subject of much   more research.

     In   conclusion, we should like to emphasize that none of our

results in this paper is at variance with Lewis' results and none of

Lewis' judgments has required important qualification or modification.

His research has been shown to possess a durability that few pieces of

scholarship published In economics today are likely to have.     Thus

Reder's conjecture that, as a comprehensive analysis of the relative

wage and employment effects of unionism, Lewis' work would be the best

for a long time   to   come has been confirmed.

      Statistics for providing us with the information to construct our

      series on the number of workers represented by trade unions.

.1/   To provide one comparison, consider the literature emanating from

      Harberger's (1962, 1966) estimates of the incidence of the corpor-

      ation income tax which were published around the same time as

      Lewis' estimates -of the economy—wide relative wage effects of

      unionism. Harberger's procedures and results immediately spawned

      a large literature: the model underlying his estimates was anal-

      yzed extensively, his numerical calculations were checked, and

      other economists determined whether his particular results could

      be produced by other methods. In fact, it transpired that there

      were both arithmetical and conceptual errors in Harberger's anal-

      ysis (see Shoven, 1976). A discussion of this literature may be

      found in Atkinson and Stiglitz (1980).

      This is true, for instance, of the research investigating the con—

      sequences for measuring union relative wage effects of treating

      unionism as an endogenous variable. See Ashenfelter and Johnson

      (1972).

-V    A complete description of our data and of our methods in assem-

      bling the data are contained in the Appendix.
                               —37—




We linked our series to Lewis' series           P2   (i.e., his adjusted

estimates of the fraction unionized where the adjustment coeffi-

cient is 0.5).

This statement rests on a comparison of the membership data and

representation data collected by the CPSs for 1977 to 1980. These

figures were divided by the number of full—time equivalent

employees.    The resulting difference between sector a and sector b

in the fraction of workers who are union members is 0.255 in 1977,

0.2143 in 1978, 0.21414 in 1979, and 0.230 in 1980. By contrast, the

difference between sector a and sector b in the fraction of

workers represented by unions is 0.253 in 1977, 0.2143 in 1978,

0.2145 in 1979, and 0.230 in 1980.           (The fractions presented in

this footnote do not incorporate an adjustment to exclude an

estimate of membership in employee associations.            This is why

neither of the series presented in this footnote corresponds to

the entries for these years in column (vi) of Table 1.          This is

explained more fully   in   the Appendix.)

Thts negative association after 1958 between the fraction union-

ized in sector a and the fraction unionized in sector b forms a

marked contrast with the 1920—58 period: the simple correlation

coefficient between Pa and b over the years 1920—58 is +0.972

while that during the period 1959—80 was —0.859. For the entire

1920—80 period the correlation coefficient between a and

is +0.7143.

.11    The variables whose values for 1958 were changed from those used

       by Lewis were national income originating in the two sectors,

       total manhours worked per year, thousands of workers covered by

       collective bargaining agreements, full—time hours worked per

       worker per year, full—time equivalent employees, and the unemploy—

       ment rate. The values of these variables that we used are given

       If    economic agents form their expectations of prices in an adap-

       tive manner, then p measures the expected price level.

21     When we embarked on our analysis, we employed two series for Z

       in the post—1958 period:                the unemployment rate in the entire

       labor force and the unemployment rate of white men aged 35_1

       years.              The idea here was that, with a growing number of

       "secondary" workers in the labor force in the 1960's and 1970's,

       the overall unemployment rate might incorporate labor force compo-

       sition effects that would render its movements less comparable

       with the movements in the unemployment rate before 1958. In fact,

       the results from using the unemployment rate of white men aged

       35.1 years differed by only a very small amount from those using

       the overall unemployment rate so we retained the latter.

El     The simple correlation coefficient between £n                  and       is

       —0.690 for the years from 1920 to 1958, -1-0.5514 from 1959 to 1980,

       and _o.6141 for the entire period from 1920 to 1980.

-111   Equation (1) is simple identity: £n                   =


       + (1 —                     W =    £n   + (Ln   W —   £n
                       P.)&n

       This is, of course, only one possible meaning of "the relative

       wage effect of unionism." r does not measure the proportional

       difference between the wages of unionized workers and the wages

       these workers would have received in the absence of unionism. For

       a thorough treatment of different concepts, see Lewis (1963),

       Chapter II.

-13]   For instance, the estimates of r in sector a range from 52.8
       percent in equation (3b) to l1.5 percent in equation (3e) whereas

       the estimates of        r   in sector b range from 69.2 percent in

       equation (3c) to a negative value in equation (3e).

       The estimates in equations (6a) and (6b) are similar to Lewis' in

       his Table 58.      We    estimated to the entire 1920—80 period the

       specifications of the equations given in regression numbers 2

       and 4 of Lewis' Table 60 and yielded almost identical results.

       Our one difference occurs when comparing the estimates of B in

       equations (6c) and (6d) of Table )4 with regression number 1 in

       Lewis' Table 62:        our estimate of B for the 1920—80 period is

       almost double Lewis' for the 1920—58 period.      In this instance,

       Lewis' unionism variable is not measured by his P2 series that

       we have used. If we fit the specification given by equation (6e)

       to the 1920—58 period only, the coefficient ° Pt is 0.160 with

       an estimated standard error of 0.055.        This is mnch closer to

       Lewis' estimate.

121 For equations (Ta) and (Tc), for instance, the calculated                   F

        statistics are 13.66 and 10.55 respectively compared with a criti-

        cal value of about 3.2

        For the record, the estimated standard errors of           corresponding

        to Lewis' Table 61 are as follows:           0.05]4 in 1920_214, 0.071 in

        1925—29, 0.122 in 1930_314, 0.130 in 1935—39, 0.086 in 19IL0liIi,

        For instance, for the specifications given by equations (Ta) and
        (Tc) the calculated F statistics are 6.12 and T.85 respectively

        while the critical F is about 3.2.

1J In estimating this more general specification, we find that the

        partial effect of £n X on Bt is less negative in the post—

        1958 period and the partial effect of Z on                 is more nega-

        tive in the post—1958 period by comparison with the pre—1958

        years. With both £n X and Z. higher in the 1970's than in

        the preceding two decades, these two effects on                partially

        offset one another.

12..'   The instruments for           £t               X, and             were as

        follows: a constant term, &n X., Z, a quadratic time trend, the

        peak of the unemployment rate registered in the preceding

        recession,          the    fraction of Democrats    in   the House of
        Representatives, and a dummy variable taking the value of zero

        before 1932 and of unity from 1932 onwards. This last variable is

        designed to reflect the change in the attitude of government and

        the courts towards unionism as signalled first by the Norris—
                            —11—




La Guardia Act. The peak of the unemployment rate in the preced-
ing recession and the fraction of Democrats in the House of Repre-

sentatives were variables used (among others) by Ashenfelter and

Pencavel (1969) to account for the level of unionism in the

econonj in year t conditional upon the level in the year t — 1.

The average value of       for the entire 1920—80 period according

to the specification in equation (Tb) is 0.121 with an estinted

standard error of o.io6.

For instance, interacting this 1930's duinnr    variable   with the

unemployment rate according to the specification in equation (Ta)

and then testing for the joint significance of the coefficients on

these interactions yields a calculated     F    statistic of 2.73

compared with a critical value of 3.18.

We also considered the consequences of specifying a stochastic

component in the determination of B. If this were the case,

then the error term in the estimating equation will not be

homoskedastic, but will be a function of P. The results from

addressing this issue——both those that assume      to be constant

and those that relate        to £n X and Zt__were similar to

those reported in Tables 1 and 5.

Our procedure here is different from Lewis' (1961). He took his

estimated   values of      from fitting the specification given by
equation (Ta) in Table 5 and treated them as if they were observa-

tions on a known, independent, variable. He regressed 2.n
      La         La Eti, and the product of      and      and drew infer-

      ences about the effects of unionism on employment from the esti-

      mated coefficient on

      Lewis estimated his equation in first differences and in none of

      the specifications in Table 7 can the bypothesis that the first—

      order serial correlation parameter is unity be rejected.

      This is a drastic precis of Lewis' argument and we encourage the

      reader to consult pages 213—20 of his book.

      In fact, Lewis specified a different adjustment coefficient in the

      distributed lag on manhours demanded from that on manhours

      supplied. However, if the number of manhours supplied equals the

      number of manhours demanded, as he assumed, there is no way      of
      identifying the two parameters separately.

El!   The Durbin—Watson statistic calculated from the values of
                                                                  u1
      is 1.70 while Durbin's h statistic calculated from the values of

       u2. is 0.93.

      The estimates of this parameter 2 seem to be sensitive to the

      particular specification of the model. For instance, if no serial

      correlation in          and C2t is specified, the estimated value

      of          rises to L.9l4 with an estimated standard error of 0.7I
           *52


      while A falls to 0.37.       Or, in estimating equations (16) and

      (iT), if A is constrained to unity, the estimated value of

      becomes negative, —1.94, with an estimated standard error of 0.80.
                              -j43_




Evaluated at sample mean values of the variables, an increase in
n X by one sample standard deviation (with Z constant at its

mean) reduces the implied value of Bt from 0.117 to —0.050 while

an   increase in Z    by one sample standard deviation (with £n X.

constant    at its mean) reduces the implied value of Bt from 0.117
to 0.092.
The point estimates of         in column (iii) of Table 8 imply the

following values for exp(Ct) which is a        natural index of the
relative    employment effects of unionism: 0.893 in 1920214, 0.835

in 1925—29, 0.7145 in 1930—314, 0.876 in 1935—39, 0.990 in 19140—1414,

1.019 in 19145—149, 0.939 in 1950—514, 0.907 in 1955—59, 0.898 in

1960—614, 0.921 in 1965—69, 0.991 in 1970—714, 1.058 in 1975—80, and

0.921 for the entire 1920—80 period.

Lewis' judgments about the relative wage impact of unionism over

time were not drawn only- from the aggregate data, but also from

the examination of a number of studies of particular industries

and occupations.     These studies, however, bad at their disposal

fewer underlying observations than those that are available on

magnetic tape and that have been the basis of so much work in the

last decade.

Trade Union Representation

      For the years from 1958 to 1980, the only continuous series on

union membership is that from the Bureau of Labor Statistics' (BLS)

survey of unions published in the Directory of National Unions and

Employee Associations. Because this is a biennial survey, data at an

industry level are available not each year, but     every two years and
values for intervening years must be estimated or interpolated. Even

ignoring this problem, the Directory series has a number of features

that render it suspect as reliable information on union membership by

industrial sector.

      First, although the aggregated data that are published distinguish

between union membership within the United States and that abroad (pri—

manly Canada), this distinction is not made at the industrial level.
Moreover, Canadian membership has not remained a constant fraction of

membership of all unions with headquarters in the United States:

whereas in 1958 Canadian union membership represented 5.8 percent of

total membership of unions with headquarters in the U.S., by 1978 this

had risen to 7.1 percent.

      A second problem with the membership data published in the

tory is   that unions are thought to inflate their membership figures to
present   a slightly exaggerated impression of their size. Unemployed and

retired members who are not paying their union dues are often kept on

the union books. The retention of some of the unemployed on the member-

ship rolls is especially relevant to a time—series on union membership
                                 _147_




given that the amplitude of business cycle movements in employment and

working hours in highly unionized industries is much greater than in

less unionized industries.

       These two factors tend to make the Directory figures an exagger-

ated   estimate of the true union membership figures. A third factor
pulls in the opposite direction and this concerns the distinction
between union membership and the coverage of collective bargaining
contracts negotiated by trade unions.     The concept required in the

analysis in the main body of the paper is the compensation of workers

covered by union—negotiated contracts as a proportion of total employee

compensation.   Insofar as this is approximated more closely by the

number of workers covered by collective bargaining contracts as a frac-

tion of all employees, then it is coverage data rather than union mem-

bership data that are to be preferred. Now it is thought that, although

the BLS surveys request information on union membership, some unions

report their representation. Other unions do not, however, and in this

event the reported membership figures may fall short of the coverage

data. Some idea of the importance of this coverage—membership distinc-

tion can be gauged by the information in the first five columns of

Table A which is taken from the May Current Population Surveys (CPS) for

the years 1977, 1978, 1979, and 1980. In each of these years, the CPS

asked the question "Are you a member of a union or employee
association?" and, if the response was "no," then it proceeded with the

question "Is your job covered or represented by a union?" The figures

in the first five columns of Table A present the ratio of union
                                                                   Table A

representation to union membership by industry for the years 1977—80.

The coverage—to—membership ratio is consistently higher in sector b than

in sector a.

      The information collected by the CPS represents the nest accurate

data on union coverage and so, in constructing our time series on the

fraction unionized in sectors a and b over the years 1958—80, we started

with these data for the years 1977—80 and worked backwards to the late

1950's.   These CPS data in 1977—80 contain one problem for our

purposes: in addition to membership in labor unions, they cover member-

ship in employee associations, many of which do not engage in collective

bargaining. These employee associations are in the public administra-

tion and service industries and fortunately the data collected by the

BLS and published in the Directory distinguish between employee asso-

ciation membership and labor union membership. During the years 1977—80

only one Directory was published that provides this breakdown by

industry between employee association membership and trade union member-

ship and this is the Directory relating to 1978.      According to the

Directory, in 1978 there were 5,1150 (thousands) members of labor unions

and 2,6314 (thousands) members of employee associations in the service

industries and government combined. Or labor union membership repre-

sented 67.14 percent (that is, 51450/80814) of total membership in this

broad industrial category.    According to the 1978 Current Population

Survey, total labor union and employee association membership in

services and public administration was 5,818.2 (thousands) so that an

estimate of labor union membership (excluding employee associations) in
                                         —50—




the 1978 CPS is 67.1 percent of 5,818.2 or 3,922.6 (thousands).              As

given in the second column of Table A, the ratio of union coverage to

union membeship in 1978 in services and public administration was 1.2109

so that an estimate of the numbers of workers represented by trade

unions (excluding employee associations) in this sector in 1978 is

1.2109 x 3,922.lL6 =       1,7I9.7   which is entered in the seventh column of

Table A.

      As has    been   mentioned, during the years 1977—80 only the Directory

providing data for 1978 supplies information on employee association

membership and labor union membership separately for different indus-

tries. Hence for the years 1977, 1979, and 1980 for services and public

administration, we multiplied each of the membership figures reported in

the Current Population Surveys (namely, 5,653.3 in 1977, 6,35.7 in

1979, and 6,555.0 in 1980) by 67.1 percent to derive an estimate of

union membership (excluding employee association membership) and then

inflated each figure by the ratio of representation to membership as

given in the first, third, and fourth columns of Table A (namely, 1.217

in 1977, 1.199 in 1979, and 1.2014 in 1980). This procedure yielded the

figures in the sixth, eighth, and ninth columns of Table A, namely,

14,637.6 in 1977, 5.203.9 in 1979, and 5,319.8 in 1980. The numbers of

workers represented by trade unions by broad industry groups as given by

the May    CPSs in   the   years from 1977   to 1980 are given in the final four

columns    of Table A.
                                    —51—




      Before 1977, the CPS asked just one question concerning union

membership,    namely, "Does . . . belong   to a labor union?"-—employee
assocations are not mentioned nor is coverage. The membership data for
the years 1976, 1975, 19714, 1973, 1970,    and 1966 are   given in Table B.
The 1966 CPS provides information on the union membership of private
workers    only.   The 1970 CPS gives data on the membership status of
private workers and government workers separately and the ratio by

industry of all union members to private union members was calculated

from the 1970 data. This ratio was then applied to the private workers

in 1966 in order to derive an estimate of all (private plus government)

union members in 1966. Of the two columns under 1966 in Table B, the

left column provides the data on private union memberships as given in

the 1966 CPS while the right column represents the adjusted figures that

incorporate an estimate of union membership among government workers.

      In order to derive from these membership data in Table B an esti-

mate of the numbers covered by union contracts, we multiplied the

numbers in Table B by the ratios given in the fifth column of Table A

(that is, 1.111 for mining, 1.061 for construction, and so on). These

numbers in the fifth column of Table A represent the ratio by industry

of union coverage to union membership averaged over the four years

1977—80. The resulting estimates by broad industry groups of workers

covered by union contracts in 1966, 1970, and 1973—76 are given in

Table C.

      All the information on union membership and coverage presented so

far has been taken from the CPSs.             However, these Surveys did not

collect information on union membership or union coverage back to the

late 1950's so, in order to extend the series back to those years, we

must rely on the data collected every two years by- the BLS and published

in the Directory of National Unions and Employee Associations. For the

years 1976, 19714, 1970, and 1966, a comparison of the CPS—based esti-

mates of the number of workers covered by trade union contracts as given

in Table C with trade union membership (excluding employee association

membership) as published in the Directory is provided in Table D. Here

the ratios of the representation figures in Table C to the membership

figures published in the Directory show a systematic difference between

sector a         industries    (mining,       construction,   manufacturing,

transportation, communications, and public utilities) and sector b

industries (wholesale and retail trade, finance, insurance, and real

estate, services and public administration, and agriculture, forestry,

and fisheries). Whereas the Directory figures on union membership tend

to exceed (and, sometimes, exceed substantially) the numbers represented

by unions in sector a, the membership figures in the Directory for

sector b industries tend to understate the numbers represented by

unions.     Essentially, our    procedure for generating a series on the
numbers of workers represented by trade unions before 1966 in sectors a

and b was   to   adjust the reported membership data as published in the

Directory by the estimates of the ratio of union representation to union

membership as given in Table D. An account of our precise methods now

follows.

        Note that to this point, estimates of the numbers of workers

represented by trade unions in sectors a and b have been derived for the

years from 1973 to 1980 plus the years 1970 and 1966. Before turning to

the pre—1966 data, consIder filling the holes in the series between 1970

and 1973 and between 1966 and 1970. For the year 1972, we averaged the

1971L and 1970 ratios by industry of union representation to Directory

union nmbership as given in Table D and then multiplied the resulting

average for each industry by the published Directory membership in

1972.    The number of workers represented by trade unions in 1972 as

estimated this way is l2,99)-.9 (thousands) in sector a and 6,308.5

(thousands) in sector b. For 1971, each sector's representation figures

for 1972 and 1970 were averaged: this yielded 13,081.6 (thousands) for

sector a and 6,027.6 (thousands) for sector b. For the year 1968, each

industry's ratio of representation to Directory membership for 1966 and

1970 (as given in Table D) was averaged and then this average ratio for

each industry was then multiplied by the published Directory membership

in 1968. The estimated number of workers represented by trade unions in

1968 is 13,827.3 (thousands) in sector a and 5,632.0 (thousands) in

sector b. For 1969, each sector's representation figures for 1968 and

1970 were averaged, while for 1967 each sector's representation figures

for 1968 were averaged: according to this procedure, sector a's union
                                  —57—




representation was 13,901.0 (thousands) in 1967 and 13,1497.8 (thousands)

in 1969 while the corresponding figures for sector b are 14,791.6

(thousands) in 1967 and 5,689.3 (thousands) in 1969.

      Now consider constructing the series on the number of workers

represented by trade unions in sectors a and b for the years before

1966. Our procedure was to adjust the membership data published every

two years in the Directory by an estimate of the ratio of the number of

workers represented by unions to the number of members reported in the

Directory. For the manufacturing, transport, communications, and public

utilities, and wholesale and retail trade industrial groups, the ratios

we used to adjust the Directry membership figures were a simple average

of the numbers in Table D for 1966, 1970, 19714, and 1976. These ratios

were 0.931 for manufacturing, 0.826 for transport, communications, and

public utilities, and 1.392 for wholesale and retail trade.           The

finance, insurance, and real estate membership data are not distin-

guished from the services and public administration data in the

tory for 1970 and 1966 so for these two industry groups the ratios we

used to adjust the pre—1966 Directory data were computed as averages of

the 19714 and 19T6 numbers in Table D alone.     This yields a ratio of

representation to Directory membership of 5.379 for finance, insurance,

and real estate and of 1.0147 for services and public administration.

Similarly, the union membership data for agriculture, forestry, and

fisheries were not separately identified in the Directry membership for

1966 so for this industry the ratio of union representation to Directory

membership was computed from the 1970, 19714, and 1976 entries of
                                   —58—




Table D.   This yields a ratio for this industrial group of l.b57.

Finally, for mining and construction, we used the ratio of union repre-

sentation to Directory membership as revealed by the 1966 Directory data

alone, namely, 0.751 for mining and 0.823 for construction. The reason

for not using the ratios averaged over the four years for these two

industries in Table D (in which case the ratios would have been 0.667

for mining and 0.T1O for construction) is that the numbers in the 1970's

are heavily influenced by the growing numbers of retired United Mine

Workers' members in the case of mining and by the growth in nonunion

construction in the case of the construction industry. For the purpose

of constructing a series on union representation in the early 1960's and

late 1950's, we suspect that the 1966 data on the ratio of representa-

tion to Directory membership are likely to yield a more accurate esti—

mate of union representation for these two industries than would an

average of the 1966, 1970, 19714, and 1976 ratios.

     With these ratios of union representation to Directory membership,

we then went to the biennial issues of the Directory from 1958 to 1966

and multiplied these ratios by each industry's reported membership

figure in each year. The results when aggregated across industries to

form sectors a and b are shown in columns Ci) and (ii) of Table E. Now

because the ratios of union representation to Directory membership that

we used to adjust the Directory membership data were not based on the

1966 information alone (except for mining and construction), there is no

guarantee that the estimates of numbers represented by unions in 1966

from so adjusting the Directory membership will equal the estimates of

numbers represented by unions in 1966 from the CPSs. Indeed, as given

in Table C, the latter are 13,97i.8 (thousands) for sector a and 3,951.1

(thousands) for sector b, whereas the implied figures for union repre-

sentation in 1966 by adjusting the Directory memberships data (as given

in columns (i) and (ii) of Table E) are 13,212.9 (thousands) for

sector a and 5,153.4 (thousands) for sector b.        Consequently, we then

returned to the pre—1966 data and readjusted sector a's series by unilti—

plying each year's observation by 1.0577         (   13,9714.8/13,212.9) and
readjusted sector b's series by multiplying each year's observation by

0.7670 (=    3,951.1/5,153.1).   The resulting series is given for sector a

in column (iii) of' Table E and for sector b in column (iv) of Table E.

Finally, for the intervening odd numbered years between 1956 and 1966,

the series on numbers of workers represented by trade unions in

columns (iii) and (iv) of Table E were linearly interpolated.           The

numbers so constructed for the years from 1958 to 1980 are given in

Table 1: the estimated numbers of workers covered by union contracts in

sector a are in column (i), those in sector b are in column (ii), and

those in the entire econorxr are in column (iii); column (iv) gives the

numbers in column (i) divided by the number of full—time equivalent

employees in sector a; column (v) gives the numbers in column (ii)

divided by the number of full—time equivalent employees in sector b;

column (vi) is the difference between the numbers in columns (iv) and

those in column (v); and the numbers in column (vii) are those in

column (iii) divided by the total number of full-time equivalent

employees.

         How accurate are these estimates of the numbers represented by

trade unions and how do the estimates in this paper compare with other

estimates? Those estimates computed from the CPSs in the 1970's are

likely to be quite accurate. Those inferred from the published

tory     membership data are likely to contain nontrivial errors of measure—
inent.      We know of no—one else who has tried to calculate a time—series
of    the   number of workers covered by   collective   bargaining contracts in
the    late 1950's and 1960's.     Leo Troy (1969) has carefully compiled

labor union membership data on a consistent basis for the years 1961—66

and the total numbers of workers covered by union contracts as calcu-

lated in this paper average 2.8 percent higher than his membership

data. A differential such as this is to be expected insofar as union

coverage estimates tend to exceed union membership estimates.            If we

were to extend our procedures back to 1956, our implied estimates of the

fraction of workers represented by trade unions are those given in

columns (i) and (ii) of Table F.           Lewis' estimates of the extent of

union membership are given in columns (iv) and (v), (vii) and (viii),

and Cx) and (xi).       Again, for both sectors a and b, Lewis' membership

estimates never exceed and are usually smaller than our representation

estimates.        The variable used in most of the regression analysis,

however, is the arithmetic difference between the fraction unionized in

sectors a and b and a comparison of our estimates of this difference in

column (iii) with Lewis' estimates in columns (vi), (ix), and (xii) will

reveal smaller discrepancies between our estimates and Lewis'. It would

be absurd to pretend that our unionism data so constructed do not

contain serious defects.          They certainly contain errors of unknown

magnitude although it is doubtful whether these errors are greater than

those underlying Lewis' series.          Lewis, of course, was fully aware of

the shortcomings of his own data and, indeed, we may conclude by recoin—

mending the reader consult Lewis' own discussion of these issues——first

pages 258—76 of his book and then pages 198—201.

     Apart from the CPS tapes, the published documents consulted in

preparing these series on union representation are as follows.                  The

issues of the Directory of National Unions and Employee Associations

consisted of Bureau of Labor Statistics Bulletins 2079, 201114, 1937,

1750, 1665, 1596, l493, 1395, 1320, 1267, and 1222. The Directory for

1973 appears not to have been issued as a BLS Bulletin. Also consulted

were U.S. Department of Commerce, Population Characteristics:                  Labor

Union Membership in 1966, Current Population Reports, Series P—20,

No. 216, March 1971; U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor

Statistics, Selected Earnings and Demographic Characteristics of Union

Members, 1970, Report 1117, 1972; and Courtney D. Gifford, ed., Directory

Washington, D.C. 1982.


National Income

      The   national income originating from each of the ten major

industry divisions is to be found in Table 6.3B of the Department of

Commerce's National Income and Product Accounts.                     The figures for

1957—75 are from tAl and those for 1976—80 are from EBI.                  Sector a's

figure for each year is derived by adding the national income
originating in the following industry divisions: mining; construction;

manufacturing; and transportation and public utilities.      Sector b's

figure for each year is derived by adding the national income

originating in the following industry groups: wholesale trade; retail

trade; finance, insurance, and real estate; services; government and

government enterprises except the military; and agriculture, forestry,

and fisheries. To exclude national income originating in the military,

the total compensation of military employees (Table 6.5B) was subtracted

from the government and government enterprises entry.

     The figures thus constructed were linked to Lewis' series as they

appear in his Table 59, page 211, although we linked our numbers to his

1957 figure rather than to his 1958 figure. That is, we replaced his

1958 indices of 1.286 for sector a and 3.923 for sector b with 1.297 and

3.969 respectively.   The reason for this modification was that our

procedures yielded estimates that replicated Lewis' series almost per—

fectly up to and including l957 but they diverged slightly for 1958.

The figures we use reflect the latest adjustments and corrections to the

data and so we are inclined to use our figures for 1958 over Lewis'.

The difference, however, is only slight.    Our series for 1957—80 are

given in columns (vii) and (viii) of Table G and they link up with

Lewis' series in columns (1) and (2) of his Table 59, page 211.

estate; services; government and government enterprises except the

military; agriculture, forestry, and fisheries), average annual full—

time compensation was     computed from national income data by adding to
"wages and salaries per full—time equivalent employee" (Table 6.9B of

the National Income statistical tables) an estimate of supplementary

compensation per full—time equivalent employee. The latter, following

Lewis, was   calculated    by subtracting all annual wages and salaries

(Table 6.6B) from annual total compensation of employees (Table 6.5B)

and then dividing by the number of full—time equivalent employees each

year (Table 6.8B).      (In each case, the figures for the military were

subtracted from the entire government sector.)     Figures for sectors a

and b were calculated as fixed weighted averages of these industry

estimates where the weights are the industry's annual full—time equiva-

lent employment relative to the group's total full—time equivalent

employment over the entire period 1958—80.        (Note that these fixed

weights are not the same as Lewis' fixed weights which were the average

relative employment of each industry over the period 1929—57.)       The

series for the years 1958 to 1975 were taken from [Al below and the

series for the years 1976 to 1980 were taken from EmI below.        With

sector a and b compensation thus constructed, these series were linked

to Lewis' series in Table 5, page 2014, of his book. The series from

1958 to 1980 is given in columns (i) and (ii) of Table G.


Full-Time Hours Worked       Worker p Year
     For each of the ten major industry divisions, annual full—time

hours worked per employee were calculated as the total number of hours
                                 —67—




worked per year by full—time and part-time employees (Table 6.10 of the

National Income statistical tables) divided by the number of full—time

equivalent employees per year (Table 6.8B).   In each year the figures

for the military were subtracted from the government's sector.      The

sector averages were fixed weighted averages of the industry estimates

where the weights are the industry's annual full—time equivalent employ-

ment relative to the group's total full—time equivalent employment over

the entire period 1958—80.   The sources were !cl below for the years

1957—72, (A] (except for the government sector) for 19T3Tl4, (D] for

1975—78, and (B] (except for the government sector) for 1979 where

Table 6.12 provided the hours data. Hours worked and full—time equiva-

lent employees for the military and for the entire government sector in

the years 1973 and 19714 were taken from the issues of the Survey of

Current Business for July 1977 and 1978 respectively. For the govern-

ment sector in 1979, the hours worked of the military seems not to be

available in the regularly published series so for this year it was

inferred by assuming it was the same proportion of the hours worked in

the entire government sector as it was in 1978.

      The sources cited do not provide data for 1980. For this year we

turned to the household data from the CPS which provides information on

average weekly hours worked (of those at work). We assumed that for

each industry the ratio of the Department of Commerce numbers to the CPS

numbers in 1979 remained the same in 1980 so, with the latter data

available in 1980, we can infer the corresponding Department of Commerce

figures for hours worked. The CPS data are published in Employment and
                                    —68—




Earnings, January 1980 and January 1981 (Tables 31 and 32 in both

issues). Because data for mining are not supplied from the CPS, we used

the establishment data (Employment and Earnings, January 1982, Table 3,

page 198).

        With the sector a and b hours worked per employee thus
constructed, these series were linked with Lewis' series in Table 56,

page 206, of his book.      The link was rrade with Lewis' observations on

average hours worked for 1957' not for 1958. That is, we replaced his

1958 indices of 1.088 for sector a and l.215 for sector b with 1.095 and

1.255 respectively. (In fact, our revised values for 1958 yield a ratio

of 0.873 which is virtually the same as Lewis' ratio of O.871.) The

reason for replacing Lewis' values with ours is that we have been able

to make use of revisions in the data series that presumably reflect

improvements in the underlying data.       Our series on hours worked are

listed in columns (iii) and (iv) of Table G.


TOtal   ?.nhours Worked
        For each industry division, total manhours worked is the product
of (a) full—time hours per year per full—time equivalent employee and

(b) the number of full—time equivalent employees. The construction of

(a) has already been discussed. Data on full—time equivalent employees

by industry is from Table 6.8B of [Al for 1957—76 and of [BI for

1977—80.     After each industry's total manhours worked figure is formed,
the sector figure is derived by summing over the constituent industry
                                     —69--




figures.      The implied index numbers of total n.nhours worked per year

are given in columns (v) and (vi) of Table G; these link up with those

given in columns (14) and (5) of Lewis' Table 59, page 211, of his book.


Ratio   of   Actual to Expected Price Level

        The   index used for prices is the implicit price deflator for net
national      product available from Table T.6 of issues of the National

Income and Product Accounts. The series on "expected" prices is calcu—

lated in the same way as Lewis formed it, namely, as a weighted average

of current and past prices with weights declining exponentially from the

current date to earlier dates.       The ratio of actual to expected price

levels that we constructed is given in column (ix) of Table G and it

links up with Lewis' series in column (2) of Table 61, page 218, of his

book.


Uneniploy-nnt    Rate
        The series on the unemployment rate was taken from the Employment
and Training Report of the President, 1981, Table A—i, page 119,   and   was

linked   up in 1957 with Lewis' series in column (1) of Table 61, page 218

of his book. The series is presented in column (x) of Table G.
