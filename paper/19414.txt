The Time for Austerity: Estimating the Average Treatment Effect of Fiscal Policy

                                           ABSTRACT

After the Global Financial Crisis a controversial rush to fiscal austerity followed in many countries.
Yet research on the effects of austerity on macroeconomic aggregates was and still is unsettled, mired
by the difficulty of identifying multipliers from observational data. This paper reconciles seemingly
disparate estimates of multipliers within a unified and state-contingent framework. We achieve
identification of causal effects with new propensity-score based methods for time series data. Using
this novel approach, we show that austerity is always a drag on growth, and especially so in depressed
economies: a one percent of GDP fiscal consolidation translates into a loss of 4 percent of real GDP
over five years when implemented in a slump, rather than just 1 percent in a boom. We illustrate our
findings with a counterfactual evaluation of the impact of the UK government’s shift to austerity
policies in 2010 on subsequent growth.

       I solemnly affirm and believe, if a hundred or a thousand men of the same age, same tempera-
       ment and habits, together with the same surroundings, were attacked at the same time by the
       same disease, that if one half followed the prescriptions of the doctors of the variety of those
       practicing at the present day, and that the other half took no medicine but relied on Nature’s
       instincts, I have no doubt as to which half would escape. – Petrarch, letter to Boccaccio, 1364


       The boom, not the slump, is the right time for austerity at the Treasury. – J. M. Keynes, 1937


In 1809 on a battlefield in Portugal, in a defining experiment in epidemiological history,
a Scottish surgeon and his colleagues attempted what some believe to have been the first
recognizable medical trial, a test of the effectiveness of bloodletting on a sample of 366
soldiers allocated into treatment and control groups by alternation. The cure was shown
to be bogus. Tests of this sort heralded the beginning of the end of premodern medicine,
vindicating skeptics like Petrarch for whom the idea of a fair trial was a mere thought ex-
periment. Yet, even with alternation, allocation bias—i.e., “insufficient randomization”—
remained pervasive in poor experimental designs (e.g., via foreknowledge of assignment)
and the intellectual journey was only completed in the 1940s with the landmark British
Medical Research Council trials of patulin and streptomycin. Ever since the randomized
controlled trial has been the foundation of evidence-based medicine.1
    Is a similar evidence-based macroeconomics possible and what can it learn from this
noble scientific tradition? Ideas from the experimental approach bridge medicine, epi-
demiology, and statistics, and they have slowly infected empirical economics, although
mostly on the micro side.2 In this paper we delve into the experimental toolkit so as to
re-examine a key issue for macroeconomics, the need to ensure treatments are somehow
re-randomized in non-experimental data. We do this in the context of the foremost aca-
demic and policy dispute of the day—the effects of fiscal policy shocks on output (see,
in particular, Alesina and Ardagna 2010; Guajardo, Leigh, and Pescatori 2014).3
   1 See  Chalmers (2005, 2011), who discusses Petrarch, bloodletting, and the MRC clinical trials.
   2 Angrist   and Pischke (2010) judge that “progress has been slower in empirical macro.” The fear that
standard empirical practices would not work, especially for aggregate economic questions, goes back a
long way, at least to J. S. Mill (1836), who favored a priori reasoning alone, arguing that: “There is a
property common to almost all the moral sciences, and by which they are distinguished from many of the
physical; this is, that it is seldom in our power to make experiments in them.”
    3 Ironically enough, fiscal policy debates are now littered with medical metaphors. In 2011 German

Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble wrote in The Financial Times, that “austerity is the only cure for the
Eurozone”; while Paul Krugman, at The New York Times, likened it to “economic bloodletting’. In the FT,
Martin Wolf, cautioned that “the idea that treatment is right irrespective of what happens to the patient
falls into the realm of witch-doctoring, not science.” Martin Taylor, former head of Barclays, put it bluntly:
“Countries are being enrolled, like it or not, in the economic equivalent of clinical trials.”



                                                      1
    Identification of the effects of fiscal consolidation in empirical studies has broadly
taken one of two forms. In the context of a vector autoregression, one option is to
achieve identification based on exclusion restrictions. In practice, these restrictions are
roughly equivalent to a regression-control strategy based on a limited number of ob-
servable controls, and (usually) a linear conditional mean assumption. Examples of this
strand of the literature include Alesina and Perotti (1995); Perotti (1999); and Mountford
and Uhlig (2009). The other strand of the literature has approached the identification
problem through instrumental variables. Examples of this approach include Auerbach
and Gorodnichenko (2012, 2013), Mertens and Ravn (2013, 2014), and Owyang, Ramey
and Zubairy (2013).
    Following a new and arguably more promising direction, we take a third fork on the
road to identification based on the Rubin Causal Model. This approach has the attractive
features of being semiparametric (and hence flexible with respect to the functional form),
providing better control for observables, and offering a more reliable alternative when
the putative instrumental variables for policy action are themselves possibly endogenous.
Tests of instrument validity are well-known to have low power (see, e.g. Cameron and
Trivedi 2005) but, more importantly, formal testing is not an option when we are in the
case of exact identification.
    We find that, on average, fiscal consolidations generate a drag on GDP growth. The
effect is also state dependent: if a 1 percent of GDP fiscal consolidation is imposed in a
slump then it results in a real GDP loss of around 4 percent over five years, rather than
just 1 percent in a boom. We arrive at this conclusion by carefully constructing an encom-
passing framework that allows us to evaluate the type of approach followed by several
recent papers in the literature (to be discussed in detail shortly) to improve comparabil-
ity with the methods we introduce in this paper. In addition to accommodating existing
methods, the framework allows us to address the identification concerns we uncover via
the application of an estimator from the family of “doubly robust” augmented inverse-
propensity-score weighted regression adjustment methods (Robins, Rotnizky, and Zhao
1994; Robins 1999; Scharfstein, Rotnitzky, and Robins 1999; Hirano, Imbens, and Ridder
2003; Lunceford and Davidian 2004; Imbens 2004; Glynn and Quinn 2010).
    To provide more texture to our results, we evaluate the UK austerity program im-
plemented by the Coalition government after the 2010 election. The Global Financial
Crisis struck the US and the UK in a similar way and these economies ran on parallel
trajectories until 2010. Thereafter the UK experienced a second slowdown while the US
continued to grow. Using our estimates we compute how much of the slowdown could
be attributed to the austerity program; we find it to be a very significant contribution (ris-


                                              2
ing to 3.4% of GDP in 2013) and larger than official estimates. Thus, better models, with
state-dependent features, could improve official fiscal policy analyses going forward.


                      1.    The Austerity Debate: A Road Map

Are fiscal consolidations expansionary, neutral, or contractionary? In order to answer
this question, and understand the different answers the literature has arrived at so far,
we proceed in a series of incremental stages.
    First, we use the OECD annual panel dataset adopted in two recent high-profile
yet seemingly irreconcilable studies. The “expansionary austerity” idea has come to
be associated with the paper by Alesina and Ardagna (2010, henceforth AA) an idea
perhaps dating back to at least Giavazzi and Pagano (1990). On the opposite side, the
IMF team of Guajardo, Leigh, and Pescatori (2014, henceforth GLP) reached the opposite
conclusion of “contractionary austerity.” By juxtaposing these two papers we are not
implying that the literature falls evenly or comprehensively within these two camps. We
use the contraposition as a rhetorical device much like Perotti (2013), who presents a
lucid discussion of the empirical pitfalls in this research area.
    Second, we use (Jordà 2005) local projections (LPs), rather than structural vector auto
regressions (SVARs). The reason is that, among other advantages that we will discuss
momentarily, LPs are a convenient pedestal on which all extensions of existing estima-
tion methods can rest. The unified framework provides the reader a way to compare the
results across a set of nested estimation strategies.
    LPs provide a flexible semi-parametric regression control strategy to estimate dy-
namic multipliers and include, as a special case, impulse responses calculated with an
SVAR. LPs accommodate possibly nonlinear, or state-dependent responses easily, and
indeed we find that the effects of fiscal policy can be very different in the boom and
the slump, as emphasized by Keynes in the 1930s. State-dependent multipliers based on
LPs have been taken up in some very recent papers (Auerbach and Gorodnichenko 2012,
2013, for the US and OECD; Owyang, Ramey, and Zubairy 2013, for the US and Canada).
Other recent papers on state-dependent multipliers, using various measures of slack, in-
clude Barro and Redlick (2011) and Nakamura and Steinsson (2014). For a critical survey
see Parker (2011). Long ago, Perotti (1999) explored the idea of “expansionary austerity”
with state-dependent multipliers.
    We calculate the impact of fiscal policy shocks based on LPs using the AA measure
of policy, the change in the cyclically-adjusted primary balance (d.CAPB).4 When we
  4 The   d.CAPB measure used by AA is based on Blanchard (1993). The construction of this variable


                                                 3
restrict attention to “large” shocks (changes in CAPB larger in magnitude than 1.5% of
GDP, which is the benchmark cutoff value used by AA and proposed earlier by Alesina
and Perotti 1995), we replicate the “expansionary austerity” result. However, when we
condition on the state of the economy, we find that this result is driven entirely by what
happens during a boom. The expansionary effects of fiscal consolidation evaporate when
the economy is in a slump.
    Third, we then use instrumental variable (IV) estimation of the LPs to account for
unobserved confounders. Specifically, we instrument the cyclically-adjusted primary
balance using the IMF’s narrative measure of an exogenous fiscal consolidation in GLP.
This type of “narrative-based identification” has been applied by, e.g., Mertens and Ravn
(2013, 2014), Ramey and Shapiro (1998), and Romer and Romer (1989, 1997). Our IV
estimation then turns out to replicate the flavor of the GLP results: austerity is contrac-
tionary, and strongly so in slumps.
    Fourth, we show that the proposed IMF narrative instrumental variable has a signif-
icant forecastable element driven by plausible state variables, such as the debt-to-GDP
level, the cyclical level or rate of growth of real GDP, and the lagged treatment indicator
itself (since austerity programs are typically persistent, multi-year affairs).5 Formal test-
ing of instrument validity is not possible since we have exact (not over-) identification.
However, the evidence that we provide calls into question the validity of the narrative
instrumental variable. As noted above in the history of medicine, and as with any ef-
forts to construct a narrative policy variable that is exogenous, one has to worry about
the possibility that treatment is still contaminated by endogeneity, which would impart
allocation bias to any estimates.6
    Fifth, in order to purge remaining allocation bias we use inverse probability weight-
ing (IPW) estimation based on a prediction model of the narrative policy variable to
estimate the LP responses. We consider the IMF narrative policy variable as a “fiscal
treatment”—i.e., a binary indicator rather than a continuous variable—and we are inter-
ested in characterizing a dynamic average treatment effect (ATE). In new work, Angrist,
Jordà, and Kuersteiner (2013) introduce IPW estimators in a time series context to cal-
culate the dynamic ATE responses to policy interventions. We follow a slightly differ-
ent approach using augmented regression-adjusted estimation instead, denoted AIPW,
consists of adjusting for cyclical fluctuations using the unemployment rate.
   5 The potential endogeneity of fiscal consolidation episodes has been noted by other authors. For

example, Ardagna (2004) uses political variables as an exogenous driver for consolidation in a GLS simul-
taneous equation model of growth and consolidation for the period 1975–2002. Hernández De Cos and
Moral-Benito (2013) use economic variables as instruments.
   6 For example, in the debate over the use of narrative methods to assess monetary policy, see the

exchange between Leeper (1997) and Romer and Romer (1997).


                                                   4
which combines inverse probability weighting with regression control and adjusts the
estimator to achieve semi-parametric efficiency (see, e.g., Lunceford and Davidian 2004).
Our AIPW estimator falls into the broad class of “doubly robust” estimators of which
Robins, Rotnitzky, and Zhao (1994) is perhaps the earliest reference (see also Robins 1999;
Scharfstein, Rotnitzky, and Robins 1999; Hirano, Imbens, and Ridder 2003; Lunceford
and Davidian 2004; Imbens 2004; Glynn and Quinn 2010). The “doubly robust” property
means that consistency of the estimated ATE can be proved in the special cases where
either the propensity score model and/or the conditional mean is correctly specified;
Monte Carlo evidence also suggests that the estimator performs better than alternatives
even in more general cases too.
    The remainder of the paper expands on each of these stages in turn.


         2. Replicating Expansionary Austerity: OLS Results

Our first estimates use OLS estimation with the LP method, based on what is the tra-
ditional variable in the literature, the change in the cyclically adjusted primary balance
(denoted d.CAPB), the same variable used by Alesina and Perotti (1995) and by AA, and
used as a reference point by GLP in the IMF study. The local projection is done from year
0, when a policy change is assumed to be announced, with the fiscal impacts first felt
in year 1, consistent with the timing in GLP. The LP output forecast path is constructed
out to year 5, and deviations from year 0 levels are shown, and also the sum of these
deviations, or “lost output” across all of those five years.
    To create a benchmark estimating equation that mimics the standard setup in the
literature, the typical LP equation that we estimate has the form

          yi,t+h − yi,t = αih + Λh Di,t+1 + βhL0 ∆yi,t + βhL1 ∆yi,t−1 + βhC yi,t
                                                                             C
                                                                                 + vi,t+h ,   (1)

for h = 1, ..., 5, and where yi,t+h − yi,t denotes the cumulative change from time t to
t + h in 100 times the log of real GDP, the αih are country-fixed effects, and Di,t denotes
the d.CAPB policy variable (measured from time t to time t + 1 given the assumed
timing of the announcement and implementation of fiscal plans). Finally, to control for
reversion to the potential output trend, the term yi,t C is the output gap, denoting the

cyclical component of GDP, and it is proxied here by deviations of log real GDP from an
HP trend estimated with a smoothing parameter of λ = 100. We use the subscripts L0
and L1 for the β parameters associated to ∆yi,t−l for l = 0, 1 so as not to confuse them
with the j = 1, 0 treatment-control index that we will use later.

    Our choice of using the HP filter with λ = 100 was justified by a series of experi-
ments undertaken with US postwar data (from FRED) which showed that a relatively
high smoothing parameter was needed if the proposed proxy series (HP filtered log
real GDP) was to come close to matching the official CBO output gap series. We also
replicated this type of analysis using a bandpass filter tuned to various frequencies, and
the conclusions were very similar. That is to say, we found that the conventional filter
frequencies typically used in the business cycle literature are too low to provide a good
match with the output gap, which is what we want in our model so as to control for
reversion to trend. These experiments are available from the authors upon request.
    The specification (1) nests the main elements in AA and GLP to facilitate compar-
isons of our results with theirs. The coefficient Λh from expression (1) is the parameter
governing the impact of the continuous policy treatment measured by d.CAPB and cor-
responds to the constrained version of expression (7) below in Section 5, where we have
rearranged that expression to get a direct estimate of the average response to policy
intervention Λh from the regression output, but it is otherwise specified the same way.
    Table 1 reports estimates based on expression (1). Estimated log real GDP impacts
(× 100) for each year are reported in columns 1 to 5, and the 5-year sum of the devia-
tions in final column 6. In parallel with the main result in AA, although the effects are
economically modest, the data appear to support the notion that fiscal consolidation can
be expansionary (especially in the first two years), although the cumulative effect over a
five year period is small and negative. If we focus on multiplier estimates based on large
consolidations (i.e., changes in CAPB larger than 1.5 percent of GDP using the Alesina
and Perotti (1995) and AA cutoff value), then the results are almost identical. Small
consolidation packages have a small effect on output, but the estimates are imprecise.

                                                    6
    Would the picture change much if we broke down the analysis of the impact of con-
solidation as a function of whether the economy is experiencing a boom or a slump?
Estimation was next carried out on two bins of the data to allow responses to be state
dependent. We sort on the sign of yC , the time-0 output gap (HP filtered) into “boom”
and “slump” bins, to capture conditions at time 0 varying across the cycle. This parti-
tion places just over 200 observations in each of the “boom” and “slump” bins, given the
AA-GLP combined dataset with about 450 observations in total, after allowing for ob-
servations lost due to lags. Note that this partition is meant to provide a more granular
statistical summary of the main features of the data. We are not arguing whether or not
a boom or a slump is more likely under a particular choice of fiscal policy or another.
    Table 2 shows OLS estimated responses using expression (1) by sorting the data into
these two bins. Panel (a) shows the estimated response coefficient at year h based on
values of d.CAPB common to the AA and GLP datasets. Panel (b) shows results when
we estimate separate response coefficients for “large” and “small” changes in d.CAPB,
following the 1.5% of GDP cutoff value employed by Alesina and Perotti (1995) and by
AA. These distinctions prove to be relatively unimportant since, as can be seen, all of the
action is driven by “large” changes, with similar coefficients on the “large” changes in
panel (b) and all changes in panel (a). In panel (b), the coefficients for “small” changes
are small and not statistically significant at conventional levels. This is similar to what
we found in Table 1.
    The results are reasonable and consistent with the literature, and particularly the
GLP replication of the AA-type results. The OLS estimates suggest that fiscal austerity
is expansionary, since the only statistically significant coefficients are ones that have a
positive sign. However, our stratification of the results by the state of the cycle at time 0
brings out a new insight, and shows that this result is entirely driven by what happens in
booms. It is only in the boom that we find a significant positive response of real GDP to
fiscal tightening, with a coefficient or “multiplier” (the more general usage of the term,
which we follow in the remainder of the paper) of nearly 0.25 in years 1 and 2. Over 5
years the sum of these effects is small, near 0.15. In the slump, the estimate of the policy
response is not statistically different from zero and in many cases it is negative.


         3. Replicating Contractionary Austerity: IV Results

One widely shared concern with the OLS estimates just discussed is that the policy mea-
sure d.CAPB may be highly imperfect for the job. It likely suffers from both measure-
ment error and endogeneity. A recent frank discussion of the measurement problems

the cyclical component of log y (log real GDP), from HP filter with λ = 100. Additional controls: cyclical
component of y, 2 lags of change in y, country fixed effects. The boom bin is for observations where the
cyclical component yC is greater than zero, the slump bin is for observations where the cyclical component
is less than or equal to zero. Large consolidations means larger than 1.5% of GDP; small means less than
or equal to 1.5% of GDP.


with this concept is presented by Perotti (2013). Moreover, to disentangle the true cyclical
component of this variable from the observed actual level outcome has to rely on model-
ing assumptions about the sensitivity of taxes and revenues to the cycle—effects which
may be only imprecisely estimated, and which may not be stable over time or across
countries. If that attempt at purging the cyclical part of the variable still leaves some
endogenous variation in d.CAPB, then the implicit assumption of exogeneity needed for
a causal estimate and policy analysis would be violated.
   One potential solution therefore is to seek a different and more direct measure of
underlying fiscal policy change, using the so-called “narrative approach” (Romer and
Romer 1989). This was the arduous strategy adopted by the IMF’s GLP study, which

went back over the history of 17 OECD countries and estimated the timing and magni-
tude of fiscal policy shocks on a year-by-year basis, based on documentary evidence from
each country concerning the policies enacted since the 1970s. GLP focused exclusively
on fiscal consolidation episodes, where authorities sought to reduce their budget deficit,
and they sought events that were not reactions to the contemporaneous or prospective
economic conditions, so that they could claim plausible exogeneity. We employ the IMF
narrative measures in two ways: much of time we use an indicator of a fiscal treatment
(denoted Treatment) which is simply a country-year event binary 0-1 dummy that shows
when a consolidation is taking place; the other variable of interest is the IMF’s estimate of
the magnitude of the consolidation measures in that year as a percent of GDP (denoted
Total), and which provides a scaled measure of that year’s austerity package.
    To bring this IMF approach into our framework, and consistent with our OLS repli-
cation of the AA results above, we present in Tables 3, and 4 our IV estimates which
make use of the IMF narrative variable. We reestimate expression (1) using the IMF
dates of fiscal consolidations as both binary and continuous instruments. This approach
is parallel to the approach in Mertens and Ravn (2013, 2014) for the US and based on
Stock and Watson (2012). If the IMF approach is correct and has found truly exogenous
shocks to fiscal policy, then it would be a valid instrument for d.CAPB. It would also be
a potentially strong instrument: the raw correlation between d.CAPB (year 1 versus year
0) and Treatment (in year 1) is 0.31, and a bivariate regression has an F-statistic of over
50; the same applies when Treatment is replaced by Total (in year 1).

    We begin by reestimating the full sample specification reported in the top panel of
Table 1 using instrumental variables in two ways. First we use the IMF narrative vari-
ables on dates of fiscal consolidation as a binary instrument (first row). Second, for a
continuous IV we use the size of the consolidation identified by the IMF (second row).
The results are reported in Table 3. Strikingly, the message here completely overturns
the findings in Table 1. This is of course a well known problem, consistent with the
pronounced divergence between the AA and GLP results. Fiscal consolidation is unam-
biguously contractionary. Using the sum of coefficients reported in column (6) of Table
3, for every 1% in fiscal consolidation, the path of real GDP is pushed down by over 0.57
percent each year on average over the five subsequent years. This result is not sensitive
to whether we use the binary or continuous instrument.
    The previous section broke down the analysis as a function of whether the economy
is in a boom or a slump. For completeness and as a check that the IV results in Table 3
are robust, we reproduced much of the analysis in Table 2 using instrumental variables
based on the binary version of the IMF narrative variable. These results are reported in
Table 4. Almost identical results (not shown) arise when the continuous IV is used, so
the precise choice of IV makes very little difference to the overall message.
    The IV-based responses suggest that austerity is contractionary since the only statis-
tically significant coefficients here have a negative sign. However, stratification by the
state of the cycle shows that this result is now driven by what happens in slumps. It is


                                                   10
only in the slump bin that we find a significant negative response of real GDP to fiscal
tightening. In Table 4 we find a coefficient or “multiplier” of between -0.25 and -0.95 in
years 1 to 5. Over five years the sum of these effects is -3.35∗∗ , so the average loss for a
1% of GDP fiscal consolidation is to depress the output level by about -0.67% per year
over this horizon.


   4.   Endogenous Austerity: Is the Narrative Instrument Valid?

So far we have briefly replicated the current state of the literature, but this is not entirely
pointless. It serves to show that the LP framework can capture different sides of the
debate in a uniform empirical design, on a consistent data sample, allowing us to focus
on how differences in estimation and identification assumptions lead to different results.
It also shows how the LP estimation method makes it very easy to allow for nonlinearity
and do a stratification of results; here we found significant variations in responses across
bins designed to capture variations in the state of the economy from boom to slump. We
found that indeed fiscal impacts vary considerably across these states in a manner that
is intuitive and not unexpected: the output response to fiscal austerity is less favorable
the weaker is the economy. Does this mean that Keynes was right?
    Before drawing any conclusions we evaluate whether the IMF narrative variable
might be a legitimate instrument. Have we identified the causal effect of fiscal consoli-
dations on output? We cannot formally test the validity of the IMF narrative instrument
since the LPs are just identified. However, if the IMF’s narrative variable can be predicted
by excluded controls, and those controls are correlated with the outcome, at a minimum
the excluded controls should be added to the regression. At worst, predictability points
to having failed to resolve the allocation bias in our estimates—episodes of consolidation
identified by the IMF might be simply an endogenous response by the fiscal authority.
This possible shortcoming of the “narrative identification” strategy has been noted be-
fore in the context of monetary policy (Leeper 1997) and we have the same concern here.
To address this issue we report three diagnostic tests in this section in Tables 5, 6, and 7.
    In the ideal randomized controlled trial, with treatment and control units allocated
randomly, the probability density function of each of the controls in X would be the same
for each subpopulation—there would be perfect overlap between the two subpopulation
densities. For example, the distribution of debt to GDP ratios would be similar in the
subpopulation of narrative IMF fiscal consolidations and the subpopulation of all other
observations. A simple way to check for this balance condition, as it is often referred to in
the literature, is to do a test of the equality of the means across subpopulations. Notice

that the balance condition also lies behind the implicit assumption that one can estimate
the LP by restricting the coefficient of the controls to be the same for the treatment
and control groups, an observation that we discuss in detail in Section 5. The balance
condition is evaluated in Table 5 for several potentially important macroeconomic control
variables included in expression (1). The null hypothesis of balance is rejected for all of
them, strongly suggesting that the IMF narrative dates are not truly exogenous events.
    We go beyond this simple check and perform two additional tests. First, we check if
the outcome is predictable by a set of available controls not yet included in the analysis.
To be clear, the original AA and GLP papers do include in their analysis a robustness
check that includes other controls. However, the controls they consider are typically
related fiscal variables rather than the set of macroeconomic controls we consider here.
    In Table 6 we report the results of such tests by reexamining whether our candidate
model in expression (1) admits as additional explanation the following variables: real
GDP growth; real private loan growth; CPI inflation; the change in the investment to
GDP ratio; the short-term interest rate on government securities (usually 3-months in
maturity); the long-term rate on government securities (usually 5–10 year bonds); and
the current account to GDP ratio. The first 3 variables are expressed as 100 times the log
difference. In all cases, we consider the value of the variable and one lag. The tests are
conducted with the 1-period ahead local projection (the equivalent of the corresponding
equation in a VAR) using the full sample according to expression (1).
    The objective is to set a higher bar for the possibly omitted regressors to be signifi-
cant. Partitioning the sample into the growth bins we used earlier could generate spuri-
ous findings since the tests would rely on a smaller sample. Table 6 reports the p-value
associated with the joint null that the candidate variable and its lag are not significant.
A rejection means that output fluctuations could be due to reasons other than the fiscal
treatment variable. The message is clear: most of the excluded controls are highly signif-
icant. For now, a cautious interpretation is to view these findings as a source of concern
rather than conclusive evidence that the multipliers reported earlier are incorrect.

    Next we check for another condition: Do excluded controls predict fiscal consolida-
tions? Table 7 asks whether variation in the IMF binary treatment variable identified
by GLP can be predicted. The results indicate that we have a reasonable basis for this
concern. This is a set of estimated treatment equations, where we use a pooled probit
estimator to predict the IMF fiscal consolidation variable in year 1, presumptively an-
nounced at year 0, based on state variables at time 0. As shown in the appendix, our
later results are robust to alternative binary classification models such as pooled logit,
and fixed-effects probit and logit with controls for global time-varying trends.
    Table 7 shows in column (1) that treatment is more likely, as expected, when public
debt to GDP is high: the coefficient is positive, meaning that governments tend to pur-
sue austerity when debt has run up. In column (2) we add yC (the output gap) and the
growth rate of y to further condition on the state of the economy: when the economy is
growing below potential, there is an increase in the likelihood of consolidation. More-
over, austerity is more likely to be pursued when growth slows, in stark contrast to what
common-sense textbook countercyclical policy suggests. But this finding is in line with
contemporary experience in Europe and the UK, although all of the sample data we use
here are pre-crisis. Thus, the act of engaging in pro-cyclical fiscal policy is not a new-
fangled craze but more of a chronic tendency in advanced countries. Finally, columns (3)
and (4) add the lag of the dependent variable Treatment and this has a highly significant
coefficient: as we know from the raw data series generated by the IMF study, the fiscal
consolidation episodes are typically long, drawn-out affairs, so once such a program is
started it tends to run for several years. Being in treatment today is thus a good predictor
of being in treatment tomorrow. In these last two columns the lagged growth rate rather
than the cyclical level of output emerges as the slightly better predictor of treatment.

    Further confirmation of the predictive ability of these treatment regressions is pro-
vided by the AUC statistic.7 The AUC is commonly used in biostatistics and machine
learning to evaluate classification ability (see, e.g. Jordà and Taylor 2011). Under the
null that the covariates have no classification ability, AUC = 0.5. Perfect classification
ability corresponds to AUC = 1. The AUC has an approximate Gaussian distribution in
large samples. Table 7 measures the classification ability of each specification. The AUC
statistics show that the probits have very good predictive ability, with AUC around 0.65
when lagged treatment is omitted (Column 2), and over 0.8 when lagged treatment is
included (Columns 3 and 4). The AUCs are all significantly different from 0.5.
    The key lesson from Table 7 is simply that the IMF variable has a significant fore-
castable component.8 The question, then, is how to deal with the problem of potentially
endogenous instruments. The remainder of this paper provides one answer.
   7 AUC stands for area under the curve. The curve usually refers to the Receiver Operating Characteristic

curve or ROC curve. It also refers to the Correct Classification Frontier, as in Jordà and Taylor (2011).
   8 Hernández De Cos and Moral-Benito (2013) have arrived at a similar conclusion. Their proposed

solution to the lack of exogeneity problem is to use an instrumental variable approach. Instruments rely
on data for pre-determined controls and on past consolidations. Since data on pre-determined controls
already appear in the specification of previous studies (AA, GLP, etc.), the key question is whether past
consolidation data predict current consolidation episodes. Fixed-effect panel estimation already takes into
account heterogeneity in the unconditional probability of consolidation across countries. Take Australia
as an example. It is unlikely that the consolidation observed in 1985 helps determine the likelihood of
consolidation in year 1994 beyond the observation that Australia may consolidate more or less often than
the typical country (already captured by the fixed effect). There may be little gained from the point of
view of strengthening the identification.

                                5.    Statistical design

The previous section raises concerns that the narrative IMF variable could be an in-
valid instrument using three different checks. The empirical strategy that we propose
is based on taking triple insurance against this potential endogeneity. First, we take the
episodes of consolidation from the IMF narrative variable as the subset of all consolida-
tion episodes that are a candidate for random allocation. Think of it as a pseudo-IV step.
Second, we include the extended set of covariates from Tables 6 and 7 and add them
as right hand side variables in the LP of expression 1. Third, we use inverse propensity
score weighting on this LP to re-randomize allocation of the IMF fiscal consolidation
events.
     In order to facilitate the exposition we momentarily drop the cross-sectional country
index in the panel. Denote, as before, yt the outcome variable of interest, the log of
real GDP. In other applications yt could be a k y -dimensional vector. Let Dt denote the
fiscal policy variable. Dt will now be a discrete random variable Dt ∈ {0, 1} based on
the IMF narrative indicator of exogenous fiscal consolidations, although earlier it was
the continuous d.CAPB variable. The methods that we present next can be extended to
settings in which the policy variable takes on a small number of discrete values. Next
we allow for a k w -dimensional vector of variables, wt that are not included in the vector
yt , but which could be relevant predictors of the policy variable Dt . Finally, denote Xt
the rich conditioning set given by ∆yt−1 , ∆yt−2 , ...; Dt−1 , .Dt−2 , ...; and wt .
     We assume that policy is determined by Dt = D ( Xt , ψ, ε t ) where ψ refers to the
parameters of the implied policy function and ε t is an idiosyncratic source of random
variation. Therefore, D ( Xt , ψ, .) refers to the systematic component of policy determina-
tion.
     To make further progress at this point we will borrow from definition 1 in Angrist,
Jordà, and Kuersteiner (2013, henceforth AJK). This defines potential outcomes given by
  ψ
yt,h (d) − yt as the value that the observed outcome variable yt+h − yt would have taken
if Dt = d for all ψ ∈ Ψ and d ∈ D . In our application, the difference yt+h − yt refers to
the cumulative change in the outcome from t to t + h and d = 0, 1. The horizon h can be
any positive integer.
     The causal effect of a policy intervention is defined as the unobservable random
variable given by the difference (yt,h (1) − yt ) − (yt,h (0) − yt ). Notice that yt is only used
to benchmark the cumulative change and it is observed at time t. We assume that the
parameters of the policy function do not change.
     Following AJK, we can state the selection-on-observables assumption (or the condi-


                                               15
tional ignorability or conditional independence assumption as it is sometimes called) as

             ψ
           (yt,h (d) − yt )⊥ Dt | Xt ; ψ     for all h > 0, and for d ∈ D , and ψ ∈ Ψ.               (2)

That is, the treatment-control allocation is independent of potential outcomes given the
variables or controls Xt . This condition does not imply that there is no effect of policy on
the outcome given controls. We are simply stating that conditional on controls, policy
allocation is independent of the potential outcome, whatever that might be.
    Consider the ideal randomized experiment to understand the role that the conditional
independence assumption plays. The average causal effect of policy intervention on the
outcome at time t + h given by

                                 E [(yt,h (1) − yt ) − (yt,h (0) − yt ))]

could be simply calculated using group means as

                     1                          1
    Λ̂hGroupMean =        ∑ Dt (yt+h − yt ) − n0 ∑(1 − Dt )(yt+h − yt )             for all h > 0,   (3)
                     n1   t                         t

where n1 = ∑t Dt and n0 = ∑t (1 − Dt ) are the number of observations in treatment and
control groups, respectively.
   Alternatively, the average treatment effect, Λh , could be calculated from the auxiliary
regression
                (yt+h − yt ) = Dt α1h + (1 − Dt )α0h + vt+h   for all h > 0.             (4)

The difference in the OLS estimates of the intercepts α̂1h − α̂0h = Λ̂h in expression (4) is
equivalent to that in expression (3). More conveniently, one could estimate the average
treatment effect directly from the regression

                      (yt+h − yt ) = α0h + Dt Λh + vt+h            for all h > 0.                    (5)

    Even when data are randomly allocated across the treatment and control subpopula-
tions, it would be natural to condition on the Xt to adjust for small-sample differences
in subpopulation characteristics and therefore to gain in efficiency. The estimator is
consistent for the average treatment effect (ATE hereafter) whether or not regressors are
included. Notice that the model for the outcomes is unspecified. The estimate of the ATE
does not depend on specific assumptions about this model if the conditional ignobility
assumption is met.


                                                    16
   Allocation to treatment and control groups is not usually random in observational
data. To appreciate the role of the selection-on-observables assumption in (2), consider
elaborating on the example. First, by the law of iterated expectations, we can write

                               E [(yt,h (1) − yt ) − (yt,h (0) − yt )]                           (6)
                  = E [ E [yt+h − yt | Dt = 1; Xt ] − E[yt+h − yt | Dt = 0; Xt ]]
                                    = Λh        for all h > 0.

    Assume that a linear regression control strategy suffices to do the appropriate con-
ditioning for the Xt and hence obtain a consistent estimate of E[yt+h − yt | Dt , Xt ]. This
is a big assumption that we relax later on in the paper. Note this is the assumption of
studies based on VARs where identification does not rely on external information. Then
the average causal effect of a policy intervention on the outcome variable at time t + h in
the maintained example, can be calculated by expanding expression (4) with

     yt+h − yt = Dt α1h + (1 − Dt )α0h + Dt Xt βh1 + (1 − Dt ) Xt βh0 + vt+h    for all h > 0.   (7)

    If one imposes the constraint βh1 = βh0 , then expression (7) is nothing more than a
standard LP of expression (1) and Λh = α1h − α0h is the policy response at horizon h.
The standard linear LP is a direct estimate of the typical impulse response derived from
a traditional VAR, as Jordà (2005) shows. This naı̈ve constrained specification, which
characterizes responses derived from a VAR, imposes two implicit assumptions. First,
the effect of the controls Xt on the outcomes is assumed to be stable across the treated
and control subpopulations. Second, the expected value of Xt in each subpopulation is
assumed to be the same. The first assumption is potentially defensible. The economic
mechanism describing the transmission of interest rates on real GDP could be the same
whether or not there is a fiscal consolidation, for example. The second assumption is
more difficult to defend. It is unlikely that, say, government debt levels are the same in
the treated and control groups. Fiscal consolidations are often driven by high levels of
debt.
    This is a good place to make a connection with structural VAR identification. When
h = 1, the LP is equivalent to the corresponding equation in a VAR. A specification
that includes all contemporaneous variables as controls (in addition to their lags) could
be seen as equivalent to imposing the Choleski ordering in which the policy variable
is ordered last. However, unlike a VAR, there is no need to impose exclusion restric-
tions on the remaining variables in the system if the focus shifts to a different re-


                                                 17
sponse/intervention pair. Practically speaking it would be advisable not to impose such
constraints but rather include all available observable controls again and let the data
choose which variables are appropriate conditioning information. The larger principle is
to ensure that fluctuations in the shocked variable cannot be explained by any observable
information. In that respect, it is perhaps useful to remember that the true square-root of
the reduced-form residual covariance matrix need not be upper-triangular or even have
any zero entries for that matter.
    When instruments are available one can further achieve identification using instru-
mental variable methods as in Stock and Watson (2012) and Mertens and Ravn (2013,
2014). We have shown above how IV methods can be used with the LP approach in a
more natural way. However, it is important to recall several features required to resolve
the identification puzzle. These are: (1) the instrument is relevant, which appears to be
the case as we discussed earlier; (2) the instrument is valid, which is untestable given
just-identification and for which the analysis of the previous section raises concerns; and
(3) predetermined and exogenous controls are not omitted from the specification. This
latter requirement is not resolved by the use of the instrument, especially when there is
substantial evidence that the controls are predictive for the instrument, as shown here.
    Taking up our earlier discussion once more, using expressions (6) and (7), notice that

                        E[ E[(yt,h (1) − yt ) − (yt,h (0) − yt )| Xt ]] =
                  n h                                                         io
                                       h                              h
                 E E ( Dt {α̂1 + Xt β̂ 1 }) − ((1 − Dt ){α̂0 + Xt β̂ 0 })| Xt    =
                                      E[α̂1h − α̂0h ] = E[Λ̂h ] = Λh ,

under the maintained assumptions of the example that E( Xt | Dt = 1) = E( Xt | Dt = 0)
and β 1 = β 0 and noticing that E( Dt | Dt = 1) = E((1 − Dt )| Dt = 0) = 1.
    More generally, if we do not impose the implicit assumptions of the naı̈ve LP specifi-
cation, the analogous representation to the group means expression (3) is


                 1                             1
       Λ̂hRA =        ∑ Dt (m1h (Xt , θ̂1h )) − n0 ∑(1 − Dt )(m0h (Xt , θ̂0h ))   for all h > 0,   (8)
                 n1    t                           t


where mhj (.) is a generic specification of the conditional mean of (yt+h − yt ) in each
subpopulation j = 1, 0 and θ jh = (αhj βhj )′ for the regression example in (7). The n1 and
n0 have been defined earlier. Note that this more general form of regression adjustment
allows the conditional means to be different for the treated and control subpopulations
and allows their effect on the outcome to differ as well.

                                                       18
5.1.    Re-randomization through the propensity score
Recall that the critical assumption is the conditional ignorability or selection-on-observables
condition (2). Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983) show that

                                        X t ⊥ Dt | p ( Dt = 1 | X t , ψ ) ,

that is, the propensity score p( Dt = 1| Xt , ψ) is all that is needed to capture the effect of
the Xt in the selection-on-observables condition.9 This result provides further support
for the IPW estimator. Recall the average treatment effect (ATE) is, by definition,

    Λh = E [(yt,h (1) − yt ) − (yt,h (0) − yt )] = E[ E [(yt,h (1) − yt ) − (yt,h (0) − yt )| Xt ]],       (9)

using the law of iterated expectations. Looking inside the expectations in the final term
above, the average policy response conditional on Xt , in terms of observable data, is

                               E [(yt,h (1) − yt ) − (yt,h (0) − yt )| Xt ] =                            (10)
              E [yt,h − yt | Dt = 1; Xt ] − E [yt,h − yt | Dt = 0; Xt ] ,       for all h > 0,

where it is assumed that the policy environment characterized by ψ ∈ Ψ remains con-
stant. Estimation of these conditional expectations can be simplified considerably when
a model for the policy variable Dt is available.
     Angrist and Kuersteiner (2004, 2011) refer to the predicted value from such a policy
model the policy propensity score. The policy propensity score is meant to ensure the
estimation of the policy response (the average treatment effect in the microeconomics
parlance) is consistent under the main assumption. In addition, it acts as a dimension-
reduction device. Ideally, any predictor of policy should be included, regardless of
whether that predictor is a fundamental variable in a macroeconomic model. The probit
results reported in Table 7 can be seen as candidate estimates of this policy propensity
score. We will instead construct the policy propensity score using a richer specification
that includes all the controls used in Table 6 as well.
     Denote the policy propensity score P( Dt = j| Xt ) = p j ( Xt , ψ) for j = 1, 0. Clearly
p1 ( Xt , ψ) = 1 − p0 ( Xt , ψ). Using the selection-on-observables condition in expression (2)
   9 Correction  of incidental truncation with inverse probability weighting has a long history in statistics
(Horvitz and Thompson 1952) and is generally viewed as more general than Heckman’s (1976) selection
model. Heckman’s (1976) approach corrects for incidental truncation using the inverse Mills ratio, requires
specific distributional assumptions, and at least one selection variable not affecting the structural equation.
Heckman’s approach is only known to work for special nonlinear models, such as an exponential regres-
sion model (see Wooldridge 1997). See Wooldridge (2002) for a more general discussion.

shown earlier, then

        E [(yt,h − yt )1{ Dt = j}| Xt ] = E[(yt,h ( j) − yt )| Xt ] p j ( Xt , ψ)                    for j = 1, 0.   (11)

Solving for E[(yt,h ( j) − yt )| Xt ] and taking unconditional expectations, by integrating over
Xt , the ATE in (9) can be calculated as

             Λh = E [(yt,h (1) − yt ) − (yt,h (0) − yt )]
                                     1 { Dt = 1 } 1 { Dt = 0 }

                = E (yt,h − yt )                    −                  for all h > 0.                                (12)
                                      p1 ( Xt , ψ )   p0 ( Xt , ψ )

Under standard regularity conditions (detailed in AJK) an estimate of expression (12)
can be obtained using sample moments which generalize the sample moments presented
earlier in expression (3) for the OLS case.
    Suppose that the first-stage treatment model takes the form of a probability of treat-
ment at time t given by the estimated model p̂t = p1 ( Xt , ψ̂), where ψ̂ is the estimated
parameter vector, and 1 − p̂t = p0 ( Xt , ψ̂). The inverse propensity score weighted (IPW)
“ratio estimator” of the average treatment effect is

                                Dt ( y t + h − y t )          (1 − Dt )(yt+h − yt )
                                                                                 
                          1                             1
                Λ̂ IPW   = ∑                           − ∑                            .                              (13)

Some improvements can be made to this expression. Imbens (2004) and Lunceford and
Davidian (2004) suggest renormalizing the weights so that they sum up to one in small
samples. Hence expression (13) becomes

and the notation n∗j parallels the notation n j for j = 1, 0 in (3). Note that E[ Dt /pt ] =
E[ E( Dt | Xt )]/pt = 1; similarly E[(1 − Dt )/(1 − pt )] = E[ E((1 − Dt )| Xt )]/(1 − pt ) = 1;
and hence it follows that in large samples expressions (13) and (14) apply the same
weighting, since E(n1∗ ) = E(n0∗ ) = n. These expressions are natural analogs of the Group
Mean estimator in (3), with inverse propensity-score weighting to correct for allocation
bias and to achieve a quasi-random distribution of treatment and control observations
via reweighting.

5.2.   Regression adjustment (IPWRA) and Augmented IPW (AIPW)
As a way to enhance robustness, researchers have derived estimators with a regression
adjustment component added to the standard IPW estimator presented above. This
estimator parallels that in expression (8) but using inverse probability weighting. To
further enhance efficiency, the augmented IPW or AIPW estimator combines the IPW
and IPWRA estimators in a manner to be discussed shortly.
    It is natural to consider extending the estimator in expression (8) using the propensity
score. Formally, the basis for such an estimator would be to transition from expression
(11) to (12) in the following manner

                                                1 { Dt = 1 } 1 { Dt = 0 }

              h
            Λ = E ( y t + h − y t | Xt )                       − 0                    for all h > 0,   (16)

which can be implemented by first projecting the outcome variable on the set of con-
trol variables (see, e.g. Robins and Rotnitzky 1995; Robins, Rotnitzky, and Zhao 1995;
and Wooldridge 2007). The inverse propensity-score weighted estimator with regression
adjustment (IPWRA) is then given by
                                 "                    h #           "                          h #

where again mhj ( Xt , θˆj ) for j = 1, 0 is the conditional mean from the first-step regression
of (yt+h − yt ) on Xt as in expression (8) in Section 5. The n∗j for j = 1, 0 are the same
as in expression (15). It is clear that equation (17) nests all the previous estimators, the
Group Mean (3), the RA (8), and the IPW (14) as special cases.
     The estimator in expression (17) falls into the class of doubly robust estimators (see, e.g.,
Imbens 2004; Wooldridge 2007; Lunceford and Davidian 2004; and Kreif et al. 2011). The
intuition behind the estimator is to use the regression model as a way to “predict” the
unobserved potential outcomes. Consistency of the estimated ATE only requires either
the conditional mean model or the propensity score model to be correctly specified.
     However, although (17) is one of a large class of unbiased IPWRA estimators of ATE,
it is not the most efficient in this class. Starting with Robins, Rotnitzky, and Zhao (1994)
and more recently, Lunceford and Davidian (2004), the estimator within the doubly-
robust class having the smallest asymptotic variance, is the (locally) semi-parametric

                                p̂t (1 − p̂t )

    Thus, the estimator in (18) can be seen as the basic IPW estimator plus an adjustment
consisting of the weighted average of the two regression estimators. The adjustment term
has expectation zero when the estimated propensity scores and regression models are
replaced by their population counterparts. Moreover, the adjustment term stabilizes the
estimator when the propensity scores get close to zero or one (Glynn and Quinn 2010),
and this alleviates with the need to truncate the propensity score weights as suggested
in Imbens (2004). Another way to interpret the AIPW estimator is to realize that

                                Λ̂hAIPW = Λ̂hIPW + (Λ̂hRA − Λ̂hIPWRA ).                               (19)

Readers familiar with the bootstrap will notice the similarities between the bootstrap
bias correction formula and expression (19).
   The AIPW has a number of attractive theoretical properties. Using the theory of
M-estimation, Lunceford and Davidian (2004) show that the estimator is asymptotically
normally distributed. In addition, they show that the variance can be calculated using
the empirical sandwich estimator V (Λ̂hAIPW ) = n12 ∑t ( Îth )2 , where

                        Dt (yt+h − yt ) (1 − Dt )(yt+h − yt )
                                                                       
           Îth   =                      −                                 −                          (20)
                               p̂t                  (1 − p̂t )
                       ( Dt − p̂t ) h                                                  i
                                      (1 − p̂t )m1 ( Xt , , θ̂1 ) + p̂t m0 ( Xt , θ̂0 ) − Λ̂hAIPW .
                                                 h            h          h          h
                       p̂t (1 − p̂t )

    Later we allow for the possibility that the Îth are not a martingale difference se-
quence and calculate standard errors using cluster robust methods. When the propensity
score and the regression function are modeled correctly, the AIPW achieves the semi-
parametric efficiency bound. Alternatively, Imbens (2004) shows that standard errors for
Λ̂hAIPW can be calculated with the bootstrap.

using inverse propensity score weighting have been frequently implemented in applied

microeconomics with cross-sectional data. Matching methods more generally constitute
a benchmark within the medical research literature when trials are suspected of being
contaminated by allocation bias. The provenance of the particular inverse propensity-
score weighting method we employ is thus well established.
   Figure 1 provides intuition for the methods that we just described and exemplifies
the perils of allocation bias with a simple bivariate manufactured example based one
observable confounder. Panel (a) displays the hypothetical frequencies of observing the
control variable x in the treatment and control subpopulations using circles of varying
diameter. Think of it as a display of the raw data. In the control subpopulation, we
are more likely to observe low values of x. This is indicated with the bigger circles

                                                         23
in blue that are located near the vertical axis. The opposite is the case for the treated
subpopulation, indicated with the red circles that grow the further they are from the
vertical axis. The example is set up so that the true ATE = 1.
    The naı̈ve Group Means estimator based on expression (3) consists of the difference in
means between the two subpopulations delivering an estimate of the ATE = 7.33 (treated
mean)- 4.67 (control mean) = 3.67 that is almost four times as large as the true ATE.
Panel (b) implements the regression adjustment estimator described in (8). Now the ATE
is estimated using the conditional mean average implied by the regression estimates of
each subpopulation. In this case ATE = 6 (treated regression mean) - 5 (control regression
mean) = 1, which is the correct ATE. In the simple example, the effect of the control x is
linear so a regression control strategy suffices to obtain the correct ATE.
    Suppose that you do not want to make assumptions about the functional form of the
regression needed to adjust for the covariate x in the ATE estimator. Panel (c) implements
the IPW estimator in (13). Using weights based on the inverse frequency with which
the data are observed for each value of x in each subpopulation generates a ”pseudo-
randomized” sample from which the simple difference in mean estimator delivers the
correct answer. In this case ATE = 6 (treatment mean using inverse weights) - 5 (control
mean using inverse weights) = 1, again the correct value.
    In practice one may be unsure about the correct specification of either the regression
or the propensity score describing the appropriate reweighing scheme. Panel (d) com-
bines the two approaches (IPW and regression adjustment) based on expression (17).
This estimator is ”doubly robust” meaning that either the propensity score or the regres-
sion may be incorrectly specified and yet still deliver the correct estimate of the ATE. In
the example there is no gain from using this procedure, but one can still verify that ATE
= 6 (conditional regression mean for treated using inverse weighting) - 5 (conditional
regression mean for control using inverse weighting) = 1. Again, the correct ATE.
    When policy interventions are mostly driven by the endogenous response to controls,
we can think of the observable treatment/control subpopulations as being oversampled
from the region of the distribution in which the propensity score attains its highest
values. Moments calculated with this raw empirical distribution will therefore be bi-
ased: not enough probability mass is given to observations with low propensity scores.
Weighting by the inverse of the propensity score shifts weight away from the oversam-
pled toward the undersampled region of the distribution. This shift of probability mass
reconstructs the appropriate frequency weights of the underlying true distribution of
outcomes under treatment and control so that the means estimated from each subpopu-
lation are no longer biased and their difference is an unbiased estimate of the ATE.

5.4.   What We Do
The next section reports the results of applying the AIPW estimator (18) to measure the
average treatment effect of fiscal consolidations as a counterpoint to the conventional
OLS and IV results reported earlier. As a way to understand where the differences
come from, we first implement the AIPW estimator by restricting the parameters of the
regression (based on LPs) to be the same in the treated and control subpopulations, as
is implicit in the OLS and IV approaches. Under that constraint, the results from the
AIPW estimator are close to the IV results seen earlier. Next we allow for the parameters
to vary across subpopulations, adhering to the way expression (18) is typically applied
in the policy evaluation literature. These results deliver the same qualitative implication
of contractionary austerity, but show that the effects of consolidations are quantitatively
even more painful.


6. Contractionary Austerity Revisited: Estimates of the Average
                       Effect of Fiscal Consolidations

This section presents AIPW estimates of the ATE of fiscal consolidations. Following
standard procedures, the propensity score used here is based on a saturated probit model
that extends the set of controls used in Table 7 with the current and lagged values of the
controls in Table 6. The saturated probit also includes country fixed effects. Although
we do not report the coefficient estimates of this more saturated model, it is worth
mentioning that the AUC in this treatment model rises to 0.86.
    Figure 2 provides smooth kernel density estimates of the distribution of the propen-
sity score for the treated and control units to check for overlap. One way to think of
overlap is to consider what overlap would be in the ideal RCT. The empirical distribu-
tions of the propensity score for treated and control units would be uniform and identical
to each other. At the other extreme, suppose that treatment is allocated mechanically on
the basis of controls. Then the distribution of treated units would spike at one and be
zero elsewhere, and the distribution of control units would spike at zero and be zero
elsewhere. Despite the high AUC, the figure indicates considerable overlap between
the distributions, which indicates we have a satisfactory first-stage model with which to
properly identify the ATE using IPW methods.
    However, the figure also indicates that there are some observations likely to get very
high weights. Specifically, there are control (treated) units whose propensity score is near
zero (one) and hence who get weights in the IPW in excess of 10. In general, it is often

recommended to truncate the maximum weights in the IPW to 10 (see e.g. Cole and
Hernán, 2008 and Imbens 2004). However, the AIPW has the property that high weights
in the IPW are compensated at the same rate by the augmentation term. Experiments not
reported here indicate that this is indeed what happens in practice and that truncation
is unnecessary in our application (see Appendix A.3).
    Using the more saturated probit, we then estimate cumulated responses and their
sum to the 5-year horizon as before. Our indicator of a fiscal consolidation is the narra-
tive IMF indicator, the Treatment variable. Since Treatment is binary, we are estimating
average effects only. However, coincidentally, the average treatment size (or dose) is
close to 1 percent of GDP in these data (the exact value is 0.97, with a standard deviation
of 0.07 in the full sample, and is not significantly different in booms and slumps), so
the interpretation of these responses is directly comparable to a conventional multiplier,
with only a small upscaling (of 1/0.97) for strict accuracy. We can return to this rescaling
issue in a moment when we make a formal comparison with the previous OLS and IV
results.

    We begin by discussing Table 8, which is the direct counterpart to the OLS and IV
result presentations in Tables 1 and 3. Here we show the ATE of fiscal consolidation
using the AIPW estimator (18), for the full sample (i.e., no use of boom and slump
bins, yet) and using the propensity score estimates based on the saturated probit. Both
the treatment-equation probit model and the outcome-equation AIPW model include
country-fixed effects.
    Table 8 is organized into two rows. The first row reports the results based on im-
posing the restriction θ1h = θ0h , the usual implicit restriction used without hesitation in
the macro-VAR empirical literature and the same restriction we imposed in reporting
the results of Tables 1 and 3. The second row reports the results that do not impose
the θ1h = θ0h restriction. The results are qualitatively similar to those reported in Table 3
in that we still find that austerity is contractionary. However, the estimated impacts of
fiscal consolidations on output are now even bigger.
    Recall that according to the IV estimates, the accumulated loss over five years was
-2.94∗∗∗ . This would imply an average annual real GDP loss of about 0.59% of GDP
per 1% of fiscal consolidation over each of the 5 years. Here our AIPW estimate with
unrestricted coefficients has a sum effect of -3.61∗∗∗ over 5 years. This would imply an
average annual real GDP loss of about 0.74% of GDP per 1% of fiscal consolidation over
each of the 5 years (using a 1/0.97 rescaling factor). Thus the implied output losses due
to austerity are about 20% larger under our AIPW estimation than with IV estimation.
    Next we once again explore the same partition of the data into booms and slumps,
allocating to the bins according to whether output is above or below trend as in earlier

sections to provide a more granular view of these results, and Table 9 presents these
AIPW estimates based on the same saturated policy propensity score probit model de-
scribed earlier. These results show that in a boom a fiscal consolidation has on average a
small, negative, but imprecisely estimated effect. The first row of the table indicates that
the accumulated loss over five years is -1.80 percent of GDP. In a slump, the results are
about three times as strong and highly statistically significant: over five years, the accu-
mulated loss is -3.54∗∗ percent of GDP, as shown in the second row of the table. Scaling
these effects for the average treatment size (0.97 percent of GDP) the average loss per 1%
fiscal consolidation is 0.37% of GDP per year over the five year window in booms, and
0.73% of GDP per year in slumps.
    Summing up our LP results, we always find more adverse paths when austerity is
imposed in slumps rather than in booms, but there are sometimes big differences across
specifications. OLS suggests that austerity might have a small and imprecisely estimated
expansionary effect, although a more granular view indicates that even then, this result
holds only in booms. Using the “narrative” instrument we would walk away believing
more firmly that austerity is contractionary. The estimated effect with IV is relatively
small and imprecisely estimated for the boom, but stronger and significant in the slump,
adding up to a loss of -3.3% of output over 5 years for the typical consolidation. Finally,
using the AIPW estimator we find even larger contractionary effects of austerity, still not
statistically significant in booms, and amounting to -3.5% over 5 years in slumps. One
may quibble that the size of the consolidation should also be taken into consideration.


                                                   28
In principle, this is a valid concern. However, in practice this would mean extending the
space of discrete interventions. Given the data, there would be too few observations to
obtain robust results (and in some cases, insufficient data to estimate the desired effects).
Fortunately, as we have discussed earlier, fiscal consolidations typically average about
one percent relative to GDP with a tight range of variation, which greatly facilitates the
interpretability of our findings.
    Figure 3 displays the coefficients reported in Table 9, with appropriate rescaling in
the case of AIPW to allow for the average treatment size, to show the dynamic ATE
impacts of fiscal consolidations in graphical form and compares them with the responses
obtained using the IV coefficient estimates which were reported earlier in Table 4.
    Our results underscore that austerity tends to be painful, but that timing matters:
the least painful fiscal consolidations, from a growth and hence budgetary perspective,
will tend to be those launched from a position of strength, that is, in the boom not
the slump. This would seem to require moderately wise policymaking and/or fiscal
regimes (councils, rules, etc.), not to mention an ability to stay below any debt limit so
as to maintain capital market access to permit smoothing.
    The next section puts our new results to work in the context of the austerity program
launched in UK by the Coalition administration in 2010, to show how our analysis can
be used in practice. Moreover, by putting our results in a realistic situation outside the
sample used for estimation, we obtain a feel for how well calibrated our findings are to
the recent macroeconomic experience of a representative economy from our sample.


  7.   Counterfactual: Coalition Austerity and the UK Recession

This section makes a counterfactual forecast of the post-2007 path of the UK economy
without the fiscal austerity policies imposed by the Coalition government after the 2010
election. These estimates are based on a sample that excludes the Global Financial Crisis.
Therefore, the exercise has the flavor of an out-of-sample evaluation.
    We need to be very clear about the assumptions, explicit or implicit, in our coun-
terfactual. We assume that zero fiscal consolidation was done in the years 2010–13 as
the counterfactual, and that this was feasible, and would have not caused other possibly
adverse outcomes. Most crucially we assume that this would have had no damaging
effect on UK government debt yields, or country risk, in the relevant time frame. We
assume, in other words, that the UK had the fiscal space to follow a counterfactual path
for those years. Critics may question this assumption, but no evidence has been ad-
duced to support their view. First, absent a model on their part of the determinants of

UK sovereign risk showing such a spike, the point is not well supported. In fact, to the
extent that we have any cross-country evidence on the impact of fiscal consolidations
on sovereign yields it shows that austerity tends to worsen sovereign spreads, or has a
small and often non-significant efffect (Born, Müller, and Pfeifer 2015, Figure 4). Second,
the evidence from UK longer-run history is even less favorable: the country emerged
from the Napoleonic Wars and the two World Wars with debt ratios higher than current
levels relative to GDP (and tax revenues much lower) and yet never defaulted on market
debt or lost capital market access. So there is no within-country evidence of this link
either. Third, recent UK history also goes against this argument: despite public debt


                                                             30
levels rising under the Coalition (mainly because a slow recovery meant poor tax rev-
enues) the UK gilt yield has fallen to its lowest level in centuries. Indeed, with stronger
output growth under the counterfactual, tax revenues would have been higher, a factor
that would have alleviated debt build up, all else equal.10
    The UK experienced a much weaker recovery than in the US, where nothing close to
a double dip took place. The divergence between the two recovery paths began in 2010
(Schularick and Taylor 2012). Since both countries’ central banks acted with aggressive
ease, by going to the zero bound and pursuing quantitative easing policies thereafter,
explanations for the differences have focused elsewhere. Various explanations have been
offered, ranging from tighter UK fiscal policy, to spillovers from the Eurozone and weak
trade links with fast-growth emerging markets. Other stories have invoked contractions
in oversized UK sectors such as finance and North Sea oil and gas, the extent of non-bank
finance, and differential energy costs (Posen 2012; Davies 2012).
    To gain quantitative traction on the share of responsibility that should be borne by
fiscal policy we use our AIPW estimates. We scale, and assign the impacts of fiscal
shocks as follows. As a measure of the change in fiscal stance we use the change in
the UK Office of Budget Responsibility’s (OBR) cyclically-adjusted primary balance. The
changes turn out to be +2.3% of GDP in year 1 (2009–10 to 2010–11), followed by +1.5%
in year 2, and +0.1% in year 3, showing a slowing of the pace of tightening in year 3, but
with further austerity planned in future years.11 This gives us a sequence of three fiscal
policy shocks. Note that the average treatment size is 0.97, so for this counterfactual
exercise we scale treatment effects due to each shock by a factor of 1/0.97.
    We then have to compute the impact of each shock at each horizon and make sure
we assign it appropriately. Our AIPW estimation already allows for the fact that if
  10 Low   yields have been evident throughout the advanced economies in recent years, outside the Eu-
rozone crisis countries. Though outside the scope of our paper, the main explanations for these trends
would seem to be a strong medium-run flight to safety since 2008, and a longer-run drift to lower real
rates globally over two decades driven by global demography and/or EM precautionary saving motives.
An additional factor is that having its own central bank means that the UK cannot suffer a sudden stop or
a self-fulfilling run on the sovereign like, say, countries in the Eurozone periphery. Together, these factors
appear have contributed to enlarged fiscal space in the form of a massive absorption potential for UK gilts.
   11 Considerable controversy attends the question as to whether austerity policy was eased in

year 3, with the Chancellor and HM Treasury insisting that consolidation continued, but many
critics suggesting the data showed otherwise.              This is often referred to as the Plan A ver-
sus Plan B debate.           See the discussion by Jonathan Portes, http://www.niesr.ac.uk/blog/

Royal Mail asset transactions which are not related to fiscal plans. See Appendix A.5 and Appendix Table
A5. Two alternative measures of fiscal shocks are discussed in the appendix, one from the OBR and one
from the IMF. The measure we have chosen is the official UK measure and is more modest than these
alternative measures


                                                     31
at time 0 a treatment occurs, then its measured impact at time h ≥ 1 includes not
just the direct impact of the policy on output, but also its indirect impact arising from
the fact that treatment at time 0 also predicts some positive probability of treatment at
time h ≥ 1. To prevent double counting we therefore need to carefully subtract these
“expected austerity” measures from any forecast of fiscal impacts in year 1 and beyond.
    The effects of the first round of austerity in 2010–11 can be computed directly from the
AIPW estimates above (for the slump bin, since the UK was already in a deep recession
then). For example, the effect of the 2010–11 austerity shock in 2011 itself would be
computed as the shock magnitude of +2.3 (OBR data, as above) multiplied by the scaling
factor of 1/0.97 (noted above), and then multiplied by the AIPW coefficient of -0.19 (from
the slump bin in year 1).
    However, in other subsequent years an adjustment must be done. For example, the
effect of the 2010–11 plus 2011–12 austerity shock in 2012 itself would be computed in
two parts. First, there is a similar direct effect of the first year shock on second year
output: the first year shock magnitude of 2.3 (again) multiplied by the scaling factor of
1/0.97 (again), and then multiplied by the AIPW coefficient of -0.76 (from the slump bin,
but now in year 2). Second, there is the additional effect from unexpected treatment in
year 2 conditional on treatment in year 1. To get at this problem we estimate a simple LP
regression for the forward path of treatment at time h, conditional on treatment today,
and use these to weight austerity impacts in Years 2 and 3.12
    The results of this counterfactual exercise are presented in Figure 4, and for reference
we also show various actual and forecast paths for UK real GDP from 2007 (the business
cycle peak) through 2013. As a starting point, absent knowledge of what was to happen
after the 2010 Coalition austerity program, what might have been the ex ante expected
path of the UK economy? This question is answered by the two dashed lines. The double-
long-dashed line shows the unconditional historical path in a financial crisis recession
based on a large sample of all advanced-economy recessions from 1870 to 2007 in Jordà,
  12 The  LP estimations for the forward path of treatment for the necessary 3-year horizon are reported
in the appendix in Table A4. We find that the ATE estimate of a change in probability, in the slump bin,
of a treatment in year 1 given a treatment in year 0 is 0.51; the model also gives a 28% chance in year
2 and 17% in year 3. For our counterfactual this means that 51% of the Coalition austerity in 2011–12
(and 28% in 2012–13) was “baked in”—in probabilistic terms—by the decision to do austerity in 2010–
11. So this component is already accounted for in the AIPW output path estimates. The net effects can
be computed mechanically as we illustrate in the following example. First, we can compute the first
year shock magnitude of 2.3 multiplied by the scaling factor of 1/0.97, and then multiplied by the AIPW
coefficient of -0.76 (from the slump bin in year 2). Second, we can add to this the second year shock
magnitude of 1.5 (OBR) multiplied by the scaling factor of 1/0.97, multiplied by the AIPW coefficient of
-0.24 (from the slump bin in year 1), and multiplied by the probability of no treatment in year 2 which is
0.49=1-0.51. In a similar way we can assign unexpected and expected effects of contemporaneous treatment
to prior treatment in all years along the path.

Schularick, and Taylor (2013), extended to the 6-year horizon. We restrict attention to
their average path for highly-leveraged economies after a financial crisis, a category
which includes the UK case in 2007. Clearly, a seriously painful recession was to be
expected anyway: if output is scaled to 100 in 2007, this path shows a 4% drop over two
years, to a level of 96 by 2009, followed by recovery thereafter to about 104 in 2013.
   What did the authorities expect? According to the June 2010 Pre-Budget report of
the OBR they expected something similar but slightly worse to unfold after 2010, as
shown by the short-dashed path in the figure. The bottom in output here is 94.2 and
the recovery was predicted to be initially slower, although by 2012 the OBR thought the
output level would be 100.6 and by 2013 it would be at 103.4, in the same units. (Thus
the difference between the two displayed forecast paths is only 0.6% of GDP by 2013.)
   Alas, this did not come to pass, as shown by the solid line in the chart using actual
UK (ONS) data to depict the outturn of events. Everything was going more or less in


                                                           33
line with the forecast path until 2010. After that, a double-dip recession was avoided
only by a decimal rounding and the UK real economy virtually flatlined for a couple
of years before a small uptick in 2013. (In per capita terms, the UK economy actually
shrank.)
    How much of the UK’s dismal performance can be attributed to the fiscal policy
choice of instigating austerity during a slump? The answer based on our counterfactual
model is about 7⁄9, or just over three-quarters. This is shown by the dotted line in the
chart, which cumulates the effects of each of the three years of austerity on growth
from 2010 to 2013. By 2013, the last year in the window, the cumulative effects of these
choices amounted to about 3.1% of GDP (in 2007 units) where the total gap relative to
the actual path was 4.0%, thus leaving an unexplained residual of 0.9%. Our model also
suggests that additional drag from the 2010–13 austerity policies would have been felt
into 2014–16, even if no further austerity had been imposed.13
    In 2013, at the end of the period analyzed here, OBR published an estimate that
austerity caused a roughly -1.5% change in output in the year 2013. Our -3.1% estimate
of the impact of fiscal austerity on economic activity is just over twice as large. We think
this important difference is largely due to the fact that, unlike us, OBR does not allow
for state-dependence and they also arbitrarily force the effects of fiscal policy to decay
to zero after four years. Both of these modeling choices would appear to be strongly
rejected by the data, however.14
    Even so, our 3.4% estimate could still be biased down because we are unable to adjust
for monetary policy at the zero lower bound (ZLB). The UK out-of-sample counterfactual
is based in a liquidity trap environment, but the in-sample data we used for estimation
overwhelmingly were not. Our estimates used data from the 1970s to 2007. Out of
173 consolidation episodes, there are only 7 country-year observations at the ZLB, all
relating to Japan in the 1990–2007. Economic theory (Christiano et al. 2011; Eggertsson
and Krugman 2012; Rendahl 2012) and also historical evidence from the 1930s (Almunia
et al. 2010) indicate that fiscal multipliers are much larger under ZLB conditions than in
normal times when monetary policy is away from this constraint. But we cannot hope
to convincingly capture the ZLB effect in our sample with just a handful of observations
from Japan, so this must remain a goal for future research where we hope to apply our
new estimation methods to a large set of contemporary and historical data.
  13 The residual in Figure 4 could be accounted for by factors outside the framework: export patterns, the
Eurozone crisis, or idiosyncratic UK sector shocks. There may have also been overoptimism in the 2010
forecast (e.g., OBR underestimating either the size or economic impacts of upcoming austerity shocks).

                                   8. Conclusion

Few macroeconomic policy debates have generated as much controversy as the current
austerity argument, and as Europe stagnates the furore appears to be far from over.
Amidst the cacophony of competing estimates of fiscal multipliers, the goal of this paper
is not to add another source of noise.
    Rather, the main contribution is to harmonize dissonant views into a unified frame-
work where the merits of each approach can be properly evaluated. The effect of fiscal
consolidation on macroeconomic outcomes is ultimately an empirical question. In the
absence of randomized controlled trials, we have to rely on observational data. And to
measure the causal effect of fiscal consolidations on growth, it is critical that identifica-
tion assumptions be properly evaluated and that empirical methods be suitably adjusted
to the demands of the data.
    Whenever outcomes are correlated with observables that determine the likelihood of
treatment, the effect of the treatment cannot be causally measured without bias. Yet,
this allocation bias prevents us from being able to tell whether or not the low or even
inverted values of the fiscal multiplier often found in this strand of the literature are
indeed close enough to the truth.
    If episodes of fiscal consolidation could be separated by whether or not they are
explained by circumstances, identification could be, once again, restored. The narra-
tive approach relies on a careful reading of the records to achieve just such a separation.
Moreover, results from this approach indicate that the fiscal multiplier is larger in magni-
tude, especially in depressed economies. However, when those consolidations believed
to be exogenous are predictable by omitted observable controls omitted two concerns
arise. One is that the instrument may not be exogenous as argued. Second, even if the
instrument is exogenous, the omitted predictors introduce bias in the IV estimator.
    Extant results in the literature can be somewhat reconciled by interpreting exoge-
nous consolidations as instrumental variables. After all, if the narrative approach were
not very informative about the exogeneity of these episodes, there should not be any
difference in the value of the multiplier estimated using simple least squares and IV
methods. So, while potentially problematic, the narrative approach (through these IV
estimates) seems to be isolating fiscal consolidations that differ from those in the overall
population in some important respects. Whether the fiscal multiplier estimated with
instrumental variables can be interpreted causally required further analysis.
    Dissatisfaction with the potential violation of exogeneity conditions required for
identification could lead one, like Mill (1836), to the nihilistic conclusion that without


                                             35
an experimentum crucis mere observational data are hopelessly unsuitable for testing a
macroeconomic hypothesis, but we believe the battle is not lost. Propensity score meth-
ods, common in biostatistics, medical research, and in applied microeconomics when
ideal randomized trials are unavailable, offer a last line of defense. Recent work by An-
grist, Jordà and Kuersteiner (2013) introduced inverse probability weighted estimators
of average treatment effects for time series data.
    Our appeal to this approach begins by recognizing that fiscal consolidations may not
be exogenous events, even those identified by the narrative approach. Next we construct
a predictive model for the likelihood of fiscal consolidation using various specifications
including some with a rich set of available observable controls. The predictive model
serves to reallocate probability mass from the regions of the distributions in the treat-
ment/control subpopulations that are oversampled to those regions that are undersam-
pled, thus enabling identification in the framework of the Rubin Causal Model.
    Our preferred AIPW estimates, which correct for the endogeneity of the fiscal treat-
ments, are quantitatively much closer to those from the instrumental variables specifi-
cation than to those from the least squares specification, although that such would be
the outcome was unknowable without doing the analysis. This result provides some
measure of comfort on the potential validity of the instrument. Our analysis suggests
even larger austerity impacts than the IMF study when the economy is growing below
its long-run trend, however. This is likely a result of correcting attenuation bias due to
the omitted predictors of fiscal consolidation and the re-randomization methods that we
use. Generally, in the slump, austerity prolongs the pain, much more so than in the
boom. It appears that Keynes was right after all.

A.3.     Robustness
As discussed in the text, we explored the sensitivity of our results to different model specifica-
tions. These findings are shown in Table A3. In each case we show the impacts that these model
changes have on the estimated 5-year summed estimate of the response of output to the fiscal
treatment in the two output level bins. We also report the predictive ability test for the first stage
in each case based on the area under the curve (AUC) statistic and its standard error.
     In the main text we adopted a baseline specification of a pooled probit with country-fixed
effects in the first-stage binary treatment regression. In column 1 we add the year-0 World real
GDP growth rate (from the World Bank dataset) as a control to capture global time varying
trends in both stages. In column 2 we show the first-stage using a pooled logit estimator with
country-fixed effects. In column 3 we extend the estimator in column 3 and add the year-0 World
real GDP growth rate (from the World Bank dataset) as a control to capture global time varying
trends in both stages. Columns 4 and 5 report the results for the baseline probit model in the
main text when probability weights are truncated to [0.1,0.9] and [0.2,0.8].
     The message from these checks is that our results are not sensitive to the particular choice of
first-stage model used to generate the propensity score. In the boom bin, effects are always small
and statistically insignificant. In the slump bin the effects are negative and significant.

A.4.     Estimated LP Equation for Future Treatment
For our UK counterfactuals we use LP-OLS estimates of future treatment as a response to treat-
ment today. This allows us to compute expected and unexpected components of fiscal shocks in
multi-year austerity programs, e.g. UK 2010–13. The estimates are shown in Table A4.

A.5.     Measures of UK Fiscal Consolidation 2010–13
Measures of the Size of UK Fiscal Treatments are shown in shown in Table A5. As discussed in
the text, in our UK counterfactuals we use the change in the UK Office of Budget Responsibility
(OBR) cyclically-adjusted primary balance as a measure of the scale of the fiscal treatment in each
period (panel a). Alternative measures exist such as the OBR’s cyclically-adjusted Treaty balance
(panel b) or the IMF government structural balance (panel c) . (“Treaty” refers to Maastricht
Treaty definitions.) All three paths are broadly similar; our preferred OBR cyclically-adjusted
primary balance series (a) shows smaller changes than the other two series.
