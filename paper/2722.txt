                 INDUSTRIAL ORGANIZATION AND PRODUCT QUALITY:
               EVIDENCE FROM SOUTH KOREAN AND TAIWANESE EXPORTS


                                   ABSTRACT


     The central focus of this paper is on the relationship between domestic

market structure and export performance. It evaluates the hypothesis that

more concentrated industrial sectors can achieve more easily the transition

from standardized, labor-intensive manufactures to sophisticated, skill-

intensive products, as such industries are better able to cope with the

inevitable reputational externalities involved in producing high-quality

goods for foreign markets. South Korea and Taiwan provide a good test of

the theory, as they have sharply different market structures. The results

of the empirical analysis provide strong support for the hypothesis.

I. Introduction

     For developing countries, probably the predominant question of strategic

trade policy is: how can entry be facilitated into markets for sophisticated

manufactured goods characterized by imperfect competition and well-entrenched

oligopolists? Pessimism regarding the prospects for successful entry into

such markets underlies the widespread unease with outward-oriented trade

strategies. Yet, as the experiences of Japan and the East Asian tigers

folllowing on her heels have amply demonstrated, successful entrants can

always create room for themselves. These countries have diversified into

manufactured products of increasing sophistication, demonstrating that even

the tightest international oligopolies can be shook up.

     The broad reasons underlying the export success of the East Asian

countries are now well known. My focus in this paper is on a narrow, but

significant aspect of their performance: the transition from standardized,

labor-intensive manufactures to sophisticated, skill-intensive products where

quality plays an important role. While traditional factor-endowment

considerations typically play the determinant role with the former group of

products, the role of industrial organization comes intb its own with the

latter. Putting it somewhat crudely, the transition can be viewed as a shift

form price to quality as the source of competitiveness. The higher-end

products typically require not only a broader range of skills and
                                     -2-

technological sophistication, but also investment in product quality, customer

loyalty, and reputation.

     The rate at which the transition takes place, if it does take place at

all, is naturally influenced by a wide range of factors and country

characteristics. Can industrial policy play a role here as well? As a first

cut, I focus in this paper on broad patterns of industrial organization. We

can identify two relevant models for policy here. In the first, policy would

favor the formation of large firms and conglomerates and direct resources

towards them, discriminating against small firms and potential entrants. In

the second, policy would be neutral and a more fluid, diffuse industrial

structure would result. Which is the more conducive pattern for making the

transition to high-end products? In the next section, I will discuss a simple

theory which suggests that the transition can be achieved more easily when

domestic industry is highly concentrated. The basic argument is that such

industries are better able to cope with the inevitable reputational

externalities involved in producing high-quality goods for foreign markets.

     Is there any empirical evidence in support of this proposition?

Fortunately, South Korea and Taiwan provide as close a controlled experiment

for testing the hypothesis as can be hoped for in economics. Starting from a

tiny base, bothcountries have been phenomenally successful in expanding and

diversifying their manufactured exports. Their trade and macroeconomic

policies have been broadly similar, as are their income levels. Yet, the two

countries are radically different in their patterns of industrial

organization. Korean industry is dominated by a handful of large

 conglomerates, and firm-concentration ratios are uniformly higit. In Taiwan,

 large conglomerates are the exception rather than the rule, and individual
                                      -3-

industries are typically less concentrated than their Korean counterparts.

Given this difference, it would be very surprising indeed if their respective

trade patterns did not reflect it somehow. In light of the considerations

discussed above, this paper looks for evidence of differential performance

with respect to product quality.   I find strong support for the hypothesis

that industrial organization and product quality are related in the expected

manner: the quality of Korean manufactured exports--with quality proxied by

unit value--is systematically higher than that of Taiwanese exports.

     The outline of the paper is as follows. The next section sketches out a

simple theory which relates product quality to the number and size

distribution of firms in an exporting industry. Section III compares briefly

the industrial organization patterns in South Korea and Taiwan, and discusses

some of the reasons behind the differences. Analyzing the two, countries'

exports to the U.S., section IV presents evidence on their divergent

performance with respect to product quality. The paper ends with concluding

comments in section V.



II. Product quality and Industrial qryanization: A Theoretical Sketch

     New entrants into high-end product categories typically face an entry

barrier altogether different from the usual obstacles. Perceived product

quality is an important component of demand for such products; to be Judged

high-quality by consumers, entrants must invest in reputation or other means

of communicating quality. The problem is even more serious for firms from

developing countries, as they may have to surmount a reputation for shoddy

quality frequently associated with developing-country goods.1
                                     -4-

     Such informational barriers to entry have been the subject of a number of

theoretical papers. In the simplest framework, one could imagine that

(foreign) consumers' familiarity with quality increases with cumulated

exposure to the product in question. Provided the actual quality level of

home exports exceeds the perceived level, there may then be a role for export

subsidies to speed up the process of product familiarization (Mayer. 1984).

When domestic firms are differentiated by quality, high-end firms can try to

signal quality by selling at low prices initially (in anticipation of future

profits); subsidies can facilitate such signalling strategies, at an overall

welfare gains to the home economy (Bagwell and Staiger, 1986). But the

problem is that subsidies may also encourage additional domestic firms to

enter at the low-end of the quality spectrum, failing to improve the perceived

quality of home exports, and increasing the cost to high-quality producers of

distinguishing themselves from their low-quality counterparts (Grossman and

Horn, 1987). In all these cases, the transition to higher-quality products is

hampered by informational entry barriers.

     These papers do not consider directly the importance of domestic market

structure in determining the average level of product quality in exports. A

recent article by Chiang and Masson (1988), motivated specifically by policy

discussions in Taiwan, focuses on this issue in the context of a simple model

of reputational externalities in product quality. Their basic point is that

concentrated industries will do a better job of internalizing these, and that

 they will therefore tend to produce at the higher end of the quality spectrum.



 1. On country stereotyping with respect to product quality, see for example
 Khanna (1986).
                                        -5-

In what follows, I will base my argument on the same point, and sketch out a

similar model with a few additional twists.

        Consider an industry which is a price-taker in world markets and which

exports all of its output. Since my objective is to trace the effects of

industry structure on product quality, I will take as given the overall size

of the industry and the size distribution of firms within it.      This is

tantamount to assuming fixed capacities and full capacity utilization. Let

the price received by each firm be a linear function of perceived quality,
                                                                                   p1
—   4. where   i indexes firms. Marginal costs of production are linear in

output, but increasing and convex in actual quality. qj       For ease of

exposition, I let these costs be quadratic. What is the relationship between

perceived and actual quality? I assume that j     will   generally lie somewhere

in between the firm's actual quality Cci and the averaEe quality ()         of   home

exports:


(1) 4      —    + (l-)q,
where      is (for now) taken to be fixed. As a firm's perceived quality level

(and hence price) will be based partly on other exporters' quality choices,

this formulation introduces the externality which drives this section's

results. The average quality level is simply


         —
(2)
             Xsjq.
where s is firm j's (fixed) share in industry output.

        Letting x denote the firm's (fixed) level of output, profits can be

written as
                                                  -6-

                       -
(3)    ,r


which yields the first-order condition for quality:


('i)   i       $       + (l)s.
Notice that the social optimum would require the reputational externality to

be eliminated by setting               equal to         in which case the equilibrium level

of      would be unity, irrespective of the firm's market share. As can be seen

from (4), this case can be recovered in this framework when #—l, i.e. when

firms can costlessly and perfectly communicate their individual quality levels

to foreign consumers. Notice that                 denotes the weight attached to own-

quality level in foreigners' perceptions. As long as 4rCl, quality involves a

positive externality, and firms' quality level will lie below unity. In the

worst possible scenario, when firms are branded by the average quality level

of the home industry (—O),                 will equal the firm's share in the industry.

In general, larger firms will choose higher levels of quality.

       We can now investigate the effects of industry structure on average

product quality. Suppose that                is identical across firms. In the present

 framework, average quality then turns out to be a simple linear function of

 the Herfindahl index of concentration. Using (2) and (4) in conjunction with

            1, we get


 (5)    q          +   (l-*)H,

 where H —                 is   the Herfindahl index. As q is increasing in H, more

 concentrated industries will operate at higher quality levels than less

 concentrated ones. For a given scale of industry output, the Herfindahl                 index
                                                                  -7-

is influenced both by the number of firms and the size distribution of firms,

so both factors will come into play in determining q. Notice also that

whether a firm operates below or above the industry-wide average will depend

on the relationship between its market share and H:


(6)       -
              q —      1-[i             -
                                                H].

Therefore,             > q whenever s > H.

       As a tiny step towards added realism, consider now the case where firms

can invest in advertising, marketing/distributional channels, brand names, and

the like in order to differentiate their image from other firms' in the home

industry. Let the amount of such investment be denoted by f1.                                I assume that

investment of this type serves to close the gap between actual and perceived

quality. In the present framework, this amounts to letting                                 be an increasing

function of                So we can write —                      (f1),   with *(O)—O, (m)—1, '—   8/8f>O,
and ''—       a2/af2cO.             Firm profits now become


(7) w —                -
                                                 fj,
with      defined as before in (1). Since it may not pay for a firm to invest

in reputation-building, we associate the Lagrange multiplier                                with fj and

write the Lagrangean expression as


(8) L —       [i   -
                                                f     +   .Xfi.

The first-order condition for                                 remains unchanged from (4)--except that     is

no longer a constant. With respect to


(9) x'(q - q)               -   1   +       A   — 0.
                                                -8-

Notice that for firms that operate at or below average quality (q -               q   S 0)

this equality requires that A > 0, implying             —    — 0.     For low-end firms, it

simply does not pay to communicate their true quality levels, as this hampers

their free ride on higher-quality firms,

       As (9) shows, firms that choose to invest in "reputation" will be those

with sufficiently high quality relative to the average.2 From our earlier

discussion, these will be the firms with larger market shares. For such firms

A —    0, and we have

(9) x'(q -                q) — 1.

Since 'b' '    is   negative by assumption, high levels of          will be associated with

high levels of fj.

       To determine the effect on the average level of quality in the industry,

let us divide firms into two groups, one for which f —              0, and the other for
which I >      0.       Denote the second set by T (for top-quality firms). Since (0)
— 0, we have


           —             sf + Zje'r [jSj +
(10)
               Xj'r
where         denotes #(fj). This yields


           — H      +               -

where H is once again the Herfindahl index. If firms were unable to

distinguish themselves from their competitors     would equal H (as (O) —    0).
As (11) shows, the ability to communicate their true quality--as partial and

costly it may be- -raises the average quality level of exports.

     The bottom-line of this discussion is that, everything else being the

same, we would expect more concentrated industries to produce and export a

higher quality range of products. When firms have the ability to build

reputation and brand loyalty, the expectation is that the quality differential

between concentrated and unconcentrated industries will be even larger: this

is because the incentive to undertake such investments depends on how skewed

the size distribution of firms (and hence the quality distribution) is in the

first place.

     To be sure, the model presented here is no more than a parable. It

focusses on only one possible link between industry structure and product-

quality choice. We should certainly not expect it to provide great

explanatory power regardless of context. But I suspect that for many

developing countries the considerations raised here are likely to be important

ones. Therefore, it would be useful to see if there is evidence which

supports the basic hypothesis. Before I go on to discuss the evidence from

Korean and Taiwanese exports, however, I provide a brief overview of

industrial organization in the two countries.



III. Industrial Or2anizatjpn in South Korea and Taiwan

     Probably nothing better illustrates the difference in the industrial

organization of the the two countries than the fact that South Korea has

eleven firms in the Fortune International 500 compared to Taiwan's three.3

Some of the major Korean conglomerates are now becoming

industrialized countries (Hyundai, Samsung), while even sophisticated

consumers would be hard pressed to come up with the name of a single Taiwanese

firm. This despite the facts that Korer GNP per capita     is a quarter lower

than Taiwans and that the overaLl magnitude of the two countries' exports are

similar.

      The differences in the industrial structures of the two countries have

received little attention to date, with few notable exceptions.    In his

comparative account of economic development in the two countries, Tibor

Scitovsky (1986) focussed on these differences1 and stressed that the

Taiwanese economy is organized much more along free-market lines   than is the

Korean one, with much greater competition among firms in the former     country.4

In a series of papers based on case studies of Taiwanese and Korean     firms,

Brian Levy has investigated the implications of market structure on strategies

and likely success of these firms in foreign markets (Levy 1987, Levy and Kuo

1987a and b). He finds that firm strategies are predictably influenced by

size, but that small size has not adversely affected the ability of Taiwanese



 3. The Korean firms in the top 500, with their ranks in parentheses, are:
 Samsung (21), Ltcky-Go1dstar (37), Daewoo (39), Sunkyong (82), Ssangyong
 (152), Korea Explosives (182), Hyundai Heavy Industries (187), Hyosung (195)
 Pohang Iron & Steel (216), Hyundai Motor Company (261), and Doosan (431). The
 three Taiwanese companies are Chinese Petroleum (104), Nan Ya Plastics (467),
 and China Steel (489).

 4.  Scitovsky takes it on faith that more competitive industries will perform
 better. But he is forced to conclude: "Ironically [sic), in Korea there is no
 evidence that the large profits and fast accumulation of great fortunes that
                                                                         the
 Korea's economic policies made possible had any unfavorable effects on
 drive, stamina, and efficiency of Korea's businesses." He   concludes, in what
 would easily give cultural explanations a bad name, by saying "[p]erhaps this
 is due to the Chinese cultural background" (1986, p. 151).
                                      -11-

firms to break into high-technology markets, at least when investment

requirements are no too large.

     Direct, comparative evidence on industrial organization patterns in the

two countries is hard to come by. Table 1 summarizes the broad size

distribution of enterprises in manufacturing industry. Because the size

distribution is not sufficiently disaggregated, the data here are not

particularly meaningful. They show that large enterprises (300 or more

employees) account for 64 percent of total value added in Korea compared with

59 percent in Taiwan. The share of small enterprises (5-19 employees) is 4

percent in Korea and 8 percent in Taiwan. These numbers do not point to a

great discrepancy between the two economies, but this is highly misleading.

For one thing, the table excludes the smallest firms (with less than five

employees), as statistics are not compiled on such firms in Korea--which in

itself is meaningful. These smallest firms account for almost half the total

number of manufacturing firms in Taiwan. More importantly, the Korean

industrial censuses collect data at the establishment (plant, factory,

workshop. etc.) level rather than the firm or enterprise level (as in Taiwan).

This naturally biases the Korean concentration figures downwards. Moreover,

the preponderance in the Korean economy of the chaebul (conglomerates)

spanning diverse activities across sub-sectors introduces another important

source of downward bias. In 1985, the top five cahebul accounted for 27.0

percent of Korean manufactured exports, and the top thirty 41.3 percent (Lee,

1988, Table 20). There are few such giants in the Taiwanese economy. As a

consequence, the figures in Table 1 greatly underestimate the degree of

concentrition in Korea.

     There are other indicators that suggest that the extent of competition in
                                       -12-

Taiwanese industries surpasses that in Korea. Scitovsky (1996, p. 146) draws
the following interesting comparison: between 1966 and 1976 the number of

manufacturing firms in Taiwan increased by 150 percent while the number of

empoyees per firm increased by 29 percent; in Korea, the number of firms

increased only by 10 percent, while average firm size (measured again by

employees) increased by 176 percent. The relative ease of entry into

Taiwanese industries is also corroborated by the high rate of bankruptcy in

that country (Scitovsky, 1986, p. 151). In Korea, by contrast, bankruptcy is

legally not even recognized, and business failure carries great moral stigma

extending beyond the entrepreneur to his family (Michell, 1983. pp. 168-169).

       The reasons behind these divergent patterns of industrial organization

are due partly to historical circumstance and partly to policy. Among the

former, possibly the key role in Taiwan was played by the immigration of

overseas Chinese who brought substantial capital with them (30 percent of the

total inflow of foreign capital) and used it to establish new enterprises

(Scitovsky, p. 146). With respect to policy, the Taiwanese government's

attitude has beet much more benign towards small enterprises, and there has

been little overt support for large firms. In Korea, the situation has been

quite different. "Since l961, writes Michell (1983, p. 168), "it has been

the continual mission of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry (of Korea] to

prevent what is termed 'reckless overcompetition' '    Given the transactions

cost of dealing with governmental bureaucracies, it is also likely that the

more active role of the Korean government in industry (in credit allocation,

for   example) would have served to discriminate against small and medium firms,
even when policy had no such objective (see Levy, 1986). taking some license
with   terminology, it can be said that "industrial policy" favored industrial
                                      - 13-

consolidation in Korea and was indifferent to firm size in Taiwan.



IV. Evidence on Product quality from US, ImDorts

     I now turn to discuss the available evidence on product quality in Korean

and Taiwanese exports. Note first that by most relevant criteria, Taiwan is

the more developed of the two from an economic perspective (see Table 2).

Most important from our perspective, Taiwan is comparatively rich in human

skills and education by virtue of having been an early-starter compared to

Korea. As Table 2 shows, Korea now appears to have caught up with Taiwan in

terms of £iQ additions to the educated workforce, but the latter country is

still endowed with a proportionately larger stock of skilled and educated

workers. On these grounds, then, we would expect Taiwan to be further along

the transition to high-end products than Korea. The industrial-organization

effects discussed above go in the opposite direction.

     To check for systematic differences in product-quality, I examine the

unit values for the two countries' exports to the United States,
                                                                   disaggregated
at an appropriate level. A critical maintained hypothesis is that unit values

are a good proxy for quality. For manufactured exports of the type that will

be the focus of the analysis, this seems to be a sensible working hypothesis.5

The analysis is restricted to the U.S. market in order to obtain
                                                                   closely-
comparable trade data for the two countries. The U.S. is by far the largest

export market for both countries, accounting for roughly a half of total



5.  I have also computed unit values for Japanese exports to the U.S. These
are almost without exception higher than those for the two countries. This is
consistent with what we know regarding Japan's successful transition to
products at the very high end of the quality spectrum.
                                       -16-

sales. It is unlikely that substantial biases are introduced by restricting

attention to the U.S.

     Selecting the level of disaggregation at which the comparison of unit

values is carried out requires care. At too aggregate a level, there is

always the danger of comparing apples with oranges. At a too flaggregated

level, on the other hand, the quality range of the product in question may be

needlessly compressed, leaving out useful information about the upper and

lower end of the range.6 I have chosen an intermediate level of

disaggregation, using the four-digit Schedule A classification for U.S. import

statistics (FT 150) .   These import data are recorded on a "customs value"

basis, defined as "the price actually paid or payable for merchandise when

sold for exportation in the United States, excluding U.S. import duties,

freight, insurance and other charges incurred in bringing the merchandise to

the United States.      In order to focus on products which are important

exports for the two countries, I restrict the analysis to categories in which

at least one of the countries had exports to the U.S. exceeding $100 million.

In 1986, there were forty-nine such product groups. Exports included in these

groups amount to $9.6 billion for Korea and $14.5 billion for Taiwan. a

substantial part of each country's total exports to the U.S.

      Table 3 lists the respective unit values for each of these forty-nine



 6. For example, the highly detailed seven-digit TSUSA classification contains
 categories such as: "moccasins, soled, leather, for women, not over $2.50
 pair" (emphasis added).

 7.  The description further adds, helpfully: "In the case of transactions
 between related parties, the relationship between buyer and seller should not
 influence the Customs value."
                                         -1.5-


categories for the two countries. The product groups are ranked in ascending

order of (proportional) difference between Korean and Taiwanese unit values.

A quick glance at the table reveals clearly that Korean exports tend to have

higher unit values than Taiwanese exports. Thirty of the forty-nine products

exhibit higher unit values in Korean exports. Moreover, all of the larger

discrepancies in unit values are in favor of Korea. The unweighted average

differential between Korean and Taiwanese unit values is 27 percent. On the

basis of weighted averages, Korean exports command a price premium of 19

percent (Korean export weights) to 22 percent (Taiwanese export weights) over

Taiwanese exports.

      Is the observed discrepancy in unit values statistically significant? An

appropriate statistical test here is the Wilcoxon signed-ranks test, which

takes into account both the frequency with which Korean unit values exceed

Taiwanese ones id the relative magnitudes of the discrepancies.8 Using this

test, the null hypothesis that Taiwanese unit values are at least as high as

Korean unit values is decisively rejected at the 5 percent confidence level,

with a z-value of 2,75. Notice that this is a particularly stringent test of

our hypothesis, as a priori we would expect Taiwanese products to be   of higher

quality than Korean ones on all grounds but industrial organization.

      A related implication of the model is that Korean exporters would be more

 likely to specialize at the high-end of the quality spectrum across broad

 product categories, as they possess a comparative advantage   there relative to

 Taiwan. Figure 1 shows that this is indeed the case. Ranking product groups

 by Japanese unit values to establish a rough quality hierarchy, we find that




 8.   See DeGroot (1975), pp. 483-486.
                                       -16-

the distribution of Korean exports is relatively skewed towards the top end.

Twenty-nine percent of Korea's (included) exports are inthe "top" quality

range (unit values greater than $10,000), compared to twenty-one percent for

Taiwan. Korea has fifty percent of its exports at the low end (unit values

$5,000 or lower) and Taiwan sixty percent.

     A further test of a different nature would be to see whether the

differences in unit values are proportionately more
                                                          pronounced in products for
which quality p.ays an important role. Remember that, in terms of our model,

industrial-organization becomes important only when quality is a predominant

characteristic of the product group in question.      Unfortunately, there is no

clearcut way of determining the products for which this is       likely to be true.
A short-cut is to assume that higher unit values are associated with
                                                                           "quality-
intensive" products. Using Japanese unit values to rank industries by this

criterion, the following regression results are obtained:


    PREM —   -1.03 + 0.15    ln(JAP)
                    (0.06)                    R2 — 0.11      N — 49


where PREtI is the Korean unit-value premium over Taiwan (in percent) and JAP

is the Japanese unit value for the corresponding product group. The standard

error of the slope coefficient is in parentheses. This suggests that the

Korean quality advantage over Taiwan increases as we move      up from low-end to

high-end products. A doubling of the average level of product quality- -as

measured by unit values of Japanese exports- -is associated with an increase in

the Korean price premium over Taiwan of 15 percent. This finding is

consistent with the discussion in section II.
                                      -17-

     To sum up. these data reveal an interesting divergence in the export

performance of the two countries.9 It is of course entirely possible that

these findings reflect some other unidentified statistical quirks. For

example. Taiwanese exporters could be prone to under-invoicing. Or, the

relatively greater downstream integration of the Korean exporters in the U.S.

market nay lead to high transfer prices being set on these exports, Drovided

that it is viewed preferable to hold income in South Korea rather than in the

U.S. In any case, the hypothesis that quality differentials in the exports of

the two countries are systematically related to their industrial organization

patterns would appear to be worth closer look.



V. Conc1udin Remarks

     This paper has combined a simple- -perhaps simplistic- -   theory   with a

simple test. The findings are two-fold: (1) Korean exports tend to be

systematically of higher quality relative to Taiwanese exports, at least when

quality is proxied by unit value; and (ii) this is consistent with a model of

quality choice in which reputational externalities are less damaging in

heavily concentrated industries.

     A crucial final point concerns the normative aspect of the analysis.

Nothing that has been said here should be construed as advocacy of an

industrial policy that actively pursues concentration. Before we can go from

the positive analysis to policy prescription, we will need a more complete




9. Based on a quick look at 1975, it would appear that earlier years show the
same pattern as that of 1986. Among included categories, the Korean premium
In that year ranges from 20.1 percent (Taiwanese export weights) to 30.9
percent (Korean export weights).
                                     -18-

welfare analysis and a more complete model in which to carry it out. There

are at least two sets of reasons, besides policymatcers' obvious concern about

quality upgrading, to suspect that the findings here have normative

significance. First, higher-quality products may carry price premia exceeding

the additional cost of producing them, as excess profits serve as the carrot

needed to sustain quality levels (Shapiro, 1983). Public policies in pursuit

of such excess profits can potentially improve welfare. Secondly, there may

be significant skills generated as countries move up the quality spectrum, and

these may in turn create substantial positive externalities for the rest of

the economy. Once again, policy may have a role to play. If domestic

industrial structure and export performance are indeed linked, as the

preliminary results presented here would indicate, these would be fruitful

areas for further research.
