       This paper explores potential realization of gains by hospitals that are managed on a day-

to-day basis by external organizations under formal contracts. It draws from the incentives

literature, which postulates that managers of firms where ownership is separated from control will

employ an input mix that deviates from cost minimization. While this status applies to hospitals

generally, we hypothesize that specialized managerial expertise, coupled with the threat of non-

renewal, will improve efficiency in hospitals that opt for contract. Secondary data obtained from

the AHA Annual Surveys (1991-1998) are applied to examine the distribution of ‘expense

preference’ parameters for all contract management adopters both pre- and post-adoption. These

are contrasted with two control groups of hospitals drawn from the same years using propensity

score methods. Results reveal allocative inefficiency among both adoption and control groups

but a significantly lower change in the expense preference parameter pre- and post-adoption

associated with a staffing. This suggests that changes in incentive contracts are one important

strategy hospitals are using to cope with competitive pressures.

Introduction

While there is considerable literature on the impact of managed care and networking in U.S.

hospitals, other profound organizational changes affecting the industry have been largely

overlooked. In particular, the last two decades have seen a dramatic growth in “contract-

management” arrangements; to the point where nearly 20 percent of U.S. acute care hospitals

now fall within this category (see Figure 1). Under this arrangement an independent firm is

contracted to provide day-to-day management services in lieu of a salaried CEO. This

organizational form may be viewed as occupying an intermediate position between system

acquisition in which ownership is relinquished entirely and that of the freestanding hospital that

maintains full administrative and operational control. These hospitals venture to attain the

management, administrative, and operational benefits of the more tightly integrated system

hospitals while retaining the advantages of organizational autonomy. Specialized managerial

expertise, coupled with the threat of non-renewal, are expected to improve efficiency in hospitals

that opt for contracts. Despite the importance of this phenomenon, there is a paucity of evidence

on the efficiency gains from contract adoption.

       In this study we attempt to fill the gap by tracking changes in performance of adopters

and non-adopters over time. To derive an empirical test, we turn to the incentives literature,

which postulates that managers of firms where ownership is separate from control will employ

an input mix that deviates from cost minimization. While separation of ownership from control

applies in both our cases, we hypothesize that allocation of inputs to the production process will

be adhere more closely to cost-minimizing behavior under contracted managers. Our test is a

generalization of the method found in Mester (1989), whereby an ‘expense preference’

parameter associated with one of the firm’s inputs enters its cost function in a highly non-linear



                                                  1
fashion. Unlike Mester, we allow this parameter to vary across inputs, after deriving an

appropriate functional form. We derive a system of non-linear equations that consists of the cost

function and the input demand functions for labor and capital, broadly defined, and estimate

them jointly by method of non-linear seemingly unrelated regressions. Our model is more robust

than an earlier generalization due to Dor et al. (1997) since we further impose constraints on the

expense preference parameters that are consistent with linear homogeneity. It offers an

alternative to panel data estimations of hospital cost functions that identify managerial disparities

through hospital effects which confound them with other factors such as quality of care and

unmeasured case severity (Carey, 1997). Moreover, our quasi-experimental sample design

allows us to explicitly test for the stability of the expense preference parameter over time.

          We hypothesize that hospital behavior under management contract will reveal a more

efficient allocation of inputs to the hospital production process. Contract management has

continued to grow, and so have external constraints and accountability facing the hospital

industry. Better understanding of the behavior of this form of structural reorganization is an

important research direction in the ongoing study of organizational change in the health care

sector.


Background


Institutional contract management involves the daily running of the hospital by an external

organization under formal contract. The managing organization reports directly to the board of

trustees or owners of the hospital, which retains ownership of assets as well as legal rights and

responsibilities. The management firm supplies an administrator and often a management team

as well as other support services that may provide marketing, recruitment, strategic planning,




                                                 2
legal, and/or financial expertise. Contract management in the hospital industry is dominated by a

handful of large firms, some of which manage dozens of hospitals at any given time (Scott,

1994). Institutional contract management is not limited to the hospital industry. In the realm of

education, recent interest has appeared in the management of public schools by for-profits and

entrepreneurship is growing among education companies. In the 1997-1998 school year,

approximately 60 publicly funded elementary and secondary schools were run by for-profit

firms.

         Prior literature has been anecdotal or descriptive, involving small samples only. Rundall

and Lambert (1984) and Alexander and Rundall (1985) looked at matched samples before and

after adoption, and reported lower proportions of expenses due to payroll in public hospitals

under contract management. Wheeler and Zuckerman (1984) studied pre- and post-adoption

samples for 21 contract-managed hospitals. They found a reduction in number of employees per

occupied bed in the post-test sample, as well as reduction in the variability of this measure,

suggesting enhanced control over staffing patterns as well as improved organizational stability.

Together these studies at least suggest that labor should be treated as a ‘preferred’ input by less

efficient managers. Other descriptive studies suggested that efficiency gains from contract

adoption might be more general. For instance Dor (1994) found lower expenses per admission,

per bed, and per FTE following contract adoption in the late 1980s. One reason cited was the

importance of efficiency from a financial standpoint for the purpose of gaining access to

managed care contracts.

         However these latter studies lacked a comparison group again making it difficult to rule

out the possibility that some historical event other than adoption itself was responsible for the

change. A more comprehensive work that accounted for paired comparisons both pre- and post-




                                                 3
adoption is that of Kralewski, Dowd, Pitt, and Biggs (1984). This study showed no difference in

changes in staffing ratios or payroll expenses between the two groups. It did show improved

financial health related to markups of services by contract managers but no evidence of

efficiency improvement following from decreases in expenses. Thus to date, the evidence

remains inconclusive.

       To derive a more complete test we build from the incentives literature, which postulates

that when ownership of the firm is removed from control, managers may not be driven by profit

maximization. Rather they may be motivated to maximize utility, and consequently have a

positive preference for expenditures on items such as more staff and higher managerial wages.

While separation of ownership from control applies to hospitals in general, we hypothesize that

allocation of inputs to the production process will be more efficient under contracted

management arrangements rather than under conventional salaried administrators.

       The issue of separation of management and control of the firm has been examined more

widely in the empirical literature, where results have been mixed. Edwards (1977) developed an

early ‘intercept’ test for expense preference tied to specific inputs. He found that salaried

managers opted for higher expenditures on labor compared with manager-owners. Hannan and

Mavinga (1980) applied this test to other institutional settings in the banking industry, and found

similar results. Awh and Primeaux (1985) developed a model applicable to the electric utility

industry; their results provided evidence contrary to expense preference. Blair and Placone

(1988) and Mester (1989) tested the hypothesis in the savings and loan industry, and found no

evidence of expense preference behavior in mutuals, compared with lending institutions with

shareholders who are presumed to exercise tighter control of management. However, Mester’s

study represented a major methodological shift from the earlier body of work, as she was critical




                                                 4
of the notion that preferences could be revealed from an intercept term in the firm’s input

demand function. She suggested that preferences would permeate the production process as a

whole. Thus, she derived a more general test in which an input-specific inefficiency parameter

appears as a highly nonlinear argument in the firm’s cost function. As with Edward’s original

work, she associated expense preference behavior with labor demand. Dor, Duffy, and Wong

(1997) provide a further generalization of Mester’s model, whereby the firms’ cost function is

estimated jointly with the demand function for the input hypothesized to be preferred. While

their model did not yet develop the full set of constraints appropriate for the system of non-linear

equations, it demonstrated that results could change quite dramatically depending upon the

particular input being studied.

        In this study, we rectify the constraints problem, and present more robust estimation.

We again use the setting of contract management, but for a more recent and longer time-series

than previously considered. We further expand earlier work by incorporating all contract-

managed hospitals and contrasting them with a comparison group of hospitals that never

adopted, but have the same longitudinal distribution. Moreover, the current sample design

allows us to explicitly test for the stability of the inefficiency parameter over time. Finally, in

recognition of the notion that hospitals do not enter randomly into contract management, we use

propensity score methods in drawing the control group.


Methods


In this section we detail the development of our empirical test of input-specific inefficiency. Let

C* = cost under cost-minimization, and S i* = optimal share of input i in total cost. Then




                                                  5
          J
C * = ∑Wi * X i*
         i =1

         Wi * X i*
S i* =
          C*

Where Wi* is the market determined input price for the i’th input, and X i* is the level of input i

if cost-minimization is satisfied. For convenience we will assume that there is only one preferred

input, which managers may choose to allocate inefficiently. Let X i* denote the preferred input,

using the operator X j = (1 + z j ) X *j to denote deviations from the optimal level1; substituting

and rearranging yields:



C = C * (1 + z j S *j )                                   [1]

                  1+ zj
S j = S *j                                                [2]
                (1 + z j S *j )

Where C and S j are the observed costs and input share, and z j is an inefficiency parameter to

be estimated. A number of observations can be made. First, from [1] and [2] it is immediately

obvious that the following condition applies

              If z j = 0, then S j = S *j , and C = C *

Evaluating the limits of equation [2] we get

    Note that this is simply the parameterization of the more general result X ≥ X *j . The profit maximizing
                                                                              j

firm will set inputs such that P · MPj,. For the utility maximizer such that U=U(π, Xj) where π is profit,
wage exceeds the marginal value product of the ‘preferred’ input.


                                                                6
           lim S j = 1
           z j →∞

            lim S k = 0
           z k → −1

The first condition states that if zj=0, i.e. no expense preference occurs, then the observed cost

and the observed input shares are equal to their respective optimal values. The second condition

states that if expense preference is ‘absolute’, i.e., approaches infinity, then the preferred input

becomes the only input in the cost function. Further note that as the share of the preferred input

increases, the share of the alternative input k necessarily declines. Evaluating the limits for the

relevant preference parameter zk implies that it can take on small negative values, up to the cut

off points zk > -1. We will refer to preference parameters at that range as ‘non-preference’

values2. While C * , S *j and consequently the z’s are unobservable to the researcher, it is

possible to parameterize these in terms of existing variables using well-known functional forms3.

A general form is given by the translog cost function:

                                                                                                         [3]

                                       n                     n    n
                                                        1
ln C = α 0 + α 1 ln Y + α 2 (ln Y ) 2 + ∑ β i ln wi +       ∑∑          β ij ln wi ln w j +   ∑γ   i   ln wi ln Y
                                      i =1              2   i =1 j =1                         i




2
    It can easily be shown that the same boundary condition, -1 ≤ z < ∞, applies to multiple inputs (n>2),
for any zi , provided that one of the preferred inputs approaches infinity faster than other inputs. A special

case arises when all zi move at the same rate. In this case, for any input we have S j = S *j , but C > C * .

Since all relative shares remain the same, this can be interpreted to mean that allocative inefficiency may
not occur. At the same time, since all inputs are equally overused, technical inefficiency occurs, with
total costs exceeding the least cost optimum.

3
    This is akin to multiple cause-multiple indicator models. See Van Vliet and Van Praag (1987).


                                                        7
where Y = output and wi is the factor price of the i’th input. By Shephard’s lemma, the share of

input i in costs is given by its elasticity. Hence

       ∂ln(C)                         n
Sj =            = β j + β jj ln w j + ∑ β ij ln wi + γ j ln Y                                    [4]
       ∂ ln w j                      i≠ j


Equations [3] and [4] can be estimated jointly by method of seemingly unrelated regression (e.g.,

Berndt and Christensen, 1973). Note that with multiple inputs, equation [4] can itself be

regarded as a vector of equations. In any event, one input share equation is omitted from the

estimation since ∑ S i = C .

Substituting these into equation [1] and equation [2]

                                                                                         [3’]

Equations [3’] and [4’] present a constrained optimization problem. The translog cost function

and corresponding input share are nested within this problem. Thus the usual constraints of linear




                                                             8
homogeneity and homotheticity apply (see Table 1). Combining the limiting cases from [1] and

[2] we have the further constraint that z > -1.

         An important observation is that equation [3’] is virtually identical to the model presented

in Mester [1989]. However, Mester did not consider the relationship between the cost function

and input share equations in this highly non-linear setting. From an examination of [3’] and [4’]

it is immediately obvious that the zs are determined simultaneously by these equations.

Estimates can be obtained by the method of iterative seemingly unrelated non-linear regressions.

Gallant (1987) has shown that this method is equivalent to maximum likelihood estimation.

Note that in the 2 input case [3’] and [4’] are greatly simplified when one zj is estimated each

time, as would necessarily be the case when only two inputs are considered. This is summarized

in Table 1.


Data and Sample Design


         The majority of data for this study come from the American Hospital Association (AHA)

Annual Survey Database for the years 1991-1998. The dependent variable is total hospital

expenses. The AHA data isolates labor costs but not capital costs4. This allows us to incorporate

two inputs into the models: labor and non-labor5. While input prices are not available directly

from the data, we constructed measures of these by dividing labor costs by full-time equivalent

employees and non-labor costs by the number of facility beds. Output is measured as adjusted

inpatient days. The patient variable is the number of inpatient admissions with outpatient



4
  Labor costs are defined as the sum of total facility payroll expenses and total facility employee benefits.
Unfortunately the survey does not provide a breakdown of expenses by type of labor, so that this category covers
registered nurses, licensed practical nurses, and administrative staff.
5
  Capital expenditures are a small part of the residual input. Depreciation plus interest accounted for eight percent of
total expenses in 1993, the latest year for which the AHA data reported on capital expenditures. Labor costs made
up 54 percent of the total for 1993.


                                                           9
services transformed into inpatient unit equivalents using a known formula and loaded onto

inpatient variables6. We did this in order to fully account for the hospitals’ output, while keeping

the specification as parsimonious as possible to ensure model convergence. In order to control

for product heterogeneity, we entered the Medicare diagnosis related group (DRG) case-mix

index obtained from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (formerly Health Care

Financing Administration) public use files. Average length of stay is also entered to control for

variation in output not captured by the adjusted patient days and case mix variables. Finally, we

include three binary variables that have been shown to explain cost variation among hospitals

and/or by which adopters appear to differ from non-adopters: rural location, government control,

and nonprofit status. Descriptive statistics are listed in Table 2. All financial variables are

converted to 1998 dollars.

         Our methods involve examining expense preference behavior for contract managed

hospitals and comparing them to those with conventional management structures. To that effect,

we created four hospital samples. Two contain contract-managed hospitals. The first of these

includes data on hospitals for the year falling two years before they first reported being contract-

managed (pre-contract sample). The second contains information for the year coming two years

following first reporting, allowing the hypothesized behavior of contract-adopting hospitals a

period of adjustment (post-contract sample). Because results of models estimated on these

samples are conditional on hospitals that eventually adopted contract management, we also

created two control groups of hospitals that never reported being contract-managed,

corresponding to the same time periods (pre-control and post-control samples).




6
  The AHA adjusted discharges variable is the product of discharges and the ratio of total revenue to inpatient
revenue.


                                                         10
       One thousand three hundred and sixty-five hospitals reported being contract-managed

during one or more of the years 1991-1998. Since the sample design calls for information on

pre-contract hospitals for two years prior to the adoption year, that sample includes those 278

hospitals that adopted contract management during the period 1993-1998, for which a full set of

data was available. Hence the pre-contract sample spans the years 1991-1996. The post-contract

sample contains data for the 215 hospitals whose apparent adoption year was between 1992 and

1996 and for which all data elements were non-missing. The post-contract sample represents the

years 1994-1998, or two years following adoption. One hundred and fifty-eight hospitals appear

in both samples. Because specialty hospitals produce different services and have distinct

technologies, the four samples were limited to nonfederal hospitals classified as general medical

and surgical.

       For the pre-control and post-control groups, we chose random samples without

replacement of non-adopters numbering three times the numbers of adopters. Because the

sampling strategy involves drawing all hospitals that adopted contract management, and because

those hospitals differ in profile from internally managed hospitals, the drawing of a simple

random sample was unlikely to produce a good match. More specifically, as seen below, a

relatively high proportion of contract-managed hospitals are rural. These hospitals are also more

likely to be government-affiliated hospitals, less likely to be not-for-profit, are lower in case-mix

index, and have longer lengths of stay.

       In order to account for these various differences, we used propensity scores to reduce bias

in the comparisons. Propensity score methods are commonly used in observational studies in

which the experimental unit of interest lacks the benefits of randomization. Consequently, the

‘treatment’ group and the randomized control group may differ systematically across a number




                                                 11
of covariates (Rosenbaum and Rubin 1984; D’Agostino 1998; Imbens 2000). The propensity

score, defined here as the conditional probability of adopting contract management, can be used

to balance the distribution of covariates between the contract and control groups. Because the

propensity score is a scalar function of the covariates, it overcomes a significant drawback to

standard techniques of adjustment through stratification, which can use only a limited number of

covariates in the adjustment. By summarizing information into a scalar, stratification on it alone

can match the distribution across many covariates. (Refer to Appendix for further discussion.)


Results


       The full set of parameter values for the model including the labor input equation is

reported in Table 3. The estimation procedure incorporated two empirical themes. First, we

attempted to look at the effect of contract adoption on hospital efficiency. To this end, we obtain

separate estimates of the input-specific preference parameter in the pre-contract and post-

contract period, for hospitals that ultimately ended up adopting contracts. Second, we aim to

verify that the findings were not related to technological changes that occurred over time,

independently of contract adoption. We therefore repeat the estimation for a matched control

group with an identical longitudinal distribution, and compare the inefficiency parameter in the

simulated ‘pre’ and ‘post’ periods. In addition, we implemented the same estimation strategy for

the non-labor input. Parameter estimates were similar, with the important exception of the

preference parameters, which by construction must take on smaller values. To avoid

redundancy, we do not present the full set of results here. Rather we summarize the results for

all the ztj parameters in Table 4. All of the regression models were estimated by method of

non-linear iterative seemingly unrelated regressions (non-linear ITSUR). Start values were



                                                12
obtained from linear ITSUR models in which the parameter ztj is set to zero. All models took 14

to 16 interactions to converge.

         It is immediately apparent from an examination of Table 3 that labor is a preferred input,

with all ztj > 0. For contract adopters the values of this parameter fell from 0.98 in the pre-

contract period to 0.71 in the post-contract period, indicating a reduction in labor-specific

inefficiency due to adoption of the contract. The results become even more pronounced in

comparison with the matched control group. For this group, z rises from 0.54 in the pre-period

to 1.13 in the post-period. Thus in the absence of contract adoption the degree of inefficiency

would have actually increased over the same time span7.

         Table 4 summarizes these results as well as results for the inefficiency parameters of the

residual input. The latter set of estimates were always negative, but within the permissible range.

The table further demonstrates that when there is a decrease (increase) in the value of

inefficiency for the ‘preferred’ input, there is a concomitant decrease (increase) in the value of

‘non-preference’ for the residual input. The interpretation of these results should be treated with

caution. These results pertain to a summation of non-labor inputs categories that could not be

identified in the data, due to changes in the AHA survey in the 1990’s. It is possible that for

some specific activities subsumed into this category positive values would have been found for

corresponding inefficiency parameters. For instance, capital investments, known anecdotally to

comprise about 7-8 percent of total spending in U.S. hospitals, is a likely ‘preferred’ input. The

  The notion that excess staffing occurs in hospitals has also appeared in related literature (e.g. Mobley and
Magnussen, 2002). Recently the trade literature has begun to focus on the problem of nurse ‘shortage’ in hospitals,
suggesting that hospitals tend to under employ nurses (Green and Nordhaus-Bike, 1997). However this concern is
limited to certain high-end specialties of registered nurses, and does not seem to apply to licensed practical nurses,
nurse-aides and the like. Moreover, even for registered nurses as a whole the national trend has been that of
increased employment in hospitals during most of the period observed in our data (Buerhaus and Staiger, 1999).

significance Table 4 is in demonstrating how our estimation procedure conforms to the boundary

conditions defined in the previous section.

        We next investigate the significance of the difference in z between contract managed

hospitals pre- and post-adoption controlling for extraneous historical factors. This task is

complicated by the large number of hospitals that are common to both the pre-contract and post-

contract samples. While the contract-managed and control groups are entirely distinct, there are

158 hospitals that appear in both the pre-contract and post-contract samples and 299 hospitals in

both the pre-control and post-control samples. We are unable to apply the two-sample t-test for

the difference in parameters across regressions due to unknown covariances among the pre- and

post-parameter estimates.

        As an alternative strategy, we solve [4’] for zj (in the case of one preferred input) yielding

        z j , h = ( S *j , h − S j , h ) / S *j , h ( S j , h − 1)

where

        S *j , h = β j + 2 β jj ln W j , h + β jk ln Wk , h + γ j ln Yh                        [5]

where h indexes the hospital. Calculation of [5] yields the distribution of hospital specific values

of z. Our interest lies in the equation for which labor is the preferred input. Table 5 describes z

for this model. To facilitate comparisons across regressions, the hospitals common to both the

pre-contract and post-contract samples and to the pre-control and post-control samples are

separated, producing 158 and 299 matched pairs of hospital specific zs, respectively.

        We wish to evaluate the significance of a ‘management’ effect, or whether z differs for

contract-managed hospitals between pre- and post-adoption years, after netting out a trend effect.

For the hospitals represented in panel A, the first step in this evaluation is calculation of the

changes in the zs for each set of matched pairs. The result of the paired t-test performed on the


                                                                     14
change in z before and after contract adoption, appears in column (1) of Table 6. The average

difference, -0.28, is significant. Since z represents inefficiency, this suggests an efficiency gain

for these hospitals. Next, the second column shows that applying the paired t test to the

difference in z for the control groups results in a highly significant average difference of 0.58,

indicative of a decrease in efficiency. The third column compares the difference in the changes

in the means by application of the two-sample t test to the two sets of changes in z. Under the

assumption of unequal variances, the difference of –0.96 is, not surprisingly, highly significant.

This final result provides strong evidence of the existence of a ‘management’ effect in which

contract adoption results in improved efficiency after controlling for other factors affecting

hospital efficiency over time.

       In the case of the hospitals contained in the independent samples of Panel B, the

‘management’ effect can be expressed as

        ∆ = [( µ11 − µ 01 ) − ( µ10 − µ 00 )]                                                [6]

or the difference in z between pre- and post-adoption minus trend. In order to test the

significance of this effect, a two way analysis of variance is performed on binary variables M (1

= contract management; 0 = control), P (1 = post period; 0 = pre-period) and interaction M * P

according to the following regression:

        z = β 0 + β1M + β 2 P + β 3 M * P + ε .                                              [7]

The management effect, which is equivalent to µ11 − µ 01 − µ10 + µ 00 , can then be expressed as

        (β 0 + β1 + β 2 + β 3 ) − (β 0 + β1 ) − (β 0 + β 2 ) + β 0 = β 3 .                   [8]

This demonstrates that the significance of the management effect turns on β 3 , or the coefficient

on interaction M * P . Table 7 displays the regression results of equation [7]. The highly

significant negative term on the interaction effect points once again to the finding that netting out


                                                      15
the trend effect, the decrease in inefficiency for contract adopting hospitals is highly significant.

While a less powerful assessment than the case of matched pairs, analysis of the independent

samples still offers strong support for the hypothesis of improved efficiency associated with

contract management adoption.


Discussion


       In this study, we develop a general estimator of input-specific inefficiency that is well

suited for settings in which there are varying degrees of separation of ownership and control.

Unlike previous studies, which focused on either the cost function of the firm or on its input

demand functions, our approach is to estimate the two types of functions jointly. This imposes

added structure, allowing the highly non-linear estimator to converge quickly and efficiently.

Moreover, our analysis demonstrates that the degree of inefficiency depends critically on the

particular input suspected of being ‘preferred’. In our particular setting of adoption of contract

management arrangements, there is an added longitudinal dimension to the problem, since contract

adoptions occur in different years. To address this we create a matched control group of non-

adopters with the same longitudinal distribution.

       Turning to our results for U.S. hospitals, we find that labor is consistently a preferred

input. However, preference for labor declines significantly after the adoption of a contract. In

comparison, there is a marked increase in labor-specific inefficiency for non-adopters during the

same ‘simulated’ period. At the very least it can be stated that contract-managed hospitals did

not experience the increase in labor-specific inefficiency that occurred elsewhere in the industry.

Combined, these results suggest that contract-management firms are indeed able to introduce

efficiencies over conventional, salaried managers. These results have implications for other




                                                 16
service industries as well, particularly education, where contract management arrangements are

becoming more prevalent. It would appear that third-party contracts are a way by which boards

of predominantly non-profit institutions can impose greater market discipline on the institutions

they govern.

       As for the particular setting of hospitals, our results also pose new questions regarding

the process by which contract-managers capture efficiency gains. In particular, with the data

available to us we were unable to separate out specific activities such as capital investment from

the residual ‘non-labor’ expense category. To gain a better understanding of this process, it will

be useful to focus on more narrowly defined services that are at managerial discretion albeit at a

more descriptive level. We leave this to future research. Nevertheless, the example of contract-

management provided a useful application for our model, whereby a robust inefficiency

parameter for an input can be identified from a system of expenditure equations.

Appendix: Propensity Scores Calculation

       Propensity scores, or conditional probabilities of adopting contract management, were

estimated for each hospital using logistic regression. We performed two regressions

corresponding to the ‘pre’ and ‘post’ groups. The first regression included all available

observations for the adoption years 1993-1998 and the second included those for adoption years

1992-1996. We incorporated all variables used to explain variation in cost as covariates in the

logit regression. Table A1 shows the results of these regressions. Some interesting results

emerge. What matters in the distinction of contract adopters is ownership form and locality.

Contract management is on the order of two times as likely to be found among hospitals with

government control, non-profit status, or rural location.

       Using calculated propensity scores based on the regression results, stratification

proceeded by dividing the propensity scores into quintiles. In practice, stratum boundaries can

be based either on the propensity scores from the entire merged sample or else from the adoption

group alone. Following D’Agostino (1998), we based the stratum boundaries on quintiles of the

estimated propensity scores from the combined groups.

       Stratification also took into account the distribution of the contract-managed hospitals

over time. The control groups were finally drawn randomly within propensity score quintile-

year cells. We produced two control groups each containing three times the number of contract

adopters that matched the adopter groups’ distributions by propensity score quintile and year.

Table A2 shows the propensity score distributions.
