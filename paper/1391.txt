                The Role of Consumption in Economic Fluctuations



                                     ABSTRACT


         Consumption and income tend to move together; the correlation of

their first differences is about 0.14.     In most accounts, the correlation is

attributed to the upward slope of the consumption function.        When the public

is better off, they consume more.      But in the microeconomic theory of the

household, income is a variable chosen by the household.       Choosing to work

more, and   therefore   to consume less time away from work, is a sign of diminished

well being.    The structural relation between earnings and consumption should

have a   negative   slope.    The explanation of the observed positive correlation

of consumption and income must rest on shifts of the consumption—income

relation, not movements along it.     An examination of data for the U.S. in

the twentieth century shows that the slope of the consumption—income relation

has been approximately zero.      Shifts in consumer behavior explain the

positive observed correlation; they are an important, but not dominant, source

of overall fluctuations in the aggregate economy.

1.    The issues


     Consumption is the dominant component of BNP. A one percent
change in consumption is five times the size of a one percent

change in investment. This paper investigates whether the
behavior of consumers is an independent source of macroeconomic

fluctuations, or whether most disturbances come from other
sectors.

     Informal commentaries on the business cycle put considerable
weight on the independent behavior of consumption. It is
commonplace to hear of a business revival sparked by consumers.

On the other hand, all modern theories of fluctuations make the

consumer a reactor to economic events, not a cause of them.

Random shocks in technology are generally the driving force in
fully       articulated   models.

     This paper develops a framework where the distinction between

a movement along a consumption schedule and a shift of the
schedule is well defined. pplication of the framework to 20th
century American data shows that shifts of the consumption

schedule have probably been an important cause o-f lluctuations
but have probably not been the dominant source of fluctuations.

        I   consider   three sources of disturbances to the economy:


                                       1
     1. Shifts of the consumption schedule
    2. Shifts of the schedule relating spending in categories

other than consumption and military spending
    3. Shifts in military spending

The reason for the e>plicit examination of military spending is

that such spending is the only plainly exogenous major influence
on the economy. Movements in military spending reveal t      slopes

of the consumption and other spending schedules.
     My basic strategy is the following. Fluctuations in
military spending reveal the slope of the consumption—BNP

schedule. GNP rises with military spending——quite stably, GNP
has risen by about 62 cents for every dollar increase in military

spending. This conclusion is supported by data from years other
than major wars when resource allocation by command may have made
the consumption schedule irrelevant. But when GNP rises under

the stimulus of increased military spending, consumption actually
falls a little——the same dollar of military spending has

depressed consumption by about 7 cents.
     Under the reasonable assumption that higrter military
spending does not shift the consumption schedule, but only moves
consumers along the schedule, we can infer the slope a-f the

schedule from the ratio of the consumption change to the GNP

change. The slope is essentially zero.

                                S.
     Equipped with this knowledge, we can measure the shift of
the consumption schedule as the departure of co.'sumption from a
schedule with the estimated slope. My macn concern is the
absolute and relative importaice a-f these shifts.

     The effect 'f a consumption shift on GNP depends on the

slope c-f tht consumption schedule and also upon the slope 0-f the

schedule relating other spending to GNP. For this reason, it is
necessary to carry out a similar exercise for other spending.

Again, the way other spending changes when military spending
absorbs added resources is the way the slope can be inferred.

Historically, other spending has declined when military spending

has risen; investment, net exports, and non—military government
purchases are crowded out by military spending. For each dollar of
added military spending, other spending declines by about .O
cents. The inference is that the schedule relating other

spending to GNP has an important negative slope.
     Over the period studied here, the correlation of the change
in consumption and the change in GNP has been strong; the
correlation coefficient is 0.59. Similarly, the correlation of
the change in other spending and the change in GNF is strongly
positive at 0.61. The results of this paper explain all    of   the

correlation a-f consumption and GNP in terms of   the unexplained
shifts   in the two schedules and nore as the result o-f movements
along the consumption function. Even more strikingly, the
results explain the strong positive correlation of other spending
and GNP in spite of the negative slope of   the   schedule relating
the two.

     Stated in terms of the scale of the economy in 1982, the
standard deviation of the annual first difference of GNP for the

period was $90 billion. The standard deviation of the component
associated with the shift of the consumption function was $28

billion; for other spending including military, $72 billion. The
decomposition between the two schedule shifts is ambiguous

because they are quite highly correlated, but, by assumption,
both are uncorrelated with the shift in military spending..

     Eecause the slightly negative slope found for the
consumption function in this work contradicts the thinking of
many macroeconomists on this subject, I have repeated the
exercise for two assumed values for the slope a-f the consumption—

GNF' schedule. One, which I think of as Keynesian, assumes a
value of 0.3. The standard deviation of the consumption shift
effect on GNP is $26 billion. The shifts in the consumption
function are estimated to be smaller in this case, but their
contribution to movements in GNP is larger because the multiplier
is larger.

       second case derives from equilibrium models of the

                                4
business cycle. It interprets the consumption—GNP schedule as
the expansion path of the consumption—labor supply decision of
the household. The slope of     the    schedule should be r?egative
since   presumably both consumption and leisure are normal goods.
Any events that make people feel that it is a good idea to
consume more should also cause them to take more leisure and
there-fore work less.    A reasonable value -for the slope o-f the

consumption—GNP schedule under this interpretation is —1. When
this is imposed on the problem, the consumption shifts appear
much larger, since this is a long step away from the regression
relation. The standard deviation of the e-f-Fect o-f     consumption on
GNP is $47 billion, comparable to the effect of shifts in
other spending, $4 billion.




2. Earlier research


     Modern thinking about the possible role of shifts in the
consumption function in overall macro -fluctuations began with

Milton Friedman and Gary Beckers 'A Statistical Illusion in
Judging Keynesian Models" (1957). They pointed out that random
shits   in   the consumption function could induce a positive

correlation between consumption and income, which in turn could

                                   5
make the consumption look more responsive to income than it
really was and also make the consumption function more reliable
than it really was. However, neither Friedman and Becker nor
other workers on the consumption function pursued the idea that
shifts in the consumption function might be an important element
of the business cycle.

     More recently, Peter Temins Did Moretary Forces Cause the
Great Depression' (19Th) argued force-Fully -for a role for shifts

o-- the consumption function in explaining the contraction from

1929 to 1933. Temin focusses particularly on the residual from a
consumption function in the year 1930 and suggests that the shift
in consumption in that year was an important factor in setting
of-f the contraction. His results are strongly supported in this
paper, which finds large shifts in the consumption—GNP relation
in all the years a-f the contraction.

     Tem3.ns critics, Thomas Mayer (1978) and Barry Anderson and
James Butkiewicz (198t)., confirm that consumption functions of

various types had important negative residuals in 1930.    It is a

curious feature a-f Temins work and that of his critics that no
attention has been paid to the issue of finding the true slope of
the consumption—income schedule.   If the history of the U.S. is

-full of episodes where consumption shifts affected GNP, then the
observed correlation a-f consumption and income is no guide at all
to the slope of the consumption function. Temin considerably
understates the power of his case by looking for departures from
the historical relation between consumption and income, which is
not at all the same thing as the slope of the structural
relation. The historical relation summarizes numerous other
episodes where a spontaneous shift in consumption had important

macro effects. Temin only looks at the excess in 1930 over the
usual amount of a shift, when his argument logically involves the
whole amount of the shift.

     Because o-f my use o-f   military   spending as the exogenous
instrument that identities the structural consumption function,

the paper spends some effort in understanding how a burst of

military purchases influences the economy. Robert Barro (1981)
has examined the theory of the effect of government purchases in

an equilibrium framework and has studied U.S. data on the effect
•n GNP. He found a robust positive effect of all types of

government purchases, with an especially large coe-rficient for
temporary military spending. My results here are in line with
Barros, though I do not attempt to distinguish permanent and
temporary purchases. Barro notes that higher government
purchases should depress consumption as a matter of theory (p.
1094) but does not examine tre    actual   behavior of consumption.
Barro and Robert King (1982) point out the difficulties of

                                   7
creating a theoretical equilibrium model in which the covariance

of consumption and work effort is anything but sharply negative.

     Joseph Altonji (1982) and N. Gregory Mankiw, Julio
Rotemberg, and Lawrence Summers (1902) use the observed positive
covariation of consumption and hours of work to cast doubt on the

empirical validity of equilibrium models. However, neither paper
considers the possibility that feedback from shifts in household
behavior creates an econometric identification problem. The
results of   this   paper give partial support to their conclusion,
With a serious treatment of the identification problem, the
structural relation between work and consumption appears to be

flat or slightly negatively sloped, but not nearly enough
negatively sloped to fit the predictions of the equilibrium
model.

     This paper examines the importance of fluctuations in
consumption as an interesting question in its own right.      Its

finding of important shifts in the consumption function is
important as well for recent research on consumption and related
issues in finance. As Peter Barber and Robert King (1983) point
out, shifts in preferences or other sources of unexplained
fluctuations in consumption behavior invalidate the Euler

equation approach used by myself and others in studying the
reaction of consumers to surprises in income and to changes in

                                   8
expected real interest rates. The hope that the Euler equation
is identified econometrically without the use of exogenous
variables depends critically on the absence of   the   type of shift
found in this paper. My findings suggest that the Euler equation
is identified only through the use of exogenous instruments, just
as most other macroeconomic structural relations.

3. A simple structural relation between GNP and consumption



    K:eynesian theory denies consumers choice about the level of

work effort. The effective demand process dictates the amount of

work and the corresponding level of earnings. Consumers choose
consumption so as to maximize satisfaction given actual and

expected earnings. In general, the resulting relationship
between earnings and consumption can be complicated——consumers
will use the information contained in current and lagged earnings
to infer likely future earnings and thus the appropriate level of

consumption. Traditional K:eynesian thought has emphasized the
strength at the contemporaneous relation between income and
consumption. Liquidity constraints probably contribute to the
strength. Recent tests by myself and Frederic Mishkin (1982) and
by Marjorie Flavin (1981) have rejected the optimal response of
consumption in favor o-f excess sensitivity to current income
(however, these tests are likely to be contaminated by shifts in

consumer behavior of the type investigated in this paper).
     Otto Eckstein and Allen Sinai a paper + or this conference
(1984) provides a reasonable estimate for the slope of the GNP—

consumption schedule.   In their Table 7, they estimate the

effects on GNP and consumption of an exogenous increase in
government purchases. The ratio o-f the change in consumption to

                                10
 the change in GNP is an estimate of the slope of exactly the
schedule considered in this paper. The ratio is
      Quarters       GNP        Consumption    Ratio

         24         0.56          0.10         0.18


I will use an estimate for the year—to—year marginal propensity
to consume of 0.3 on the basis of this evidence about the overall

behavior of a fully—developed Keynesian model.




Equilibrium thinking about the consumption—GNP schedule


   In an equilibrium model consumers are free to choose the most
satisfying combination of hours of work and consumption of goods,
subject to the market tradeoff between the two:

   max         :
  Cc. , ye,)

   subject to      R(p4c,, —   wtyi)    = W.



                                       11
My notation is:
         D:   Time preference factor

         uO: One—year utility function
         ct: Consumption in year t
         y: Employment in year t
         R: Discount factor
         pt: Price of consumption goods in year t
         w: Wage in year t
              Initial wealth



I will work with one aspect of the overall problem, the

consumption—work choice in year t. The first—order condition for
that choice is:



         Marginal rate a-f substitution =   real   wage
or
     —   u/y    =
                    w   =



Define the expansion path, f(y,), by


         u(f(y,u) ,y,/y —


Other aspects of the overall choice problem determine the point

                                     12
the consumer chooses on the expansion path. These include wealth
and the timing of consumption and work. With the real wage held
constant, higher wealth moves the consumer to a point of higher
consumption and lower work. Again with the real wage held
constant, a higher real interest rate moves the consumer to a
point of lower consumption and more work. Joseph Altonji (1982)
pointed out the usefulness a-f examining the joint behavior a-F

work effort, consumption, and the real wage; his paper presents
many more details on the derivation o-f their relationship..

     It should be apparent that the expansion path slopes

downward, so long as consumption and leisure are normal goods.

Figure   1. The expansion path. For a given real wage,
consumption and work occur in combinations given by the path.
The real interest rate and the level of wealth determine the

position on the expansion path chosen by the consumer.




     The expansion path shifts downward if the real wage

declines. Consequently, a higher tax rate depresses consumption


                                      14
given the level of work effort. On the other hand, the expansion
path is unaffected by an increase in government purchases of

goods and services or by lump—sum transfers or taxes. These
latter influences will move the consumer along the expansián
path, but will not shift the path.

     The slope of the expansion path can be estimated as the
negative o-f the ratio of the income effect in the demand for

consumption goods to the income effect in the labor supply
-function. Estimated income effects for labor supply run on the
order of $0.50 less in earnings -for each $1.00 in increased non—

labor income. That is, an increase in non—labor income of $1.00
raises total income by only $.50.    If all of the increase in

total income is applied to goods consumption, sooner or later,
then the income effect for goods consumption is also $.50 per
$1.00 o-f non—labor income. The resulting slope of the expansion
path is —I..

     The structural relation in the equilibrium model refers to

consumption and work effort. For the purposes o-f this paper, I
think the best measure of the change in work effort from one year
to the next is the change in real GNP.   In the short run, the
amount of capital available for use in production hardly changes,

though, of course, the intensity of its use cnanges. lmost all
changes in output correspond to changes in hours of labor input


                               15
and in the amount of effort per hour spent on the job (see Hall,

1980, for an elaboration and empirical study of this point).
Real GNP is the best available measure of all the dimensions of

changes in work effort in the short run.

     The structural relation suggested by the equilibrium model
has the form

          =   Øy       +


In addition to the level of work effort, measured by y, the
after—tax real wage, w, shifts consumption up relative to work
effort. In the empirical work carried out here, it is not
possible to estimate the coefficients of two different endogenous
variables. The best that can be done is to estimate the
coefficient of y net of the part of a real wage movement that is
systematically related to y. For example, if the real wage is

countercyclical , so that


          =   5yi
then it is possible to estimate the net relation,



     Ct   = (0     —


Because 0 is negative, the countercyclical wage movements makes


                               16
 the consumption—GNP relation even more negatively sloped.              It -

 seems unlikely that procyclical movements of after—tax real wages

are anywhere near large enough to explain the finding of this
paper of a zero net slope of the consumption—GNP relation. That

finding is probably evidence against a pure equilibrium model.

4. Other components of GNP


     I will assume that military purchases of goods and

services, g.e, is an exogenous variable.
     I will define x as the remainder of GNP, that is,

investment plus net exports plus non—military government
purchases of goods and services (the latter is largely state and
local). x has a structural relation to GNP; fluctuations in
this relation are a source of fluctuations in almost all theories

of the business cycle.
     It is not possible to estimate a detailed structural model

for x for the reason just mentioned——a single exogenous variable
limits estimation to a single endogenaus variable. Basically,
what can be estimated is the net effect of an increase in GNP on

investment, net exports, and non—military government purchases.
On the one hand, considerations of the accelerator (particularly

important for inventory investment suggest a positive relation
between GNP and x. On the other hand, increases in interest
rates that accompany an increase in GNP bring decreases in

For investment, especially in housing, the negative response to
interest rates is well documented. For net exports, an increase
in GNP raises imports directly. In addition, under floating

exchange rates, the higher interest rates brought by higher GNP

                                18
cause the dollar to appreciate, making imports cheaper to the
U.S. and exports more expensive to the rest of the world.             It is
perfectly reasonable that the overall net effect of higher GNP on

investment, net exports, and non—military purchases should be
negative.

      The following simple relation summarizes these
considerations:

          =       +


The coefficient       may well be negative, if crowding out through
interest rates is an important phenomenon.




                                       19
5. The complete model


      The model comprises three equations:


           =       +
           =       + Vt
           = ct   +    X. +


The solution for GNP is


      Vt                      +   + y)


This equation gives a precise accounting for the sources   of

fluctuations in outputs The three driving forces for the economy
are military purchases of goods and services, g., the random

shift in the consumption schedule, :., and the random shift in

other spending, v.




                                         4-
6. Identification and estimation


     The goals of estimation in this work are threefold:
         1. Estimate the multiplier,
                1
              1--&
which applies to each of the three components in the
decomposition in the last section.

     2. Estimate the "propensity to consume," ,           in   order to
compute the residuals, z, in the consumption function.
     3. Estimate the 'propensity to spend," j,       in    order to
compute he residuals, ,       in   the function for other spending.

     The solution to the first problem is perfectly

straightforward. In the equation for the movement in GNP,
military spending appears as a right—hand variable along with two
disturbances assumed to be uncorrelated with military spending.

Hence, the regression of GNP on military spending should estimate
the multiplier directly. Again, the interpretation of the
estimated multiplier is net of feedback effects through interest
rates.




                                   21
     To estimate the slope of the consumption—GNP schedule, ,

note that c and g have the regression relation,

      c =     _____   (g   +   -) +   1—t*




An estimate of        can be computed as the ratio of this coefficient

to the multiplier. Alternatively, exactly the same estimate can
be computed with two—stage least squares applied to the c—y
relation with g as the instrument.

     The slope of the x—y relation can be computed analogously
either by the ratio of the regression coefficient of x on g to

the multiplier, or by applying two—stage least squares to the x—y
equation with g as instrument.

     The relationships estimated in this paper are approximations
to more complicated equations. For example, the complete model
does not do justice to the modern Keynesian notion that gradual

wage and price adjustment gives the model a tendency toward full
employment in the long run. The results are likely to look
somewhat different with an estimation technique that gives heavy
weight to lower frequencies from those based more on higher
frequencies. Because cyclical fluctuations are the focus of this
paper, I want to exclude the lower frequencies from the

estimation.     I have accomplished the exclusion in two ways.


                                       4-—
First, I have detrended all of   the   data in a consistent fashion.
Second, I have used first differences in all of the basic
estimation. With annual data, first differences puts strong
weight on the cyclical frequencies and no weight at all on the

lowest frequencies.

7. Data

        The data on real GNP in 1972 dollars for 1919—1982 and real

personal consumption expenditures for 1929—1982 are from the U.S.
National Income and Product Accounts. For 1919—28, data on real
consumption are taken from John Kendrick (1961).

        I used data on real military purchases of goods and services
from the NIFA for 1972 through 1982 and from Kendrick for 1919—
53. For 1954 through 1971, nominal military spending is taken
from the NIPA and deflated by the implicit deflator for national

security spending from the Office of Management and Budget
(1983), converted to a calendar year basis.

        For some additional results described at the end of the
paper, I used the number of full—time equivalent employees in all

industries, including military, from the NIPA.
        To eliminate the non—cyclical frequencies from the data, I
started       by fitting a trend     to real GNP:



        log   y = 5.14 + .0206 t ÷ .00014       t2

        (t    is one in 1909)

Then I detrended real GNP, real consumption, and real military
purchases with this real GNP trend.            I preserved the 1982 values
0-f   each   o-f   the   three variables, so the effect c-f detrending was


                                         24
to raise the earlier levels. For employment, I detrended with a

log—linear trend of 1.96 percent per year and rebased the series
so that it equals real GNP in 1982.

     All of the estimates used the first differences of the
detrended series.




                              S.
8. Results


     All of the regressions reported in this paper include
intercepts, but the values of the intercepts are not reported
because detrending makes them almost meaningless.
     Estimation a-f the multiplier by regressing the change in GNP

an the change in military spending for the years 1920 through
1942 and 1947 through 1982 gives the following results:

    Ay- = .62 Ag.
         (.16
    Standard error: $81 billion       DW:   1.48


Because the multiplier is less than one, it is clear that a
certain amount a-f crowding out took place, on the average. Each
dollar of military purchases raises GNP by 62 cents, so non-
military uses of output decline by 38 cents.

     The regression a-f consumption on military spending is:

         =   —0.07
              (.08)

    Standard error: $38 billion      DW: 1.50


Because the coefficient is close to zero, with a small standard
error, it is clear that the implied slope a-f the c—y relation

                               26
will be close to zero as well. Even though periods of wartime

controls on consumption have been omitted from this regression,

there is strong evidence against the proposition that those
increase in GNP that can be associated with exogenous increases

in military spending stimulated any important increases in
consumption. Similarly, the strong regative response of
consumption to military spending predicted by the equilibrium
model has also been shown to be absent.

       The ratio of the two regression coefficients is —.12; this
is the estimate of the slope of the consumption—GNP schedule.
The same estimate can be obtained by two—stage least squares,

together with the standard error of                and the standard error of
the residuals:


       Ac. = —) 12 iyt
                  (. 1,
       Stanoarij error: $4 billion                 DW:   1.39



The confidence interval on the slope of the c—y relation includes
a range of values, but          excludes     the :eynesian value a-f O.   and
the equilibrium value of             —1   as well. Neither theory is able to
explain the lack of a structural association of consumption and
GNP.

       In   the   next    section,    I will make use a-f   consumption

                                            27
equations with two different assumed values of the

slope:


Keynesian,          = 0.3

         Ct = O.3y
      s = $31 billion


Equilibrium, i=—l

            = —Aye


      s = $117 billion


      The basic results of the paper can be guessed from these
results. The residuals in the Keynesian consumption relation are
smaller than those for the estimated relation (standard errors of
$31 billion against $46 billion) and are very much smaller than

are those for the equilibrium case ($117 billion). Even the
smaller Keynesian residuals turn out to be important in the
overall determination of GNP. GNP and consumption are positively
correlated both because the consumption relation slopes upward
and because shifts in the relation are an important determinant
of both variables.

      On the other hand, the equilibrium model sees very large

                               28
shifts in the c—y relation. When the relation shifts upward,
both c and y rise. Because most of the variation in both
variables comes from the shifts in the relation, the two are

highly positively correlated, even though the relation has a
negative slope. The fact   that   a positive slope gives a better
fit in the consumption equation is not evidence against the
equilibrium view at all.

     The regression of x on _g gives:


         = —0.30

     Standard error: $58 billion        DW: 2.03

     Investment, net exports, and non—military government

spending are quite strongly neqatively influenced by military
spending, again during years when wartime controls on private
spending were not in effect. The estimate of the slope of the
y schedule inferred by dividing by the multiplier is —0.48. The
same estimate is available -from two—stage least squares:




                                  29
         = —0.48
            (.30)


     Standard error: $95 billion    DW:   1.79



Plainly, the negative effects operating through interest rates
dominate the positive effects of the accelerator. Higher GNP

depresses non—consumption, non—military spending along this
structural schedule.

9. Estimates of the importaice of the consumption shift



     Because neither of the major schools of business cycle
theory is consistent with my estimates of the slope of the c—y

relation, I will proceed by making estimates for three different
cases:


     1.   Estimated.. The slope of the c—y relation is —.12, the
value inferred from the fact that, historically, higher
military purchases have raised GNP but not consumption.

Consumption is virtually an exogenous variable..   It influences
GNP but is not influenced by GNP.

     2. Keynesian.. The slope of the c—y relation is 0.3. When
more work is available, people consume more as well.
     . Equilibrium.    The slope of the c—y relation is —1.

Events that move consumers along their expansion paths leave the
sum of GNP and consumption unchanged. Departures o-f the sum a-f

GNP and consumption are a signal of a shift in the expansion
path, possibly associated with a change in the after—tax real

wage, but usually a random, unexplained shift.


     Though the movements of GNP can be decomposed into three
components for the three driving forces listed in the model in

                               31
section 4 (military purchases, the random shift in the
consumption schedule and the random shift in the investment—

exports schedule) ,   I   will concentrate on the consumption shift on

the one hand and the sum of the two other components on the

other hand. The consumption component is

         I
             :
   is the residual from the consumption equation. Note that the

magnitude of the consumption component depends on the magnitude
of the residual and on the magnitude o-f the multiplier. The other

component is Just -•y. less the consumption component.
     Figure 2 shows the total change in real GNP and the
consumption components tor the three cases. As a general matter,

the consumption component is most important for the equilibrium
case and least important for the Keynesian case. However, it is
a signiticant contributor to GNP fluctuations in all three

cases.

Figure   2. Change in real GNP and the consumption component for
the three cases.



     Under the estimated results where consumption is effectively

exogenous, shifts in the consumption schedule are important, but
so are shifts in the other determinants of GNP, especially in the

interwar period. Responsibility for the Great Contraction is


                                      ._.   ._,
shared between shi-fts in the c—v relation and the other sources.

However, in the postwar period, shii-ts in other spending account

i-or   the bulk o-f the movement or GiF.       the two large drops of (NP

in     1973—74 and 1974—75 are partly the result of drops in
consumption.     borne of   the   long contraction since 1978 is the

result of a consumption shift as well.

        In the reynesian view, shifts in the consumption function
are bound to be less important than in the other two cases. When
consumption and GE crop together, all or part o-f the decline in
consumption can be attributed to the drop in GNP. Still, shifts
in consumption are a part at        the   story o-f total fluctuations.

        For the equilibrium case, the story about the Great
Contraction in 1925—32 toid        by these results   will    help clarify
what the theory is saying. Fescajed real GiF           fell   by $227
biliion in i525—30, i7j oiliion in 1930—31, and $243 billion in
1531—32.     0-f this, $140 billion came -t-rom a random shift in

housenoid behavior toward less work and less consumption in 1929—

30, $97 billion in 1930—31, and $148 billion in 1931—32.                The
remaining $87 billion in the first vear *-74 ciliion in the
second year, and $55 billion in the third year came from changes
in miiitarv spendina ana shitts in the investment—export
schedule.      0-f the two, tne tirst was almost negligible. But the
most important part at the story ot the contraction was a sudden
lack of interest in working and consuming,, according to the

equilibrium model.
     Table 1 summarizes the findings for the three cases in terms
of simple statistical measures.

     it is interesting to note that the standard deviation of the

consumption component for the Keynesian case is slightly higher
that it is in the estimated case. llthouqh the residuals in the
Keynesian consumption function are smaller than the residuals in
the other case, the multiplier is quite a bit hiqher (0.85 as

against 0.b2. The big difference between the two cases is in

                                 35
the size of the other component. Again, because the multiplier
is lower for the estimated case and higher for the K:eynesian

case, the other component is larger for the Keynesian case. The
Keynesian case reconciles a larger other component with a
consumption component of about the same size by invoking a
lower correlation of the two components.. The negative
correlation permits the sum to have the same standard deviation
(the known standard deviation of the change in real GNP) even

though one of the components is more variable.

10. Other    estimates



     Estimates for other time periods and other specifications
have convinced me that the basic findings of this paper are

robust. First, estimates for the entire period, the interwar
period, and the postwar period are

For both equations, the considerable extra variance
from the extraordinary level of military spending during World
War II helps to reduce the sampling variation without much
changing the coefficients.

Results for a direct measure of work effort

     In his comment on the version of this paper presented at the

conference, Angus Deaton suggested that the negative findings for
the equilibrium model might be the result of the use of GNP as a
measure of work effort. Because GNP might measure the result of

other productive factors, including pure good luck, and these
other factors might reasonably be positively correlated with
consumption, the consumption—GNP relation might be more

positively sloped than is the consumption—work effort relation.
     To check this possibility, I repeated the analysis with
full—time equivalent employment in place of real GNP.     I

detrended the series by its own exponential trend and rescaled it
to equal real GNP in 1982. Application of two—stage least
squares to the relation of the first difference o-f consumption to

the first difference o-f employment, with the change in military

spending as the instrument, for the period 1930—42 and l94782, is


        = —0.10
            (.18)

    Standard error: 41 billion       DW:   (:1.91



Again, the structural slope is slightly negative, but not nearly
negative enough to fit the equilibrium hypothesis. The
hypothetical value of —1 is strongly rejected.

                               39
11. Conclusions


     A simple structural     relation between GNP and consumption is
a feature of two major theories a-f economic fluctuations, though
the theories differ dramatically in most other respects.

     In the K:eynesian analysis, the consumption function slopes
upward, so, in principle, the positive correlation of 6NP and
consumption could be explained purely by forces other than shifts
in consumption behavior. Nonetheless, the results of       this   paper
show that shifts in the consumption function are a source
of overall fluctuations in a Keynesian analysis. In the first

place, even the Keynesian consumption function has residuals,
though they   are   smaller than the residuals -from the

equilibrium or estimated c—y relationships.      In the second place,

exactly because of the Keynesian multiplier process operating
through a positively sloped consumption function, the consumption
disturbances are much more strongly amplified than they are in
the equilibrium or estimated models.

     In the equilibrium theory, the relation is the expansion
path of the work—consumption choice. The public is free to pick
a point along the path in response to economic conditions.

Shi-ft in government tax and spending policies and shifts in

                                   40
investment and net exports will move the economy along its

negatively sloped c—y schedule.        I-f ever GNP and consumption move

together, it is the result of a shift in the consumption

schedule. Because consumption and GNP frequently move together,
random shifts o-f the consumption—work schedule must be a dominant

part of the equilibrium explanation of cyclical fluctuations.
        In the Keynesian model, an increase in military purchases
should raise GNP and raise consumption. In the equilibrium
model, an increase in military purchases should raise GNP and
lower consumption. The data for the past six decades examined in
this paper seem to split the difference——consumption is
unaffected by military purchases, while GNP rises. Hence the
estimate of the slope o-f the c—y relation inferred through the

use a-f military purchases as an instrument is about zero. In
the compromise economy (which does not have a theory to go with

it, ,   random shifts in consumption are an important source of
overall fluctuations.
