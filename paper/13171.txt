Rosenstein-Rodan (1943) and others posit that rapid development requires a 'big push' -- the coordinated
rapid growth of diverse complementary industries, and suggests a role for government in providing
such coordination. We argue that Japan's zaibatsu, or pyramidal business groups, provided this coordination
after the Meiji government failed at the task. We propose that pyramidal business groups are private
sector mechanisms for coordinating and financing 'big push' growth, and that unique historical circumstances
aided their success in prewar Japan. Specifically, Japan uniquely marginalized its feudal elite; withdrew
its hand with a propitious mass privatization that rallied the private sector; marginalized an otherwise
entrenched first generation of wealthy industrialists; and remained open to foreign trade and capital.

1 Introduction

Over sixty years ago, Rosenstein-Rodan proposed a state-coordinated big push to kick-start sustained

growth.1 After decades off economists’ radar, the idea resurfaced in a 1989 model by Murphy, Shleifer,

and Vishny.2 Their intuition is cleaner: a car factory is scant use in a country without steel mills, oil

refineries, gas stations, mechanics, roads, or people with disposable income. Economic development

requires coordinated growth of demand and supply across multiple sectors, as firms in each exploit

increasing returns to scale – often with firms in one sector bearing losses as another develops. Without

coordination, growth falters because of a range of market failures.                      With coordination, increasing

economies of scale in each growing industry spillover into growth opportunities in other sectors.3

    A key problem is that first movers risk “hold-up” problems.4 “Hold up” occurs when one business’s

return depends on others’ actions. For example, digging a coal mine next to a planned steel mill exposes

the mine to a “hold-up” The steel company can demand cut price coal by threatening to walk away,

leaving the mine without a nearby customer. Each wants the other to move first.5 Information

asymmetries and adverse selection problems prevent the two parties from contracting their way out of the

impasse. At worst, nothing happens; at best, one or both operate on inefficient scales.

    Vertical integration solves this problem under some circumstances, for if a single company digs the

mine and builds the steel mill, the problem evaporates.6                    But the problem of coordinating rapid

development across an entire economy is much knottier.7 Some goods are complementary, so a creamery

does little business unless consumers have refrigerators. Other cross-industry dependencies take the form

of network externalities – for example, having a phone does a business little good if its suppliers and

customers lack phones.8 Financial, legal, and physical infrastructure development, all critical to an

economy’s ability to support entrepreneurship, share many characteristics of network externalities.9

Individuals investment in human capital also has such characteristics.10 Yet other coordination problems

turn on having enough consumer demand to achieve economies of scale in production.11 Rosenstein-

Rodan concludes that integrating all such interdependencies within a single entity is essentially a call for

central planning, and calls for the state to coordinate and subsidize a massive cross-industry surge of

capital investment – a big push.

    Rostow defines economic takeoff as the transition from a low-income to a high income growth path;

and sees big push coordination lifting countries out of a poverty trap. 12 Kofi Annan’s UN Millennium

Project and Sachs’ shock therapy both echo Rosenstein-Rodan’s call for a big push to bring developing

countries to Rostow’s economic takeoff.13

    But despite past big push efforts a growing income gap separates rich from poor countries.14 Easterly

despairs of big push plans because they provoke government failures.15 Bauer argues that development

depends on individual freedom, and that burdensome government causes poverty traps16. Hayek criticizes

Rosenstein-Rodan specifically, stressing that governments lack the detailed information needed to

coordinate a big push.17 Kornai adds that state subsidies distort investments by softening budget

constraints.18 Krueger argues that extensive government intervention magnifies returns to political rent

seeking, deepening poverty traps.19 Baumol and Murphy et al. explain how high political rent-seeking

returns divert entrepreneurs from the positive externality investments needed for a successful big push.20

Easterly’s growing gap highlights a deep inconsistency if the very state intervention needed to coordinate

a big push undermines it.

     The only successful big push Easterly concedes is Meiji Japan.21 We therefore investigate this

success, and find it to be an informative anomaly. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Japan’s Meiji

government organized a big push, much like that advocated by the UN Millennium Project. In the late

19th century, the government capitalized and subsidized numerous state-owned enterprises (SOEs), but

government failure problems soon triggered a fiscal crisis. To restore public finances, Japan conducted a

mass privatization as the 19th century drew to a close. Wealthy families and entrepreneurs assembled

former SOEs into zaibatsu, large diversified pyramidal groups of listed firms. Japan then entered its high

growth era and Rostow estimates its economic takeoff as complete perhaps by 1900, 1914 at the latest.22

     Highly industrially diversified business groups, of which zaibatsu are typical examples, are

ubiquitous in developing economies.23 We propose they are mechanisms for private sector coordination of

mid 20th century growth as state directed; however this is the reconstruction of an industrial economy destroyed by war, not a big
push in the sense of Rosenstein-Rodan. Also, econometric evidence disputes positive role of state planning in postwar Japanese
reconstruction; see e.g. Richard Beason and David E. Weinstein, “Growth, Economies of Scale, and Targeting in Japan (1955-

a big push growth via “tunneling” – transferring wealth from one group firm to another.24 With tunneling

coordinating growth across industries and a controlling shareholder preventing hold ups, business groups

provide an alternative to a state-orchestrated big push. 25 We concede that the generality of our arguments

remains speculative, and call for further research on Japan and other countries.

    The article is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly reviews relevant literature on business groups.

Section 3 describes Japan’s Meiji “shock therapy” marginalizing traditional elites. Section 4 describes the

state-initiated big push, fiscal crisis, and mass privatization. Section 5 describe zaibatsu-led big push and

the subsequent marginalization of their controlling shareholders. Section 6 concludes.



2. Previous Work on Business Groups

We are not proposing an alternative hypothesis to other economic explanations of business groups.

Rather, we seek to synthesize competing hypotheses into a single overarching explanation. Thus, rather

than test our thesis against alternative hypotheses, we draw on previous results to show that apparently

clashing explanations and evidence coalesce into our thesis, yet retain their individual validity.26 Thus,

much of what we say is not new.

    Our thesis accords with Ohkawa and Rosovsky, who see zaibatsu as foreign technology importers.27

Their evidence matches our thesis, for a big push coordinates new technology investment across

complementary industries. Indeed, without specifically mentioning the big push literature, their wording

resonates: “[t]he most famous zaibatsu [were] based on the rapid industrialization that had occurred in the

Journal 22, no. 1 (2001): 45-74.

Wolfenzon and Bernard Yeung, “Corporate Governance, Economic Entrenchment and Growth,” Journal of Economics Literature

     25
        Masahiko Aoki, Information, Incentives, and Bargaining in the Japanese Economy (Cambridge: Cambridge University
Press, 1988), 223 documents such coordination, writing that zaibatsu implement “centralized coordination” as “[t]he general
trading company acted as a sole trading agent for member firms and was in a position to manipulate the terms of transaction with
outsiders. The holding company pooled the profits of the operating firms.” He adds that “post-World War groups of companies -
those of zaibatsu origin or those clustered around the principal banks - do not operate under such centralized coordination.”

first two decades of this century. Although it is difficult to generalize, perhaps, one can say that in the

nineteenth century commerce was the major activity of zaibatsu; around World War I it was industry with

particular emphasis on coal mining, shipbuilding, engineering, and glass; and in the 1920's, it became

sophisticated industries."28 Detailed industry-by-industry analysis of this shifting emphasis, though

beyond our present scope, might accord with a big push.

    Khanna and Yafeh propose coinsurance as a major purpose of business groups.29 Using Japanese data,

they show zaibatsu firms sharing risks in 1932-1943, though not necessarily in earlier periods. Examining

data for 1921-1927 and 1933-37, Miyajima detects no such risk sharing, instead suggesting zaibatsu

controlling shareholders monitor group firms’ capital investment.30 Our argument accords with both,

clarifying the nature of key risks (hold up problems) and why a single controlling shareholder monitors

firms in diverse industries (big push coordination).

    Khanna and Palepu and others argue that business groups substitute for corrupt capital, labor, and

product markets.31 They find group firms outperforming freestanding firms in corrupt economies,

explaining that group firms can safely deal with other firms in the same group while freestanding firms

risk being cheated at every turn. The market failures we stress are similar. Central coordination facilitates

a big push by sidestepping hold-up problems and coordinating growth across industries. Given an

efficient legal system, contracts between independent firms might substitute for a common controlling

shareholder under some circumstances.32 Certainly, a greater centralization of control is plausibly needed

businesses arise from the very beginning of the industrialization of under-developed countries when such countries contact with
advanced capitalism, because under-developed countries undertake modernization or industrialization of all industrial sectors.”
Note however, that pyramidal business groups are radically different from diversified single firms. Explaining the advantages of
diversification does not explain the ubiquity of pyramidal business groups.

to achieve a big push where corruption is rifer.

    Yafeh captures part of our thesis, arguing that vertically integrated keiretsu in postwar Japan, wherein

a major firm like Toyota holds control blocks in listed supplier and customer firms, arose to limit hold-up

problems.33 We elevate Yafeh’s insight into a broader theory of pyramidal business groups as major

players in big push growth. Even closer to our argument, Khanna and Yafeh refer to zaibatsu helping the

government coordinate a big push. But ours differs fundamentally, for we see zaibatsu taking command

of a big push that was failing under state leadership.34

    Much work stresses tunneling, the controlling shareholder siphoning wealth from listed group firms

to benefit himself, as a primary raison d’être for business groups.35 Our thesis accords with this too.

Coordinating a big push requires the massive tapping of national savings, so group firms need public

shareholders. It also requires group firms in some industries to subsidize those in other industries, and to

forsake hold-up opportunities. Their shareholders would understandably perceive this as tunneling and as

poor governance. An undisputed controlling shareholder is needed to overrule them so the big push can

proceed. Thus, evidence of tunneling between group firms accords with our thesis.

    One objection to this reasoning is that extensive tunneling deters the public from buying group firms’

shares. However, this misapprehends agency theory. Rational shareholders forecast tunneling losses and

discount share prices accordingly. At low enough prices, they buy and earn equilibrium risk-adjusted

returns. Expected tunneling reduces insiders’ proceeds from floating a set fraction of a firm’s shares, and

its cost, like all expected agency costs, falls on the initial owners at the initial public offering (IPO).36

Expected tunneling raises firms’ costs of tapping public equity, but does not ‘exploit’ public shareholders.

governance abuses in pyramidal groups.37 This may explain why the United States forcibly dismantled its

business groups in the 1930s, the London Stock Exchange did likewise in the 1970s; and Korea seems

intent on curbing its chaebol.38 Haber argues that aging tycoons and the heirs to great business families

often undermine sustained growth.39 Once wealthy, they see a dynamic and consequently unstable

economy as threatening a status quo they enjoy.40 Others suggest untalented, but well-connected heirs to

old-money pyramids find political rent-seeking their highest value investment. 41 This could retard growth

as effectively as government failures in a state-run big push.42

    This dark side to pyramidal groups seems initially to contradict our thesis. But the dark side

characterizes business groups controlled by geriatric tycoons or inadequate heirs; not the highly talented

controlling shareholders of the other discussions. Big pushes generally fail, and a natural progression

from entrepreneurial controlling shareholders to entrenched heirs might convert growth-promoting

pyramids into growth-blocking artifacts.

    If so, we must explain Japan’s oddly successful big push. To do this, we show this progression failing

in Japan because of uniquely sweeping early shock therapy marginalizing the feudal elite, a fiscal crisis

draining bureaucratic power, and military governments (Japanese and American) marginalizing zaibatsu

families. We also argue that Meiji Japan’s so-called “unequal treaties”, even when renegotiated, limited

trade and investment barriers. Openness checks elites’ power, and thus the downsides of pyramidal

groups.43 The unequal treaties gave foreign courts jurisdiction in concession enclaves, providing Japanese

unobstructed views of foreign jurisprudence, likely helping Japan implement an effective legal system –

which further limits these downsides.44 Openness also lets imports and exports, as well as foreign capital,

compensate for missing or misscaled parts of the domestic economy as a big push builds.45 Japan’s

propitious timing and persistent openness may thus highlight conditions for successful big pushes that

might be deliberately imposed elsewhere.

    Finally, we reiterate that we in no way challenge the validity of other explanations of business groups.

Rather, we seek to reconcile them as consistent with business groups orchestrating big push growth. We

further acknowledge that our big push thesis need not fully subsume the above hypotheses, which may

well retain independent validity entirely independent of big push growth.

Before its big push, Japan underwent sweeping institutional renewal that uniquely marginalized

traditional elites. Unique in depth and scope, this ‘shock therapy’ may well explain Japan’s ultimately

3.1        The Shocking Truth

Prior to the arrival of Admiral Perry’s warships in 1854, Japan was remarkably isolated, with foreigners

subject to instant death outside a tiny enclave in Nagasaki. The Tokugawa Shoguns, who ruled Japan

from 1603 to 1868, preserved a rigidly stratified society. The elite were samurai – an hereditary caste of

warriors with the power of life and death over their inferiors. The lesser castes were peasants, tradesmen

below them, and merchants lowest of all. An intricate code of warrior ethics, bushido, forbade class

mobility and enshrined samurai rule. That foreigners sought the company of merchants was an affront.

      The shogunate, nonetheless, needed merchants – for samurai need weapons and taxpayers. Two great

families, the Mitsui and Sumitomo, arose to such prominence as merchants might attain.

      The Mitsui traded silk. Since money was not in general use, they ran a sophisticated barter operation

– a general trading business. This operation, spanning Japan, was recruited by the Shogunate for tax

farming, further enriching the Mitsui. The Sumitomo owned mines and supplied metal for weapons. Both

silk finery and metals also bought curiosities and weapons from the barbarians confined in Nagasaki.

Other Tokugawa merchant families were important in Japan, but only the Mitsui and Sumitomo survive

Japan’s transition to play important roles in its big push.

      Both families managed without money and modern economic institutions, like corporation or contract

law. Consequently, both families developed house rules – constitutions dictating how business should be

done; profits calculated, allocated, and disbursed; and power passed from generation to generation. House

rules assigned key decisions to family councils – parliaments representing clans according to precise

voting formulae. Thus, in an environment without ambient business law, merchant houses formulated

their own laws and, as far as we can tell, adhered to them rigidly. Private legal systems served both

merchant houses well, making their behavior predictable and their promises credible. The Mitsui and

for Our Time,” Journal of Economic Literature 44, no. 1 (2006): 1, and cites therein.

Sumitomo became preferred business partners for economic actors of all kinds, including the Shogunate.

    In 1853, the United States dispatched about one-fourth of its navy to Japan.47 Their humanitarian

goal, lifting the death penalty on foreigners shipwrecked off Japan, veiled a commercial mission –

opening Japan to American traders. The commander, Admiral Matthew Perry, sailed into Tokyo Bay in

violation of Japanese law, presented Tokugawa officials a draft trade treaty, and continued on to China.

The following year he returned with a larger fleet and, under American cannon, the Shogunate signed the

Convention of Kanagawa, which protected shipwrecked sailors, let U.S. ships buy coal, and opened

Shimoda and Hakodate to American traders.

    Japan’s accession to the Victorian global economy was formalized with the 1858 Treaty of Amity and

Commerce. This U.S.-imposed treaty opened Tokyo, Kobe, Nagasaki, Niigata, and Yokohama to

American trade, fixed low tariffs, and gave consular courts extraterritorial jurisdiction over “concession”

areas in those ports. Similar treaties with the Britain and other Western powers soon followed.

    Japan was thus suddenly flung open to free trade and foreign investment in the concessions. These

agreements were denigrated in Japan as unequal treaties because they enforced no similar concessions for

Japanese in foreign countries, and were renegotiated in 1899. Tariffs rose very slightly, but foreign

companies could now operate throughout Japan. General Electric, Western Electric, Vickers Armstrong,

and other major firms starred in a large-scale foreign direct investment inflow that continued until 1930.48
                                                                                                                 49
    Japan remained open to foreign trade and investment openness until the Great Depression.                          Japan’s

Tokugawa rulers realized that globalization required domestic reforms, and from 1899 on, taxed industry

more lightly than agriculture.50 But comprehensive liberalization proved beyond their abilities.

3.2       Shock Therapy

This backdrop perhaps explains the subsequent political tsunami. In 1868, a band of young samurai

overthrew the craven Tokugawa shoguns. With the Meiji emperor, previously relegated to ceremonial

duties, as their figurehead; these zealous warriors launched the Meiji Restoration.51 Their coup triggered

perhaps the deepest transformation ever effected on a major economy.

      The regime dispatched young Japanese abroad to study science, law, economics, engineering, and

every other field relevant to modernization – and then report home. The knowledge these emissaries

brought back frightened the Meiji rulers, who resolved to restore Japan its rightful place in the world. The

modernization they implemented was unparalleled until the post-socialist reconstructions of the 1990s in

Eastern Europe. The term shock therapy, coined in that context by Sachs seems appropriate here as well.52

      Meiji shock therapy, like its late 20th century analogs, launched comprehensive reforms across all

aspects of the economy nearly simultaneously. Within a few years, Japan adopted parliamentary

democracy modeled on the German Diet, compulsory public education modeled on French and German

schools, universities and a modern military fashioned after those of Prussia, and a fleet modeled on the

Royal Navy. Religious freedom, social mobility, and land reform became official policy.

      Most pertinently, the reformers imposed 19th century liberal capitalism. Finding hereditary casts and

warrior ethics hopelessly fusty; they abolished all feudal ranks and privileges in 1871.53 The feudal

      51
         The Meiji Restoration was a sequence of radical political, economic, military and cultural transformations. Beginning in
the late Tokugawa era, the Restoration is generally considered complete by 1877 when, a conscript army suppressed the Seinan
Uprising, the last in a series of rebellions by feudal warlords and other traditionalists. See also Samuels, Richard. Rich nation,
strong army – national security and the technological transformation of Japan. New York: Cornell University Press, 1994.
      52
         Shock therapy holds that institutional reform must be comprehensive, not piecemeal. Lipton and Sachs argue that Poland
cannot establish a market economy without simultaneously establishing supporting institutions: law, courts, regulators,
institutional investors, social insurance, and the like. Each, in turn, requires other supporting institutions. Shock therapy
advocates the total replacement of one set of institutions by another. Japan’s Meiji leaders drew similar conclusions for similar
reasons. Hence, the term, though not used then, aptly their policies. David Lipton and Jeffrey Sachs, “Creating a Market
Economy in Eastern Europe: The Case of Poland,” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity 1 (1990): 75-147.

   Edwin O. Reischauer, The Japanese Today: Change and Continuity (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, Belknal Press,
1988): 81-83) explains “With the disappearance of the domains, the samurai lost their position as a hereditary bureaucratic class,
and in 1873 universal military conscription was substituted for the old class basis for military service. In 1876 the samurai were
even prohibited from wearing their swords, their badge of distinction. Samurai stipends were also drastically reduced and by


                                                               12
system bound society together, so new glue was needed. Modifying the German Civil Code in stages, and

with grafts from other legal models, Japan rapidly built a state-of-the-art late 19th century legal system.

Regulations permitting public bond trading arrived in the early 1870s, and an 1878 Stock Exchange

Ordinance opened the way for equity markets in Tokyo and Osaka. By 1888, Japan’s Civil Code was

fully as sophisticated as its German prototype.



3.3.      Aftershock

Under the new code, merchant houses were suddenly general partnerships subject to previously unknown

constellations of laws that overrode house rules and family councils. Adaptation proved beyond the

capabilities of some merchant houses, and severely strained others. Mitsui and Sumitomo survived, but

navigating the aftershocks was simple for neither. Both modernized by adopting Western technology –

textiles manufacture and mining technologies, respectively – and by supplementing general trading with

banking as money gained acceptance.

       But institutional change proved harder than technological change. The legal system created

previously unheard of liabilities, so many merchant families incorporated to obtain limited liability. But

this created more problems, for they now found squabbling relatives claiming rights that never obtained

under the ancient house rules. Even worse, rewards traditionally bestowed on successful hired managers

turned out to be shares with voting rights. In short, new institutions undermined traditional norms,

creating uncertainty around previously clear business dealings.

       Hired managers holding shares proved unbearable, and many old families went to great lengths to

rectify the situation. Mitsui Bank, founded in 1876, found itself with over 400 manager-shareholders and

reorganized in 1893 to buy them all out. Other merchant families also bared their coffers buying back

shares from hired managers. These buyouts alienated outsiders by underscoring their inferior status.


1876 were entirely commuted into relatively small lump-sum payments of cash or government bonds. Thus the samurai in a brief
nine-year period were deprived of all their privileges, and Japan was started on a great change that was to transform its society in
a mere generation or two from one in which status was determined primarily by heredity to one in which it depended largely
upon the education and achievements of the individual.”


                                                                13
    Loyal hired managers holding shares were intolerable, but outside shareholders were unadulterated

outrage. A few merchant families, notably the Shimomura and Ohmura, financed growth with public

equity and lost control to outsiders. Others therefore remained unlisted and dependent on internal funds.

This curtailed their growth, and explains the eclipse of many Tokugawa merchant dynasties.

    Into this void stepped a new generation of entrepreneurs without Tokugawa roots. Yataro Iwasaki

(1834-1885) organized Mitsubishi around a state-subsidized shipping monopoly. Mitsubishi probably had

a genuine business advantage, for Iwasaki instituted modern accounting before his rivals.54 But its main

advantage was government favors. The government wanted Japan to be a maritime power, and Iwasaki

stepped forward to help. From 1875 on, his Yubin Kisen Mitsubishi Kaisha shipping company received

¥250,000 annually for carrying government mail. This subsidy protected Mitsubishi from foreign

competition. Quickly acquiring 37 seafaring ships, Mitsubishi soon carried most of Japan’s foreign trade.

More subsidies flowed through the state-owned Nagasaki Shipyard, which lost money repairing and

maintaining Mitsubishi ships – probably at cut rates. Iwasaki plowed his rapidly rising earnings into

capital investment, and Mitsubishi grew rapidly to rival Mitsui and Sumitomo.




4. The State’s Big Push

Japan’s shock therapy aimed to build modern munitions plants, shipyards, and the like. Although Mitsui

and Sumitomo embraced new technology for spinning silk or refining copper, and supplemented their

trading operations with banking; they remained cool towards utterly new industries. This perhaps

reflected a realistic assessment of their expertise; but building new business plainly required outside

capital and neither family dared risk joining the Shimomura and Ohmura in economic oblivion. And


    54
       The government required a double entry bookkeeping account for its annual subsidies, which were of unprecedented size.
Yukichi Fukuzawa (1835 – 1901), the Meiji statesman, educator, author, philosopher and political theorist who founded Keio
Gijuko, later Keio University, introduced Western accounting to public finances (Yukichi Fukuzawa. Chuai no hou (Methods of
bookkeeping) (in Japanese) (Tokyo: Keio University Press, 1873); Shinichiro Shimme, “Introduction of double-entry book
keeping into Japan,” Accounting Review, 12 (1937)) and to his students. Although the Mitsui and Sumitomo also hired Keio
graduates, Iwasaki, appreciated modern accounting and enthusiastically implemented it throughout his business operations. His
son Hisaya, his manager Heigoro Masuda (1847-1922), and many other Mitsuibishi executives were Fukuzawa students. See e.g.
Mitsubishi Public Affairs Committee (2006).


                                                             14
though Mitsubishi grew rapidly, it too lacked expertise outside shipping and related businesses.

      Government prodding of merchant families to pool capital met determined resistance. The state

exhorted many families into jointly capitalizing banks in the 1870s, but interfamilial squabbling paralyzed

governance and each family soon established its own bank. The Mitsui thus abandoned the First National

Bank, co-founded with the Ono and other families, to establish Mitsui Bank in 1876. More prodding to

pool their capital and develop new industries seemed a poor plan.



4.1        State-Owned Enterprises

Instead, SOEs would build new industries essential to modernization. More SOEs would be needed to

provide inputs to the first set, and still more to build railroads and other infrastructure. The new strategy

quickly developed into a big push as SOEs materialized in one modern industry after another.55

      This effort was massive. From 1868 to 1885, the Industry, Interior, and Agriculture Ministries

“special subsidy funds” of ¥52.9, ¥4.6, and ¥9.6 million total ¥69.3 million for SOE operating deficits,

frontier development initiatives, and targeted loans. Adding the ministries’ operating costs – ¥15.4, ¥3.1,

and ¥18.1 million, respectively – totals ¥42.4 million, bringing the grand total to ¥111.7 million per year.

Separate accounts for new SOEs, an investment capital trust fund, and other programs total ¥16.1 million.

Finally, prefecture industrial promotion grants total ¥1.6 million. All told, subsidies and their

administration cost ¥127.83 million from 1868 to 1885. Given Japan's national income – ¥397 million in

1878, the first year of data – these sums are huge for the era.56


      55
        The Ministries of Industry (kobusho) and the interior (naimusho) emerged from a spate of administrative restructuring in
the early Meiji era in 1871 and 1873, respectively.
     56
        The figures here are from Ishizuka (p. 131), Kobunkan (c. 4), and Umemura and Nakamura (p. 29). Kobayashi, using
slightly different years, concurs as to general magnitudes. On National Income, see Kazushi Okhawa, “Production Structure,” in

                                                               15
    The Industry Ministry oversaw mining, railways, civil engineering, telegraphy, navigation,

shipbuilding, iron production, and manufacturing; and all SOEs therein. The greater parts of its

investment flowed into state-owned railways and mines – 47.9% and 31.5%, respectively. Lesser amounts

financed SOEs in telegraphy (12.3%) and manufacturing (8.3%).

    The ministry expected its gold and silver mines to generate revenue. It operated ten large mines

directly, and leased the management of others to private contractors. But Japan’s only modern colliery,

the Takashima mine near Nagasaki, was Dutch-owned, albeit with Japanese partners.57 This

embarrassed the government, and the state bought the Takashima mine for $400,000 in 1874.

Many thought this ridiculously generous and accused the government variously of bribing

foreigners or bargaining ineptly.

    Japan needed railroads to transport goods, but also to build Japan’s regions into a nation. The ministry

thus emphasized linking interior regions to ports. The same nation-building agenda charged the ministry

with modernizing Hokkaido, spotting the undeveloped territory with cotton and sugar mills, breweries,

creameries, canneries, and other SOEs.

    The Interior Ministry oversaw commerce, vital statistics, the post, cartography, surveys, and policing.

It had budgets for civil engineering projects and SOEs. Its SOE subsidies went 29.0% to agricultural

products, 28.6% to dairy products, 28.2% to cotton textiles, 8.6% to silk, and 2.0% to experimental farms;

with lesser amounts to forestry, crafts and commerce, and maritime shipping.

    Its control over policing and other regional matters brought direct involvement in local economies.

Thus, the ministry financed experimental farms, farm factories, and dairy farms – all on small local

scales. Its model silk, cotton and other textile, and paper mills, unlike the Industry Ministry’s gargantuan

SOEs, were not designed to force industrialization; but to introduce new technologies that would

eventually substitute domestic goods for imports. Its policies thus foreshadowed twentieth century




    57
         The Dutch merchant, T.B. Glover, held a controlling interest.


                                                                16
“import substitution” theories.58

      The government also inherited state-owned mines and enterprises the Tokugawa established in their

final years. Many went to the military – the navy took Yokosuka ironworks, Yokohama ironworks, Uraga

shipbuilding, and Ishikawajima shipbuilding; and the army Sekiguchi manufacturing. The Sado gold mine

and Ikuno silver mine fell to the Industry Ministry. Industrial ventures by individual warlords, typically

with direct military objectives, were also seized when the feudal order was abolished in 1871. Of these,

the Shikine gun powder plant and Shuseikan manufacturing complex went to the navy; the Takinokami

gun powder plant and Ogi Chuzou metal casting plant went to the army, a raft of mines and Hyogo

shipbuilding went to the Ministry of Industry, and the Sakai textiles plant went to the Ministry of Finance.

      However, the most important SOEs were established by the state anew. These include large ventures

in chemicals, machinery, mining, printing, railways, shipbuilding, telegraphy, and textiles. In mining, the

Aburato venture was notable. In machinery and chemicals, the government established Akabane

Seisakusho, Cement Seizosho, Shingawa Glass Seizosho, and Shirorengaishi Seizousho. In textiles, key

state-established ventures include Tomioka Seishisho, Shinmachi Bousekisho, Senju Seijusho, Aichi

Bosekisho, and Hiroshima Bosekisho. Although they also established new gold and silver mines, the

reformers’ hopes that mining revenues could fund modernization were unfulfilled.

      Various branches of government apparently disputed control. Telegraphy and lighthouses ultimately

fell to the Communications Ministry. Railways ultimately ended up directly run by the Cabinet. The Navy

and Army controlled munitions and related enterprises. For example, the Navy ran Yokosuka Iron and

Steel, Yokohama Iron and Steel, Uraga Shipbuilding, and Ishikawajima Shipbuilding.59



4.2       Government Failure

To finance its big push, the government seized control of all taxation, abolishing the feudal rice tax and

     58
        See e.g. Kobayashi on the Interior Ministry, and Prebisch on import substitution. M. Kobayashi, Japan's industrialization
and privatization of government enterprises (Nihon no kogyoka to kangyo haraisage) (in Japanese) (Tokyo: Toyo Keizai, 1977)

trans. of El desarrollo económico de América Latina y alguno de sus principales problemas (Santiago: CEPAL, 1949).
     59
        These weapon factories and some other SOEs were transferred from the Tokugawa state.


                                                               17
requiring payment in coin from 1873 on. This plus earnings from state-owned mines reduced the state’s

exposure to agricultural prices. From 1871 through 1875, the government's primary balance (tax revenues

less ordinary expenditures excluding interest) remained marginally positive.

    But this could not finance thoroughgoing modernization. The state therefore borrowed. Its first bond

issue raised £1 million at 9% in London in 1870 to finance state railways, with duties and future railway

profits as collateral. A second London issue in 1873 raised a further £2.4 million at 7% due in 30 years for

warlords and samurai pensions. These were abruptly terminated in August 1876 – freeing up the funds.60

This issue was collateralized by general revenues plus up to 400,000 ton of rice, worth about $16 million

– slightly more than the annual interest. In total, these two issues netted ¥16 million.

    Japan issued no more foreign debt until the Sino-Japanese War. But the government now appreciated

the advantages of debt markets over the private (and secret) debts the Tokugawa incurred from merchants.

From 1872 through 1883, a succession of domestic debt issues to raised ¥292 million – a huge amount.61

    Their fiscal situation deteriorated sharply in 1877, when suppressing the Seinan Uprising – Japan’s

last feudal rebellion – cost ¥41.57 million, roughly 70% of the previous year’s budget. The government

managed the immediate crisis by borrowing ¥15 million and printing ¥27 million in inconvertible paper

currency.62 The soaring money supply fuelled inflation, which induced the National banks to quicken

their presses. Japan was now in an unsustainable inflationary spiral. The Finance Minister, Masayoshi

Matsukata, resolved to confront the crisis with a dual reform.

    His monetary reform unified the currency. Previously only coinage was official, and private national

banks issued banknotes in currencies of their choice. Matsukata created the Bank of Japan in 1886 to




    60
        These cost ¥ 17.67M annually – a third to half the normal budget, and benefited about 1% of the population – 467 lords
and about 320,000 samurai. In lieu, the state granted them 30 year bonds, so it netted (allowances less interest) only ¥6M
annually. Subsequent inflation greatly eroded the real value of the obligation.
     61
        Domestic bond issues raised ¥23M in 1872, ¥22M in a sequenced issue from 1873 through 1875, ¥17M in 1874, ¥174M
in 1876, ¥12M in 1878, and ¥44M in a sequenced issue from 1880 through 1883. For comparison, the national budget for 1876
was about ¥60 million.
     62
        In the late 1860s and 1870s, government paper currency was not convertible to gold. The dajokansatsu, introduced in
1868, was the first government paper currency usable throughout Japan. A legal reform let numbered national Banks, modeled on
US national banks, issue paper money in their own currencies.

    His fiscal reform was a general belt tightening, slashing subsidies and raising money by privatizing

SOEs en masse. The SOEs hemorrhaged money, and Matsukata’s predecessor, Shigenobu Okuma, was

fired amid a political struggle after proposing a mass privatization in 1880.64 Matsusaka, finding virtually

every SOE, save a few mines, a looming fiscal disaster, recognized mass privatization as the only escape

from economic and political collapse.

    Accepting economic liberalism was inescapable. Initially, this was grudging. Subsidies slowly fell for

many SOEs, but continued for maritime shipping, railways, and silk. But resistance faded as fiscal crisis

loomed, and ending all subsidies soon seemed imperative.

    Matsukata initially merely slashed SOE subsidies and shelved plans for new SOEs. This hardened

SEO budget constraints. As in modern transition economies, this improved governance.65 From mid-1878

on, each SOE provided detailed income statements and balance sheets. Remarkably, the state previously

only tabulated aggregate expenditures and revenues of all SOEs! These reforms had three key effects.

    First, modern accounting made SEO managers’ budgetary excesses visible to their superiors.66 This

instilled appreciation for economic reality, and undercut lobbying for expanded subsidies.

    Second, the worst SEO money drains was evident, raising political pressure to privatize them. SEO

balance sheets also gave politicians book values, reflecting past subsidies to each. These were substantial,

and the prospect of recovering these amounts through privatizations seemed increasingly attractive.

    Third, dissenting voices reiterated that SOEs were intended to pull the whole economy towards

comprehensive modernization, with gains in some offsetting losses in others.67 Some of this was likely

disingenuous, for at least some sectors should have posted gains. But the crisis made SOEs justify

benefits against realistic cost assessments, including opportunity costs recoverable via privatizations.

           A few SOEs escaped the mass privatization – military suppliers, mints, government printing,

railways, postal services, and telegraphs. But military suppliers judged obsolete or unimportant were

privatized, and private railways and military suppliers displaced SOEs as subsidies ended and SEOs sold

off plant and equipment. With few exceptions, SOEs were on the block.



4.3        Mass Privatization

The state privatized twenty-six large SOEs by 1896. The model was the Takashima mine, nationalized in

1874, then sold to its manager, the merchant and Meiji politician Shojiro Goto, in 1875. Goto financed the

deal, essentially a management buy-out (MBO), with debt, including a loan from the British firm Jardine,

Matheson.68 Production rose, but earnings struggled to cover hefty interest costs. Still, the government

paid $400,000 to nationalize the mine and got ¥550,000 privatizing it less than a year later, netting

¥190,000 at prevailing exchange rates.69 Repeating this with other SOEs promised fiscal salvation.

      The first mass privatization attempt was an 1880 law offering fourteen money-losing SOEs at gross

book value (book value with no depreciation allowance) to buyers screened by officials for financial

resources – though not ability or expertise! Unsurprisingly, virtually no buyers appeared.

      Under escalating fiscal pressure, and reluctantly conceding that most SOEs were not worth their gross

book values, the government passed another privatization law in 1884, offering profitable state-owned

mines to the highest bidder.

      Japan’s major private mining business remained aloof. The Sumitomo ran the Besshi copper mines

for the Tokugawa, and the Meiji government confiscated these as state property in 1868. Soon realizing

they needed Sumitomo expertise to operate the mines, the government reversed itself a month later. But

Sumitomo’s general manager, Saihei Hirose, distrusted the government and bid for no SOEs in this or

subsequent privatization rounds. His only reaction was to hire expert engineers away from former SOEs.

    In contrast, Mitsui, bid enthusiastically in every major privatization round. Its major purchases were

the Shinmachi and Tomioka silk textiles mills, bought in 1887 and 1893, respectively.

    The Iwasaki too entered the fray. Shojiro Goto was struggling to keep Japan’s first privatized SEO,

the Takashima mine, out of bankruptcy. Yataro Iwasaki once worked under Goto, but showed no interest

until an elaborate sales contract was drafted in 1881 by the Meiji statesman Yukichi Fukuzawa.70 The

contract imposed strict financial conditions on the departing Goto, but gave Mitsubishi clear title after a

one-time payment terminating the mine’s debts.71 Mitsubishi paid ¥859,636.45, ¥259,636.45 to the state

and ¥600,000 to Takashima’s creditors. Iwasaki saw the mine’s remaining reserves and salvage value as

marginal, but apparently sought political capital by rescuing Goto.72

    He imposed modern accounting and management, radical changes after Goto’s chaotic governance. In

1882, he fired three miners for sleeping on the job, presaging sweeping layoffs at the overstaffed mine.

    Iwasaki found a colliery useful, for Mitsubishi’s “national champion” status hinged on shipping,

which required coal. Mitsubishi could also export coal in otherwise empty freighters during low-volume

winter seasons and exploit supply shortfalls in Shanghai. Most importantly, Takashima gave Mitsubishi

expertise applicable in other mines.

    Mitsubishi acquired twenty more coal mines from 1884 through 1911. Eleven were large-scale

operations that compensated for Takashima’s falling output. The expertise developed at Takashima

proved invaluable, for coal was essential to Japan’s rising chemical and heavy industries, positioning

         Iwaskaki calculated that the mine contained 1,500,000 tons, implying eight more years of operation and earnings of
¥1,125,750. This fell short of his estimate of mine’s accumulated debt at that time by ¥128,250, but his estimate of the mine’s
salvage value in eight years was ¥200,000. His reserves estimate was excessively conservative, for the mine continued producing
until 1986.

Mitsubishi well to retain its “national champion” status and attendant political influence.

    But, perhaps unsurprisingly, being a “national champion” ultimately became a liability. By the late

1870s, rival politicians took to attacking Mitsubishi for manipulating shipping and passenger fares. After

two major Mitsubishi supporters, Toshimichi Okubo and Shigenobu Okuma, retired, more politicians

attacked Mitsubishi for redirecting shipping subsidies to other businesses.73

    In 1882, the government ordered Mitsubishi to restrict itself to shipping or forego further subsidies.

Sensing an opportunity, the Mitsui had organized a maritime shipping firm, Kyodo Unyu Kaisha, with

military personnel as CEO and vice-CEO. Generous subsidies let Kyodo Unyu cut sharply into

Mitsubishi's shipping revenues, which fell from ¥4.6 M in 1881 to only ¥2.3 M by 1883. Kyodo Unyu

had 29 ships with a 28,010 ton total capacity by 1881, rivaling Mitsubishi's 29 ships and 36,599 ton

capacity.74 Iwaskai and the Mitsui appreciated the merits of cooperation, and merged their shipping lines

in 1885 to form Nippon Yusen Kaisha, renamed Nippon Yusen Kabushiki Kaisha (NYK).75 The merger

also let Mitsubishi remain in mining and diversify further.

    Mitsubishi developed ship maintenance, shipbuilding and iron production in Yokohama, its primary

port. These facilities were gargantuan, with 1882 sales revenue of ¥187,338, assets of ¥119, 986, and over

a hundred thousand employees.76 In 1887, Mitsubishi bought another major SOE, Nagasaki Shipyards,

which it operated at the government’s request since 1884. Citing the increasingly vociferous political

attacks on Mitsubishi, Kobayashi suggests the lease and subsequent purchase of the money-losing

Nagasaki Shipyard were forced upon Mitsubishi to weaken the Iwasaki.77 If so, they quickly turned the

engineering universities and others with modern training. Mitsubishi transformed the money-losing SOE

into Japan’s premier ship building facility. By 1895, Nagasaki Shipyard was the undisputed industry

leader, having built Japan’s first government-standard rank 1,392-ton ocean liner, the Suma.

     For the most part, the Meiji government’s burnt fingers kept its hand out of the economy in

subsequent decades.78 After the mass privatization, Japan established only one new state-owned enterprise

– Yawata Steel – in 1901, and Figure 1 shows subsidies to business remaining small until World War II

blurred the lines between the military and industry. This fiscal probity let Japan return to bond markets

when necessary to sustain government spending and refinance old debts. The government raised ¥45M

from 1884 through 1889, and floated a ¥175M sequenced issue from 1886 through 1897.




5.        Zaibatsu Big Pushes

The Mitsui, Mitsubishi, and other wealthy families, despite ongoing earnings from traditional businesses,

lacked capital to buy more than a few SOEs. This handful whet their appetites for profit opportunities

the private sector by encouraging the spread of the company system and the accumulation of capital by entrepreneurs. By the
1890s, however, the state had cut back on its direct role in the economy, giving way to private corporations.”

Shimomura and Ohmura.



5.1       Pyramidal Business Groups

Fortunately, a solution presented itself – the “pyramidal business group”. This structure, apparently

devised earlier in the 19th century by British trading firms, let a wealthy family (or individual) use public

investor’ money to control corporate assets worth vastly more than its own wealth.79 By the late 19th

century, pyramids existed in the United States, Canada, Europe, and elsewhere. By the 1920s, they were a

preferred structure for big businesses throughout the world.80

      The Japanese variant of the pyramidal business group is called a zaibatsu.81 As elsewhere, zaibatsu

were multi-tiered structures with a lead business at the apex. Figure 3 illustrates. The apex firm holds

equity control blocks in a first tier of listed companies. Each of these, in turn, holds control blocks in a

second tier of listed firms. Each of these, in turn, holds control blocks yet other listed firms. In each tier,

public investors own all remaining shares in each firm.



[Figure 3 about here]



      Pyramids have several advantages.82 First, by controlling the apex firm, a wealthy family controls

essentially limitless tiers of listed firms. The apex firm controls 51% of the votes in every first tier firm,

and so appoints whomsoever it pleases, usually family members, to their boards. These firms control 51%

      81
         We define zaibatsu to include any large pyramidal group with listed firms controlling other listed firms. This distances the
term from issues of origin, control, monopoly power, and land rents; which some Japanese scholars hold as definitional. It also
distinguishes the pyramidal zaibatsu from the horizontal keiretsu business groups of postwar Japan, which lack apex firms and
pyramidal structures. Literally zaibatsu means “wealthy group”. Japanese economic and business historians debate the precise
definition of a zaibatsu. The literature generally dates zaibatsu to the period after World War I, the Mitsui, Sumitomo, and
Mitsubishi pyramidal groups predate that era by many decades and are the models for subsequent zaibatsu. Shigeaki Yasuoka,
Japanese zaibatsu (Nihonno zaibatsu) (Tokyo: Nikkei, 1976).

                                                                24
of each second tier firm, so the latter’s boards are appointed by the boards of the former, who are

appointed by the family. In this manner, the family controls every firm in the pyramidal group.

    Second, the apex firm’s controlling shareholder needs only a modest fortune because the pyramidal

business group is mainly financed by public investors. The listed firms in the first tier are 49% financed

by outside shareholders. Those in the second are 49% directly financed by outside shareholders and 51%

financed by first tier firms, which are also 49% financed by outside shareholders. The net result is that

second tier firms are 74% financed by outside shareholders. Firms in the third tier are 85.25% financed by

outside shareholders, and those in the fourth tier are 92.25% financed by outside shareholders. Lower tier

firms are successively more thoroughly financed by public shareholders.83 Despite this, every firm is still

controlled by the apex firm’s controlling shareholder. Berle and Means stress this stark separation of

ownership from control in pyramids, and argue that it induces seriously suboptimal management.84

    Third, pyramids magnify the political and economic clout of the controlling shareholder.85 Wealthy

families controlled most zaibatsu. A few, like the Nissan zaibatsu had widely held apex firms. But

Aikawa and his family controlled Nissan’s board, so here too pyramiding magnified a family’s power.

    Fourth, existing firms’ earnings can finance control blocks in new firms. The controlling shareholder

needs no additional funds to control new firms created in existing or new lower tiers of the group.86

    Finally, the family is protected from lawsuits. Each firm is separately incorporated and listed. Each

has distinct shareholders. And multiple layers of limited liability shield the controlling shareholder from

legal problems afflicting lower tier firms.
    83
         Continuing this example, listed firms in the nth tier are 1 – αn financed by external shareholders, where α, the
intercorporate control stake, is 51% in this example. A 51% stake is often unnecessary for effective control if most shareholders
fail to vote, the control stake shares have multiple votes, or debt and non-voting preferred shares are added to the mix. Cross-
holdings – shares held by firms not in the level immediately above, but elsewhere in the pyramid – further complicate the
arithmetic in real pyramidal groups. See Lucien Bebchuk, Reinier Kraakman, and George Triantis, “Stock Pyramids, Cross
Ownership and Dual Class equity: The Mechanisms and Agency Costs of Separating Control from Cash Flow Rights,” in
Concentrated Corporate Ownership, ed. Randall Morck (National Bureau of Economic Research Conference Volume, University

      In most ways, zaibatsu resembled pyramidal groups in other countries, and Japanese academics call

pyramidal groups elsewhere zaibatsu. However, some peculiarities merit note. Most zaibatsu owned land

and mines, initially (Sumitomo) or following the mass privatization (Mitsui and Mitsubishi). Mines,

especially, were cash cows that financed control stakes in new subsidiaries. Also, zaibatsu had sogo-

shosha, or general trading companies. Through these, zaibatsu bought and sold all goods, gleaning market

information to guide entry into new industries. Sogo-shosha also served as de facto banks, with trade

credit replacing loans. This helps explain a third peculiarity, aversion to debt.

      These characteristics combine to facilitate big push growth. One controlling shareholder controls all

group firms, can make customers and suppliers grow in tandem, and can siphon money between firms as

needed. National savings is tapped on a huge scale, since the group is predominantly financed with

public equity issues. The controlling shareholder has an interest in the profitability of the entire group,

and in laws and regulations that benefit the economy overall. And the group can finance ventures into

new industries using the retained earnings of existing group firms.                       Thus, we propose that Japan’s

zaibatsu, its pyramidal business groups, decided to take over direction of Japan’s ‘big push’ – not because

the government asked them to, but because the government had withdrawn its hand and each zaibatsu

could now tunnel earnings from one industry into profitable investments in others. Each zaibatsu, quite

likely acting alone and for profit, thus did precisely what Rosenstein-Rodan ask of the State.87



5.2        The Mitsui Pyramid

The Mitsui constructed Japan’s first zaibatsu. Whether they devised pyramiding independently or

imitated foreign pyramids is unclear. The group began in 1876 when Mitsui Bank, then the Family

Council’s control center, divested Mitsui Bussan. Since the bank’s owners bore unlimited liability, it


      87
        Paul Rosenstein-Rodan, “Problems of Industrialization of Eastern and South Eastern Europe,” Economic Journal 53
(1943). We find no evidence that the State directed the zaibatsu-led big push, that they coordinated it with each other, or indeed
that they coordinated production in any way. The Revised Commercial Code of 1890 allowed cartel contracts between
producers, but also let firms freely exempt themselves and freely withdraw. After Russo-Japanese War, cartels were organized in
a few industries, including sugar and oil. But most Japanese economic historians see industrial organization as competitive until
the late 1920s. In fact there is evidence that firms with large shareholders, such as Sumitomo zaibatsu firms, avoided cartel
contracts. On all these points, see Miyajima (2004), pp.49-50, and references therein.


                                                               26
avoided risky high return ventures. These Mitsui Bussan undertook. To protect the bank, Takenosuke and

Yonosuke Mitsui, representing two major Mitsui clans, legally renounced their birthrights and were

formally cast out by the family. Takenosuke and Yonosuke assumed ownership of Mitsui Bussan, which

funneled Mitsui money into various risky ventures, including maritime shipping.

    This limited the family’s downside, absent formal limited liability. A contract specified Mitsui Bank’s

limited liability for Mitsui Bussan obligations, obligations of each to the family should the other fail,

salaries Mitsui Bank paid Takenosuke and Yonosuke, and that Mitsui Bank controlled Mitsui Bussan.

    This finely crafted document let Mitsui Bussan take risks intolerable to other families, and earn fat

commissions shipping coal from the state-owned Miike mine to politically volatile China, gaining

political capital by fattening state coffers. The Mitsui repeated this separation of ownership from control

wherever a business grew risky. Thus, when Japanese clothing sales flagged in 1873, the silk clothing

store was transferred to the newly created Mitsukoshi, owned by distant relatives. Again, a contract

established Mitsui Bank’s control over Mitsukoshi and limited the bank’s liability. In each case, one

Mitsui firm controlled another without owning it. Thus, some date the formation of the Mitsui zaibatsu to

1876.88 The Sumitomo followed suit with similar structures shielding family wealth from downside risk.

    After much trial and error, civil and commercial codes were announced in 1880, though implemented

much later. A Civil Code passed in 1888, and the Company Law Section of the first Commercial Code in

1893. These formalized limited liability, rendering controlled subsidiaries unnecessary to block liability.

Yonosuke and Takenosuke Mitsui quickly revised their birth certificates to restore their Mitsui lineage,

and Mitsui Bank assumed ownership of Mitsui Bussan and Mitsukoshi. But Japanese controlling

shareholders were now used to separating their businesses into distinct companies.

    By the late 1890s, after several additional legal reforms, the Mitsui group began to tap public equity.

Although most Mitsui businesses remained unlisted, the Mitsui Partnership, the group’s apex firm,

through the Mitsui Bank, held control blocks in Oji Paper and Kanegafuchi Boseki (Kanebo) Textiles,

                                                               27
with public shareholders owning the remaining shares.89

    Mitsui mines were cash cows – producing earnings the Family Council could redirect into other

companies as they diversified from silk business into banking, which provided financial services to their

customers and suppliers; electrical equipment, which their modernized mills required; and then other

more diverse industries that became relevant as Japan’s growth accelerated. This succession reflects

precisely the industry complementarities envisioned in the big push.90

    This developing pyramidal structure let Mitsui organize new joint stock companies to expand into

additional lines of business from the late 1890s through the early 1920s. Soon, most Mitsui firms were

listed, for promising investments outpaced the family’s wealth, necessitating public equity issues. But all

firms in the group remained under Mitsui Partnership control, directly or indirectly. The family’s actual

ownership, though, varied. Figure 3 depicts the zaibatsu in 1914.



[Figure 3 about here]



    Mitsui Partnership retains full ownership of three of the four first tier firms through 1921, but reduces

its stake in the rapidly growing Mitsui Bank from 100% to 67.2%, even as the book value of its holdings

rises from ¥20M to almost ¥43.6 M. The expansion is thus predominantly financed with public shares.

    Figure 3 groups remaining firms into affiliates, second tier firms, and related firms, located in lower

tiers. Again, substantial public equity infusions erode the family’s percentage stakes even as their value

rises. Thus, the book value of family holdings in Oji Paper rose from ¥4.35 M in 1914 to ¥5.23 in 1921,

while its ownership stake dropped from72.5% to 31.6%.

    The increasingly complex pyramidal structure, with more tiers of controlled listed firms, let the

Mitsui reposition firms to their advantage. Morikawa argues that higher tier firms attracted greater family



    89
        The Mitsui Council functioned as a holding company, with various committees and departments but was not a corporation
and therefore could not own property. Actual operating businesses were owned directly by the family from 1898 to 1909.

“concern”, and hence posted higher profitability and lower risk.91 But, key firms in low levels belie this.

Mitsukoshi, heir to the ancestral silk business, moved to a low tier after its 1904 transformation into a

department store chain. Oji Paper and Kanebo, firms of national prominence, also placed in low tiers; as

did Shibura Engineering Works, which merged with Tokyo Electric to form Tokyo Shibura (Toshiba)

Electric in 1939.92 General Electric confirmed Shibura’s importance when it bought a 25 to 30% stake in

1904 for technology licensing.

    It seems plausible that firms were positioned to maximize the family’s returns, while minimizing its

risk. Putting highly profitable low risk firms in the top tier accomplishes this, Korean pyramidal group

restructurings in the late 20th rearranged firms at prices favorable to controlling families, so changes in

zaibatsu structures might be similarly motivated.93 However, firms might also be repositioned to facilitate

tunneling – to facilitate big push growth, to concentrate net profits in firms owned directly by the family,

or both. This too is consistent with superior performance of firms higher in the pyramid, and the location

of many clearly important firms in lower tiers.94

    Records attest that Mitsui Partnership carefully considered which firms to place where, and what

stake each should hold in others. As the zaibatsu grew more complex from 1912 to 1930, lower tiers were

periodically restructured, but the upper tier changed little. Mitsui Bank, Mitsui Bussan, Mitsui Mining

understanding them. The Mitsui considered divesting Shibaura in 1902, but opposition from Mitsui Mining and others forestalled
this. Shibaura went public as a Mitsui company in 1904.

and Toshin Warehousing remained Mitsui Partnership direct subsidiaries.95 The only significant change

added Mitsui Life Insurance and Mitsui Trust Bank to the first tier after 1912.96

    Mitsui’s intensive diversification began with Mitsui Mining’s entry into chemicals in the early 1910s.

The Mitsui textiles business needed dyes, and a Mitsui chemicals firm grew apace with the textiles

operation. Mitsui Bussan founded a shipbuilding firm in 1917 to complement its export business, bought

steel mill in 1924 to supply its ship building and electrical equipment operations, and established Toyo

Rayon to enter artificial fibers. This coordinated diversification wave occurred exclusively through new

subsidiaries of Mitsui Mining, Mitsui Bank and Mitsui Bussan, or new subsidiaries of subsidiaries.

    The growth of the Mitsui zaibatsu seems consistent with a privately orchestrated big push enabled by

the increasingly active public equity markets. The state declared many of these industries priorities, but

subsidies were now checked by legislators’ reluctance to undermine public finances again.

    Instead, the Mitsui turned to equity markets. Statutes precisely defining the nature of a business

corporation and the rights and liabilities of its shareholders made stocks and bonds viable ways for people

to save. The Mitsui responded to each such legal reform with more share issues, increasingly using public

equity issues as necessary to expand existing firms or enter new industries.97 By 1909, most Mitsui

subsidiaries were listed.

    Older upper tier subsidiaries – Mitsui Bank, Mitsui Bussan, or Mitsui Mining – typically controlled

newer high-growth companies, which drew on public equity (and some debt). Thus, earnings from Mitsui

Mining and Mitsui Bussan helped capitalize high growth subsidiaries in chemicals, machinery,

shipbuilding and maritime shipping. These ventures fulfilled government development plans, but public

share issues, not subsidies, funded their growth. In contrast, Mitsui's ancestral silk business, now the

lower tier. Mitsui’s pyramidal structure seemed generally consistent with Mitsui Partnership channeling

earnings and public savings into high growth industries, consistent with a big push.



5.3        The Great Pyramids of Japan

The Mitsui zaibatsu was the first great Japanese pyramidal business group. The others, the Mitsubishi,

Sumitomo, and Nissan zaibatsu, grew similarly, and ended up with similar structures. These expansions

also accord with zaibatsu head offices supplanting the state in coordinating big push growth.



The Mitsubishi Pyramid

Mitsubishi, of course, kept the best double entry accounting records. These let us see big push

coordination in action. Each operating unit had to remit its annual profits less depreciation to the head

office, for reallocation.98 From 1897, two percent daily interest on excess working capital due the

partnership insured timely compliance.

      The partnership distributed these profits across the group to cover losses at weaker firms and finance

expansions at firms with growth opportunities. The head office thus devolved management but controlled

operating and investment budgets at each location. This let it orchestrate the growth of each business so as

to maximize the Iwasaki family’s returns as the zaibatsu expanded. One exception to this, the Mitsubishi

Bank, acquired in 1895, remitted only one tenth of its profits, and so served as a second earnings reservoir

for the group. This rendered it more secure in depositors’ eyes, but still let the Iwasaki allocate lending by

dint of their controlling equity block.

      Distant Iwasaki relatives held “income shares”, and enthusiastically used their dividends establish

new companies. This practice developed so the Iwasaki could operate other businesses while Mitsubishi

obeyed a one-time state edict to focus on shipping or forego subsides. The practice outlived the edict, and

      98
       We translate jigyobu as operating unit. The term describes a division in a conglomerate as well a firm’s operations
pertaining to a specific particular product line


                                                               31
Iwasaki relatives formed Meiji Life Insurance, Asahi Glass, Kirin Beer and other ventures that built up

the pyramid. These were managed independently, but remained dependent on head office capital.

    The head office relied on operating unit managers for information about viable investment

opportunities.99 Devolving capital budgeting to these mangers therefore seemed reasonable. Thus, from

1909 on, the minerals mining operation followed the bank’s lead and retained 90% of its profits. Other

mining, shipbuilding, and sales operations followed in 1911; and the real estate operating unit went a step

further, remitting only 6% of its profits.

    Earnings merely accumulated in many profitable operating units, so the head office soon widely

reinstituted full remission. Thus, the minerals mining operation, after retaining ¥1.65 million in 1911,

resumed full remissions in 1912. The coal mining unit's ¥1 million retention in 1913 likewise triggered

restoration of the old rule. These ventures served Mitsubishi better as profit centers, for growth

opportunities lay elsewhere. This failed experiment in investment devolution highlights the head office’s

coordinating function – the role of big push planners.

    The shipbuilding operating unit, in contrast, continued retaining 90% of its earnings despite

accumulating over ¥1 million in a single year. Presumably the head office felt the operating unit had

viable growth opportunities.

    Mitsubishi fully modernized accounting procedures throughout all operations at this time. Operating

units consolidated balance sheets and income statements for each location and passed the information to

Mitsubishi Limited Partnership. The head office then set retention levels, borrowing, and capital budgets

for each operating unit. This let the operating unit managers finance investments directly related to their

own operations, but also let the head office coordinate the growth of the different operating units and

finance diversification into new industries.

    Thus, Mitsubishi’s growth, formerly financed with state subsidies, now drew mainly on retained

    99
        Hidemasa Morikawa, Zaibatsu: the rise and fall of family enterprise groups in Japan, (Tokyo, University of Tokyo Press,
1992) p. 105 notes that “the survey of salaried managers during the formative period of the zaibatsu leaves the strong impression
that such managers were highly oriented to national goals and relatively well educated. Graduates of Tokyo Imperial University
and Keio Gijuku University were especially enormous. Their education had prepared them to seek as businessman to enhance
their country's place in the world.” Such broadmindedness would perhaps help group firm managers accept decisions detrimental
to their firm, but beneficial to the overall group.


                                                              32
earnings. Profitable operating units with growth opportunities financed their own expansion. Growth

elsewhere depended on Mitsubishi Bank loans and earnings redeployed by the head office. After World

War I, coal mining and shipbuilding profits financed major expansions in iron works, shipbuilding and

banking. The highly profitable mining operating units, especially, had scant growth opportunities of their

own. Very occasionally, especially when head office profits were low, Iwasaki family money was also

plowed back into Mitsubishi.

    But expansion was still financed internally, or with bank depositors’ money. Internal funds proved

insufficient to finance the burgeoning growth of the 1920s. Mitsubishi Mining was the first to list in 1920,

raising ¥14.84 at its initial public offering (IPO). One by one, other Mitsubishi operating units listed, and

started issuing more shares to fund growth. Mitsubishi share offerings raised a total of about ¥45 million

from1920 to 1931.100 Further offerings in the early 1940s brought in many times more. These offerings

often entailed an established firm listing, and then using the funds raised to finance new subsidiaries

rather than growth in its own operations. For example, the first major Mitsubishi listing, Mitsubishi

Mining, had more sufficient earnings to cover its own investment needs.

    From the early 1920s on, these equity issues steadily diluted the Mitsubishi Limited Partnership’s

equity stakes in its listed operating subsidiaries – from an average of 85.5% in 1921 to only 69% by

1928.101 To stem this dilution, these subsidiaries took to financing growth by issuing shares in their own

subsidiaries, rather than issuing more of their own shares. Thus, by 1928, the Mitsubishi group had a

standard pyramidal structure.

    Mitsubishi firms’ bank debts shrank rapidly, disappearing by 1928. Mitsubishi Bank’s 1929 IPO

raised ¥13.72 million, and a subsequent seasoned offering raised another ¥5.87 million. The Mitsubishi

Bank now lent mainly to unrelated firms, and thus held a highly diversified loans portfolio that helped it

survive the 1923 Great Kanto Earthquake and the Great Depression. A few Mitsubishi companies issued

          Though a large part of this dilution involved equity sales to Iwasaki relatives.

bonds, though.102 Other groups, like the Suzuki zaibatsu, which relied mainly on their banks rather than

equity issues, generally did not survive those crises.103



The Sumitomo Pyramid

The Sumitomo eschewed the Meiji mass privatization, and diversified more slowly than the Mitsui or

Mitsubishi. Sumitomo accumulated profits from its Besshi copper mine, but its manager, Saihei Hirose,

opposed diversifying into banking. Sumitomo Bank was established only in 1895, after his departure.

Nevertheless, it grew rapidly through the early 1900s, soon eclipsing Mitsubishi Bank.

    Sumitomo diversification likewise lagged, as did issuing shares. Sumitomo let the others test the

pyramidal group model first, and then moved quite quickly. Like the others, Sumitomo diversified first

into businesses complementary to mining, its core business, and then more broadly. Sumitomo acquired

several distressed firms during Japan’s deep post World War I recession.104 Some of this diversification

seems opportunistic. For example, the Sumitomo took over Japan-US Sheet Glass, a troubled Mitsubishi

joint venture, in 1922 and replaced all its managers. The rechristened Nippon Sheet Glass prospered and,

by 1930, essentially monopolized Japan's flat glass market along with Mitsubishi's Asahi Glass.

    But the diversification’s thrust was entry into industries complementary to existing operations. The

Sumitomo expanded from copper mining to large-scale bulk copper and wire production; and from iron

and coal mining into large-scale iron and steel production. Increasingly sophisticated business dealings

required commensurate banking services, so the family established Sumitomo Trust Bank in 1926.

Shipping and storing valuable metals and metal products required insurance, so they acquired Hinode Life

in 1925 and Fuso Marine Fire and Casualty in 1930. Large-scale coal mines were better sustained if coal

had alternate uses, so Sumitomo Chemicals ventured into ammonia/nitrogen fertilizer production at new

coal-based chemicals plants in 1928.

    The Sumitomo’s inexhaustible cash cow, the Besshi Copper Mine, continued yielding healthy profits,

but Mitsui and Mitsubishi mining operations both generated nearly twice its profits by 1909. While

Sumitomo Bank grew to rival Mitsubishi Bank, Sumitomo’s overall diversification lagged, and its

businesses remained smaller in scale than their Mitsui and Mitsubishi peers through the early 1900s. The

first Sumitomo listing was Sumitomo Fertilizer in 1934, when the family finally came to terms with

the need to tap public equity markets to diversify further.105 From this point on, the Sumitomo

diversified more energetically with rapid-fire share issuances.106



The Nissan Pyramid

The fourth of Japan’s great zaibatsu, Nissan, has a different provenance. The Mitsui and Sumitomo

pyramids grew from old family wealth. Mitsubishi grew with the newly wealthy Iwasaki family. Nissan,

in contrast, was built entirely with public shareholder wealth virtually from its outset – perhaps because

the pyramidal model was already proved when Nissan, the youngest of the four, was conceived.

    Nissan was formed by the initially impecunious Husanosuke Kuhara and his brother-in-law,

Yoshisuke Aikawa. By 1919, Kuhara controlled 30% of Japan’s copper mines, 40% of its gold mines, and

50% of its silver mines; all financed with a ¥2.4 million IPO to capitalize his Kuhara Mining. Japan

prospered during World War I, but subsequent downturns weakened Kuhara Mining and ultimately

bankrupted its subsidiary, Kuhara Trading. The ailing Kuhara retired, leaving Aikawa in charge. An

engineer with state-of-the-art iron US training, Aikawa successfully steered his much smaller Tobata Cast

Iron through the economic turmoil. To save Kuhara Mining, he pooled his money with that of relatives,

managers, and outsiders to inject over ¥25 million into that company. Against all expectations, he saved

Kuhara, became a director in 1926, and then became president. To restore the firm’s long-term health,

Aikawa needed capital. In 1928 he issued shares in a new holding company, Nippon Sangyo (Nissan) and

used the proceeds to capitalize Nippon Mining, which he then merged with Kuhara Mining. Since Kuhara

was already listed, this left Nippon Mining publicly held, but controlled by the widely held Nissan.

    The older zaibatsu families clearly understood the advantages of public equity, but balanced these

against privacy and undisputed control. This balance limited public shareholders’ participation, for it

required unambiguously dominant control blocks throughout the pyramid. The apex firm of the Nissan

group, in contrast, was widely held, and could issue shares to create new subsidiaries, like Nippon Metal,

or acquire control blocks in already listed companies.

    Aikawa rapidly built Nissan into a large, diversified zaibatsu, though machinery remained its most

important business. His technical expertise, still rare in Japan, made him irreplaceable to the group’s core

profit centers, so Aikawa needed no control blocks.107 This let Nissan expand rapidly, since equity-

financed mergers and acquisitions (M&A) permitted faster growth than constructing new facilities.108

    Aikawa preserved Nissan’s technology focus, for its major diversification was into heavy industries,

chemicals, and electric power. Unafraid of public equity, but averse to debt because of Kuhara’s near

bankruptcy, Aikawa saw no need for Nissan to control a bank, and kept Nissan firms’ leverage moderate.

    The big push logic underlying the expansion of the Mitsui, Mitsubishi, and Sumitomo zaibatsu relies

on circumstantial evidence. But Aikawa makes the logic explicit for Nissan in Figure 3, taken directly

from his autobiography. Here, Aikawa models Nissan and its directly owned subsidiaries to a plumbing

system, in which water represents capital.



[Figure 3 about here]



    Nissan was listed and Aikawa had to keep its shareholders satisfied. He accomplished this with a

slowly rising dividend, flowing through the central pipe of the five extending downwards from his ‘public

holding company tub’ representing Nissan, the pyramid’s apex firm. The valve in that pipe is turned so as

to drain the central compartment of that tub, Nissan’s retained earnings, slowly enough that fluctuations

in its water level never alter its dividend flow into the public capital tub at the bottom of the diagram.

Nissan’s other two compartments are filled with capital from securities issues (left) and the sale of

treasury securities (right).

    Nissan’s many operating subsidiaries are represented by the smaller capital tanks across the top of the

diagram. The level of water in these is kept constant across the subsidiaries by their drainage into a

common pipeline to Nissan and their own public investors. Note especially the prominent bidirectional

values on a pipe linking their primary inflow and outflow pipes. By adjusting these, as well as the flow

directly out of the top of the holding company tub, Aikawa can raise or lower the common level in all the

subsidiaries. By carefully adjusting the one-way values on the inflow pipes to each, he can prevent

profitable ones from accumulating capital and less profitable ones from draining empty. A parallel system

of debt financing pipes tapping water from a financial institutions tub completes the picture.

    Morck and Nakamura correctly note that Figure 3 describes tunneling.109 But closer inspection

suggests tunneling to sustain a big push. The plumbing is arranged to keep a constant level of water

across subsidiary tanks – so those with large investment needs do not run dry and so those with few

investment needs do not overflow. Aikawa specifically justifies using overall profits to subsidize losses

in key firms, and investing in “a few new business lines” that would lose money, but were nonetheless

“important to the nation” and likely to augment Nissan’s long run financial health.110 These ventures

included an auto manufacturing firm, subsequently named Nissan Motor, an Antarctic whaling business,

and a broadcasting company.111 This cross-industry and intertemporal subsidization, financed by current

earnings from a constellation of industries, is precisely what big push development strategists envision.

    As Nissan grew, Aikawa carefully structured voting blocks and crossholdings so every listed

subsidiary was unambiguously controlled by other group firms. This was presumably necessary because

big push growth requires firms in some industries at subsidize those in other industries. While this might

optimize overall gains for the group, as reflected in Nissan’s own share price, shareholders of subsidiaries

conscripted to provide subsidies might ‘hold up’ the transaction to seize the group’s economic profits.112

Wielding a control block let Aikawa marginalize tetchy shareholders under such circumstances.113

    Nissan’s share price rose steadily through the Great Depression, allowing repeated equity issues to

finance opportunistic M&A in the bear market of the 1930s. His broad strategy was to buy promising

firms, develop them as fully owned subsidiaries, and then refloat them via partial IPOs. In creating these

spin-offs, or bunshin kaisha, Nissan resembled modern US private equity firms.114 However, the latter

usually sell all their shares to the public to raise funds for the next venture, while Nissan always retained a

control block, using further IPOs to extend the pyramid. This let Aikawa channel earnings from across the

widely diversified group back to Nissan, and thence to other group firms.

    Aikawa constantly recognized his duty to keep Nissan’s dividends on track, so other listed group

firms were managed to benefit the apex firm.115 To Aikawa, this mandated broad group diversification to

provide Nissan low-risk cash inflows. Subsidiaries in many industries meant a downturn in one was likely

to be offset by an upturn in another. When the government began accumulating gold in 1932, Nissan sold

Nippon Mining shares and used the proceeds to diversify further. By 1937, the group included Nippon

Mining, Hitachi, Ltd., Hitachi Power, Nissan Motor and numerous other large manufacturers and utilities.

    Nissan grew rapidly, surpassing Sumitomo as the third largest zaibatsu by the 1930s; and its apex

holding company grew successively more widely held. Its shareholder base rose from 20,000 in 1934 to

     113
         An alternative strategy, of combining all Nissan operations into a single widely held company could also have prevented
such shareholder hold up problems. One possible advantage of the pyramidal structure might have been that Aikawa could tunnel
earnings into Nissan give its shareholders a generous return at the expense of selected subsidiary shareholders even during
downturns.

51,804 in May 1937. Although 98% of the latter held fewer than 500 shares, these small investors

collectively owned over 50% of the Nissan’s equity. Only 33 shareholders owned over 10,000 shares, and

the Aikawa family’s combined stake totaled only 5.2% in 1937.116

    Nissan's listed subsidiaries prospered on average, further enriching both Nissan’s shareholders and

their own. Listed subsidiaries formed or acquired more lower tier subsidiaries, and the pyramid expanded.

Nissan's own paid-in capital, ¥5.25 million in 1933, rose to ¥198.37 million in 1937, as its total assets

soared from ¥91.08 to ¥383.10 million. This mainly reflected the rising value of its direct subsidiaries, for

Nissan’s stock portfolio rose in value from ¥53.38 to ¥269.92 million over the period.



Lesser Pyramids and Other Structures

The top four zaibatsu were widely imitated by other families and entrepreneurs. 117 The chemistry experts

Shitagu Noguchi, Tomonori Nakano, and Nobuteru Mori modeled their widely held Nichitsu, Nisso, and

Mori zaibatsu on Nissan. Masatoshi Okochi, an expert in machinery manufacture, constructed the Riken

zaibatsu, again with a widely held firm at the apex.

    Of prominent merchant families from the Tokugawa era, only the Yasuda clan ultimately joined the

Mitsui and Sumitomo in constructing significant pyramidal groups. The Yasuda kept to finance, and

never gained the prominence accorded the other two. Other zaibatsu, imitating Mitsubishi, arose as

wealthy entrepreneurs sought to establish dynasties. Again, none grew to anything approaching the scale

and scope of the top four. Finally, zaibatsu were not coextensive with Japan’s business sector. By the

1920s, Japan’s stock markets were large by world standards.118 Numerous freestanding firms also traded,

and professional managers played important roles in many.119

5.4       Pyramid Power

Japan transformed itself from a feudal barter economy into a modern industrial state in one lifetime.

Figure 5 shows real living standards doubling from 1885 to 1920, and tripling by World War II. Figure 6

shows a labor force only slightly more concentrated in primary sectors than in Canada or France.

      The Japan that achieved this economic miracle is quite different from the Japan of today. Its financial

system was market-centered, for equity finance predominated. It entrusted corporate governance to

powerful families and tycoons, who organized listed firms into pyramidal groups; and likely maximized

of their own wealth, concentrated in the pyramids’ apex firms. Apex firm value maximization is unlikely

to coincide with shareholder value maximization in any individual lower tier firm.120

      But, at least for a time, it perhaps aligned the wealthy families’ and tycoons’ interests with the social

welfare goal of a successful big push, which requires that industries grow in tandem, with suppliers and

customers eschewing opportunities to hold each other up and expanding in tandem. This sometimes

requires one industry to lose money temporarily so another can exploit profitable growth opportunities.

Pyramidal business groups give the apex firm undisputable control over a large constellation of listed

subsidiaries, and subsidiaries of subsidiaries, populating many industries. The party in control of the apex

firm can prevent firms from holding each other up and can coordinate cross-subsidized growth where it

makes overall financial sense for the group. Whether the controlling shareholder’s interest align precisely

with those of a central planner selflessly coordinating a big push is a knotty problem. But a degree of

alignment seems plausible.

5.5 The Pyramids’ Curse

Why did Japan’s big push succeed, while similar programs in Latin America, South Asia, and Africa

repeatedly fail?121 We propose that Japan’s unique success occurred because its feudal elite, then its

reformist government, and finally its zaibatsu families, propitiously bowed out.

    First, Japan’s feudal elite was uniquely marginalized by early Meiji shock therapy. Elsewhere,

traditional elites, intent on preserving their social and economic dominance, are thought to stifle

growth.122 After the failed 1877 Seinan Uprising, Japan’s feudal elite was a spent force.

     The Meiji state too was propitiously marginalized. It began a classic big push, subsidizing SOEs in

all major industries. Standard government failure problems forced a mass privatization to restore

government finances. Thus burned, the state avoided subsidizing industry or establishing SOEs for

several decades. This left business largely to itself. Elsewhere, big push programs remain state-directed

indefinitely, magnifying political rent seeking returns. Rampant government failure, unsurprisingly,

strangles growth after an initial spurt.123

    Japan’s zaibatsu took over the big push, brought it to completion, and then were also abruptly

marginalized. Economic development stalls when a old money families manipulate the state to entrench

their status.124 This could not happen in Japan, for the zaibatsu families were fortuitously sidelined after a

    The military government, which seized power in the 1930s through assassination, blackmail, and

intimidation, had a surprisingly populist – in some respects, almost socialist – ideology for a fascist

dictatorship.125 Coining an expression that echoes through financial history, the military condemned

zaibatsu families for an unpatriotic “short term focus” on the current earnings and dividends of their apex

firms.126 Acting on these “concerns”, the military de facto took control of the investment policies and

strategic decisions of the country’s great corporations. Whether zaibatsu families were coöpted or

conscripted is debated, but the military substantially sidelined them. 127

    The US occupation’s zaibatsu dissolution program completed their marginalization. Justified on

antitrust grounds, but probably to diffuse zaibatsu families’ political power, the program confiscated the

families’ shares and intercorporate equity blocks, and sold these into the open market.128

    Thus, Japan’s zaibatsu families did not become an old-money elite of the sort Haber portrays in Latin

America.129 Instead, postwar Japan entrusted the governance of its largest corporations to professional

managers. The zaibatsu families added momentum to the big push, but then lost their hold.

    Finally, Japan’s unequal treaties kept trade barriers low and precluded foreign investment barriers.

Much work links elite entrenchment to financial insularity.130 These treaties empowered foreign courts to

apply foreign law to disputes in treaty concession enclaves, demonstrating a spectrum of foreign legal

systems in action. These working examples let Meiji Japan devise and rapidly implement a modern legal

system. The structure of a country’s legal system correlated with its financial development and growth.131

Japan’s stock markets were large by contemporary standards in the early twentieth century.132 Openness

also lets imports and exports, as well as foreign capital, substitute for missing pieces of the domestic

economy in a big push.133




6. Conclusion

Easterly concedes Japan as exemplifying a successful big push, a government-coordinated expansion of

interdependent industries that sidesteps hold-up problems.134 That Japan joined the modern world

remarkably quickly is clear. The Meiji Restoration took place in 1868, and by the end of World War I

Japan was an industrial economy on par with much of Europe. But most of its big push was likely not

government coordinated.

    Rather, Japan’s economic history suggests a big push can succeed under certain circumstances despite

gloomy evidence to the contrary.135 Specifically,

1. The state gives an initial shove, marginalizing traditional elites, reforming basic institutions, perhaps

    even subsidizing technology imports, and then withdraws its hand. This withdrawal checks

    government failure problems.

2. Pyramidal business groups emerge to propel the big push. An undisputed controlling shareholder

    focusing on the apex firm’s value, prevents hold up problems and coordinates cross-industry

    subsidies, as group member firms tap public equity markets to capitalize cascades of subsidiaries

    spanning all relevant industries. At least to some extent, this echoes what a selfless central planner

    coordinating a big push would do

3. The controlling shareholders are marginalized as the big push nears completion. This prevents

    entrenched oligarchy problems from reversing the big push.

4. All this is done with limited trade barriers and no barriers against foreign investment.

If this thesis is valid, Japan offers an alternative big push prescription for today’s emerging economies.

    That Japan’s experience is replicable is unclear. Inefficient SOEs became a political liability in Meiji

Japan – perhaps because of Confucian expectations that bureaucrats should be honest.136 Japan’s feudal

elite, central planners, and zaibatsu families were auspiciously discredited in circumstances difficult to

replicate elsewhere. Elites, once established, are usually hard to dislodge.137

    Our big push theory of pyramidal business groups differs from other explanations of pyramidal

business groups. Business group firms may well let firms coinsure each other to spread risk.138 Group

firms may well trust each other to do business in economies where corruption stymies arm’s length

dealing.139 Without denying such possibilities, we suggest a broader argument that subsumes them. The

highly industrially diversified pyramidal structure common to business groups throughout the world

permits a controlling shareholder to stem hold-up problems and coordinate growth across diverse

complementary industries, permitting very rapid growth financed by public equity – a big push.

    Further research is clearly needed to test these ideas.                If our thesis is valid, diversification in

pyramidal business groups, at least in rapidly growing economies, should do more than spread risks.

These groups should disproportionately contain firms that would risk hold up problems were they

freestanding. Cross-subsidization should also balance growth across complementary industries, not just

enrich controlling shareholders. In contrast, pure risk sharing implies that groups should contain firms

whose returns are as little correlated as possible. We welcome further work exploring these issues more

thoroughly, and hope to pursue them ourselves in subsequent studies.

Capital is pumped from the public capital tub at the bottom up to the operating subsidiaries at the
top – directly, through the Nissan holding company tub in the center, or through the financial
institutions tub at the lower right. By turning one-way and bidirectional values, Aikawa could
adjust the level of capital in each operating subsidiary to its needs, subsidizing weak but
necessary units with the overall profits of the industrially diversified group.

Only real per capita Gross National Product (GNP) is available up to 1930, after which real per
capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is reported. The difference is that GDP includes economic
activity by foreign firms within Japan, but excludes activity by Japanese firms abroad. GDP is now
generally preferred as a measure of economy performance, but was not introduced in most
countries until well into the 20th century.
