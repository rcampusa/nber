In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of place-based payroll taxes in stimulating local
employment by exploiting a unique policy setting in Norway, where a system of geographically
differentiated payroll taxes was suddenly abolished due to an EU regulation. The reform was
enforced independently of the regional labor market developments, creating arguably exogenous
variation in the payroll tax rates that firms in different local labor markets faced over time. We
find evidence of partial shifting of payroll tax increases on to worker wages as well as a
significant decline in local employment. These findings suggest that in settings with some
degrees of wage rigidity, place-based payroll tax incentives can be effective in stimulating local
employment.

1 Introduction
As highlighted in a recent review by Kline and Moretti (2014a), most countries exhibit large
and persistent geographical differences in income and employment, and a growing class of
place-based policies attempt to reduce these differences through targeting underdeveloped or
economically distressed regions. The most prominent and extensively studied place-based
policies include enterprise zones such as the Empowerment Zone Program in the U.S. (Busso
et al. 2013); infrastructure investment such as the Appalachian Regional Commission (Glaeser
and Gottlieb 2008) and the Tennessee Valley Authority (Kline and Moretti 2014b) in the U.S.
and EU structural funds (Becker et al. 2010, 2012) in Europe; and discretionary subsidy
policies such as the Regional Selective Assistance program in the UK (Devereux et al. 2007;
Criscuolo et al. 2019).1
        A form of policy that has received less attention in this literature is place-based payroll
tax incentives commonly used in Finland, Norway, and Sweden (see Korkeamäki and Uusitalo
2009; Johansen and Klette 1997; Bennmarker et al. 2009). Payroll taxes are the backbone of
financing the social insurance system in these countries, and payroll taxes levied on firms
constitute about 15% of the total tax revenue in OECD countries. 2 As payroll taxes are
proportional to workers’ earnings, they serve as an additional labor cost for firms, beyond the
gross wages paid to employees. To stimulate employment in remote areas, and thereby reduce
regional disparities in labor market opportunities, governments of Finland, Sweden and
Norway (used to) apply geographically differentiated payroll tax rates. Norway for instance,
had, from the 1970’s and up until 2003, five tax zones with payroll tax rates ranging from 0%
in the northernmost regions to 14.1% in the central areas.
        In this paper, we investigate whether such place-based payroll tax incentives are indeed
effective in boosting employment in low tax areas, by looking at the case of Norway. The key
challenge to evaluating geographically differentiated payroll taxes is that the prevailing tax
rates in different regions likely reflect the regional economic conditions or developments. This
makes it difficult to separate the impacts of different payroll tax rates on employment and
wages from the effects of local labor market conditions or business cycles. We overcome this
challenge by exploiting a unique policy setting in Norway in the mid-2000s, where the system
of geographically differentiated payroll taxes was suddenly abolished.

        Prior to the reform, the government of Norway allowed lower payroll tax rates in remote
areas to stimulate employment and business activity, and to avoid depopulation of sparsely
populated areas of the country. In 1999, however, the European Free Trade Association
Surveillance Authority (ESA) ruled that the Norwegian system of geographically differentiated
payroll tax rates was not in compliance with European Union (EU) trade regulations. The result
was a tax rate harmonization reform that took place between 2004 and 2006. The reform was
adopted and implemented independently of the local labor market developments and thereby
created (arguably) exogenous variation in the payroll tax rates faced by firms in different
regions over time. At the same time as complying with the EU ruling of a tax harmonization,
the Norwegian government implemented a subsidy scheme that essentially rendered small
firms exempt from the payroll tax increase.
        Our analysis takes advantage of the EU-induced payroll tax changes at the level of the
local labor market or commuting zone (there are 45 commuting zones in Norway excluding
Oslo).3 Specifically, we compare changes in employment and wages before (2000-2003) and
after (2004-2006) the abolition of geographically differentiated payroll taxes between
commuting zones that are differentially exposed to the policy. Even though there are just five
tax zones, there is variation in payroll tax increases across the 45 commuting zones. First, and
most importantly, this is because 23 out of the 45 commuting zones span more than one tax
zone. Second, the relevant tax rates are determined by the location of the worker rather than
that of the firm or establishment, and commuting zones may differ with respect to their
propensity to hire workers from different locations.
        We find that a one percentage point increase in the payroll rate tax leads to a decline in
wages in the local labor market of 0.32%; although this effect is imprecisely estimated. Taking
into account that only large firms—which employ about 70% of workers in the local labor
market—are subject to the payroll tax increase in our context (see Section 2 for details), this
wage response implies a pass-through rate of 0.46%, a rate comparable to that found in
Holmlund (1983) and Johansen and Klette (1997) for earlier periods in Sweden and Norway.4
We further find a significant decrease in local employment in response to the payroll tax hike:
a one percentage point increase in the payroll tax rate reduces employment in the local labor
market by 1.37%. The employment decline is largely driven by workers transitioning from

3
  The commuting zones are constructed by Statistics Norway, based on commuting flows of workers between
municipalities over the years 2002-2006, rather than on administrative boundaries. See Bhuller (2009) for a
documentation of the construction of commuting zones.
4
  Results are also consistent with Stokke (2017) who looks at heterogeneous effects of payroll tax decreases in
Norway on employment and wages among workers with different levels of education.

                                                      2
employment to un- or non-employment rather than worker relocation (i.e., outmigration to
different commuting zones). 5,6
         When viewed through the lens of a perfectly competitive model where firms choose
inputs to maximize profits, and taking into account that only large firms are subject to the
payroll tax hike, our wage and employment responses imply a labor demand elasticity of -3.60.
This estimate falls in the upper range of estimates reported in the literature (see e.g., Lichter et
al. 2015 for a meta study). One possible explanation for such a large labor demand elasticity is
that capital is fixed over the three-year study period.7 An alternative explanation is one based
on liquidity constraints, as recently put forward by Saez et al. (2019). The idea here is that
liquidity-constrained firms faced with an unexpected windfall loss (in our context caused by a
payroll tax hike) may be forced to bring down labor costs quickly to lessen the magnitude of
the windfall loss, and thus reduce employment by more than what is implied by the competitive
model. Yet another explanation for the large local employment decline in response to the
payroll tax hike (and hence a large inferred labor demand elasticity) is agglomeration spillover
effects (see e.g., Ciccone and Hall 1996; Greenstone et al. 2010) or local multiplier effects (see
e.g., Moretti 2010).8
         Ultimately, the effectiveness of place-based payroll tax incentives in stimulating local
employment depends on how flexibly wages can adjust to a given tax change. In settings where
rising labor costs for firms are easily shifted on to worker wages, we would expect no changes
in employment levels in response to payroll tax hikes (see e.g., Anderson and Meyer 1997,
2000; Gruber 1997). In contrast, in situations where wages cannot fully adjust, employment
levels may indeed be responsive to payroll tax changes (see e.g., Kugler and Kugler 2009;
Cruces et al. 2010; Saez et al. 2019). The fact that higher payroll taxes are not fully shifted on
to worker wages in our context is indicative of downward wage rigidity in Norway. 9 Overall,
our findings suggest that in settings with some degrees of wage rigidity, place-based payroll
tax incentives can be effective in stimulating local employment.


5
  Non-employment here refers to a status where workers are not on unemployment benefits, but at the same time
do not have a labor income high enough to support themselves.
6
  This finding is consistent with Dale-Olsen (2018) who shows an increased inflow into disability benefit receipt
after a payroll tax hike.
7
  As we show in Section 3, when capital is fixed, the Cobb-Douglas production function implies a labor demand
elasticity that is equal to one divided by the capital share in production. That is, assuming a capital share of one
third, the implied labor demand elasticity is -3, close to our estimate.
8
  According to this explanation, a reduction in labor demand in some firms spill over to other firms in the local
labor market (that thereby also reduce their labor demand) either through a decline in firm productivity or through
a decline in the demand for local services in the region.
9
  Wage rigidity due to labor market institutions and collective wage bargaining was also documented in prior
research including Saez et al. (2012) and Lehmann et al. (2013) in the contexts of Greece and France, respectively.

                                                         3
       By evaluating the impact of geographically differentiated payroll taxes on local wages
and employment, we add to the growing literature on place-based policies (see Kline and
Moretti 2014a). Whereas most place-based policies offer a package of programs and incentives
(e.g., tax credits together with a block grant) with multitudes of policy objectives, the place-
based policy reform evaluated in this paper allows us to isolate the effect of payroll tax
incentives in isolation on regional wages and employment. In addition, by proposing a new
research design based on an exogenous abolishment of pre-existing and geographically
differentiated payroll tax rates faced by firms, we also contribute to the empirical literature that
estimates own-wage labor demand elasticities (see Lichter et al., 2015 for an overview).
       The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 explains the policy setting
whereas Section 3 presents a theoretical framework to aid the structuring and interpretation of
our empirical analysis. Section 4 describes our empirical strategy, and Section 5 presents the
data. The results of the empirical analysis, and a discussion of the findings are provided in
Section 6. Some concluding comments are provided in Section 7.



2 Background
2.1 The Payroll Tax Harmonization Reform

Norway runs a generous social security system to finance pension benefits and health
insurance, as well as unemployment, disability and welfare benefits. The system is largely
financed through payroll taxes. While employees contribute 8.2% of their gross pay to the
scheme, regardless of where they reside, employers’ contributions are geographically
differentiated. Even though some employers pay significantly more into the system than others,
all employees draw the same benefits from the scheme. The motivation behind geographically
differentiated payroll taxes is to stimulate employment in more remote areas of the country.
Until 2006, Norway was divided into five tax zones, with payroll tax rates ranging from 0% in
the northernmost regions to 14.1% in the central areas (see Appendix Figure A.1). The relevant
tax rates faced by a firm was determined by the locations of the workers rather than the location
of the firm. This meant that firms located in the same tax zone could face different average tax
rates depending on the residency locations of their workers.
       In 1999, the European Free Trade Association Surveillance Authority (ESA) ruled that
the Norwegian system of geographically differentiated tax rates was not in compliance with
trade regulations agreed on by the EU and the European Economic Area (EEA) countries

                                                 4
including Norway, Iceland and Lichtenstein. Norway contested the ruling, arguing that the
differentiated tax rates (with only minor changes for certain industries) should be considered
as direct transport aid in line with EU-EEA legislation. ESA approved the proposal, and
Norway was allowed to keep the system until 2003.
         In September 2002, however, ESA sent a letter to Norwegian authorities requiring that
the system had to be changed, and Norway was asked to propose a change by March 25th 2003
that was to be implemented by January 1st 2004.10 As a result, a tax rate harmonization was
imposed between 2004 and 2006. The resulting payroll tax changes in the different zones are
illustrated in Figure 1 (see also Table A.1 in the appendix). Zone 5 (the northernmost region)
was allowed to keep its zero payroll tax rate. Zone 1 (central areas) was likewise unaffected,
and the payroll tax rate remained constant at 14.1%. In zone 2 the harmonization took place
immediately in 2004, raising the tax rate from 10.6% in 2003 to 14.1% in 2004, while the
harmonization was more gradual in zones 3 and 4, raising the payroll tax rate by 5.7 and 6.6
percentage points over a three-year period.11


                                                   [Figure 1]


         The externally imposed harmonization provides an ideal setting to study the impact of
payroll tax increases on regional employment and wages, since the changes in the average
payroll tax rate faced by firms were imposed by ESA, and are therefore likely to be independent
of the local labor market business cycles.
         At the same time as complying with the EU ruling of a tax harmonization, the
Norwegian government implemented a subsidy scheme to ease the burden (especially on small
firms) of the higher payroll taxes introduced in 2004. In particular, firms (in most sectors) could
pay the pre-reform (2003) payroll tax rate for the wage bill up to a cap, after which firms would
pay the contemporary statutory tax rate for the remaining wage bill. The subsidy is computed
at the level of the firm (as opposed to the establishment); the wage bill therefore refers to the
firm’s total wage bill across all establishments. The cap was set such that firms were given a

11
  In 2007, another ESA ruling allowed Norway to re-introduce the system of differentiated payroll taxes (after an
appeal case), and tax rates were reduced to their pre-2004 levels. Several other changes to the payroll tax system
was made in 2007. First, the statutory tax rate faced by firms were to depend on the location of the firm, as opposed
to the location of the workers. Second, some of the municipalities in zone 1 and 4 were classified under two new
tax zones: 1a and 4a. Third, there were some changes to the sector exemptions from the system.

                                                         5
maximum tax relief (subsidy) of 270,000 NOK (38,136 USD) per year. 12 Accordingly, the
actual subsidy received by a firm varied over time (as the harmonization proceeded), and
depended on the worker composition of the firm. Specifically, the subsidy for firm j in year t
is given by:


                                      𝑁𝑗,𝑡
                         𝑆𝑗,𝑡 = min⁡{∑𝑖=1  𝑤𝑖,𝑡 × (𝜏𝑖,𝑡 − 𝜏𝑖,2003 ) , 𝑆̅},


where 𝑤𝑖,𝑡 is the total earnings of worker i employed at this firm in year t, 𝑁𝑗,𝑡 is the number

of workers in firm j (across all establishments) in year t, 𝜏𝑖,𝑡 and 𝜏𝑖,2003 are the post- and pre-
reform statutory tax rates relevant for worker 𝑖 (or her municipality of residence), and 𝑆̅ is the
maximum subsidy. In consequence, in areas that saw an increase in the statutory tax rate, only
large firms above a certain size effectively experienced an increase in the payroll tax rate; small
firms, on the other hand, were not directly affected by the tax reform. The firm’s effective tax
rate 𝜏𝑗,𝑡
      𝐸
          then is:


                                                           𝑁
                                    𝐸
                                   𝜏𝑗,𝑡                     𝑗,𝑡
                                        = 𝜏𝑗,𝑡 − (𝑆𝑗,𝑡 / ∑𝑖=1   𝑤𝑖,𝑡 ),


                                               𝑁
where 𝜏𝑗,𝑡 is the statutory tax rate, and ∑𝑖=1
                                             𝑗,𝑡
                                                 𝑤𝑖,𝑡 is the firm’s total wage bill.
        In Figure 2, we plot the expected effective tax increase from 2003 to 2006 against firms’
2003 wage bills based on the tax schedule shown in Appendix Table A.1. Figure 2 illustrates,
for each tax zone separately, the effective tax increases that firms will experience assuming
that each firm recruits all its workers from its own tax zone. As expected, there are no changes
in the effective tax rates in zones 1 and 5 (as the reform does not change the statutory tax rates
in these zones). For zones 2, 3, and 4, the figure shows that firms below a certain size will not
be directly affected by the tax increase whereas the effective tax rate converges towards the
statutory tax rate as the wage bill increases and the subsidy becomes negligible. The cutoff
point for being exempt from tax increases varies across zones, with the most stringent cutoff
(for firms recruiting all their workers from zone 4) corresponding to an annual wage bill of less
than 4.1 million NOK (580,000 USD) in 2003.

2.2 Labor Market Institutions in Norway

The tax structure and labor market institutions of an economy often go hand in hand (e.g.,
Summers et al. 1993). In assessing the impact of a place-based payroll tax policy in Norway,
it is therefore important to have an understanding of Norway’s labor market, and in particular
wage setting, institutions. The wage setting in Norway is characterized by centralized
bargaining and a high degree of unionization. In 2014, 52% of Norwegian workers were
members of a trade union, and close to 70% of workers in the private sector were employed in
firms that were members of an employer federation (FAFO 2014). Even though only firms that
belong to an employer federation are legally required to pay union wages, non-member firms
often do so as well. The guiding idea behind the wage bargaining system is that the outcome
of wage negotiations in the sectors exposed to foreign competition should set the norm for
wage growth also in other sectors of the economy. In this way, overall wage growth is linked
to productivity growth in the exposed sectors.
       In practice, the main federation of trade unions (Landsorganisasjonen i Norge) and the
main private sector employee federation (Næringslivets Hovedorganisasjon) bargain over
wages in the manufacturing sector, based on a common assessment of the economic situation
produced by a committee with broad representation. This centralized wage bargaining typically
determines a minimum wage increase, while leaving room for local negotiations of
supplementary wage increases at the firm level. The local negotiations are supposed to take
into account a firm’s profitability, productivity, expectations for the future and competitiveness
(NOU 2013:13). Despite the manufacturing sector being quite small in Norway, the outcome
of the centralized negotiations in this sector has usually served as an effective norm for wage
growth both in other private sectors and in the public sector (Kahn 1998; Gjelsvik et al. 2015).



3 Theoretical Framework
A unique aspect of the 2004-2006 reform was the subsidy scheme that rendered large and small
firms, operating in the same local labor market, subject to different effective tax rates, even
though the region as a whole experienced an increase in the statutory tax rate. This setting gives
rise to two main questions with respect to the reform-induced increase in the statutory tax rates:
(i) how do overall employment and wages in the region respond? And (ii) do employment and
wages adjust differently in large compared to small firms in the region?

                                                 7
        To structure our analysis, we outline a benchmark framework of a perfectly competitive
labor market where wages can freely adjust to equate supply and demand for labor, and there
is one common market-clearing wage among large (subject to tax hikes) and small (exempt
from tax hikes) firms operating in the same local labor market. We then consider possible
avenues in which the Norwegian setting may depart from the competitive benchmark.



3.1 The Competitive Benchmark

Production Function Suppose that both types of firms produce output Y by combining labor
L and capital according to a Cobb-Douglas production function. Following Glaeser and
Gottlieb (2009), we distinguish between two types of capital: capital that is fixed at the firm
(𝐾
 ̅ ) and capital that is fully flexible (K). A firm’s production function is then given by:


                                          ̅ (1−α)(1−µ) K (1−α)µ ⁡,
                                  𝑌 = AL𝛼 K


where µ is the share of fully flexible capital. Assume that all output is sold in international
markets at price p = 1. Denote by 𝐿𝐷 and 𝐿𝑆 the labor demand and labor supply, respectively,
and 𝑤 the wage. The statutory payroll tax rate is denoted by 𝜏.


Labor Demand In Appendix A, we outline the behaviour of large and small firms that operate
in a given area. Firms choose labor and capital inputs in order to maximize profits. In this setup,
we obtain the following labor demand elasticity ε𝐷 :


                                         𝑑𝑙𝑜𝑔𝐿𝐷        1−(1−𝛼)µ
                                  ε𝐷 =            = − (1−𝛼)(1−µ)                                 (1)
                                         𝑑𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑤



which is increasing (in absolute terms) in the labor’s share of output (𝛼), and the share of fully
flexible capital (µ).


                                                                        𝑑𝑙𝑜𝑔𝐿𝑠
Labor Supply Let ε𝑆 denote the local labor supply elasticity, ε𝑆 =               ≥ 0. If local labor
                                                                        𝑑𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑤

supply is infinitely elastic (ε𝑆 → ∞), a slightly higher wage in another local labor market will
induce workers to seek employment in that market (leading wages to equalize across local labor
markets). If, in contrast, local labor supply is fully inelastic (ε𝑆 = 0; for example because of
excessively high moving costs)), all workers remain employed in their current local labor

                                                   8
market irrespective of the prevailing wage rate in their current relative to other local labor
markets. In addition to movements across regions induced by a wage increase, the local labor
supply elasticity captures movements into, and out of, employment within the same region.


Equilibrium Adjustments How then do wages in the region respond to an increase in the
payroll tax rate in that region? In Appendix A, we show that local wages adjust according to:


                                          𝑑𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑤     𝜙ε𝐷
                                                  = ε𝑆 −ε𝐷 ≤ 0                                  (2)
                                        dlog(1+𝜏)



where 𝜙 denotes the share of workers employed by large firms subject to the tax increase in
the local economy. If 𝜙 = 1, this expression reduces to the standard expression capturing tax
incidence in the literature (see, e.g., Gruber 1997). In this formulation, full wage shifting—
where a 1 percentage point increase in the payroll tax rate leads to a 1% reduction in wages—
occurs in the two special cases: either labor supply is fully inelastic (ε𝐷 = 0), or labor demand
is infinitely elastic (ε𝐷 → −∞). In the more general case where some firms are exempt from
the payroll tax hike, the maximum possible wage shifting (i.e., ε𝐷 = 0 or ε𝐷 → −∞), equals
– 𝜙, the employment share in firms that are subject to the payroll tax increase.
          Since the equilibrium wage falls in response to an increase in the payroll tax rate, small
firms that are exempt from the tax increase expand their employment. Denoting the
employment in small firms by 𝐿𝑈 , we can express the change in 𝐿𝑈 to a change in the payroll
tax as:


                                     𝑑𝑙𝑜𝑔𝐿𝑈             𝑑𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑤
                                              = ε𝐷 dlog(1+𝜏) ≥ 0                                (3)
                                    dlog(1+𝜏)



On the other hand, employment in large firms, which we denote by 𝐿𝐴 , will shrink following
the increase in the payroll tax, as long as the wage decrease is less than proportionate to the tax
                   𝑑𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑤
increase (i.e., |dlog(1+𝜏)| < 1):


                               𝑑𝑙𝑜𝑔𝐿𝐴             𝑑𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑤
                                          = ε𝐷 (dlog(1+𝜏) + 1) ≤ 0                              (4)
                              dlog(1+𝜏)




                                                    9
        The expressions (3) and (4) together imply that a payroll tax increase that applies to
only some firms in the local labor market will shift employment away from large firms (subject
to the tax increase) toward small firms (exempt from the tax increase). Total employment in
the local economy 𝐿𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 ⁡(= 𝐿𝐴 + 𝐿𝑈 ) adjusts according to:


                       𝑑𝑙𝑜𝑔𝐿𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙          𝑑𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑤                𝜙⁡𝜀 𝑆
                                    = ε𝐷 (dlog(1+𝜏) + 𝜙) = ε𝐷 (𝜀𝑆 −𝜀𝐷) ≤ 0                     (5)
                       dlog(1+𝜏)



The reduction in total regional employment will be more extensive when labor supply is more
elastic. If labor supply is infinitely elastic, for instance, total employment shrinks according to
𝑑𝑙𝑜𝑔𝐿𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙
             = ⁡𝜙ε𝐷 , and equilibrium wages remain unchanged. In contrast, if labor supply is
dlog(1+𝜏)

completely inelastic (ε𝑆 = 0), an increase in the statutory tax rate leaves total employment
unchanged (equation (5)), whereas the increased tax will be fully passed on to workers’ wages.
Furthermore, regional employment will decline more when labor demand is more elastic.



3.2 Possible Avenues of Departure from the Competitive Benchmark
The analysis so far has assumed that wages can fully adjust to equate local labor supply to labor
demand. The particular wage setting institutions in Norway, however, may render large wage
declines in response to tax hikes impossible, and hence wages may be partially downward rigid.
The degree of downward wage rigidity plays a similar role in determining the wage and
employment responses to the payroll tax increase as magnitude of the labor supply elasticity:
The more downward rigid wages are, the more employment will shrink following the payroll
tax increase.
       When we allow for wage rigidity (and hence no longer maintain market clearing 𝐿𝑆 =
𝐿𝐷 ), employment in small and large firms, as well as overall regional employment, will
continue to adjust according to equations (3), (4) and (5). What will be different from the
competitive case is the wage response. In particular, the wage response to the payroll tax
               𝑑𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑤
increase (dlog(1+𝜏)) is now determined by the specific wage setting and central bargaining

institutions. We will first assess our empirical findings against the competitive benchmark, and
then consider the implications of downward wage rigidity.




                                                   10
4 Empirical Strategy
The main challenge to evaluating place-based tax incentives, in the form of geographically
differentiated payroll taxes, is that the policy is usually implemented in response to the local
economic conditions. This makes it difficult to find a comparable control group to construct a
counterfactual outcome – i.e., the outcome in the absence of the place-based policy – for the
affected regions. We overcome this challenge by exploiting a setting where the existing place-
based policy was suddenly abolished due to an ESA ruling, as described in Section 2.1.
         We conduct the analysis at the level of the local labor market, defined as a commuting
zone, and compare changes in employment and wages before and after the abolition of
geographically differentiated payroll taxes between commuting zones that are differentially
exposed to the policy. Norway can be divided into 46 commuting zones or regional labor
markets (see Appendix Figure A.1). We exclude the commuting zone of Oslo from our
analysis, as it is far larger and more densely populated than any other commuting zone in
                                                             13
Norway, leaving us with 45 commuting zones.                       Commuting zones are constructed by
Statistics Norway and are defined based on commuting flows of workers between
municipalities over the years 2002-2006, rather than from administrative boundaries.14 They
thus closely correspond to the concept of a local labor market in Section 3.
         Our particular institutional setting provides variation in payroll tax increases across all
45 commuting zones, rather than just across the five large tax zones. First, and most
importantly, this is because 23 out of the 45 commuting zones span more than one tax zone.
Second, the relevant tax rates are determined by the location of the worker rather than that of
the firm or establishment, and commuting zones may differ with respect to their propensity to
hire workers from different locations.



4.1 Changes in the Statutory Tax Rate

We start out by constructing a measure of the average statutory tax rate of a commuting zone
(ignoring the subsidy scheme), for each of the post-reform years 2004-2006, based on the five
tax zones of residency of the workers employed in an establishment located in a commuting
zone in the pre-reform year (2003). Since we fix a commuting zone’s worker composition to

13
   Because of its large size, Oslo would receive a very large weight in the employment-weighted regional
regressions. In unweighted regional regressions, including Oslo in the sample has little impact on our estimates.
Estimates from employment-weighted and unweighted regressions are similar in magnitude once Oslo is excluded
from the sample.
14
   See Bhuller (2009) for a documentation of the construction of commuting zones.

                                                       11
the pre-reform year, the variation in our exposure measure is driven by changes in the statutory
payroll tax rates, and not by potentially endogenous changes in the worker composition of a
commuting zone.
       The predicted average statutory tax rate (hereby “statutory tax rate”) in commuting zone
c in year t, based on its 2003 worker composition, is given by:


                                     𝑁𝑟,2003
                            𝜏̂𝑐,𝑡 = ∑𝑖=1     𝜔𝑖,2003 × 𝜏𝑧(𝑖,2003),𝑡                           (6)


where 𝑁𝑐,2003 denotes the total number of workers employed in in the commuting zone in 2003,
and 𝜏𝑧(𝑖,2003),𝑡 denotes the statutory tax rate in year t of the tax zone of residency of worker i
in 2003. The time-varying, worker-specific payroll tax rate is weighted by worker i’s share in
                                                                            𝑁
the commuting zone’s total wage bill in 2003, i.e., 𝜔𝑖,2003 ≡ 𝑤𝑖,2003 / ∑𝑗 𝑐,2003 𝑤𝑗,2003 , where

𝑤𝑗,2003 denotes the wage of worker 𝑗 in 2003. We then construct a measure of the commuting
zone’s overall exposure to the tax harmonization policy (over 2004-2006) as follows:


                                    ∆𝜏̂ 𝑐 = 𝜏̂ 𝑐,2006 − 𝜏̂𝑐,2003 .


       The regional change in the statutory payroll tax rate, ∆𝜏̂ 𝑐 , varies between 0.03
percentage points (close to a zero change) in Vestfold, a commuting zone located in the south
of Norway, and 6.5 percentage points in Lofoten, a commuting zone located in the north of
Norway. Of the total variation in ∆𝜏̂𝑟 across 45 commuting zones, 84% is across, and 16%
within, tax zones.


4.2 Event Study
To visualize the evolution of outcomes (employment and wages) in local labor markets
experiencing a large (versus small) change in tax rates, we start our empirical analysis by
conducting an event study. In particular, we split the commuting zones in our sample into two
groups based on their overall exposure:


                                            1⁡⁡⁡⁡⁡𝑖𝑓⁡∆𝜏̂𝑐 ≥ 4⁡𝑝𝑝,
                               ⁡⁡⁡⁡𝑇𝑐 = {                                                     (7)
                                            0⁡⁡⁡⁡⁡𝑖𝑓⁡∆𝜏̂𝑐 < 4⁡𝑝𝑝.




                                                   12
We designate commuting zones with 𝑇𝑐 = 1 as “treated” (11 commuting zones) and those with
𝑇𝑐 = 0 as “controls” (34 commuting zones). The cut-off of four percentage points is arbitrary
and is chosen to ensure that the “treated” commuting zones experience a significant tax
increase. The key conclusions of our paper do not hinge on the specific cut-off chosen. We
compare employment and wages in “treated” and “control” commuting zones in the years prior
to and following the tax reform using 2003 as the reference year. The event study allows us to
assess whether the two types of commuting zones experienced similar time trends in
employment and wages prior to the 2003 reform, but diverge afterwards.15
        In a regression framework, our event study corresponds to estimating the following
difference-in-differences equation:


                          ln⁡(𝑦𝑐,𝑡 ) = 𝜆⁡𝑇𝑐 + 𝜌𝑡 × 𝑺𝑐 + ∑𝜅≠2003 𝛾𝜅 𝑇𝑐 × 𝐼(𝑡 = 𝜅)+𝑣𝑐,𝑡 ,                     (8)


where 𝑦𝑐,𝑡 is the outcome variable of interest (i.e., employment and wages) in commuting zone
c in year 𝑡; 𝑇𝑐 indicates the treatment status as defined in (7); 𝜌𝑡 denote year fixed effects; and
𝑺𝑐 is a vector of regional industry shares (the share of workers in the commuting zone in 2003
employed in 11 different industries).16 The coefficients 𝛾𝜅 show the dynamic effects of the
payroll tax increases on local outcomes. Instead of imposing common year effects across
regions, this specification allows the year fixed effects to differ by the commuting zone’s
industry structure (through the interaction between 𝜌𝑡 and 𝑺𝑐 ). In the absence of differential
pre-existing trends between treated and control commuting zones (unaccounted for by
differences in the commuting zone’s industry structure), the coefficients 𝛾𝜅 should be close to
zero for years prior to the tax reform (i.e., 𝜅 < 2003). For the post-reform years, the
coefficients 𝛾𝜅 reveal the dynamic impact of the payroll tax increase on regional outcomes.



4.3 Baseline Regression Equations

In our main analysis, we exploit the variation in the statutory tax rates over time and across
commuting zones more fully, and estimate the following regression:




15
   Like any spatial difference-in-difference designs, we cannot account for general equilibrium effects that may
arise from a variety of channels including trade between regions, costs of living, agglomeration, public good
provision, etc. For a full-fledged spatial equilibrium model, see Fajgelbaum et al. (2019).
16
   We use 11 industries defined based on establishment NACE codes. The 11 industries are listed in Table 1.

                                                      13
                           ln⁡(𝑦𝑐,𝑡 ) = 𝛽ln⁡(1 + 𝜏̂ 𝑐,𝑡 ) + 𝛿𝑐 + 𝜌𝑡 × 𝑺𝑐 + 𝜀𝑐,𝑡 ,                               (9)


where 𝜏̂𝑐,𝑡 is the (predicted) statutory tax rate based on the commuting zone’s worker
composition in 2003, as defined in equation (6); 𝛿𝑐 denotes commuting zone fixed effects; and
𝜀𝑐,𝑡 is an error term. As in equation (8), we include year fixed effects 𝜌𝑡 interacted with a vector
of regional initial industry shares 𝑺𝑐 .
         In regression equation (9), the parameter of interest, 𝛽, measures the impact of a one
percent increase in (1 + 𝜏̂ 𝑐,𝑡 )—which approximately corresponds to a one percentage point
increase in the statutory tax rate—on (log) wages and total employment in the commuting zone.
The theoretical counterpart to the estimates of 𝛽 for wages and employment are given by
equations (2) and (5) respectively, which are functions of the share of workers employed in
exempt firms, 𝜙, and the labor supply and labor demand elasticities, 𝜀 𝐷 and 𝜀 𝑆 . When
estimating regression equations (8) and (9), we weight by the number of employees in the
commuting zone in 2003, and cluster standard errors at the level of the commuting zone.


Large versus Small Firms Because of the subsidy scheme described in Section 2.1, the same
change in the statutory tax rate leads to differential changes in effective tax rates for large and
small firms that are located in the same commuting zone. Therefore, to shed light on their
differential adjustment behavior, we estimate equations (8) and (9) separately for the two types
of firms. We classify firms into large versus small based on whether or not their wage bill falls
above or below the cutoff point of 4.1 million NOK, as defined in Figure 2.17 To be precise,
as the same firm may have establishments in different commuting zones, we investigate
whether the payroll tax hike differentially affects employment in establishments that are part
of a large (above the subsidy cut-off) or small (below the subsidy cut-off) firm.



5 Data
Our analyses make use of several sources of administrative register data, provided by Statistics
Norway that can be linked through unique firm, establishment and worker identifiers. The main
data source is the linked employer-employee register that covers all employment spells for the
period 2000 to 2006. The data set includes information on the number of days a worker worked

17
   For firms that exist in the year prior to the reform (2003), we use the firm’s total wage bill in 2003. For firms
that do not exist in 2003 but existed in prior years, we use the firm’s total wage bill in the last year of existence.
If the firm enters only after the reform, we use the firm’s wage bill in the first year of entry.

                                                         14
during the year, her wage, the dates when she started and stopped working for a particular
establishment, the establishment and firm identification number, as well as the establishment’s
and firm’s location (municipality) and sector affiliation. We match these data to data on worker
demographics, including education, labor market experience, age, gender and country of origin.
We further make use of a longitudinal database with information on workers’ municipality of
residence. Finally, to study flows from regional private sector employment to other types of
employment such as self-employment not registered in the employer-employee register (in the
analysis in Section 6.4), we make use of data on earnings from the tax records.
       From the employer-employee register, we select all firms (and their workers) in the
private sector outside the commuting zone of Oslo. We exclude firms in the public sector as
they may not choose inputs to maximize profits. We drop workers with missing information
on the municipality of residence or the municipality of their establishment. Overall, our sample
includes 880,812 unique workers.
       Table 1 compares treated community zones that faced an increase in the statutory
payroll tax rate of at least 4 percentage points from 2003 to 2006, and control community zones
that experienced an increase of less than 4 percentage points. In 2003, the statutory payroll tax
rate was, on average, 6.0% in treated areas, and 11.6% in control areas. Treated community
zones experienced a 5.9 percentage point increase in the statutory tax rate on average, compared
to a 1 percentage point increase in control community zones, harmonizing the payroll tax rate
in treated and control areas. As expected, treated commuting zones employ fewer workers than
control community zones. Wages are slightly higher in control than in treated commuting
zones. The construction sector is overrepresented, whereas the finance sector is
underrepresented, in treated relative to control commuting zones.
       It should be noted that our empirical approach accounts for any time-constant
differences between treated and control areas through the inclusion of commuting zone fixed
effects. Moreover, we include regional (pre-reform) industry shares interacted with year
effects, thereby accounting for the possibility that commuting zones experience different time
trends because of differences in their industry structure. The event study provides further visual
evidence that the two types of commuting zones experienced similar trends in total employment
and wages prior to the 2003 tax reform, but start to diverge afterwards.

6 Results
6.1 Overall Regional Employment and Wage Effects of Payroll Tax Hikes

6.1.1 Event Study
In a first step, we simply plot the evolution of total regional employment (in logs) and average
regional wages (in logs) separately for treated and control commuting zones over the period
from 2000 to 2006, the years prior to and three years after the payroll tax hike (Figure 3). Panel
(a) highlights that total regional employment increased at a roughly similar pace in the two
types of commuting zones in the years prior to the reform. After the reform, regional
employment first declined at a higher rate, and then increased at a lower rate, in treated than in
control commuting zones, in line with the hypothesis that the payroll tax hike caused a decline
in regional employment. Turning to regional wages, panel (b) of Figure 3 shows that wages
grew by roughly 4% per year in both treated and commuting zones, both before and after the
tax reform, suggesting that the reform did not have a large impact on regional wages.


                                            [Figure 3]


       In Figure 4, we display the coefficients 𝛾𝜅 from the event study regression equation (8)
that trace out regional employment in treated commuting zones relative to control commuting
zones, and allow the year fixed effects to differ by the commuting zone’s industry structure. In
line with Figure 3, total regional employment evolved similarly in treated and control
commuting zones prior to the tax hike, but sharply declines in treated relative to control
commuting zones sharply thereafter—by about 6 percent three years after the tax hike (panel
(a)). Regional wages, in contrast, develop at a similar pace in treated and control commuting
zones not only prior to, but also after, the payroll tax hike (panel (b)).


                                            [Figure 4]


6.1.2 Regression Analyses
Baseline Estimates We next exploit the variation in the statutory tax rates over time and across
workers more fully, by estimating equation (9) for the commuting zone as a whole. We report
the estimated coefficients in Table 2 along with a number of robustness checks. The results
confirm the findings of a reduction in employment from the event study. A one percentage
point increase in the statutory tax rate reduces total regional employment by 1.37% (panel (a)).
                                                16
This estimate is of similar magnitude as that implied by the event study in Figure 4. According
to the figure, treated commuting zones experience a six percent decline in local employment
and a 4.9 percentage point increase in the statutory tax rate relative to control commuting zones,
implying a 1.22% (0.06/0.049) decline in employment for an increase in the statutory tax rate
of 1 percentage point. For wages, we find that a 1 percentage point increase in the statutory tax
rate leads to a decrease in the regional wages by 0.32% (albeit estimated with little statistical
precision). 18


                                                  [Table 2]


Robustness Checks The tax reform was implemented the same year as the 2004 expansion of
the EU, and we might therefore worry that the inflow of labor from Eastern Europe affected
treated and control commuting zones differently. To assess this, we restrict the sample to
Norwegian-born workers (panel (b) of Table 2). The results from this robustness exercise are
similar to the baseline results.
        Second, ESA allowed Norway to keep a zero tax rate in zone 5, the most remote and
sparsely populated region. Results are not sensitive to excluding commuting zones (partly)
located in tax zone 5 (panel (c) of Table 2).
        Third, our results so far compute the firm’s average statutory tax rate based on its 2003
workforce composition—before the tax change came into effect in 2004. Although the extent
and timing of the EU-induced tax changes were not laid out until March 2003, anticipatory
adjustments to the 2003 tax reform are possible, as firms knew as of September 2002 that some
changes would have to be made. Our results are robust to using 2001 workforce composition
of commuting zones to calculate average regional statutory tax rates (panel (d) of Table 2).



6.2 Differential Adjustments by Large versus Small Firms
So far, we have examined the effect of changes in the statutory tax rate on the employment and
wage levels in the region overall. Next, we examine possibly differential effects of the statutory
tax hikes on establishments that are part of a large (subject to tax hikes) or small (exempt from
tax hikes due to subsidy) firm. For simplicity, we refer to the two types of establishments as


18
   We present the reduced-form estimates throughout, using the predicted regional statutory tax rate (calculated
based on 2003 worker composition) as the main regressor. When we use the actual regional statutory tax rate
(based on contemporary worker composition) as the main regressor and instrument it by the predicted regional
statutory tax rate, the IV estimates are very close to the reduced-form estimates. See Appendix Table A.2.

                                                      17
large and small establishments (even though the classification large versus small was done at
the level of the firm).
        In Figure 5, we present an event study based on regression equation (8), separately for
the two types of establishments in the commuting zone. The figure shows that the decline in
employment in treated relative to control commuting zones after the tax hike is much more
pronounced in large establishments subject to the payroll tax increase (panel (a)) than in small
exempt establishments (panel (b)). The differential employment responses in small and large
establishments provide reassurance that the drop in total regional employment is indeed caused
by the tax reform, and not by differential macroeconomic conditions in remote and central
regions. The figure further shows that wages evolved similarly in treated and control regions
in both large and small establishments (panels (c) and (d))—as we would expect if a single
market wage applies to all establishments in the commuting zone.


                                          [Figure 5]


        Table 3 presents employment and wage effects (estimates based on equation (9))
separately for large and small establishments. An increase in the statutory tax rate by one
percentage point reduces regional employment in large establishments by 1.28% (panel (a)).
The regional employment effect in small establishments is imprecisely estimated but indicates
a lower reduction of -0.56%.
        While the theoretical framework presented in Section 3 predicts a non-negative
employment effect among small, exempt establishments, there are two main explanations for
why we might find a negative effect. First, since we classify firms and establishments as large
versus small status based on their pre-reform wage bill, some establishments classified as small
might in practice become large in subsequent years and hence are subject to the payroll tax
increase. In fact, 20% of the establishments classified as small become large in the sense that
their wage bill (or the wage bill of the firm that they belong to) exceeds the cut-off of 4.1
million NOK at some point during the years 2004-2006. Second, the negative employment
effect in small establishments may be due to agglomeration spillover effects, whereby the
reduced economic activity in the commuting zone lowers the productivity of local
establishments (e.g., Ciccone and Hall, 1996; Greenstone et al., 2010), or local multiplier
effects whereby the reduced economic activity in the commuting zone lessens the demand for
local services (e.g., Moretti 2010).

6.3 Heterogeneity Analysis
Our theoretical framework in Section 3 highlights that the employment reduction in large
establishments is increasing in the labor demand elasticity (equation (4)), which in turn is
higher in labor-intensive (high 𝛼) than in capital-intensive firms (equation (1)). In Table 4, we
show results that are in line with this prediction. The table shows estimates of β in regression
equation (9) among establishments that are part of a large firm, separately for labor-intensive
(column (1)) and non-labor-intensive (column (2)) establishments.19 The results show that the
drop is considerably larger in labor-intensive than in non-labor-intensive establishments, in line
with the theoretical framework.


                                                  [Table 4]


        Further, we examine effect heterogeneity by firm size while continuing to focus on the
sample of establishments that are part of large (above the subsidy cut-off) firms. This split is
motivated by the fact that larger firms further away from the subsidy cut-off will experience a
larger increase in their total labor costs (for their stock of incumbent workers) than smaller
firms close to the subsidy cut-off, while the marginal cost of hiring a new worker increases in
the same way for all firms. To explore this idea, we split establishments (that are part of large
firms and hence subject to the tax increases) into three groups. The first group accounts for
25% of the workers in the sample, namely those employed in the smallest firms closest to the
subsidy cut-off. The second group accounts for 50% of the workers in the sample, namely those
employed in medium-sized large firms. The third group accounts for 25% of the workers in the
sample, namely those employed in the largest firms furthest away from the subsidy cut-off.
Comparing columns (3) and (4), we find that a payroll tax hike leads to a stronger employment
decline in establishments that are part of a medium-sized large firm further away from the
subsidy cut-off than in establishments that are part of a smaller large firm close to the subsidy
cut-off. In establishments that belong to the largest firms (column (5)), employment does not

   We use the definition of labor intensive sectors from a governmental report (St.mld. nr. 41, 1998). The labor
intensive sectors are: Manufacture of food and fish products; manufacture of wood and wood products; graphic
production; manufacture of ceramic products; manufacture of basic metal and fabricated metal products;
manufacture of machinery and equipment; manufacture of electrical and optical equipment; transport; other
industry production; wholesale; construction; hotels and restaurants and business activities.

decrease in response to a payroll tax increase, although the employment response is imprecisely
estimated. These very large firms may have sufficient means to cushion the labor cost shock
(e.g., by increasing product prices or through lower profits).



6.4 Mechanisms of Regional Employment Adjustment

In this section, we shed some light on the various margins of adjustments that can explain the
regional employment drop. In Panel (a) of Figure 6, we decompose the overall decline in
regional employment in treated relative to control commuting zones three years after the tax
reform into reductions in regional employment that are due to reduced inflow into employment
and increased outflows out of employment:

               Total⁡change⁡in⁡employment                   inflows               outflows



Inflows are composed of workers who enter into regional private sector employment from other
regions, from unemployment, from non-employment, or from the public sector or self-
employment. Outflows consist of workers who leave regional private sector employment and
move to other regions, or who transition into the public sector or self-employment,
unemployment or non-labor force participation within the region. We estimate regression
equation (8) using total employment as well as inflows and outflows as dependent variables.
Panel (a) of Figure 6 shows that the drop in regional employment following a tax hike is entirely
accounted for by an increase in outflows from the commuting zones (the grey bar); inflows to
the commuting zone in fact increases slightly after the tax hike (the mint-green bar).
       In panel (b) of the figure, we decompose the overall employment drop in the commuting
zone in response to the payroll tax increase into jobs lost due to increased establishment exit,
reduced establishment entry and employment adjustments at the intensive margin, within
continuing establishments:

Establishment exit between year 2003 and 2006 is defined as the establishment identification
number existing in 2003, but not in 2006. Establishment entry is defined as the establishment
identification number existing in 2006, but not in 2003. The findings in panel (b) of Figure 6
show that increased establishment exit (the brown bar) is an important margin of adjustment,
accounting for a bit more than a third of the overall employment decline in the region, while
establishment entry has a negligible impact on employment. Employment adjustments within
continuing establishments (the orange bar) make up a bit less than two thirds of the overall
employment drop in the commuting zone following the payroll tax hike.
         Finally, the findings in panel (c) of Figure 6 shed light on whether the employment drop
in treated relative to control commuting zones in response to the payroll tax increase represents
a reallocation of workers across commuting zones, an increase in un- or non-employment
within the commuting zone, or an increase in other types of employment (public sector
employment or self-employment) within the commuting zone.20

sole-proprietorship and public sector work. An individual is defined as being in this category if the sum of wage

the low regional mobility in Norway—only 7.5% of workers in our sample are employed in a
different commuting zone in 2006 from that in 2003. The other three components are of roughly
equal importance. Around 30% of the overall regional employment drop is accounted for by
moves into and out of unemployment (the pink bar), while movements into and out of non-
employment make up 35 % of the overall regional employment drop (the darker blue bar).
About 28% of the overall regional employment drop is due to transitions into other types of
employment within the region (the light blue bar).

6.5 Discussion
What do our findings imply for the pass-through of payroll taxes on wages? While the wage
response to the payroll tax hike is imprecisely estimated, our baseline estimate implies a 0.32%
decline in wages in response to a 1 percentage point increase in the payroll tax rate (Panel (A)
of Table 2). Since not all firms are subject to the payroll tax increase, full wage shifting (which
occurs either if labor supply is completely inelastic or labor demand is infinitely elastic) in our
context implies a wage response of -0.7, equal to the employment share 𝜙 in firms subject to
the tax increase (see equation (2)). Benchmarked against this number, our estimate of -0.320
implies that we can reject the null hypothesis of a full passthrough (i.e., 𝛽 ≥ −0.7) at the
conventional level of statistical significance.21 Instead, our estimated wage response indicates
a pass-through rate of 0.46% (0.32/0.7), a rate that is comparable to that found in Holmlund
(1983) and Johansen and Klette (1997) for earlier periods in Sweden and Norway. In contrast,
Gruber (1997) and Anderson and Mayer (1997) find evidence for full pass-through in the
context of Chile and the US where the degree of unionization is low and wages may thus be
more downward flexible.22
        We can also use our estimated wage and employment responses to the payroll tax hike,
in combination with the theoretical framework, to back out the labor supply and labor demand
elasticities. When viewed through the lens of the perfectly competitive model outlined in
Section 3.1 (equations (2) and (5)), our baseline estimates of -0.32% for the wage response and

22
    As of 2000, 13.2% and 12.9% of workers are unionized in Chile and the US, respectively
(https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=TUD). The corresponding figure for Norway and Sweden are
54.1% and 80.1%, respectively.

                                                  22
-1.37% for the employment response (Panel (A) of Table 2), together with 𝜙 = 0.7⁡ imply a
labor supply elasticity of ε𝑆 = 4.28 and a labor demand elasticity of ε𝐷 = −3.60.
         The implied labor supply elasticity is considerably larger than that found in studies that
focus on the combination of intensive (hours worked) and extensive (employment) margins,
and that generally find elasticities well below 1 (see Blundell and Macurdy 1999; Chetty et al.
2011; Chetty 2012). Our context is different, however, since the labor supply elasticity
measures the (percentage) decline in private sector employment in the commuting zone in
response to a 1% decline in the local wage, and hence also captures movements across
commuting zones, as well as movements to and from the private sector to other forms of
employment (i.e., public sector employment and self-employment) within the commuting zone.
Whereas the former account, due to the low regional mobility in Norway, only for a small part
of the overall regional employment response, the latter explain 28% of the overall regional
wage response (Figure 6). One possible interpretation of the large estimate for the labor supply
elasticity therefore is that labor is highly elastic between the private sector employment and
other forms of employment within the same region.23
         An alternative and in our view more likely explanation for the large implied (by the
fully competitive model) elasticity of labor supply, given that two thirds of the overall regional
employment decline is accounted for by movements from and into un- and non-employment,
is that the high degree of centralized bargaining and unionization in Norway prevent large
downward wage adjustments to payroll tax hikes.24 The lower pass-through rate compared to
that found in countries with a lower degree of unionization is in line with this explanation.
         Our estimate for the labor demand elasticity of -3.6 falls in the upper range of estimates
reported in the literature (see Lichter et al. 2015 for a meta study). One possible explanation
for such a large labor demand elasticity is that capital is fixed over the three-year study period.
According to equation (1), assuming that capital is fully fixed (𝜇 = 0) and a labor share of two
thirds (𝛼 = 2/3), the Cobb-Douglas production function implies a labor demand elasticity of
     1
− 1−𝛼 = −3, which is close to our estimate of -3.6.

         An alternative explanation for the high labor demand elasticity is based on liquidity
constraints, as recently put forward by Saez et al. (2019) (see also Melcangi 2018). The idea
here is that liquidity-constrained firms faced with an unexpected windfall loss (in our context



23
   This argument rests on the assumption that wages in the public and self-employed sector did not decline by as
much as wages in the private sector in response to the payroll tax hike.
24
   In this case, it is not possible to obtain an estimate for the labor supply elasticity.

                                                      23
caused by a payroll tax hike) may be forced to bring down labor costs quickly to lessen the
magnitude of the windfall loss, and thus reduce employment (by more than what is implied by
the competitive model). Our findings in Table 4 are in principle consistent with this
interpretation. The findings in Table 4 show that employment declines less in firms close to the
subsidy cut-off than in larger (but not extremely large) firms further away from the subsidy
cut-off. Both types of firms experience an increase in the marginal cost of hiring a new worker.
Larger firms, however, suffer a larger windfall loss, as labor costs increased not only for newly
hired workers, but also for their existing workforce.
        The large decline in local employment in response to the payroll tax hike (and hence
the large inferred labor demand elasticity) could also be a consequence of agglomeration
spillover (e.g., Ciccone and Hall 1996; Greenstone et al. 2010) and local multiplier effects
effects (e.g., Moretti 2010).25 According to this explanation, a reduction in labor demand in
some firms create a domino effect in the local labor market, triggering additional employment
reductions in other firms, either through a decline in firm productivity or through a decline in
the demand for local services in the region. Our finding of a negative (though imprecisely
estimated) employment effect in small firms that are exempt from the payroll tax hike is in line
with this explanation.



7 Conclusion
In this paper, we investigate whether place-based payroll tax incentives are effective in
boosting employment in low tax areas, focusing on the case of Norway. We exploit a unique
policy setting in Norway, where a system of geographically differentiated payroll taxes was
suddenly abolished. In particular, we take advantage of an EU regulation that required Norway
to harmonize its payroll tax rates across regions between 2004 and 2006, which was then
adopted and implemented independently of the local labor market developments, thereby
creating exogenous variation in the payroll tax rates across regions over time.
        We find that a one percentage point increase in the payroll rate tax leads to a decline in
wages in the local labor market of 0.32%, though this effect is imprecisely estimated. Taking
into account that only large firms—which employ about 70% of workers in the local labor
market—are subject to the payroll tax increase in our setting, this wage response implies a
pass-through rate of 0.46%. While comparable to that found by Holmlund (1983) and Johansen

25
  The simple model in Section 3 ignores agglomeration and local multiplier effects, and attributes the local
employment response to the payroll tax hike, given the wage response, entirely to the labor demand elasticity.

                                                     24
and Klette (1997) in Sweden and Norway, this pass-through rate of 0.46 is lower than what
Gruber (1997) and Anderson and Meyer (1997) find in the context of Chile and the US (i.e.,
there, firms are able to fully shift the burden of payroll tax increases onto workers’ wages). The
lower pass-through rates in the context of Norway and Sweden may be due to much higher
degrees of unionization and collective wage bargaining than in the US and Chile, which may
make it difficult for firms to fully cut wages in response to the local payroll tax increases.
       We further find that a one percentage point increase in the payroll tax rate leads to a
decline in local employment by 1.37%. This drop in local employment is largely accounted for
by workers transitioning from employment to un- or non-employment, rather than by workers
moving to another region. When viewed through the lens of a competitive model (and taking
into account the fact that only large firms are subject to the payroll tax hike in our context), our
wage and employment response imply a labor demand elasticity of -3.60. This estimate falls in
the upper range of estimates reported in the literature (see Lichter et al. 2015). One possible
explanation for the high labor demand elasticity is that capital does not adjust over our three-
year study period. Alternatively, the high labor demand elasticity could be a consequence of
liquidity constraints that worsen when firms are faced with an adverse tax hike. Agglomeration
and local multiplier effects provide a yet another explanation for the strong employment decline
in response to payroll tax hikes (and hence the inferred labor demand elasticity).
       Overall, our findings indicate that place-based payroll tax incentives can be effective at
stimulating employment in remote regions in Norway. Our findings further suggest that the
employment response to place-based payroll tax incentives depends on the institutional context
and will generally be higher when firms are unable to fully shift the burden of payroll tax
increases onto workers’ wages because of downward wage rigidities.

Notes: The table reports baseline estimates, and various robustness checks, for the effects on a one percentage
point increase in the predicted statutory payroll tax on the number of workers (in logs) and the daily wage rate (in
logs) in the commuting zone. Panel (A) shows the baseline results for all workers in establishments in the
commuting zone; panel (B) shows results restricting the sample to Norwegian-born workers (excluding 10% of
the observations); panel (C) shows results when excluding workers in establishments located in the most remote
tax zone 5 that was unaffected by the payroll tax reform (excluding 2.2% of the observations); and panel (D)
shows results when the commuting zone worker composition in 2001 (rather than 2003) is used to construct the
average statutory payroll tax rate in the commuting zone. All results are obtained from regressions at the level of
the commuting zone of the outcome variables on log(1+statutory tax rate), where the average statutory tax rate in
the commuting zone is defined in equation (6). Regressions additionally include controls for year and commuting
zone fixed effects, as well as commuting zone sector shares in 2003 interacted with year dummy variables (as in
equation (9)). The regressions in panels (A)-(C) are weighted by the number of workers in the commuting zone in
2003, and the regressions in panel (D) are weighted by the number of workers in the commuting zone in 2001.
Standard errors are clustered at the level of the commuting zone. There are 45 commuting zones (labor market
regions), of which 11 are statutory treated and 34 are statutory control regions.

We split establishments into two groups based on the labor intensity of the sector they operate in. We divide
establishments into three groups based on the size of the firm they belong to. The first group accounts for 25% of the
workers in the sample, namely those employed in the smallest firms closest to the subsidy cut-off. The second group
accounts for 50% of the workers in the sample, namely those employed in medium-sized large firms. The third group
accounts for 25% of the workers in the sample, namely those employed in the largest firms furthest away from the subsidy
cut-off. Regressions are weighted by the number of workers in the commuting zone in 2003. Standard errors are clustered
at the level of the commuting zone. There are 45 commuting zones (labor market regions), of which 11 are statutory
treated and 34 are statutory control regions.

         FIGURE 1: Statutory Payroll Tax Rates by Tax Zones (Zones 1 to 5)




Notes: The table provides an overview of the changes in the statutory payroll tax rates (by
tax zone) in Norway imposed by the EFTA Surveillance Authority (ESA). In zones 1 and 5,
the tax rates remained unchanged at 14.1% and 0%, respectively. In zone 2, the payroll tax
rate increased from 10.6% in 2003 to 14.1% in 2004, and in zones 3 and 4, the tax rates
increased by 5.7 and 6.6 percentage points from 2003 to 2006 (see also Table A1 in the
Appendix). In 2007 the geographically differentiated system was re-introduced, after an
appeal by Norway on ESA’s ruling.

        FIGURE 2: Increase in Average Effective Tax Rate from 2003 to 2006 over Firm Size




Notes: The figure plots the expected effective tax increase from 2003 to 2006 against firms’ 2003 wage bills,
based on the tax schedule shown in Appendix Table A.1. The figure illustrates, for each tax zone separately,
the effective tax increases that firms will experience assuming that each firm recruits all its workers from its
own tax zone. Firms with an annual wage bill of less than 4.1 million NOK (580,000 USD) in 2003 were not
affected by the tax increase (assuming their work force remained unchanged) regarding of tax zone from
which the firm would recruit its workers. The effective tax rate converges towards the statutory tax rate as
the firm wage bill increases (and the subsidy becomes negligible).

Notes: Panel (a) decomposes the overall reduction in employment in the commuting zone from 2003 to
2006 in treated relative to control commuting zones, caused by the payroll tax increase, into changes in
inflow into regional employment and outflow from regional employment. Panel (b) decomposes the
employment reduction into establishment entry and exit, and employment changes in continuing firms.
Panel (c) decomposes the employment reduction into the following components: (1) movements to and
from private sector employment and into another type of employment in the region, (2) movements to
and from regional unemployment (receipt of unemployment benefits), (3) movements to and from the
labor force in the same region, (4) movements to and from the region. The decomposed employment
reduction shares are obtained from estimating equation (8) using Et/E2003 as well as the various
outcome variables described above, scaled by employment in the commuting zone in 2003, as the
dependent variable. Reported estimates refer to the year 2006. Regressions are weighted by the number
of workers in the commuting zone in 2003. There are 45 commuting zones (labor market regions), of
which 11 are statutory treated and 34 are statutory control regions.

Appendix A
Given the statutory payroll tax rate 𝜏, wage 𝑤 and rental rate of capital 𝑟, firms choose labor 𝐿
and flexible capital 𝐾 to maximize profits:

                                ̅ (1−α)(1−µ) K (1−α)µ − 𝑤(1 + 𝜏)𝐿 − 𝑟𝐾
                        max AL𝛼 K
                        𝐿, 𝐾


The first order conditions with respect to labor and capital inputs are such that:

                        ̅ (1−α)(1−µ) K (1−α)µ 𝐿𝛼−1 = 𝑤(1 + 𝜏),
                      𝛼𝐴K                                            (𝐴. 1)

                              ̅ (1−α)(1−µ) K {(1−α)µ−1} 𝐿𝛼 = 𝑟.
                     (1 − 𝛼)𝜇𝐴K                                         (𝐴. 2)

Dividing either side of (A.1) by that of (A.2) and rearranging, we obtain

                                   𝑤(1 + 𝜏) (1 − 𝛼)𝜇
                            𝐾={                      } 𝐿.      (𝐴. 3)
                                      𝑟         𝛼


Plugging (A.3) into (A.1) and taking logarithm, we obtain

                                   1 − (1 − 𝛼)𝜇
                  log(𝐿) = 𝐶 −                   {log(𝑤(1 + 𝜏))}           (𝐴. 4),
                                  (1 − 𝛼)(1 − 𝜇)

where

              1
 𝐶=                    × [{1 − (1 − 𝛼)𝜇} log(𝛼) + (1 − 𝛼)𝜇 log(1 − 𝛼) + (1 − 𝛼)𝜇 log(𝜇)
        (1 − 𝛼)(1 − 𝜇)
                 + log(𝐴) + (1 − 𝛼)(1 − 𝜇) log(𝐾̅ ) − (1 − 𝛼)𝜇 log(𝑟)] .


Totally differentiate (A.4) this expression to get

                     𝑑 log 𝐿 = ε𝐷 {𝑑 log(𝑤) + 𝑑 log(1 + 𝜏)},            (𝐴. 5)

where

                                               1 − (1 − α)µ
                                    ε𝐷 = −
                                             (1 − α)(1 − µ)

is the labor demand elasticity.

The reform implies 𝑑 log(1 + 𝜏) > 0 for large firms (subject to the payroll tax increase) and
𝑑 log(1 + 𝜏) = 0 for small firms (exempt from the payroll tax increase due to the subsidy).

Denote the quantity of labor employed by large (A) and small (U) firms by 𝐿𝐴 and 𝐿𝑈 ,
respectively. From (A.5),


                                               39
                      𝑑 log 𝐿𝐴 = ε𝐷 {𝑑 log 𝑤 +𝑑 log(1 + 𝜏)}         (A.6)
and

                              𝑑 log 𝐿𝑈 = ε𝐷 𝑑 log 𝑤        (A.7)

Dividing by dlog(1 + 𝜏), we obtain expressions (3) and (4) in the main text.


Denote the quantity of labor supplied in the local economy by 𝐿𝑆 . In a fully competitive
equilibrium with downward flexible wages, the wage rate 𝑤 adjusts to clear the labor market:

                                   𝐿𝑆 = 𝐿𝐴 + 𝐿𝑈 .     (𝐴. 8)

Let 𝜙(≤ 1) denote the share of workers employed in large firms (i.e., 𝜙 = 𝐿𝐴 /(𝐿𝐴 + 𝐿𝑈 )).
Totally differentiating (A.8) and using the definition of 𝜙, we obtain

                    𝑑 log 𝐿𝑆 = 𝜙 𝑑 log 𝐿𝐴 + (1 − 𝜙) 𝑑 log 𝐿𝑈 .       (𝐴. 9)

Let ε𝑆 denote the labor supply elasticity such that

                                         𝑆
                                            𝑑 log 𝐿𝑆
                                        ε =          .
                                            𝑑 log(𝑤)

Then, using expressions (A.6) and (A.7) for 𝑑 log 𝐿𝐴 and 𝑑 log 𝐿𝑈 , (A.9) can be stated as

            ε𝑆 𝑑 log(𝑤) = 𝜙 ε𝐷 {𝑑 log(𝑤) + 𝑑 log(1 + 𝜏)} + (1 − 𝜙)ε𝐷 𝑑 log(𝑤).

Re-arranging this expression, we obtain expression (4) in the main text:

                                     𝑑 log(𝑤)     𝜙ε𝐷
                                               = 𝑆     ,
                                   𝑑 log(1 + 𝜏) ε − ε𝐷

which shows the pass-through rate of payroll tax hikes on to wages when 𝜙 share of workers
in the local labor market are employed in large firms subject to the tax increase (whereas 1 −
𝜙 share of workers are in exempt firms).

First stage estimates are reported in column 1. IV estimates are presented in columns 2 and 3. All results are
obtained from regressions at the level of the commuting zone of the outcome variables on log(1+statutory tax
rate). Regressions additionally include controls for year and commuting zone fixed effects, as well as
commuting zone sector shares in 2003 interacted with year dummy variables (as in equation (9)). The
regressions are weighted by the number of workers in the commuting zone in 2003. Standard errors are
clustered at the level of the commuting zone. There are 45 commuting zones (labor market regions), of which
11 are statutory treated and 34 are statutory control regions.
