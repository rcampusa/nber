                                           ABSTRACT

       Were high import tariffs somehow related to the strong U.S. economic growth during the late
nineteenth century? This paper examines this frequently mentioned but controversial question and
investigates the channels by which tariffs could have promoted growth during this period. The paper
shows that: (i) late nineteenth century growth hinged more on population expansion and capital
accumulation than on productivity growth; (ii) tariffs may have discouraged capital accumulation
by raising the price of imported capital goods; (iii) productivity growth was most rapid in non-traded
sectors (such as utilities and services) whose performance was not directly related to the tariff.

       In the late nineteenth century, the United States experienced rapid economic growth and

emerged as a world industrial power. During this period, the United States also maintained high

import tariffs that kept out foreign manufactured goods. That the high tariffs were accompanied

by rapid growth and industrialization was noted by contemporary proponents of protectionism

and has been a source of controversy ever since.

       Few observers have argued outright that the high tariffs caused such growth. Yet the

association between high tariffs and rapid output growth is frequently noted in such a way as to

leave the distinct impression that such causation is highly likely, or at least that the nineteenth

century experience demonstrates that protectionism was not a bad economic policy. This

interpretation has received increasing popular expression in recent years, partly in an effort to

enlist history on the side of those advocating the adoption of protectionist trade policies today,

such as Pat Buchanan. This line of reasoning about America’s past is also frequently invoked

among those sympathetic to “economic nationalist” policies, such as journalists James Fallows

and Michael Lind.

       That there is a correlation between high tariffs and economic growth in the late nineteenth

century cannot be denied.1 But correlation is not causation. There is no reason for necessarily

thinking that import protection was a good policy just because the economic outcome was good:

the outcome could have been driven by factors completely unrelated to the tariff, or perhaps

could have been even better in the absence of protection. To understand the relationship between

       1
         Indeed, O’Rourke (2000) finds the correlation to be robust in cross-country growth
regressions, even after controlling for additional factors such as initial income, the savings rate,
and country fixed-effects.
                                                 -2-

tariffs and growth, therefore, requires investigating the possible mechanisms by which the tariff

could have generated such benefits and assessing whether such benefits were likely to have

materialized and have been of economic importance.

       This paper examines the proposition that high tariffs helped promote U.S. economic

growth in the late nineteenth century. The paper first considers the views of those who suggest

that the tariffs were beneficial and sets out some simple facts regarding economic growth during

this period. Those having a favorable impression of the tariff’s contribution have tended to

present statistics that overstate late nineteenth century U.S. growth in comparison to other

periods and countries. The data presented here indicate that growth then was driven largely by

labor force expansion and capital accumulation, while productivity growth was undistinguished

when put in a comparative perspective. The paper then examines various channels by which high

tariffs could have stimulated capital accumulation and productivity growth. It is difficult to

attribute much of a positive role for the tariff because import tariffs may have raised the price of

imported capital goods, thereby discouraging capital accumulation, and productivity growth in

nontraded sectors, rather than in manufacturing, was the driving force behind the United States’s

overtaking of the United Kingdom in per capita GDP during this period. The paper concludes

that trade protection was probably not a key factor behind U.S. economic growth in the late

nineteenth century.



Recent Interpretations of Late Nineteenth Century Trade and Growth

       In recent years, several authors have drawn attention to the relationship between import

tariffs and U.S. economic growth in the late nineteenth century, while stopping short of
                                                 -3-

concluding that tariffs were responsible for that growth. Economic historian Paul Bairoch (1993,

pp. 52-53) took himself as iconoclastic for stating that “the best 20 years of American economic

growth [1870 to 1890] took place in a period when its trade policy was protectionist.” He

interpreted this fact as indicating that protectionism did not have a negative impact for the United

States, although he cautions that “the success of the United States was not due entirely to its tariff

policy.”2 Historian Alfred Eckes (1995, pp. 50, 56) presents a battery of statistics all of which

lean toward illustrating how the late nineteenth century period of high tariffs was accompanied

by strong economic performance. Although he does not contend that tariffs were responsible for

the economic boom, he writes that “home market protection is not necessarily inconsistent with

high domestic and export growth” and that “protectionism apparently did not significantly harm

U.S. economic growth or retard export expansion.” Economist Ravi Batra (1993, p. 132) also

refers to this period in arguing that “the period in which American had its highest tariff rates, and

the smallest involvement with international trade, was also the one in which the country had its

greatest economic success.”

       Other popular writers have given prominence to this interpretation. Patrick Buchanan

(1998, p. 224) contends that “Behind a tariff wall . . . the United States had gone from an

agrarian coastal republic to become the greatest industrial power the world has ever seen – in a

single century. Such was the success of the policy called protectionism that is so disparaged

today.” Journalists Michael Lind and James Fallows have expressed similar views. According


       2
         In his chapter for the Cambridge Economic History of Europe, Bairoch interrupts his
discussion of U.S. trade policy during this period to mention the rapid concurrent economic
growth. “Without linking the two things,” Bairoch (1989, p. 142) wrote, “it is important to note”
that growth was strong during this period of high tariffs. Yet one wonders why this was worth
mentioning unless Bairoch indeed believed that they were linked in some way.
                                                  -4-

to Lind (1994, p. 22), “during the era of greatest free trade in continental Europe, 1873-1890 (a

peak not reached again until the 1960s), Europe was plunged into a depression as devastating as

that of the 1930s – partly, it seems, because of free trade . . . During this time, the United States,

with its tariffs at historic highs, enjoyed one of its greatest bursts of sustained growth.” James

Fallows (1993, pp. 193-94) states that free trade theories “fail a test of history . . . . They do not

explain how the industrial old guard – first England, then America – rose to power. Indeed those

countries developed fastest when they paid least attention to today’s . . . [orthodox free-trade]

principles of economic growth.”

        To some extent, an agenda lies behind these interpretations of the past. Batra and

Buchanan advocate a return to higher tariffs today. Lind (1995, pp. 322ff) calls for imposing a

“social tariff” in the amount of the difference between domestic and foreign wages. Fallows and

Eckes do not set forth explicit policy views, but Fallows writes sympathetically about activist

government policies that he believes have been pursued by Asian countries, while Eckes is

concerned about the adverse impact of import competition on American industry. Cutting across

this spectrum is the belief that the link between high tariffs and rapid growth in the late

nineteenth century holds important lessons for today.



Nineteenth Century Growth in Comparative Context

        The relationship between tariffs and economic growth during the late nineteenth century

is quite intriguing and clearly deserves closer scrutiny. What are some of the basic facts about

U.S. growth during this period?

        To say that the United States economy grew rapidly during the late nineteenth century is
                                                 -5-

to make a comparative statement – compared to other countries during the same period, or to the

U.S. economy during a different period, the economy performed well. Those attempting to

demonstrate that protection was not bad (and possibly beneficial) have made both comparisons,

one point of reference being the “free trade” United Kingdom of the late nineteenth century, then

the leading industrial nation, and the other the “free trade” United States of the late twentieth

century.

        Did protectionist America outperform free trade Britain in terms of long-run economic

growth in the late nineteenth century? Table 1 presents a simple comparison of the economic

growth performance of the U.S. and U.K. economies during the period 1870 to 1913, using data

conveniently available in Maddison (1995).3 Over this 43 year period, real GDP grew much

more rapidly in the United States than in the United Kingdom: nearly 4 percent per year in the

United States versus nearly 2 percent in the United Kingdom, according to Maddison’s figures.

Bairoch (1993, p. 50) states that these are “facts that constitute real paradoxes for the supporters

of free trade.”

        Yet these figures can be dissected to reveal the underlying sources of growth. The

impressive U.S. economic expansion was partly due to a rapid increase in population. Even after

accounting for this fact, however, per capita GDP grew more rapidly in the United States, at

about 1.8 percent per year compared with 1.0 percent in the United Kingdom. The more rapid



        3
          Consideration of a long period, such as 1870 to 1913, is necessary to avoid confusing
short-term business cycle fluctuations with long-run growth trends. This choice of years is
dictated by the following: 1870 is roughly when the best estimates of U.S. GDP begin, and 1913
is the year before the outbreak of World War I. During this period, U.S. import tariffs were high
and stable and U.K. import tariffs were low and stable. The period from 1913 to 1950 is
generally set aside due to the shocks of two world wars and the great depression.
                                                -6-

per capita income growth in the United States was, in turn, fueled by rapidly growing capital

accumulation. The pace of capital accumulation in the United States exceeded that in the United

Kingdom by a factor of more than 3 during this period. After accounting for capital

accumulation, the total factor productivity “residual” appears, somewhat surprisingly, to have

been roughly comparable in the two economies. In other words, the rate of productivity growth,

measuring the change in the efficiency with which economy is using its resources, was about the

same in the two economies.

       The conclusion that one draws from this growth-accounting exercise is similar to that of

Krugman’s (1994) discussion of the East Asian miracle. Extensive growth was due to the

mobilization of resources – using greater amounts of labor and capital – to increase production.

Growth in per capita income was more the result of capital deepening, arising from high rates of

saving and investment in which current consumption was sacrificed for future production, than

achieving greater productive efficiency. In the end, productivity growth in the “protectionist”

United States was roughly the same as that in the “free trade” United Kingdom.

       What about comparing the late nineteenth century “protectionist” United States with the

late twentieth century “free trade” United States? Table 2 compares the 43 years after 1870 with

the 42 years after 1950. Real per capita income grew slightly more rapidly in the post-World

War II period, but the biggest difference between the periods is the source of growth —

productivity rather than capital accumulation. The key factor in postwar economic growth has

been achieving greater economic efficiency with existing resources rather than increasing the

quantities of those resources.

       Contrary to the presumption of those cited earlier, therefore, a simple analysis of the data
                                                 -7-

does not give the impression that late nineteenth century U.S. economic performance was

extraordinary in comparison to the late nineteenth century United Kingdom or the late twentieth

century United States. Late nineteenth century U.S. growth was largely due to the rapid growth

of the labor force and the accumulation of capital, with productivity growth similar to that in the

United Kingdom. Late twentieth century economic growth, judging from the increase in per

capita income and in total factor productivity, appears to have been superior to that in the late

nineteenth century.

       Those seeking to leave a different impression have bolstered their case by choosing to

compare selected sub-sample periods. In the post-war era, for example, productivity growth

slowed considerably after 1973. One can give an unfavorable impression of the “free trade” era

by setting the post-1973 period against the late nineteenth century. For instance, Eckes (1995, p.

53) compares the growth of U.S. GNP and per capita GNP between 1972 and 1992 (“the interval

of relatively free trade”) and 1890 and 1910 (“the protectionist period”). The selection of these

dates stacks the deck against the free trade period. The twenty years after 1890 was a period of

strong growth, yet the period 1870 and 1890 – also part of the high tariff period but not included

in Eckes’s sample – saw slower economic growth. The economically-disappointing twenty years

after 1972 are included in his sample, yet the low tariff, rapid growth period of 1950 and 1972

was not included. Batra (1993, p. 148) similarly argues that the 1950 and 1972 period should not

be considered part of the “free trade” period because the United States, in his view, was a

“closed” economy prior to 1973 but an “open” economy thereafter. Apparently some arbitrary

threshold in the trade to GDP ratio was crossed in that particular year and, as he puts it, “the U.S.
                                                -8-

economic debacle began in 1973, the first year of America’s transition into free trade.”4

       But to judge the matter in terms of actual trade policy, the entire post-war period belongs

to the “free trade” period because the U.S. move to more open trade policies can be dated from

around World War II. Average U.S. tariffs fell sharply from over 50 percent in the early 1930s to

just above 10 percent by the early 1950s, then falling gradually to about 5 percent today. The

United States led the formation of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (the precursor to

the current World Trade Organization) in 1947 to negotiate the reduction of tariff and non-tariff

barriers to world trade. To say that this period, and the high growth that came with it, “doesn’t

count” as part of the free trade epoch is to adopt an arbitrary standard of when “free trade” began

and to ignore the actual policies pursued.

       Yet this whole exercise rests on the dubious assumption that one can judge a trade regime

simply by examining the economic growth that occurs on its clock. A major problem with this

approach is that the effects of trade policy on growth are probably swamped by other policies and

unrelated factors so that one cannot isolate the true impact of trade policy. The simple growth

accounting exercise also leaves one uninformed about the effects of trade policy on growth

(although it can prove useful, as above, in characterizing the actual growth experience). Just as

the positive correlation between tariffs and growth in the late nineteenth century does not

necessarily imply that tariffs caused that growth, the late twentieth century correlation between

low tariffs and growth does not necessarily imply that free trade was responsible for that growth.

       The standard theory of international trade generally suggests that free trade will lead to



       4
         Here he differs from Buchanan (1998, p. 64), who views 1967 as “the year” in which
the United States entered the “free trade” era.
                                                  -9-

higher real incomes than protection, but says little about the rate of growth per se. One cannot

infer the relationship between trade and income through a simple correlation of the two because

higher income may lead to greater trade rather than the other way around. Frankel and Romer

(1999) recently overcame this simultaneity problem by using geographic characteristics of

countries (notably distance) that are uncorrelated with income but are good proxies for trade and

find that more trade is indeed associated with higher income.5 Whether openness to trade

generates stronger growth (as opposed to higher income) is an unresolved empirical question.

Several studies (such as Sachs and Warner 1995) have found that openness is correlated with

higher economic growth in the postwar period (after controlling for other factors), but Rodriguez

and Rodrik (1999) have recently cast serious doubt on the robustness of these findings.

        Such problems do not mean that we should throw up our hands in despair of ever saying

anything about the effects of tariffs on growth. Tariffs could have promoted or attenuated capital

accumulation and productivity growth through several channels. Even if definitive statements

about those channels are beyond our grasp, they can be explored to evaluate their potential

economic significance.



Tariffs and Capital Accumulation

        To say that the United States experienced strong economic growth in the late nineteenth

century because it rapidly accumulated capital begs the question: why did the United States

accumulate capital so rapidly, and could the tariff have promoted this accumulation?



        5
            Irwin and Terviö (2000) find that this relationship holds prior to World War I (1913) as
well.
                                                 -10-

        The standard interpretation of late nineteenth century capital formation comes from the

careful work of Davis and Gallman (1978). Davis and Gallman showed that the share of capital

formation in GNP rose significantly between the ante-bellum period and the late nineteenth

century. Net investment as a percent of GNP rose from about 10 percent prior to the Civil War

to nearly 20 percent in the late nineteenth century (Davis and Gallman 1978, p. 2), with a

significant part of the rise occurring during the Civil War decade. They sought to explain the

increase in the capital stock through increases in the demand for capital and the supply of

savings. The demand for capital appears to have arisen largely in non-traded sectors. While the

aggregate capital-output ratio rose throughout the nineteenth century, Davis and Gallman (1994,

p. 206) write that “the increases in the agricultural and industrial sectors were modest and were

concentrated rather late in the period.” They note that “this was not true of the service sector . . .

. There the increase began early and was very pronounced — a reflection of the marked shift in

final demand toward the capital-intensive railroad and urban-housing components of the sector.”6

        Davis and Gallman concluded that investment demand-side changes were not sufficient

to explain most of the increase in savings and investment. Consistent with the fall in the real

price of capital goods and in real interest rates over the century, they argue that a shift in the

supply of savings dominated any shift in demand. Davis and Gallman produce no single

explanation for why the savings rate rose so much over the course of the nineteenth century. Part

of the increased savings was a shift from unconventional to conventional forms of savings (i.e.,

from breaking and clearing new farm land to savings from property income) as the urban



        6
         They also note that labor-saving or capital-using technological change does not appear
to have been significant enough to account for the rise in the capital-output ratio.
                                                   -11-

population grew relative to the rural population. The rising share of property income in total

income contributed as well to the higher savings rate. The development of financial capital

markets also figures prominently in their explanation; as they (1994, p. 208) put it,

“improvements in capital markets and financial intermediation, by reducing overhead and

transactions costs and providing insurance against risky outcomes, made substantial contributions

to the increase in the savings-investment rate.”

       Taking the Davis-Gallman story as our benchmark, the question then becomes: how did

the tariff affect the process and direction of capital accumulation? A tariff on imported

manufactured goods could have accelerated capital accumulation by expanding the domestic

production of such goods and thereby increasing the demand for capital. That this mechanism

was a significant factor can be questioned on several grounds. Davis and Gallman found that the

biggest rise in the capital-output ratio occurred in the non-traded sector, such as railroads and

housing, with only a modest change in the manufacturing sector.

       Late nineteenth century U.S. tariffs also appear to have been structured to protect

relatively labor-intensive manufactures, such as cotton textiles and leather, rather than capital-

intensive manufactures, such as iron and steel and machinery (Irwin 1999). The political

justification for this tariff structure was that the high wages of American workers required

protection against the low wages paid by foreign manufacturers. Such a tariff could have

redistributed income from capital to labor and thereby reduced the incentive to accumulate

capital. A tariff-induced increase in the demand for capital also implies that the return to capital

and the price of capital goods would rise. Yet this period witnessed sharp declines in the relative

price of capital goods and in real interest rates, so most evidence points to capital accumulation
                                                 -12-

as having been a savings-driven rather than a demand-driven phenomena.

       Williamson (1974) proposed two different channels by which high tariffs may have

helped stimulate post-Civil War capital accumulation. First, the tariff helped generate large

fiscal surpluses that could have “crowded in” private investment. James (1984) found some

evidence that the government’s fiscal surpluses, devoted largely to reducing the Civil War debt

burden, indeed promoted domestic investment. While there was no direct evidence on the

substitution of government debt for private securities, James found indirect evidence through the

interest rate. Had no debt been retired after the Civil War, James estimates that the capital stock

could have been 5 to 10 percent lower than its actual level in 1890, and GNP growth could have

been 0.1 to 0.2 percentage points lower than the 4.9 percent rate registered between 1870 and

1890. As a result, the level of GNP could have been 2 to 4 percent lower by 1890 if no debt had

been retired. This evidence, however, does not so much demonstrate that protective tariffs

spurred capital accumulation as that the fiscal surpluses did. The government clearly could have

devised a different tax structure to yield the large tax revenue that it received (including revenue

tariffs and the income or excise taxes that had been imposed during the war), but just found

import tariffs to be politically expedient.

       Williamson’s second channel was a change in the structure of domestic prices whereby

the higher Civil War tariffs raised the prices of manufactured consumer goods relative to those of

capital goods between the 1840s and the 1870s. The lower relative prices of capital goods

encouraged the greater use of such goods and thereby promoted capital deepening. If the tariff

had this effect, however, the level of capital might be affected but not (transition effects aside)

the growth rate since the tariff was not increasing thereafter.
                                                 -13-

       It is not clear, however, that such a relative price shift can be attributed to the tariff.

Williamson (1974, p. 657) argues that final manufactured goods were more heavily taxed by the

tariff code than capital goods in part because, “with the outstanding exception of railroad rails,

finished capital goods were rarely traded in this phase of American development.” In contrast,

De Long (1998) argues that capital goods were internationally traded and were taxed at roughly

the same rate as final manufactured products. He calculates that the average tariff on capital

goods around 1890 was around 40 percent, about the same rate as levied on nonagricultural

consumer goods. De Long (1998, p. 369) concludes that “the tariff made a wide range of

investment goods – from British machine tools and steam engines to steel rails to precision

instruments – more expensive.” (This raises the possibility that the reason for the lack of trade in

capital goods noted by Williamson was due to the tariff itself.) Higher prices for foreign and

domestic capital goods would depress the rate of capital accumulation, significantly so according

to De Long (1998, p. 370): “if this is indeed the plausible range [of effects], then the damaging

effects of the tariff on investment were extremely important for nineteenth century growth. In the

long run, a reduction in the real investment share of national product of 2 to 4 percent carries

with it a reduction in the capital-output ratio of 10 to 20 percent – and a reduction in productivity

and real wages of 5 percent or more.” Thus, tariffs on imported capital goods could have proven

very harmful to capital accumulation and economic growth.7


       7
           Collins and Williamson (1999) report regressions that indicate higher tariffs were
associated with lower relative prices of capital goods in a panel of countries prior to 1950
(although they report that this finding is not robust to the exclusion of the United States). In their
data set, the United States exhibits “a rising relative cost of capital goods between the 1870s and
just prior to World War I” (p. 5). Their data (based on Kuznets) show a 6.8 percent increase in
the relative price of capital to consumption goods between 1870-74 and 1895-99. Other data
points to a falling relative price of capital and investment goods during this period. Williamson
                                                -14-

       Two final channels should be considered. The tariff could have promoted foreign direct

investment in the United States as foreign producers, hampered from exporting to the U.S.

market, sought instead to make capital investments there. The importance of this “tariff-

jumping” channel can be questioned because of the small contribution of foreign investment to

total capital accumulation in the period after the Civil War; almost all of U.S. domestic

investment was financed by domestic savings (see Lipsey 1994). Foreign investment played a

somewhat important role in the financing of the railroads, but this investment does not appear to

have depended upon the tariff. And by the 1890s, the United States had joined the United

Kingdom in becoming a capital exporter. Finally, the tariff could have shifted the distribution of

income in the United States toward high-savings households, thereby adding to the supply of

savings and contributing to capital accumulation. Williamson (1979) has suggested that changes

in income distribution do not explain the higher post-Civil War savings rates, so the marginal

effect of the tariff on income distribution probably did not play a major role.

       To conclude, there is no solid link between the tariff and capital accumulation. High

savings rates appear to have been the principal factor behind the rapid accumulation of capital,

the demand for which arose mainly in the non-traded sector, not in manufacturing. To the extent

that tariffs raised the price of capital goods, capital investment would have been discouraged.



Tariffs and Productivity

       The effect of import tariffs on domestic productivity growth is also, a priori, ambiguous.



(1979, p. 233), for example, has referred to data (based on Gallman) in which the relative price of
investment to the GDP deflator falls 10.9 percent between 1874 and 1897.
                                                -15-

The tariff could have contributed to higher aggregate productivity by shifting resources from low

to high productivity sectors, or could have detracted from efficiency by shielding high-cost

producers from import competition.

       One popular argument is that tariffs on imported manufactured goods contributed to

aggregate productivity growth by shifting resources from agriculture to manufacturing, where

productivity growth was faster. Table 3 presents data on total factor productivity (TFP) growth

by sector and shows that productivity growth in manufacturing did exceed that in agriculture

during the late nineteenth century. This implies that a tariff-induced shift of productive factors to

manufacturing could have raised economy-wide TFP growth.8

       But a simple back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests that the elimination of the import

tariff could not have reduced TFP growth substantially. The United States imported $315

million of manufactured goods in 1869. In that year, the United States produced $1,395 million

of value added in manufacturing with 2.1 million workers (or $680 in value-added per worker in

manufacturing).9 If the elasticity of import demand was -2.6 (as estimated for 1869 to 1913 by

Irwin 1998), then the elimination of a 40 percent import tariff on manufactured goods would

increase the value of manufactured imports by $328 million, bringing total imports to $643

million. These additional imports would have displaced 0.48 million workers in manufacturing,


       8
           The TFP figures derived from the Maddison data are not comparable to those from the
Kendrick data due to different weighting schemes applied to the productive inputs in calculating
productivity. The Maddison data on Tables 1 and 2 are internally consistent and comparable.
The Kendrick calculation is closer in spirit to the multi-factor productivity calculated by the
Bureau of Labor Statistics, although they also are not computed the same way. For the period
1950 to 1992, the BLS reports average annual multi-factor productivity growth of 1.2 percent.

about 24 percent of manufacturing workers and about 4 percent of the total labor force.10 If those

workers were shifted from manufacturing, where TFP was growing 1.2 percent a year, to

agriculture, where such productivity was growing 0.8 percent a year, economy-wide TFP growth

would fall from 1.50 percent to 1.48 percent a year, a minuscule decline. The cumulative effect

(from 1870 to 1913) would be to lower the level of 1913 GDP by a slight 0.8 percent.

       A variant on this exercise focuses not on productivity growth but on the comparative

level of labor productivity in manufacturing and agriculture. Table 4 presents the ratio of U.S.-

U.K. labor productivity by sector over this period based on the work of Broadberry (1997).

Whereas U.S. labor productivity in agriculture was comparable to that in the United Kingdom,

U.S. labor productivity in manufacturing was roughly twice that in the United Kingdom

throughout the late nineteenth century. One reason why the United States caught up to (and

eventually surpassed) the United Kingdom in per capita GDP is that American workers shifted

from agriculture to manufacturing. Indeed, Table 5 shows that the share of labor in agriculture

dropped from 50 percent in 1870 to 32 percent by 1910.

       The tariff cannot take much credit for this shift because the level of import protection was

roughly constant from the Civil War through this period, so its effect is already built into the

1870 figure. We can, however, ask how eliminating the tariff would have affected the ratio of

U.S.-U.K. per capita GDP through the sectoral allocation of labor in the United States. As

suggested above, eliminating the tariff on imported manufactured goods would have displaced

about 4 percent of the labor force. Shifting 4 percent of the labor force from manufacturing to



       10
         This effect is somewhat overstated because imports are measured by gross value
whereas production is measured by value-added.
                                                -17-

agriculture in 1870 would have reduced U.S. GDP relative to that of the United Kingdom from

92 percent to 88 percent. Posed in this way, the static labor reallocation brought about by the

tariff is relatively modest, and is nowhere close to explaining much of the United States’s

overtaking the United Kingdom in per capita GDP.

       Could the level of labor productivity in manufacturing have depended upon the tariff?

One could argue that the tariff would move resources into manufacturing and raise that sector’s

productivity due to external economies of scale. (Without the tariff, this argument goes, perhaps

U.S.-U.K. relative labor productivity would not have increased from 183 percent in 1870 to 203

percent in 1910.) To invoke the possibility of external economies, however, quickly moves the

debate into an even vaguer realm of speculation because such effects are not readily identifiable.

De Long (1998, p. 372) considers the possibility of such dynamic specialization gains in

manufacturing but, as he points out, “the key problem is that the United States levied its heavy

tariffs on those manufactured capital goods whose accumulation is the trigger for advances in

knowledge and TFP.”

       Could the tariff have advanced manufacturing productivity by promoting the development

of infant industries that initially required protection from foreign competition? U.S. tariffs

protected manufacturers across-the-board, however, and for every case in which domestic

industries improved their competitive position vis-a-vis foreign rivals (for reasons not necessarily

due to tariff protection), there are other cases in which industries remained relatively inefficient

(such as textiles, silk, and woolens).11 The tinplate industry blossomed after receiving tariff


       11
           Baldwin (1969, p. 303) has pointed out that “if the infant industry argument for tariff
protection is worthy of its reputation as the major exception to the free-trade case, it should be
possible to present a clear analytical case, based upon well-known and generally accepted
                                                -18-

protection in 1890 and became a celebrated example which plausibly met the stringent conditions

for beneficial infant industry protection. Upon closer examination, however, this industry failed

to emerge primarily because of high tariffs on iron and steel intermediate inputs and finally

succeeded because those prices fell to international levels, not because of tariff-induced learning

effects (Irwin 2000).

       Most arguments favorable to protective tariffs stress the special importance of the

manufacturing sector, but that sector’s role may exaggerated. Table 3 indicates that TFP growth

in the non-traded sector, such as transportation, services, utilities, and communications, was

much more rapid than in traded sectors such as agriculture or manufacturing. Table 4 suggests

that the pace of relative productivity growth was also higher in these non-traded sectors. The

non-traded sector accounted for a rising share of the labor force, increasing from 31 percent of

employment in 1870 to 43 percent in 1910. The non-traded sector therefore played a very

important role in the United States overtaking the United Kingdom in per capita GDP around the

turn of the century.

       In sum, many of the links between tariffs and productivity are elusive. For every

speculative argument that tariffs could have promoted higher productivity through this or that

channel, there is an equally strong, equally speculative counter argument. Tariffs might have

promoted the high productivity manufacturing sector, but also could have harmed efficiency by

shielding inefficient firms from import competition. Tariffs might have assisted externality-

generating industries, but also could have enabled imperfectly competitive domestic


empirical relationships unique to infant industries, for the general desirability and effectiveness
of protective duties in these industries.” Baldwin makes the compelling case that there does not
exist a clear case for using tariffs to promote infant industries.

manufacturers to exercise market power (“the tariff is the mother of the trust,” as it was put by

contemporaries). Even if these factors are hard to evaluate, the simple calculations here suggest

that higher productivity arising from inter-sectoral resource shifts due to the tariff alone was not a

key factor in late nineteenth century U.S. growth.



Conclusions

       The U.S. experience in the late nineteenth century is often appealed to as evidence that

high tariffs can prove beneficial to economic growth and development. Upon closer scrutiny, it

is difficult to establish this claim. That tariffs coincided with rapid growth in the late nineteenth

century does not imply a causal relationship. To provide compelling evidence of a causal

relationship requires the identification of the particular channel or mechanism through which the

beneficial effect of the tariff purportedly operates. The simple calculations performed here

suggests that U.S. economic growth during this period did not hinge on the tariff. Determining

the effect of the tariff on U.S. growth at the margin is exceedingly difficult, but that effect could

well have been negative if high tariffs on capital goods impeded capital accumulation. Focusing

on the tariff’s impact on agriculture and manufacturing also diverts attention from the importance

of non-traded sectors in the late nineteenth century U.S. growth experience. The mundane non-

traded sectors, such as utilities, distribution, and other services, accumulated capital more rapidly

than manufacturing, achieved higher rates of TFP growth than manufacturing, and boosted U.S.-

U.K. relative labor productivity in such as way as to help the United States overtake the United

Kingdom in per capita GDP. These non-traded sectors were a key feature of U.S. economic

development during this period.12




       12
          Non-traded sectors have also played a key role in productivity convergence in recent
times. Bernard and Jones (1996, p. 1216) examine sectoral productivity measures for 14 OECD
countries during 1970-1987 and find that “for all measures of productivity, the manufacturing
sector shows little or no convergence, while other sectors, especially services, show strong
evidence in favor of convergence.”
