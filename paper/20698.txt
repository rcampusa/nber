Who fares worse in an economic downturn, low- or high-paying firms? Different answers to this question
imply very different consequences for the costs of recessions. Using U.S. employer-employee data,
we find that employment growth at low-paying firms is less cyclically sensitive. High-paying firms
grow more quickly in booms and shrink more quickly in busts. We show that while during recessions
separations fall in both high-paying and low- paying firms, the decline is stronger among low-paying
firms. This is particularly true for separations that are likely voluntary. Our findings thus suggest that
downturns hinder upward progression of workers toward higher paying firms - the job ladder partially
collapses. Workers at the lowest paying firms are 20% less likely to advance in firm quality (as measured
by average pay in a firm) in a bust compared to a boom. Furthermore, workers that join firms in busts
compared to booms will on average advance only half as far up the job ladder within the first year,
due to both an increased likelihood of matching to a lower paying firm and a reduced probability of
moving up once matched. Thus our findings can account for some of the lasting negative impacts on
workers forced to search for a job in a downturn, such as displaced workers and recent college graduates.
For example, differential sorting and lack of upward mobility can account for roughly a third of the
initial earnings impacts of graduating into a large downturn.

1      Introduction

Worker sorting across rms has long been thought to play a central role in labor market

eciency.    Despite frictions that can inhibit this sorting process, such as search costs or

imperfect learning, workers are thought to gradually move towards jobs of better overall- or
                          1
match-specic quality.        At the same time, recessions may impede worker sorting. Several

papers have noted that worker churn and job-to-job mobility declined during recent recessions
                                                                                     2
and that this decline was particularly severe during the Great Recession.                This suggests that

a worker's ability to move on from poor job matches or bad jobs is curtailed in times of high

unemployment.       A natural question, then, is in what types of jobs are workers  at least

temporarily  saddled?        If the business cycle has dierential impacts on jobs or rms of

varying quality, the consequences of reduced mobility could be very dierent. In this paper,

we ask who fares worse in an economic downturn, low- or high-paying rms?

     The classic Schumpeter (1939) cleansing eect posits that in recessions resources are

reallocated to more productive rms, since, after a negative productivity shock, the least
                                                         3
productive endeavors are no longer worthwhile.               Because productivity and pay are typically

positively correlated (see for example Seranelli 2012), cleansing predicts that in recessions

workers ow to high-paying rms. However, there are also reasons to expect employment

to contract by relatively more among high-paying rms during recessions.                     For example,

the notion of a job ladder suggests that workers tend to ow from bad jobs to good, i.e.,

from low- to high-paying jobs (Burdett and Mortensen 1998).                  If during recessions higher

paying rms choose not to expand, then lower paying rms might nd it easier to hold on
                                                                                                    4
to productive employees and thus shrink by relatively less than high-paying rms.                       It is

also possible that high-paying rms produce goods for whom demand is more sensitive to
                                                                                                           5
the business cycle, maybe because they tend to produce goods that are more highly priced.

Empirically, it is therefore an open question whether the job ladder eect or dierential

product market cyclicality will outweigh any Schumpeterian cleansing.                    If so, then during

recessions, employment in low-paying rms would decline less rapidly than that in high

    1 Thisidea goes at least as far back as the canonical work of Jovanovic (1979); for empirical work on job
mobility see Farber's 1999 survey.
   2 See in particular Lazear and Spletzer (2012), Hyatt and McEntarfer (2012a).
   3 Many theoretical papers seek to explain this phenomenon by exploiting a friction that inhibits resources
from being allocated optimally. Recessions can produce large enough shocks to overcome any frictions
inhibiting optimal reallocation. See for example Hall (1991), Mortensen and Pissarides (1994), Caballero
and Hammour (1994, 1996) and Gomes, Greenwood and Rebelo (2001).
   4 Moscarini and Postel-Vinay (2013) write down a dynamic Burdett and Mortensen-style search model
with a job ladder with exactly this implication, that in a downturn rms at the bottom of the job ladder
fare relatively better since their workers are less likely to be poached away by rms at higher rungs.
   5 For example, Bils and Klenow (1998) show that consumer demand for luxury goods is more cyclically
sensitive than for other products such as non-durables. The cyclical upgrading literature (Okun 1973, Bils
and McLaughlin 2001) shows that jobs in high-paying industries (such as durable goods manufacturing)
are more sensitive to the business cycle than jobs in low-paying industries (such as non-durable goods
manufacturing), likely because products in these industries have more cyclically sensitive demand. This
implies that opportunities to move into these jobs become relatively less prevalent in contractions.

paying rms.

    In this paper we investigate the employment eects of the business cycle across high-

and low-paying rms. We use data from the Longitudinal Employer Household Dynamics

(LEHD) program, a U.S. employer-employee matched database, from 1998 to 2011. We rst

show that employment growth at low-paying rms is                 less   sensitive to the business cycle,

as measured by the state unemployment rate, than that at higher paying rms.                         This is

important because it implies that the quality of jobs erodes in a downturn. We next provide

evidence that the growth rate eect is likely driven by a partial collapse of movement up

the job ladder in a bust, as opposed to dierences in product market cyclicality and other

possible factors.    This implies that low-paying rms fare relatively better in a downturn

because workers who would like to move on to better opportunities get stuck there.                        We

estimate that movement up the job ladder is 20% slower for those working at the lowest-

paying rms in a large bust, compared to a boom. We also estimate that the distribution of

new job matches shifts towards these lower-paying rms in a downturn. The combination of

a worse initial match and a reduced likelihood of upgrading implies that new job matchers

are particularly scarred by recessions. We estimate that rm quality a year after matching, as

measured by average rm pay, is 2.6% lower for those matching in a large recession compared

to a boom. Thus the dynamics presented in this paper have important implications for the

literature on the long-lasting eects of recessions on workers, which tends to nd that those

forced to search for jobs in a downturn, e.g., recent college graduates and displaced workers,

are particularly damaged.

    The growth rate result is surprising, since it is inconsistent with Schumpeterian cleansing.

However it does line up with a small, recent body of work examining employment growth rates

over the business cycle as a function of rm size. Moscarini and Postel-Vinay (2012) show in

a number of countries including the U.S. that dierential growth rates of small-, compared
                                                                            6
to large-, rms are positively related to the unemployment rate.                This recent literature thus

supports the notion that low-quality rms (small or low-paying) are somewhat sheltered

by the business cycle, but has so far been unable to empirically pinpoint the underlying

mechanisms. We devote the bulk of this paper to disentangling mechanisms, examining the

dierential impact of the business cycle on the components driving growth rates: hires and

separations as well as proxies for voluntary and involuntary separations. We then quantify

what these eects imply for workers careers. This paper thus generates a number of new

empirical relationships that enable us to learn a great deal about rm dynamics over the

business cycle.

   6 Also, Fort, Haltiwanger, Jarmin and Miranda (2013) analyze rm growth over the business cycle as a
function of rm age and size, using U.S. data. They nd that small, young, rms typically fare relatively
better in cyclical contractions, although this relationship reversed in the 2007-09 recession. The recent work
on rm size is at odds with an older literature, interested in establishing whether small rms face credit
constraints and whether these are exacerbated in recessions. The literature had been inconclusive on this
question but tended to nd empirical support for a greater sensitivity to credit constraints among small
rms. See for example Gertler and Gilchrist (1994), Chari, Christiano and Kehoe (2007), and Sharpe (2004).
                                                      4
    Net growth in a given quarter equals hires minus separations in that quarter. It is well

known that both hires and separations decline during periods of high unemployment, and

we show that this holds across all rms. However, we nd that separations decline by more

in lower paying rms than higher paying rms. This relative reduction in worker exits from

low-paying rms accounts for their growth rate advantage.               In addition, we nd that the

relative dierence in separations is driven primarily by separations that appear voluntary

on the part of workers (separations where the worker moves directly to another employer,

rather than facing a period of time with no earnings). This nding is consistent with a partial

collapse of the job ladder during downturns: low-paying rms grow relative to high-paying

rms because workers who would ordinarily try to move on to better opportunities get stuck.

    We do nd, in addition, that rm behavior regarding layos plays a small role: in down-

turns higher-paying rms have small increases in separations that look like layos (where

the worker moves to non-employment for some period of time), while low-paying rms do

not.      High-paying rms could face a greater need to lay o workers because demand for

their products is more cyclically sensitive or because they had an easier time hiring workers

during the preceding boom (being at the top of the job ladder) and now have become too

large for production in a downturn. We test for the former by measuring whether revenues

are dierentially cyclical across high- and low-paying rms and do not nd evidence of such

an eect, though our test is imperfect since we can only obtain revenue data for publicly

traded rms. We also nd no evidence that high-paying rms suer more from downward

earnings rigidities, and therefore would have to layo workers in tough times rather than

cutting pay.

    We view this body of results as being most consistent with a job ladder model where

workers tend to use jobs at low-paying rms as stepping stones to better opportunities

elsewhere.     In an economic downturn those opportunities do not present themselves and

workers are forced to stay put. Firms higher up on the job ladder will naturally experience

this impact of a downturn less, because workers are more likely to see those jobs as nal

destinations, regardless of economic conditions.           In particular, the Moscarini and Postel-

Vinay (2013) poaching model predicts this set of ndings. In their model, rms at the top

of the job ladder poach workers away from rms at lower rungs, enabling them to grow in

a boom. In a bust, they stop poaching because they do not need to produce at the same

scale (and may indeed need to trim the fat o their existing workforce), enabling rms at

lower rungs to retain their workers. This results in more cyclically sensitive employment at
                                                                                      7
high-paying rms, while low-paying rms fare relatively better in a bust.

    Our results are very much in the spirit of Barlevy (2002) who shows that the decline

   7 In a recent paper, Haltiwanger, Hyatt and McEntarfer (2014) use the LEHD to measure the cyclicality
of poaching across large and small rms. Counterintuitively, they do not nd evidence that large rms
poach from small rms, on net. However, motivated by our ndings in this paper, they provide additional
results categorizing rms by pay (as we do), rather than by size. Here they do nd strongly pro-cyclical net
employment reallocation of workers from low- to high-paying rms, consistent with our results.

in job-to-job transitions seen in recessions has a quantitatively important negative eect
                                                                           8
on match quality, terming this the sullying eect of recessions.             We nd that workers

at low-paying rms suer more from this decline in voluntary mobility, implying a further

sullying eect of recessions: workers get stuck in worse overall quality (lower paying) jobs.

Our estimates imply that in a large recession, workers in the lowest paying rms are 20%

less likely to upgrade to a better rm in a large recession, compared to a boom.

     Finally, our results have important implications for the long-lasting consequences of reces-

sions on workers. A growing body of evidence suggests that recessions have vastly dierent

impacts on workers in the long run, depending on what stage of their career the recession

hits them in.    First, labor market conditions at the beginning of a worker's career have

long-lasting scarring eects (Kahn 2010, Oreopoulos, von Wachter and Heisz 2012, Altonji,

Kahn, and Speer 2014). Second, the consequences of job displacement have been shown to

be much larger when displacement occurs in a recession (Davis and von Wachter 2011). It

therefore seems that being forced to search and match during an economic downturn can

be incredibly damaging to a worker's career. We conclude the paper with some evidence on

this dimension. We show that workers matching in a large recession are both more likely

to match to a low-paying rm, and, one year later, less likely to have upgraded to a better

rm. Therefore, a year after matching, a worker is in a rm that pays 2.6% less, on average,

when matching in a bust compared to a boom. The rm dynamics discovered in this paper

can thus account for roughly a third of the initial earnings losses experiences by workers

graduating into a large recession, and much of the persistence of earnings losses over the

early years of a career.

     The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 describes the data, while section

3 details our methodology. Section 4 presents our core regression results on net and gross

worker ows.    Section 5 provides a discussion of the results, and tests for the underlying

mechanisms.     Section 6 shows how rm upgrading and the careers of new matchers are

impacted by the mechanisms uncovered in the previous sections. Section 7 concludes.




2      Data

We analyze employment changes within rms and over the business cycle using data from

the U.S. Census Bureau's Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics program (LEHD).

The LEHD maintains a variety of survey and administrative data from several state and

federal agencies.   For this paper, we chiey use state unemployment insurance (UI) wage

records and the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) data. Both UI and

QCEW data are available for states in partnership with the LEHD program, currently all 50

states and the District of Columbia. A thorough discussion of the LEHD data is provided

    8 See
       also Bowlus (1993) and Davis, Haltiwanger, and Schuh (1996) for empirical evidence on the decline
in match quality in recessions.

in Abowd et al. (2009); a brief description follows.

    State-level unemployment insurance (UI) data contain quarterly earnings for employees

covered by state unemployment insurance systems, over 96% of private sector employment. A

rm, as dened in this analysis, is a collection of workers who share a common unemployment

insurance system identier (SEIN). Individual wage records can be linked across quarters to

create individual work histories, worker ows, and earnings dynamics. The rm identier on

the UI records is used to link to information on the rm available in the QCEW data (we

principally use employment size and industry measured with the North American Industry

Classication System, hereafter NAICS). Worker demographics, namely sex and date of

birth, are available from links to the Census administrative and survey data. For this paper

we restrict attention to the 34 states that have UI and QCEW data for every quarter of our

sample period 1998:Q1-2011:Q4. This sample period was chosen to maximize the number of

states for which a balanced panel of data exists over a reasonably long time period.

    These data are advantageous in that they allow us to observe both gross and net worker

ows for a substantial fraction of rms in the U.S. labor market. Furthermore, we can create

a rich set of rm characteristics to measure employer quality. Finally, the time period over

which we can exploit a balanced panel consisting of a large number of states allows us to

capture both the 2001 and 2007-09 recessions. In this section we discuss the data choices

made for our primary specications. We include a lengthy discussion about robustness to

other choices in section 4.

    Our exercise in this paper is to analyze how rms of dierent qualities are impacted

by the business cycle. Our measure of quality is based on average pay in the rm. Since

one goal of this paper is to better understand the experiences of workers in recessions, we

would ultimately like our quality measure to correlate with properties of a desirable job.

Obviously pay is an important dimension of worker satisfaction.               Furthermore, rms that

can pay higher wages are likely more productive. Seranelli (2012), for example, presents

evidence using detailed administrative data in Italy that high paying rms are indeed more

productive. We construct time-invariant pay measures by taking average wage within a rm

over our entire sample period (1998-2011). This avoids the well-known reclassication bias

problem (for example, that a rm is reclassied into a higher pay bin as the economy grows;
                                                                                                   9
see Moscarini Postel-Vinay (2012)), though our results are robust to other measures.

    Figure 1 shows an employment-weighted kernel density of rm-level average monthly
                                                                               10
earnings (for employees who work an entire quarter, in 2008 dollars).               This distribution has

a long right tail and to avoid potential data disclosure issues, we cap earnings at $12,000.

   9 In particular, we have experimented with using a two-quarter moving average as in Fort et al. (2013).
Our results are also robust to categorizing based on average pay at the establishment, rather than rm (the
LEHD imputes workers in a close geographic region to the same establishment within an SEIN).
  10 Monthly pay is dened as quarterly pay divided by 3. We ensure employees work the entire quarter by
restricting to employees who have non-zero earnings from the rm in both the preceding and subsequent
quarters.

                                                    7
As can be seen, we have substantial variation across rms over this time period. Average

pay in this sample is $3,815/month, and has a standard deviation of $66,244.

    For the main analysis, we take advantage of prototype data on job-to-job ows developed
                                                             11
from the LEHD by Hyatt and McEntarfer (2012b).                    This dataset restricts attention to

primary jobs only (the job that pays most in a given quarter for a given worker).                     One

disadvantage of the LEHD is that the data are only reported quarterly. This restriction helps

avoid some of the noise generated by this limited periodicity, but we discuss robustness in

section 4.

    To categorize rms, we divide them into employment-weighted quintiles, based on the

average pay measure using state-industry-specic cut points (measured at the two-digit

NAICS level).         Our categories thus dene rms as high- or low-paying relative to other

rms in the same state and industry. Workers in the lowest paying quintile earn on average

$1,842/month, while workers in the highest paying quintile earn on average $6,665/month

(see table 1 discussed below).

    We subsequently analyze the impact of the unemployment rate on growth rates as a

function of rm quality, measured by the pay quintiles. We have a number of reasons for

making these pay quintiles state-industry specic.           First, our denitions are not sensitive

to dierent costs-of-living across states.       Second, rms may have dierent average labor

bills for reasons unrelated to the quality of the job.            For example, a greater reliance on

part-time workers would lower the overall labor bill (we cannot measure hours); a greater

reliance on sub-contractors for particular roles would shift the pay distribution within a

rm (we cannot measure occupation); a dierent mix of base pay, benets, bonuses, tips,

could also alter the level and distribution of pay within a rm. Third, dierent industries

exploit dierent technologies, some of which may be more correlated with aggregate economic

shocks than others. Making our cutpoints industry-specic should at least help hold constant

these factors. Finally, we identify the impact of the business cycle using local labor market

conditions, as measured by the state unemployment rate. This measure is likely less relevant

for traded sectors and will vary across states with dierent natural rates of unemployment.

The fact that our cutpoints are comparisons across rms within state and industry helps

here as well.

    The key dependent variables in this paper are net employment growth rates as well as

gross ow rates. To calculate these rates, we aggregate our rm-level data to the state-year-

  11 These data link primary jobs across quarters, using the timing of hires and separations to infer which
worker moves are job-to-job moves (with little-to-no time in non-employment) versus moves to and from
longer spells of unemployment. These data are also used in Hyatt and McEntarfer (2012a), who document
aggregate patterns in worker ows over the last 15 years and compare changes in earnings for dierent types
of moves, and Haltiwanger, Hyatt, and McEntarfer (2014), who measure the extent of poaching behavior by
large rms away from small rms.

capture employment dynamics driven from rm births and deaths.

      Specically, the quarterly growth rate in a given quarter,                         t,   for a rm pay type,        q,   is

dened in equation 1, where             A   is the number of hires in a given quarter,               S   is the number of

separations from the rm, and               E   is total employment over the quarter.

The growth rate is the net employment change                    (A â S)        among all rms,       f,   of type   q   (rms

are indexed    1   to   Fq )   divided by employment over the quarter,                   t,   among these rms.

      We dene the hire (separation) rate as total hires (separations) divided by total employ-
                               14
ment in a given cell.               Thus, by denition the growth rate equals the hire rate minus the

separation rate.

      We further decompose both separations and hires into those directly to/from employment

and those to/from non-employment. A separation is categorized as a move directly to another

employer if the worker has pay from another employer in the same quarter as the separation

or the quarter immediately following. Because our data only come at a quarterly frequency,

a worker must have at least a full quarter without earnings to be categorized as a mover

to non-employment.              See Hyatt and McEntarfer (2012b) for more detail.                         We discuss the

likely direction of this bias in section 5. Information on gross hires and separations, as well

as decompositions across source or destination of the worker are not available in most data

sets, even those containing measures of net employment growth, and herein lies much of our

contribution.

      Table 1 presents employment-weighted summary statistics by rm category for our rates

of interest.   Thus the 5 categories in table 1 contain a roughly equal number of workers.

Throughout our analysis, we weight by employment so that our results can be interpreted as
                                                                                   15
impacting the average worker rather than the average rm.                               Again, the unit of observation

industry xed eects, and experiment with other controls at a more disaggregated level.
  13 While in principle, we could conduct our analysis at the individual rm level, that would produce growth,
hire and separations rates that are quite a bit noisier. These rates may not be dened or may be misleadingly
large in the period in which a rm starts or closes and outliers can be generated by seasonal employers or
non-reporting events (or in principle mergers and acquisitions, though the LEHD use an algorithm to exclude
these events). At the individual rm level, these outliers create problems for our estimation, so we prefer
the slightly aggregated analysis presented here. This aggregation is particularly important given an LEHD
data limitation: that it is dicult to link rms consistently over time due to periodically changing SEIN's.
Though again, the LEHD have algorithms that avoid misclassifying workers as moving rms when SEIN
changes. See Abowd et al. (2009) for more detail on these algorithms.
  14 Temporary layos and recalls will be considered separations and hires if the worker earns no money from
the rm for at least a full quarter.
  15 This in a more representative sample, give the large left tail of small rms. See for example Haltiwanger
et al. (2013).

is a date-industry-state-pay quintile cell. Growth rates are fairly similar across pay quintiles,

ranging from    0.0014   to   0.003.16
    Hire and separation rates are highly correlated within rm category, reecting the fact

that most hiring serves to replace workers who have separated, but rates vary widely across

rm category. For example, gross hire and separation rates in the lowest pay quintile are, on

average, over double the rates in the highest pay quintile. Across our whole sample period

and for all types of rms, separation rates are roughly evenly split between separations to

employment and non-employment.              Hires are also roughly evenly split across those from

employment and those from non-employment, except that at lower paying rms workers are

relatively more likely to be hired from non-employment, while the opposite is true at higher

paying rms. Jobs at higher paying rms could be more dicult to obtain, consistent with

their more desirable position on the job ladder, so such rms tend to hire from a higher

quality pool of workers, the employed.

    Table 1 also shows the distribution of workers in a given pay quintile across other measures

of rm quality, churn and size. Excess churn is a measure of how many workers moved in
                                                                  17
and out of the rm for a given net employment change.                  Campbell et al. (2005) show that

high churn is associated with lower productivity and lower survival rates for a select set of

industries. We place rms into quintiles based on their average churn over the sample period.

From column 1 of table 1, about a third of rms in the lowest pay quintile are in the highest

churn quintile, while only a tenth are in the lowest churn quintile. These ratios are almost

exactly reversed in column 5, the highest pay quintile. This illustrates the strong negative

correlation between pay and churn.

    Firm size is dened as the number of employees in the SEIN on the 12th day of the rst
                                                                    18
month of the quarter, averaged over the life of the SEIN.                Larger rms have been shown to

have higher pay, better working conditions, a greater degree of benets provision, increased

productivity, and increased probability of rm survival (Brown and Medo 1989, Hurst and

Pugsley 2011). In our data, the lowest paying rms are predominantly found in either the

smallest (less than 20) or largest (500+) size categories. The majority of higher paying rms

  16 Based  on our categorization, high-paying rms have double the growth rate of the other quintiles. One
might have expected lower paying rms to grow more quickly because of positive correlations between pay,
size, and age. Haltiwanger, Jarmin and Miranda (2013) show that small rms grow faster than large rms,
but this is driven by the fact that small rms are also younger. By generating quintile cutpoints that are
state-industry-specic, we make rms across categories much more similar to each other. For example, while
a third of low paying rms (based on our categorization) are small, another third are very large. Overall the
lowest paying rms (unconditional on state and industry) are much more likely to be small and are also the
fastest growing.
   17 Specically, we dene the churn rate as Atf +Stf â|Atf âStf | , a denition which is now standard in the
                                                      Etf
literature (see Burgess, Lane, & Stevens (2000).
   18 Both Fort et al. (2013) and Moscarini Postel-Vinay (2012) use rm size data from the BDS, which
contains information on both establishment-level employment and national employment. Our measure of
rm size is correlated with the national size of the rm (0.75) but is not an exact match, more closely
approximating the size of the rm in the state, the same level at which we are classifying rms into pay
quintiles.

3       Methodology

In order to understand the dierential impact of the unemployment rate on growth, hire,

and separation rates across rm pay quintiles, we estimate regressions of the form specied

in equation 2.



(2)   ratesItq = Î±0 +Î±1 st_unempst +Wq Î±2 +[st_unempst âWq ]Î±3 +f (t)+I industry +I state +ÎµsItq

We regress    ratesItq , a growth, separation, or hire rate among rms of quality, q , in state, s, in
industry (three-digit NAICS), I , in time period, t, on the state unemployment rate in quarter

t (st_unempst ), a vector of rm quality indicators (Wq ) corresponding to pay quintiles, and
their interactions. The coecient, Î±1 , yields the impact of a 1 percentage point (ppt) increase

in the state unemployment rate on ratesItq for the omitted rm quality category, the lowest

pay bucket. The vector of interaction terms, Î±3 , indicates whether the impact of st_unemp

is dierent for higher pay buckets. The main eects of rm quality (Wq ) and the state
   state
(I       ) and industry xed eects (I industry , at the two-digit NAICS level) control for level
dierences in ratesItq across these observables (for example, some industries may on average

be shrinking and others growing). We also control for the average distribution of size and
                                19
churn within a pay bucket.

      We include exible controls for the time period,         f (t),   in two forms: First, we control for

quarter xed eects and a linear time trend. These allow us to control for seasonality and

secular changes over this time period (for example, the marked decline in churn during the

2000s), while still exploiting time-series variation in economic conditions at both the national

and state levels. However, since we only have a short time period, we would like to ensure

that our results are not driven by spurious correlations due to anomalies that coincided with

business cycle movements.            Therefore, in an alternative specication, we control for date

xed eects, absorbing all variation in the national time series and identifying purely o of

cross-sectional variation in economic conditions.

      We weight observations by employment and cluster our standard errors by state. Our

key explanatory variable, the state-specic unemployment rate, varies at the state-level and
                                                                  20
over time, but is likely serially correlated within state.

      We interpret equation 2 as informing how worker ows vary with local economic condi-

    19 Givenboth variables are highly correlated with rm pay, it is useful to know whether either size or churn
are the underlying drivers of the dynamics reported in the paper, or whether these dynamics exist within
size and churn. We can understand this to the extent that there is variation within pay bucket in these
variables. In practice results are nearly identical with and without these controls, suggesting dierences in
pay across rms is the primary driver of our results, not dierences in size or churn.
   20 We have also clustered at the state-date-rm quality level and obtained very similar results in terms of
statistical signicance.
                                                      11
tions and whether they vary dierentially across pay quintiles. We have chosen this speci-

cation to rule out a number of alternative channels through which the unemployment rate

might be correlated with worker ow measures. First, controlling for state xed eects and

exible controls for time period rule out that general dierences across locations or time pe-

riods drive our results and we instead pick up the relationship between idiosyncratic shocks

to the unemployment rate and worker ows. Second, and as mentioned above, our                     Wq   clas-

sication does not vary over time. Thus we will not have dierential representation of rms

across quintiles that varies systematically with the unemployment rate. Third, the               sItq -cells
are small enough so that we do not worry about reverse causality  no given cell makes up

enough of a state-quarter economy to drive the unemployment rate.

      Finally, one might worry that labor market shocks were mis-measured by the state un-

employment rate, and especially if this was dierential across rm type. For example, for

rms producing non-traded goods, the local unemployment rate is likely highly correlated

with whether the rm experiences a shock, while for rms producing traded goods, the local

unemployment rate may be less indicative. First, we point out that in some specications

we exploit both local and national variation in economic conditions, and these will be most

relevant for rms producing traded goods. Second, this kind of measurement error in eco-

nomic conditions will bias      Î±3   downward in magnitude, especially for pay buckets with a

higher share of rms producing traded goods. It is well known in the trade literature that
                                         21
exporting rms are higher paying.             Thus this should be a larger problem for higher pay

buckets, biasing us against our nding that growth rates at higher paying rms are more

sensitive to the business cycle.

      It is therefore unlikely that equation 2 suers from reverse causality, measurement error,

or systematic dierences across rm categories that are correlated with the unemployment

rate.




4       Regression Results on Growth, Hire, and Separation

        Rates


4.1          Growth Rate

Time Series
Figure 2 gives a a general sense of the time series relationships among economic conditions

and growth across rm quality. The left panel plots growth rates for the lowest and highest

    21 See
         Bernard, Jensen, Redding, and Schott (2007) for a survey. They cite a wealth of evidence document-
ing that exporters tend to be larger, more productive, more skill- and capital-intensive, and higher paying,
relative to non-exporters.


                                                    12

pay quintiles.      They are quite noisy, but show that growth rates are similar in magnitude

for low- and high-paying rms and that they trend together and opposite the unemployment

rate (dashed line).     Also one can see that the light line (highest pay quintile) has larger

uctuations than the dark line (lowest pay quintile); the light line falls lower than the dark

line in downturns and rises above it in booms.

    The right panel illustrates the dierences more clearly, plotting a dierential rate where

we subtract the growth rate at the highest pay quintile from that at the lowest in a given

quarter. This is similar to the large-small rm comparison in Moscarini and Postel-Vinay

(2012). It shows that the dierential rate very closely tracks the national unemployment rate.

That is, when unemployment is high, low-paying rms grow relative to high-paying rms,

while when unemployment is low, low-paying rms shrink relative to high-paying rms. Note

these eects are symmetric across booms and busts.



Main Regression Results
The time series evidence presented in gure 2 is suggestive, however with such a short panel

of data, we cannot perform any sort of reliable statistical inference based solely on this time

series. We now turn to a regression framework where we exploit cross-sectional variation in

unemployment rates across our 34 states and 56 quarters. Results are reported in table 2.

The dependent variable is the growth rate (net change in employment divided by average

employment over the quarter) in the state-date-industry-wage quintile.              We focus rst on

panel A, which reports the point estimates and standard errors from equation 2. The speci-

cation in column I controls for time period with quarter xed eects and a time trend, while

column II instead controls for date xed eects. The remaining columns show robustness

to alternative specications and are discussed below. Results are extremely similar across

columns I and II, and we tend to focus on column II since the date xed eects absorb any

coincidental trends that are correlated with the unemployment rate.

    From column II, the main eect of the unemployment rate, shown in the top row, is

negative, though very small in magnitude (0.00019) and not statistically signicant. This

coecient can be interpreted as the impact of the unemployment rate on the growth rate for

the lowest pay quintile  the omitted category in each regression. This regression suggests,

then, that the employment growth rate at low paying rms is acyclical.                 The interaction

terms show the dierential impact of the state unemployment rate on the growth rate at

higher paying rms.       They are all negative and statistically signicant at the 1% level.

This means the state unemployment rate has a more negative impact on the growth rate

at higher paying rms.       For example, a coecient of        â0.0011   (with a standard error of

0.00009)   among the highest paying rms, indicates that for each percentage point increase

in the unemployment rate, these rms shrink by           0.0011   more than the tiny eect seen in

  22 All
       lines have been detrended using a Hodrick-Prescott lter (with a smoothing parameter of 1600), and
seasonally adjusted by residualizing on quarter dummies. Therefore the levels are not that meaningful.

the lowest paying rms.           Multiplying this coecient by 6 yields the predicted impact of
                                                           23
the Great Recession on the growth rate, -0.006.                 This eect is quite large considering the

mean growth rate for this group was roughly               0.003.   Coecients are fairly similar for the

3rd through 5th wage quintiles, while smaller in magnitude for the 2nd quintile but still

signicantly dierent than the impact on the lowest paying rms.

    Because rm types dier in their baseline growth rates (for example, the growth rate in the

highest paying rms is nearly double that in the lowest paying rms), and to help interpret

the magnitudes of our eects, we convert our estimates to elasticities. Panel B reports the

total impact of a 1% increase in the state unemployment rate on the growth rate at each

rm-quality bucket (adding an interaction term to the main eect of the unemployment rate
                             24
for higher paying rms).          Again from column II, we nd that in response to a           1%   increase

in the state unemployment rate, the growth rate among the lowest paying rms does not

change while the growth rate for the highest paying rms declines by               1.8%.   Elasticities are

substantially larger in magnitude for the 2nd-4th pay quintiles, where growth rates decline

by 2-3.5%.



Robustness
We explore results from a number of dierent specications and samples.                    In column III,

we estimate separate regressions for each pay quintile and report the coecient on the state
                       25
unemployment rate.          This implicitly allows the impact of all of our control variables to vary

by pay quintile. These might be important if, for example, there exist dierences in growth

rates across industry-quintile or state-quintile, and if quintiles vary in their seasonality or in
                                     26
the impact of national trends.

    Column IV redenes our quintile cutpoints at an aggregated level, rather than at the

state-industry level. The set of rms in each pay quintile may be dierent when comparing

within the state-industry than the placement of rms in the overall pay distribution. We

discussed at length in section 2 why we prefer the relative comparison. However, we also

provide the absolute comparison to show that our results have implications for the economy

as a whole, not simply for dynamics within these more narrow comparisons.

    Column V excludes rms with less than 50 employees and redenes quintile cutpoints so

that employment in the remaining sample is evenly divided among them. This is important

for several reasons because small rms are also likely to be low-paying. First, small rms may

experience less of an impact on their growth rates because of a divisibility problem: in very

  23 The national unemployment rate rose from 4.2 in 2006:Q4 to a peak of 10.4 in 2010:Q1.
  24 To obtain these elasticities we add Î±1 to the relevant interaction term in Î±3 (or nothing in the case of
the lowest quintile), multiply and divide by the quintile-specic averages for the state unemployment rate
and the growth rate (respectively) reported in table 1.
  25 The coecients in this column thus reect the total impact of the unemployment rate on the growth
rate, not a main eect and interactions.
  26 Though not reported, we have also experimented with controls for state- and industry-specic seasonality
and obtained similar results.
                                                     14
small rms, laying o a single worker would stop production and hiring a new worker would

double production.      Second, small rms provide fewer non-pecuniary benets to workers,

systematically biasing our pay measure, relative to the total value of the job. Third, small

rms are known to be much more dynamic in terms of births and deaths.                     The fact that

results are similar with and without small rms suggests that the dierential impact of the

unemployment rate on growth rates is similar across both intensive and extensive margins.

It also helps with the problem that average pay is measured over dierent lengths of time

across rms. New rms that only have pay measures for a short time period will be more

sensitive to temporal factors impacting pay. Removing small rms clears out much of the
                                    27
noise that this would generate.

    Column VI categorizes rms by their xed eect in a quarterly earnings regression, based
                                                                             28
on the Abowd-Kramarz-Margolis (1999) method (hereafter, AKM).                     Our primary rm qual-

ity denition does not distinguish between rms that are high-paying from rms that tend

to employ highly-paid workers. The regression that generates rm xed eects controls for

worker xed eects and time-varying controls. This allows us to pinpoint that our eect as

applicable to high-paying rms. It also adjusts for the fact that pay is observed at dierent

time periods for dierent rms, mentioned above.

    Finally, column VII relaxes the exclusion of non-primary jobs, including all jobs. We can
                                                                                                 29
thus observe whether the dynamics hold for secondary jobs as well as primary jobs.

    As can be seen, results are remarkably similar across specication. Impacts on growth

rates for the lowest paying rms are always smallest and usually close to zero, while impacts

are larger in magnitude for higher paying rms. In all specications the impact does plateau

at the highest paying rms so that the starkest contrast comes from comparing the lowest and

upper-middle rms. Elasticities are calculated using the sample-specic means and show that

for most specications, impacts at the highest paying rms are also smaller in magnitude,

compared to the middle rms. When small rms are excluded (column V) and when we use

AKM xed eects (column VI) we do nd cyclical growth rates for even the lowest paying

rms. This is probably because these two specications result in the categorizations among

very similar groups. However, we still always see that the lower paying rms are less cyclical

than higher-paying rms.



Summary
Thus from table 2, we conclude that growth rates at the lowest paying rms are less cycli-

cally sensitive than those at higher-paying rms.           These results have implications for the

distribution of jobs over the business cycle, since low-paying rms grow relative to higher-

  27 Also, small businesses may manage dierently than larger rms. For example, Hurst and Pugsley (2011)
show that most small business owners intend to serve an existing customer base and do not intend to grow.
This would imply less growth in booms and as a result possible less shrinkage in busts.
  28 We thank John and Abowd and Kevin McKinney for providing these xed eects.
  29 For technical reasons, growth rates in this sample also more accurately capture rm births and deaths.

paying rms in busts. To put a magnitude on that, we can take average monthly earnings

in each type of rm, reported in table 1, and predict average pay in the economy based on

the implied distribution of workers across rms.    Starting from a point when workers are

evenly distributed across the quintiles, the average worker is in a rm paying $3,815/month.

Our estimates imply that after the Great Recession, the average worker is in a rm paying

$4/month less. That means that worker pay should fall in a recession by nearly 0.1% sim-

ply because of these aggregate rm dynamics, and not including any impacts on individual

worker pay. During the Great Recession, real gross domestic income fell by 3.8%. Compared

to this benchmark, the impact on the distribution of workers across rms is modest, but not

unsubstantial. We show in section 6 that the impact of this pay drop is substantially larger

for those employed by the lowest paying rms when a downturn begins.



4.2    Hire and Separation Rates

The regressions in table 2 show that growth rates at higher paying rms are more negatively

impacted by the unemployment rate. We are the rst to show these results as a function

of rm pay.   These are, however, quite consistent with work showing that small rms are

less cyclically sensitive than large rms (Moscarini and Postel-Vinay 2012) because small

rms are more likely to be low-paying. However, previous work could not decompose the

growth rate eect into its components. This is important because it helps to distinguish the

underlying mechanisms driving the growth rate eect. We provide the rst such analysis in

the subsequent sections.

   By denition, the growth rate equals the gross hire rate minus the gross separation rate

and we next analyze the impact of the unemployment rate on these two margins. First, to

get a general sense of how these uctuate dierentially across rms over the business cycle,

we plot the separation and hire rates for the lowest and highest pay quintiles, as well as the

dierential rates in gures 3a and 3b.

   Looking rst at separation rates in 3a, we see very dierent patterns than in gure 2.

First, in the left panel, the dark line (separation rates in the lowest pay quintile) clearly

exhibits much bigger amplications than the light line (the highest pay quintile). This is the

opposite of what we saw in gure 2 and is much more pronounced here. Consistent with this,

the dierential separation rate (left panel) is procyclical. When the unemployment rate is

low, low-quality rms separate at greater rates than high-quality rms, while the opposite is

true in times of high unemployment. These eects are again largely symmetric across booms

and busts. Patterns for hire rates are similar, though the amplitudes in the left panel are

more similar across low- and high-paying rms.

   Table 3 summarizes key regression results, reporting the preferred growth rate estimates

in column I (from column II of table 2), as well as the same specication for the separation

rate (column II) and the hire rate (column III). Because of the way we dened the dependent

                                              16
variables, a coecient for the hire rate minus that for the separation rate equals that for the

growth rate. Appendix tables 1 and 2 contain the full set of specications with all robustness

checks.

    Both separation and hire rates show quite similar patterns to each other, though like

the gures, opposite patterns to the growth rate.               From panel A, the main eect of the

unemployment rate is negative and a similar magnitude for both hires and separations,

while the interaction eects are positive and signicant. That is, a higher unemployment

rate is associated with reductions in both hires and separations.                 The magnitude of this
                                                                                                            30
eect is larger at the lowest paying rms, and somewhat oset at higher paying rms.

The interaction terms increase with pay quintile, so the sharpest contrast is for the lowest-

and highest-pay quintiles, though the contrasts are stronger for separation rates than for

hire rates. Our estimates imply that in the Great Recession, separation rates would have

declined by 1.7 ppts at the lowest paying rms and by 0.25 ppts at the highest paying rms,

while hire rates would have declined by 1.6 and 0.8 ppts, respectively.

    Panel B reports elasticities, analogous to table 2. Converting to elasticities is particularly

important here because the average separation and hire rates at the lowest paying rms is

double that at the highest paying rms (from table 1), making the units dicult to compare.

For example, it would be much easier for a rm to reduce its separation rate by a third of a

ppt o a base of 20% than o a base of 10%. For separation rates, the elasticities hold up

to the patterns presented in panel A; elasticities at lower paying rms are larger than those

at higher paying rms. In contrast, elasticities for hire rates are similar in magnitude across
                31
rm quintile.



4.3       Discussion

Table 3 shows that while growth rates are less impacted by the business cycle at low paying

rms, separation rates are more impacted and impacts on hire rates are roughly similar.

This implies that the growth rate eect is driven by the separations margin.                     The lowest

paying rms have a dramatic decline in worker exits in a downturn, which allows them to

maintain their workforce in spite of a large reduction in hiring. Higher paying rms do not

see such a decline in separations but they still have relatively large declines in hiring (in

percent changes they see a fairly similar decline to lower paying rms).

  30 That separation rates decline in times of higher unemployment might be surprising given we expect rms
to make more layos in a worse economy. However, this nding is consistent with a more-than-osetting
decline in voluntary quits (e.g., Shimer 2005, Hall 2005b).
  31 Results are again quite similar across specication. The general pattern that lower paying rms ex-
perience larger reductions in separation rates, compared to higher paying rms, holds robustly for both
coecients and elasticities. Impacts on hire rates are less consistent. The inclusion of date xed eects does
reduce the magnitude of the main eect (compare columns I and II in appendix tables 1 and 2), meaning that
some of the overall eect is due to sensitivity to national economic conditions. Because the interaction eects
remain constant across these specications, we infer that the dierential impacts across rms is primarily
driven by local variation.
                                                      17
     Figure 4 illustrates this result. Here we plot the total impact of a one percentage point

increase in the unemployment rate on growth (solid blue), hire (red line connected by dots),

and separation (green line connected by plus signs) rates across rm pay quintile (ignore
                                        32
for the moment the dashed lines).            The growth rate eect is close to zero for the lowest

quintile, and exhibits a shallow decline (increase in magnitude) across higher quintiles, before

leveling o at the highest quintiles. In contrast, the separation and hire rate impacts are

large in magnitude and negative for the lowest wage quintile and steadily increase (decrease

in magnitude) across higher quintiles. The separation rate eect is very close to zero for the

highest paying rms. Thus, while net employment changes are more cyclical at high-paying

rms, gross worker ows are more cyclical at low-paying rms.

     The gap between the hire and separation and rate eects (which will add up to the growth

rate eect) is largest among the highest paying rms  separation rates do not decline by as

much as hire rates in a bust so high-paying rms shrink. In contrast, hires and separations

decrease by roughly the same amount at the lowest paying rms, so net employment remains

roughly constant. In boom times, low-paying rms have relatively more separations, with a

commensurate increase in hires, resulting again in a constant size, while high-paying rms

increase their hires by more than their increased separation rate, resulting in faster growth.




5       Distinguishing among theories

We have shown that employment growth rates at low-paying rms are less sensitive to the

business cycle than those at high-paying rms.            Furthermore, the employment advantage

aorded low-paying rms in downturns is driven by a large reduction in worker separations,

and exists despite a roughly equally large decline in hiring at these rms. Separations occur

because of voluntary worker exits and layos. In downturns, the former decline while the

latter increase. So it must be that either low-paying rms experience a larger reduction in

voluntary quits, or lay o fewer workers when times are tough, or both.                  Which of these

eects occur, and why?

     As we noted in the introduction, there are several theoretical reasons why high- and low-

paying rms would be dierentially impacted by the business cycle. First, Schumpeterian

cleansing predicts that when a negative productivity shock renders the least productive

endeavors no longer worthwhile, resources will be reallocated to more productive rms.

Our nding that resources are reallocated from high- to low-paying rms, is inconsistent

with Schumpeterian cleansing because of the typical positive correlation between pay and

productivity.

     Second, a temporary collapse of the job ladder, a la the Moscarini Postel-Vinay (2013)

poaching model has several implications. In good times, rms at the top of the job ladder

    32 Fromtable 3, we add the main eect of the unemployment rate (the impact for the lowest pay quintile)
to the relevant interaction term.
                                                    18
(for example, higher paying rms) can poach workers away from rms at the bottom (lower-

paying).   As such, top rms become larger, while bottom rms have diculty retaining

workers. In a downturn, the top rms reduce their poaching eorts because the temporary

decline in productivity means it is no longer optimal to operate on as large a scale. This model

as four empirical implications that are relevant for our setting: (1) low-paying rms grow

relative to high-paying rms in a downturn because a reduction of poaching by high-paying

rms enables low-paying rms to retain their workforce; (2) low-paying rms experience a

relative decline in   voluntary   quits in a downturn because high-paying rms poach them less

often; (3) high-paying rms may increase layos in a downturn because the ease with which

they hired workers in the boom rendered them too large for optimal production in a bust;

(4) the decline in poaching behavior in a bust implies that high-paying rms will exhibit a

relative decline in hires from other employers. We have already shown that (1) holds in our

data. We provide the rst empirical tests of the remaining predictions, below.

    Third, rms may dier in how a recession impacts their protability because of dier-

ential product demand cyclicality. In particular, high-paying rms may sell more expensive

products. Bils and Klenow (1998) showed that luxury products have more cyclical demand.

If there is a positive correlation between worker pay and prices then we might expect higher

paying rms to be more sensitive to business cycle uctuations. For example, consider an

inexpensive chain restaurant and a ve-star restaurant.            The latter most likely pays their

employees more and also might have more cyclical demand. This model also predicts that

high-paying rms will have a relatively greater need to cut labor costs, perhaps via layos,

but also has implications for revenue. Below, we test for dierential product demand cycli-

cality by measuring the dierential impact of the business cycle on revenue growth using

Compustat data.

    Fourth, for a given need to cut on the labor bill, rms may be dierentially able to

adjust without laying o workers. A long-standing literature (see for example Shimer (2004)

or Hall (2005a) among many others) points to nominal wage rigidities as an explanation

for larger employment uctuations than uctuations in other market fundamentals.                      The

degree to which nominal wages are downwardly rigid remains a completely open empirical

question with evidence on all sides (see Pissarides 2009 for a survey). Furthermore, to our

knowledge no one has examined pay rigidity as a function of average rm pay. On the one

hand, high-paying rms may pay a higher share of salaries in the form of bonuses, which

are likely much easier to adjust. At the same time, low-paying rms likely pay more of their

workforce on an hourly basis, so may have an easier time cutting take-home pay through
                    33
hours reductions.        If the latter holds and low-paying rms are relatively more able to adjust

  33 The queuing literature also suggests that high-paying rms will have more rigid pay, relative to low-
paying rms. High-quality rms post a high wage, which results in a long queue of workers who wish to
work there, driven for example by an eciency wage (Akerlof and Yellen 1985), imperfect information (Weiss
1980) or explicit personnel policies (Okun 1973). They would then nd it easier to adjust the size of their
workforce without adjusting wages. A corroborating piece of evidence comes from the cyclical upgrading
                                                    19
worker pay downward, then we should again expect more layos from high-paying rms. We

examine the dierential probability of making nominal earnings cuts below.



5.1     Poaching

In this subsection we decompose separations and hires based on the destination or source,

employment or non-employment, to test predictions 2-4 of the Moscarini-Postel-Vinay poach-

ing model. Because of the periodicity of the LEHD, we can only dene a move as to or from

non-employment if the worker experienced a full quarter with no earnings. We discuss the

likely impact of this limitation below. Still these measures are useful in giving some indica-

tion for why a move occurred. A separation where a worker moves directly to another job is

more likely to have been voluntary than one where the worker had a complete quarter with
              34
no earnings.       Furthermore, a hire that was directly from employment is more likely to be

driven by poaching than a hire where the worker sat out of the labor market for at least a

month.

    Table 4 summarizes key regression results for this section, reporting the preferred growth

rate estimates in column I (from column II of table 2), as well as the same specication

for separation-to-employment and non-employment rates, and hire-from-employment and

non-employment rates. Because of the way we dened the dependent variables, coecients

for the two separation (hire) rates will sum to the full separation (hire) rate eect in table

3, column II (III). Also, the sum of the two hire rate eects minus the sum of separation

rate eects adds up to the growth rate eect. Appendix tables 3-6 contain the full set of

specications with all robustness checks.

    The regression coecients in panel A show that for separations to employment (column

II), the lowest paying rms experience a large negative drop in response to an unemployment

rate increase, signicant at the 1% level. The positive interaction terms, show that this eect

is oset somewhat at higher paying rms, mirroring the gross separation rate results from

table 3, and most dierences are signicant at the 1% level. For example, impacts on the

highest paying rms are three-quarters smaller in magnitude, than for the lowest-paying
                                                                35
rms.    Elasticities in panel B also mirror this result.            This result is therefore consistent

with prediction #2 from the poaching model, that low-paying rms experience a relatively

larger decline in voluntary quits in a downturn.

    The separations to non-employment results (column III) show that while the lowest

literature which nds that wages are more cyclical in low-paying industries (Bils and McLaughlin 2001).
This would nicely explain why high-quality rms need not increase wages in expansions, however, is it less
compelling for explaining why a rm would not lower wages in a contraction.
   34 Hyatt et al. (2014) nd a high correlation between separations to non-employment in the LEHD data
and layos in the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS), and an even higher correlation (just
under 1) between separations-to-employment in the LEHD and quits in the JOLTS.
   35 From appendix table 3, results are quite similar across the dierent specications. For results in this
section, we cannot perform the nal robustness (column VII in table 2 and appendix tables 1 and 2) that
includes non-primary jobs. Due to data constraints, these measures are only dened for primary jobs.
                                                     20
paying rms have negligible impacts, the higher paying rms have larger, positive eects.

Interaction terms are typically signicant at the 5% level, and elasticities tend to produce
                      36
the same patterns.         This is consistent with prediction #3 from the poaching model, that

high-paying rms lay o more workers in a downturn. However, this is also consistent with

the other models discussed above.

    Thus the gross separations margin is driven by a large decline in separations-to-employment

among the lowest paying rms, and a modest increase in separations to non-employment

among the higher paying rms.           This can be seen in gure 4, which decomposes the sep-

aration rate eect into separations to employment (long-dash green) and non-employment

(short-dash green). Again we plot the total impact of a 1 ppt increase in the state unem-

ployment rate on these separations rates for each pay quintile. Clearly from the gure, the

level impact of the separation rate eect is driven primarily by the impact on separations to

employment. The impact of the unemployment rate on these is large and negative for the

lowest paying rms, but becomes smaller in magnitude for higher paying rms. Also, higher

paying rms see a small positive impact on separations to non-employment.

    The inference that a separation to employment was more likely a voluntary move on the

part of a worker, while a separation to a full quarter of non-employment was more likely

a layo, is imperfect in that this mapping likely varies across rms and over the business

cycle.     For example, there is some evidence that monthly job nding rates are lower for

skilled workers, likely because they have higher returns to search.                Thus a skilled worker

might be more likely observed without pay for a full quarter following a layo. Workers laid

o from a low-paying rm may not show up as a separation to non-employment if they nd

another bad job quickly. Thus the separations-to-employment rate might include more layos

at low-paying rms, especially in downturns. However, we nd an overall large                    decline   in

separations-to-employment in the lowest paying rms. Any such misclassication of layos,

which would imply an increase in separations-to-employment in a downturn (when rms lay
                                                                              37
o more workers) is clearly not large enough to oset this decline.

    Next, we examine hire rates. From table 4, column IV, hires from employment decline by

most at the lowest paying rms (the rst and second quintiles). Impacts are about 20-40%

smaller in magnitude for the highest paying rms. Once converting to elasticities, however,

  36 One  exception is shown in column VI of appendix table 4, where rms are categorized by AKM xed
eects. Here there are no systematic impacts on the separations-to-nonemployment margin and across
categories, rms do not signicantly dier from each other.
   37 A similar problem is generated by the fact that we have only a subset of U.S. states. If a worker moves
to a state outside this database, that will be classied as a move to non-employment. Since higher skilled
workers are more likely to move in response to local labor market conditions (Wozniak 2010), this bias might
generate too many separations-to-non-employment from high-paying rms to the extent that they likely
employ higher skilled workers. This could explain why the separation-to-non-employment results does not
hold for rm xed eects. Hyatt et al. (2014) and Hyatt and Henderson (2012) go into more detail on this
issue. They point out that the inclusion of New York and Ohio into the LEHD in 2000 renders this problem
almost moot. We also point out that this nding is secondary and that the main margin of interest is the
dierential impact on voluntary separations.

                                                     21
we see the eects are roughly similar across groups.              This implies that both low-paying

and high-paying rms experience large declines in hires that are likely to be from poaching.

The poaching model predicts this eect primarily for high-paying rms (#4). However, a

natural interpretation for the decline among low-paying rms that is beyond the scope of the

poaching model is the following. After a large decline in voluntary quits, low-paying rms

respond with a commensurate decline in hires, targeting roughly the same size workforce.

It is plausible, then, that a reduction in poaching in a downturn drives the impact on the

hires-from-employment rate at high-paying rms, while a response to a reduction in attrition

drives that at lower-paying rms. The latter eect is beyond the scope of the poaching model.

   We also nd that impacts on hires from non-employment (column V) are pretty small,

and even slightly positive for the highest-paying rms, though the latter are only marginally

signicant.    Figure 4 decomposes the hire rate into these two components, showing the

total impact of a 1 ppt increase in the state unemployment rate on hires from employment

(long-dash red) and non-employment (short-dash red). This decomposition mirrors that for

separation rates. The level impact of the hire rate eect is driven primarily by the impact

on hires to employment, where the eects of the unemployment rate are most negative for

the lowest paying rms.

   We therefore nd strong support for the 4 predictions of the poaching model here. As

we noted, any bias from our mismeasuring voluntary quits likely works against our ndings.

However, as we pointed out, prediction #3 (that high-paying rms make relatively more

layos in a downturn) is also consistent with at least two alternative explanations:            that

high-paying rms have dierentially more sensitive product demand cyclicality or have more

diculty adjusting pay downwards. We explore these next.



5.2      Cyclicality of Product Demand

To investigate dierential product demand cyclicality, we need information on rm perfor-

mance other than employment changes. The LEHD has a measure of revenue at the rm level

but it is unreliable. Instead, we turn to Compustat North America by Standard & Poors,
                                                           38
the most complete database of U.S. accounting data.              Compustat has reliable balance sheet

data for publicly-traded rms. We can therefore ask whether fundamental accounting data

are more sensitive to the business cycle at high-quality rms, among those that are publicly

traded.

   The disadvantage of Compustat data is that it is made up of publicly traded rms, all

of whom may be considered reasonably high-quality.               The low-paying rms in Compustat

may be a poor representation of low-paying rms in the LEHD and the economy as a whole.

We therefore rst present evidence on whether the patterns presented above that exist in

the LEHD also exist in Compustat rms.            Though Compustat does not have comparable

 38 We   obtain these data via Wharton Research Data Services.
                                                   22
earnings or gross worker ows data, it does have annual employment.                      We can therefore
                                                                                            39
perform our net growth rate analysis using rm size as a proxy for rm pay.

    We dene size based on average employment in the rm over its lifetime in Compustat

(analogous to our pay measure). We then divide rms by size quintile, where the cut points
                        40
are within industry.         Figure 5 presents growth rates for the smallest and largest quintiles
                                                                                           41
and the dierential rate, by year, analogous to those presented in gure 2.                      The national

unemployment rate is also shown (red dashed line).               From the left panel, the larger rms

(light line) experience greater amplitudes in growth rates corresponding to business cycle

uctuations, compared to the smaller rms (dark line). From the right panel, the dierential

growth rate very closely tracks the unemployment rate; when the unemployment rate in-

creases, small rms grow relative to large rms, and vice versa when the unemployment rate

decreases. Figure 5 thus shows that even among rms within Compustat, all of whom must

be reasonably high quality, the same basic dynamics hold. We hope, then, that analyzing

the balance sheet data in Compustat can tell us something about the nancial pressures
                                                                   42
high- and low-paying rms face over the business cycle.

    We use the rate of change of quarterly revenue as a proxy for a rm's incentive to

hire. Prot maximizing rms will set employment such that marginal cost equals marginal

revenue product.       Presumably rms with more cyclical product demand will experience

accompanying revenue declines. We link the Compustat revenue change data to the LEHD

by aggregating quarterly revenue change to the three-digit NAICS level. This allows us to ask

whether LEHD pay quintiles are made up of rms in sub-sectors which typically experience
                                                                                  43
more or less business cycle volatility, as measured by Compustat.                      Figure 6 plots both

percent revenue changes for rms in the lowest and highest quintiles (left panel), as well as

the dierential revenue change (right panel), analogous to the earlier gures. Reassuringly,

revenue change has a strongly cyclical pattern, falling in recessions and rising in booms. Both

panels, however, show little dierence across low- and high-paying rms over the business

cycle. High-paying rms experienced a slightly larger decline in revenue change during the

Great Recession, as can be seen in the left panel where the gray line declines by more than

the dark line in 2009, and in the right panel where the dierential rate spikes up in 2009.

However, this pattern is not systematic over the time period as a whole. For example, in the

  39 Size is a common proxy for pay since the two variables are highly correlated. Moscarini Postel-Vinay
(2012) show in a large number of countries that small rms grow relative to large rms in slack labor markets,
while the opposite is true in tight labor markets.
  40 Since most rms in Compustat have a larger, national presence, we do not use geographic location
information.
  41 The unltered series is clearer so we present that one, and of course the annual data do not need seasonal
adjustments.
  42 Though not shown here, in regression analysis, the relationship between net employment changes and
the national unemployment rate is statistically signicantly larger in magnitude (more negative) at rms in
the largest size quintile compared to the smallest.
  43 We are not permitted to link Compustat data to the LEHD at the rm level because of condentiality
concerns.

2001 recession, the dierential rate declined meaning that low-paying rms took a relatively

bigger hit to revenue. This gure is therefore inconsistent with the notion that high-paying

rms are more sensitive to the business cycle.

       Based on the evidence presented here, we think it unlikely that dierential business cycle

sensitivity in the product market is driving our results.             The sub-sectors where low- and

high-paying rms are typically found do not experience dierential sensitivities, as reported

by Compustat. Though we should caution that this exercise needs to be taken with a grain

of salt, since it is based on an unrepresentative set of rms.



5.3         Downward earnings rigidities

We investigate downward earnings rigidities in the LEHD using total quarterly earnings for

a worker from a given rm. To be clear, this is not the typical measure used in papers on

wage rigidities, which focus on hourly rates of pay.              Instead, this measure incorporates a

number of dimensions along which rms can adjust labor costs besides lowering the base

rate of pay, for example hours, overtime and bonuses. We thus ask whether rms seem to

have dierential abilities to cut on their labor bill (without laying workers o ) and whether

this varies with the business cycle.      A nding that high-paying rms have more diculty

cutting pay in downturns could explain their relative increase in layos and more cyclically

sensitive growth rates. Also, the fact the high-paying rms continue to hire relatively more

than low-paying rms, despite an increase in layos, is consistent with the literature showing

that starting wages are more pro-cyclical than incumbent wages (Martins, Solon and Thomas

2010).

       To test this, we follow a similar methodology to Dickens et al.               (2007).   We measure
                                                                         44
nominal annual pay changes in earnings,        âpit , for job stayers.        For a rm, f , in time period
t,   we then estimate the nominal pay rigidity as per equation 3. That is,              for a rm with N

workers who have a valid pay change measure, we take the number whose annual pay change

was equal to     0   and divide that by the number whose pay change was less than or equal to

0.    In practice, we dene a pay change to be equal to      0    if it is within   Â±1%,   to allow for some

noise, and results are robust to larger bounds.

       This measure proxies for the following: Among workers who were at risk of receiving a

     44 A
        worker must have 10 continuous quarters of earnings to be included in the sample. At the quarterly
level, issues arise such as dierences in the number of pay cycles within a quarter that vary across rm
and across calendar year. To avoid additional noisiness, we measure annual pay changes. We also trim
the distribution of earnings changes to those who had more than Â±50% changes, since these presumably
represent errors in reporting.

nominal pay decrease, what share did NOT receive one? We nd that on average over our

time period, this share is roughly     0.25.   We then average these within our rm-pay buckets,

weighting by average employment at a given date, to gain a sense of whether rms of varying

quality experience dierential pay rigidities over the business cycle.

   Figure 7 plots these estimates over time for rms in the lowest pay quintile (dark line),

and rms in the highest pay quintile (light line line) in the left panel and the dierential

rate in the right panel, along with the unemployment rate.             As can be seen, pay rigidity
                                                                          45
has a cyclical pattern, falling in recessions and rising in booms.             However, the left panel

very clearly shows that high-paying rms have a much larger drop in rigidities in recessions

and a larger increase in booms. The dierential rate, for the most part, moves opposite the

unemployment rate, meaning that low-paying rms become relatively less rigid in booms

and relatively more rigid in busts.

   We therefore nd that high-paying rms are relatively more likely to reduce pay of in-

cumbents at the margin in a downturn. It seems then unlikely that an inability to adjust

pay drives the relative increase in layos at high-paying rms.            However, we caution that

our measure is selected in that we can only estimate rigidities for stayers at a rm. We have

already shown that high- and low-paying rms dier in their gross separation rates over the

business cycle. For example, a high-paying rm might lay o workers whose pay cannot be

adjusted, leaving only those whose pay can be adjusted. However, the evidence presented

here suggests that high-paying rms are able to adjust labor costs in recessions, relative

to low-paying rms, by cutting earnings. Therefore, we do not believe dierential earnings

rigidities can be driving our results.



5.4        Alternative explanations

Managerial practices at high- and low-paying rms surely dier along a variety of dimensions.

Dierences might arise if low-paying rms are always closer to the margin of survival. For

example, the pit stop model of management (Koenders and Rogerson 2005) says that in

booms managers are focused on growth and in busts must focus on eciency and cut workers.

Given positive correlations between pay, productivity, and size, it could be that low-paying

rms are always closer to the margin of survival and therefore always focused on eciency.

This would result in a relatively greater need for high-paying rms to lay o workers in

downturns.     However, such a theory suggests the counter-intuitive notion that low-paying

rms manage more eciently.          This seems on the surface unlikely, given that low-paying

rms are on average smaller, have higher churn, and are probably less productive.

   In contrast, one might suppose that given their lower productivity, smaller size, and likely

lower probability of survival, low-paying rms manage ineciently. While high-paying rms

  45 Thedata show rigidity for pay changes that occur over the next year. Thus the cyclical pattern looks
as though it leads the recession bars.

                                                   25
lay o workers in economic downturns, low-paying rms do less of this, even though they

should. This seems unlikely for a couple of reasons. First, such poor management should

result in relatively more rm deaths in bad times at low-paying rms.                   Our employment

measures include rm deaths yet we still nd that on average, low-paying rms grow relative

to high-paying rms in busts, including and despite any shrinkage from rm deaths. Second,

reinspecting gure 4, we note the         larger adjustment in gross ows at low-quality rms.        Faced

with a large decline in voluntary quits, low-paying rms respond with a commensurate decline

in hiring. This suggests that low-paying rms do respond to their business environment and
                                            46
target a particular sized workforce.

     Finally, we point out that a simple compensating dierentials framework can yield our

results. In equilibrium, volatile jobs need to be higher paying in order to make the marginal

worker indierent between working there and a low-paying job with stable employment.

However, this is also on the surface at odds with some evidence in the data. From table 1,

the lowest paying rms have 20% turnover each period, while the highest paying rms have

half that.     They also have larger rates of separation-to-non-employment, a more negative

risk. Thus the lower paying jobs are on average much more unstable.

     We therefore conclude that the body of evidence presented in sections 4 and 5 is most

consistent with the Moscarini Postel-Vinay (2013) poaching model. This is because we nd

support for all four predictions mentioned above, no support for dierential product market

cyclicality or earnings rigidities, and these nal alternative explanations seem unlikely. In

other words, a partial collapse of the job ladder in downturns leaves workers at the bottom

of the job ladder stuck when they otherwise would have liked to move up the ladder. These

ndings have important implications for the impacts of recessions on workers' careers, which

we explore next.




6       Impacts on the job ladder

In this section we use data on individual workers and their transitions across rms to quantify

the eect of the business cycle on the job ladder, established above, for workers at various

starting points and how this impacts careers. We rst examine the impacts on mobility for

incumbent workers. We then estimate impacts for new job matches in light of the fact that

job seekers seem to be particularly scarred by recessions.



6.1       All Workers

In this subsection, we assess the level of upward mobility as a function of starting pay quintile

and how this changes over the business cycle. Table 5 reports estimated transition matrices

    46 We also point out that this reduction in hires by low-paying rms,
                                                                      which osets any impact from declining
poaching at high-paying rms, is necessary to rationalize the nding that revenue does not vary dierentially
over the business cycle.

across rm pay quintiles over one quarter. We t eects for a boom (left panel) and a bust
                                                            47
(right panel) based on ordered logit regressions.

     Focusing rst on a boom and for workers who were in the lowest quintile in                   t   (left panel,

rst column), we estimate that 89.9% of these workers remain in the lowest paying rms in

t+1       (this could be their rm in     t   or a dierent rm in the same pay quintile). This means

that 10.1% move up the job ladder, with the vast majority moving up only one rung. One

way to quantify the magnitude of this chance of upgrading is to assign average pay to each

quintile (from table 1) and predict what kind of rm the average worker will be in one quarter

later. This is shown in the bottom row. Those beginning in the lowest quintile in                       t   will on

average be at a rm whose average pay is $1,936 in               t + 1.   This represents 5% advancement

above their starting point which was $1,842 (average pay at the lowest quintile).

     Workers starting at higher rungs of the ladder could upgrade, downgrade or stay put. For

example at the second rung workers stay in their current rung 72% of the time, and upgrade

or downgrade with roughly equally probabilities, around 14%. Workers in the highest rung

in   t   are most likely to survive in their current rung, at 94%.

     The right panel reports what our estimates imply for these transition probabilities in a

bust. Transitions for incumbents in rungs 2-4 are essentially unaected by the bust, while

workers in the top rung in        t   are a bit less likely to hold onto their position until         t + 1.   The

largest impacts are on workers in the lowest paying rms. Only 8% of these workers upgrade

rms over the quarter, one-fth fewer than in a boom.                     In   t+1   these workers have only

upgraded to a rm paying $1,917/month, $19 less (or a 20% smaller expected advancement)

than in a boom.

     In this paper, we establish a partial collapse of the job ladder in a downturn. We show

that for workers unlucky enough to be at the bottom of the ladder at that point, the impacts

are large. They can expect to achieve only 80% of the advancement over the next quarter

than would be expected in boom times. This back of the envelope calculation is instructive

because it allows us to quantify eects based solely on the the rm-level dynamics established

in this paper and strips away any pay dynamics for individual workers.                        Consistent with

sections 4 and 5, we nd a substantial breakdown of the job ladder for workers in the lowest

rung, as well as a small loss of position for workers in the highest rung, and not much change
                             48
for those in the middle.
   47 We estimate ordered logits of pay quintile in t + 1 on pay quintile in t, the unemployment rate and
interactions for individuals who are employed in both t and t + 1. We report regression coecients for several
specications in appendix table 7. We nd that a higher unemployment rate in t signicantly reduces the
likelihood of being in a higher pay quintile in t + 1, but only for workers in the lowest quintile in t. The tted
transition matrices in table 5 use coecients from column IV of appendix table 7 and a 4.2% unemployment
rate for a boom and 10.4% unemployment rate for a bust.
   48 It is worth pointing out that these results are selected since they restrict to those working in t + 1.
Though not shown, we estimate that a higher unemployment rate in t reduces the probability of working
in t + 1, but more so for workers at the top of the job ladder in t. Our estimates imply that in the Great
Recession, workers in the top rungs of the ladder had a 2 ppt increased probability of transitioning to non-
employment in the next quarter, while workers in the bottom rung were unaected. Thus table 5 cannot
                                                       27
6.2      New Entrants

The relative advantage low-paying rms retain in a downturn might help to explain why the

two groups mentioned in the introduction, recent college graduates and those displaced from

a job where they had high tenure, face substantial earnings losses when these events occur
                 49
in a downturn.        Our estimates imply that the distribution of jobs shifts towards the lower

paying rms in a downturn and that these jobs become stickier. How much of the long-term

earnings losses for each of the groups mentioned above can be accounted for by this shift in

the distribution of jobs and a short-term break down of the job ladder?

    We rst ask how the distribution of job matches varies over the business cycle. Table 6

reports implied distributions of new job matches across rm pay quintiles for a boom and
                                                               50
a bust and is based on an ordered logit regression.                 In a boom (rst column), 42.2% of

new matches are to the lowest paying rms. These rms are overrepresented in job starts

compared to the stock of workers (which is by construction evenly distributed across rm

type).   This is because of the especially high churn rates at the lowest paying rms.                   In

contrast only 4.6% of new matches are to the highest paying quintile.                   The bottom row

shows that the average worker matching to a rm in a boom is at a rm paying $2,782, on

average. This is lower than the $3,811 average for the stock of workers.

    In a bust (second column), the rm quality distribution shifts downward. Workers are

about 4 ppts more likely to match to the lowest paying rms and about a point less likely

to match to each of the higher quintiles.         This amounts to a nearly $90 reduction in rm

quality (average rm pay for the average matching worker) or 3% less than those matching

in booms. Of course this exercise is merely descriptive in the sense that we have not adjusted

for ability dierences across those matching in booms versus busts. There could be negative

selection of workers matching to rms in recessions, since those with a good current position

stay put (see Kahn (2013) for evidence on this). However, it is also at least consistent with

the relative shift of jobs towards lower paying rms, demonstrated above.

    Next, table 7 helps us understand whether workers are dierentially likely to upgrade

from their initial match, as a function of the economy at the time of that match. We use an

ordered logit to predict for workers matching in         t,   rm quality in   t+3   as a function of rm

fully quantify the regressive eects of a recession on a worker's position when starting at higher rungs.
  49 Davis and von Wachter (2011) estimate that the impact of job displacement for those with at least 3
years of tenure is a 20% drop in the present discounted value of lifetime earnings, for those displaced in
a recession. The impact for those displaced in a boom is a 12% drop. Altonji, Kahn, and Speer (2014)
estimate that those graduating from college into a large recession in the U.S. experience an average drop in
annual earnings of roughly 2% per year over the rst decade of a career, and similar impacts on wage rates.
Oreopoulos, von Wachter and Heisz (2012) nd similar losses in Canada and show they manifest through
initial matches to worse (smaller) rms.
  50 We estimate ordered logits of rm pay quintile on the unemployment rate and various controls among
workers who started a job in t. Appendix table 8 reports regression results for several specications. The
tted distributions in table 5 use coecients from column IV of appendix table 8 and a 4.2% unemployment
rate for a boom and 10.4% unemployment rate for a bust.

                                                    28
quality in   t and the unemployment rate.51       Workers who match to the lowest ranked rms in

a boom (left panel, rst column) do tend to upgrade in the rst year following the match.

Only 62.5% of these workers remain in a low paying rm, while a quarter have upgraded to

the 2nd pay quintile and more than 10% have actually moved up to an even higher quintile.

On average, a worker matching to the lowest paying rms in a boom is at a rm whose

average pay is $2,346 three quarters later. This is a $500 advancement above the average

pay at the lowest paying rms ($1,842) or 27%. Workers starting out in higher rungs are also

slightly more likely to hold their position or advance, than to backslide. For example, 27%

of workers matching to the 3rd quintile remain at that quintile, while another 27% advance

to the 4th or 5th quintiles. Among those matching to the highest paying rms, 65% retain

their position 3 quarters later, when matching in a boom. However, a quarter slide back to

the 4th quintile and 10% slide back further than that.

    For those matching in a bust, these gures look fairly similar, with some important

dierences.    Above, we estimated that in busts there is a substantial decline in exits-to-

employment from the lowest paying rms. This eect means that workers matching to the

lowest paying rms in a bust will probably be less likely to upgrade, initially. Indeed, the

right panel of table 7 shows that 63.8% of those matching to the lowest paying rms in a

bust retain their position; thus only 36.2% advance, 1.4 ppts less than for those matching

in a boom. In dollar terms, the average worker moves to a rm whose average pay is $2,325

when matching in a bust, or $20 less advancement (4.2%) than those matching in a boom.

    Above, we also estimated that the highest paying rms are more likely to make layos

(i.e., separations to non-employment) in a bust. From table 7, it looks as though these layos

hit new entrants especially hard. Workers matching to a top paying rm in a bust are far

less likely to maintain their position, 57.5%, compared to 65% in a boom. In dollar terms,

this amounts to a $214 lower average rm pay in           t + 3.   It is thus much worse to match to a

high-paying rm in a bust than a boom. Perhaps these rms look to clean out some of their

incumbent workforce in a bust, but still need some temporary, lower skilled workers, to eke

out their production needs.

    Workers matching to rms in the middle of the pay distribution do not see much of a

change in mobility when matching in a bust compared to a boom.

    Overall, how do workers fare when matching to a rm in a bust compared to a boom? If

we assume the matching probability does not change over the business cycle (that is, ignore

the results from table 6), and instead t the boom match probabilities, we get that the

average worker is at a rm paying $2,946 3 quarters later, if matching to a boom, and only

   51 Regression results are reported in appendix table 9. Estimates in table 7 come from column IV. We
nd that the unemployment rate at time of match is negatively related to rm quintile 3 quarters later,
for workers matching to the lowest quintile (the omitted category). This eect is fully oset for workers
matching to the 2nd and 3rd quintiles, and halfway oset for those matching to the 4th quintile. The eect
is exacerbated for those matching to the highest quintile in t, and in total is 5 times larger than the base

$2,929 if matching in a bust.    These are both advancements relative to the initial match,

which we reported above as $2,782 in a boom. This nearly $20 dierence or 10% smaller

advancement for those matching in a bust is attributed solely to the reduced probability of

upgrading after matching. If we also factor in that workers are more likely to match to low

paying rms in a recession, we get the combined eect. The average worker, 3 quarters later,

is at a rm paying on average $2,871. Thus the full eect of matching in a bust, compared

to a boom, is a $75 lower average rm quality 3 quarters later. This is 2.6% of the average

earnings in   t+3   for someone matching in   t   in a boom, or half of their typical advancement.

    The most comprehensive analysis of graduating from college in a downturn in the U.S.

(Altonji, Kahn, and Speer (2015)) nds that in the rst year after graduation earnings losses

total roughly 10% and converge to 4% by 3 years out. Our back-of-the-envelope calculation

shows that workers matching in a bust spend their rst year at rms paying 2.6% less than

those matching in a boom.      Thus the job ladder dynamics established in this paper can

account for nearly a third of the initial earning losses and half of the persistent earnings

losses over an early career for those graduating in a bust compared to a boom.

    The same disclaimer on causality applies here. However, we nd these results interesting,

consistent with the reduction in voluntary mobility estimated above, and useful for consid-

ering the possible magnitudes the dynamics presented above can have in terms of impacts

on workers and the job ladder.




7     Conclusion

In this paper, we use employer-employee matched U.S. data to study net and gross worker

ows over the business cycle as a function of rm pay.            We nd that low-paying rms

fare relatively better in downturns; their growth rates are unaected by the business cycle.

The evidence suggests that in normal times, low-paying rms suer from a large worker

separation rate, and therefore also do a lot of replacement hiring. In bad times, separations

decline substantially at these rms, especially for those that look voluntary, and they aim

for a commensurate reduction in hires. This keeps the growth rate relatively constant over

the business cycle.    Higher paying rms experience less of an impact on their separations

to employment but still a large reduction in hires. The highest paying rms also increase

separations to non-employment, which most likely represent layos. As we have said, these

ndings are consistent with the Moscarini Postel-Vinay (2013) poaching model, though we

cannot completely rule out a small role for dierential sensitivity to the business cycle driven

by consumer demand.

    While previous research has emphasized that match quality may decline in recessions

due to a lack of workforce reallocation (Barlevy termed this the sullying eect of recessions

in his 2002 paper), we provide evidence of an additional sullying eect. The types of jobs

workers get stuck in are more likely to be low quality. Our results suggest that the reduced
                                                   30
ability to move on to better matches caused by a recession has a greater impact on workers in

low-quality rms compared to those in high-quality rms. We estimate that a large recession

reduces the probability of advancing out of the lowest paying rms by 20%.

   These results also have important implications for the literature on the dierential impact

of recessions on workers.    The literature has shown that entering the labor market in a

recession (Kahn (2010), Oreopoulos, von Wachter and Heisz (2012), Altonji, Kahn and Speer

(2014)) and being displaced from a long-term job in a recession (Davis and von Wachter 2010)

each have particularly long-lasting, negative earnings impacts. Both groups were forced to

search for, and likely accept, a job in a downturn. Our results indicate that workers matching

in recessions are more likely to go to a low-paying rm, and more likely to stay there once

matched. These eects combine to an estimated 2.6% drop in average rm quality a year

after matching, for those matching in a recession compared to a boom, or $75/month lower

average rm pay. These workers thus lose out on roughly half of the advancement made by

workers matching in a boom. Our estimates are based solely on typical pay in these rms,

and do not reect any heterogeneity within rm.      Also, they do not pick up any scarring

eects from spending time at a low-paying rm. These could include both how a worker is

perceived to potential employers, but also impacts on human capital accumulation and the

development of networks. These impacts could be large and long-lasting.

Notes: Regressions weighted by average employment over the quarter and control for quintile fixed effects, churn and size controls, and state and twoâdigit NAICS industry fixed effects. Unless
otherwise specified, quintiles are obtained by averaging quarterly pay over the lifetime of the firm and fitting into the twoâdigit NAICS industryâstate distribution weighted by employment.
Standard errors in brackets are clustered at the state level. Coefficients from panel A are converted to elasticities in panel B by adding the main effect of U to the relevant interaction term then
multiplying and dividing by the quintileâspecific average state unemployment rate and dependent variable, respectively. Column III estimates separate regressions for each quintile to allow all
control variables to interact with quintile. Coeffients are then the total impact of the unemployment rate on the dependent variable (not a main effect and interactions). In column IV, quintiles are
defined based on the overall disitribution of workers, not the stateâindustry distribution. Column V excludes firms with fewer than 50 employees and uses this sample to generate quintile cutpoints.
Column VI uses firm fixed effects instead of average firm pay (see text). In Column VII nonâprimary jobs (which have been excluded from the main analysis) are included.
