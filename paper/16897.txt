Workday, Holiday and Calendar Adjustment with 21st Century Data: Monthly Aggregates
from Daily Diesel Fuel Purchases
Edward E. Leamer
NBER Working Paper No. 16897
March 2011
JEL No. C81

                                              ABSTRACT

This paper uses a Ceridian transaction-by-transaction data set on purchases of diesel fuel by over-the-road
truckers to form a monthly diesel volume purchase index from 1999 to 2011, purged of weekday, holiday
and calendar effects. These high-frequency data support a new and improved set of options to correct
for (1) the variability in the weekday composition of months and (2) the drift of holiday effects between
months. With only monthly data, Census seasonal adjustment methods are forced to make inferences
about the effects of both weekday composition and holiday drift. With daily data, these can be directly
observed, and removed from the data, if the patterns repeat. But the drift of holiday effects between
December and January resists statistical treatment, leaving the December/January comparison the
most noisy in a seasonally adjusted monthly series. This problem, and other issues of holiday drift,
can be treated with an overhaul of the calendar to put all holidays but Easter firmly in one month or
another. The bottom line here is that e-recording of transactions offers a new set of opportunities for
studying the health of Main Street.

Introduction
Many of the data sets that economists work with are based on voluntary after-the-fact
surveys conducted by trade groups and government agencies. Others are based on
involuntary after-the-fact “surveys” conducted by the IRS and other tax-collecting
agencies. The incentives for timeliness and accuracy are mixed, to say the least.

For items like retail sales and GDP, which are composed of individual transactions but
treated by economists as “flows” per unit of time, the survey respondents are usually
asked to perform the time aggregation themselves, reporting sales for a month or a
quarter rather than individual transactions.

That’s 20th Century data collection operating at a speed and accuracy worse than the US
Postal Service. The 21st Century recording and communication technologies in principle
allow each transaction to be reported instantaneously, something which is very familiar
on Wall Street but less familiar on Main Street. Instantaneous recording of transactions
creates new challenges and new opportunities for time series analysis designed to filter
the noise from the signal, and thus to find the best possible answer to questions such as:
How healthy was the economy?

I report here an analysis of diesel fuel purchases at 7,000 truck stops all over the United
States recorded on a Ceridian transaction dataset. Large and small trucking firms
employ Ceridian to provide credit cards to their employees, allowing the purchase of
diesel fuel and other items, subject to the limits selected by the employer. Within a half-
second after a credit card is swiped to pay for diesel fuel by over-the-road truckers, the
transaction is recorded on Ceridian computers in Nashville, Tennessee.1

These transactions occur at distinct points in time but also at distinct points in space.
The picture below locates the volume of diesel fuel purchases in the circles with area
proportional to volume on a US map that includes the US Interstates. It is this image
that led to the naming of the index of diesel fuel purchases: The Ceridian-UCLA Pulse of
Commerce Index. The Interstates that crisscross the country are the arteries of the
system and the product carried by trucks through those arteries are the life-blood of the
system. Without the movement of goods, the economy “dies.” Details can be found at
www.ceridianindex.com.

  Though this is not a scientifically designed random sample, I am told that Ceridian has a
large enough market share to be “representative,” but in any case concerns about
nonrepresentativeness are temporarily put aside as we focus here on seasonal and other
related adjustments.


                                                                                         2
Since these transactions are sprinkled along the Interstates that crisscross the country, it is
possible to zoom in on the manufacturing centers of the Midwest, or the ports on the East
and West and Gulf Coasts, or on the Northeast when a snowstorm hits, and so on. While
these data are capable of answering a wide variety of regional questions, in this
manuscript I focus exclusively on the US overall and exclusively on US monthly
aggregates built from daily data. I thus take the basic data to be daily aggregates of
transactions for the US overall, and I use these daily data to improve upon the Census
methods for removing “weekday” “holiday” and “calendar” effects from monthly
aggregates. I realize that regional correlations could also play a role in filtering the noise
from the monthly US aggregate. For example, there may be a different meaning when all
regions experience the same change as opposed to a change in the US aggregate that is
mostly due to the data from a single region. This is certainly something that should be
explored, but it opens up a whole new set of challenges and opportunities in determining
the best possible regional aggregates from data that are collected by position (latitude and
longitude). Is there one truck stop out there that is the bellweather for the US economy?
Is there one Interstate that is the critical artery? Where is the heart of America? Are
there veins with empty trucks going back to load up again?

In addition to the decision to aggregate the transactions geographically, I also somewhat
arbitrarily choose the task of creating monthly aggregates from daily aggregates. Why
months, and why days? The survey methods traditionally used to collect economic data
have probably influenced the choice of, for example, monthly frequencies for industrial
production and quarterly frequencies for GDP, but with transaction-based data we are
free to use any frequency that best fits our needs. I take the target to be monthly
aggregates because of a personal judgment that the health of the economy changes slowly
enough that variability of diesel fuel purchases within a month is mostly noise, and not


                                                                                             3
useful for measuring economic illnesses. I take the daily aggregates to be the building
blocks for forming monthly aggregates because of a personal judgment that variability
within a day is not likely to be material to answering the question: how healthy was the
economy last month? Neither of these judgments is a sure thing. It could be that weekly
or bi-weekly reports would be better than monthly reports, for example, when the end of
a month looks better than the beginning of a month, and it possible, but I think very
unlikely, that unusual transactions within a day could signal a change in the healthiness
of the economy.

The predictable changes between months in most economic time series is what allows
calendar adjustment of monthly data, but calendar adjustment of weekly data or daily
data remains an unsolved problem, the first step of which is to determine the day or week
in one year that are the same as a day or week in other years.2 Both disaggregation by
time (more frequent than monthly) as well as disaggregation by space (regional groups)
raise interesting but difficult unsolved problems that deserve attention and that could be
explored with this Ceridian dataset, but these are beyond the scope of the present paper,
which is targeted solely on creating monthly national aggregates.

The word “weekday” in the title of this paper refers to the fact that the volume of diesel
transactions varies by day of week, more on weekdays and less on weekends Except for
the 28 day (4-week) Februaries which have four of each weekday, the weekday
composition of each month varies from year to year, causing problems for simple
methods of calendar adjustment such as removal of monthly means, which adjusts for the
fact that some months have 31 days and others have 30, but does not adjust for the
variable number of weekends in any given month, depending, for example, on whether
the first of the month is a Monday instead of a Saturday or Sunday. There is however a
substantial though not well-known literature on this problem supported by the Census
Bureau and already embedded as seasonal adjustment options in many computer
packages under the title of “trading day” adjustment. The words “trading day” suggests
some kind of Wall Street trading phenomenon and I think a better label is “weekday”
effect. Speaking of language, for obvious reasons I will refer to “calendar” adjustment,
not “seasonal” adjustment. There is hope with daily data actually to do seasonal
adjustment, for example, allowing for the fact that as far as trucking is concerned the
summer vacations begin the week after the 4th of July and ends in mid August. That’s a
season.

The literature on “trading day” adjustments dates at least to Bell and Hilmer(1983).
With only monthly data these weekday effects must be inferred from unusual movements
in the monthly data that are correlated with weekday composition. In contrast, the
weekday effect is directly observed from our daily data and we should be able to do
better than Census methods. One of the surprises for me discussed below is how well the
Census has done in creating methods that accurately infer the weekday effect from the
monthly diesel data, in the sense that the Census treatment for weekdays produces

corrections to the monthly aggregates that are very similar to corrections based on the
daily data.

After weekday variability it is holidays that have the most pronounced effect on sales of
diesel fuel. The Census X12 seasonal adjustment allows corrections for Easter, Labor
Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas given an assumption of the distribution of the effect
around the holiday. The daily trucking data indicate very substantial declines of sales
both before and after these holidays but also around Memorial Day, the 4th of July and
New Years. If these holiday-affected patterns of sales were confined to a single month or
divided between two months the same way every year, then calendar adjustment of
monthly data would automatically correct for the holiday. With the exception of
Thanksgiving, every one of these holidays divides its impact on diesel fuel purchases
between two different months in a way that varies from year to year, and holiday
adjustment is needed in addition to calendar adjustment.

Although Census methods for inferring workday adjustments from monthly data works
well, the same methods do not work well for inferring holiday adjustments. Our diesel
data set extends for 145 months from 1999m01 to 2011m01. This turns out to be an
adequate number of observations for inferring the weekday corrections, but for each
holiday effect there are only 12 observations, which is not nearly enough to estimate the 7
or more parameters that describe the abnormal daily pattern of sales on and around each
holiday. As it turns out, the problem is even greater than Census supposes, because the
pattern of holiday effects depends on the weekday on which a holiday falls. This causes
special problems for the June to July transitions which are affected by weekday of the 4th
of July and for the December to January transitions which are affected by the weekday of
New Years. Correction for the abnormalities in the data associated with these and other
holidays substantially reduces the apparent noise in the diesel data, providing a more
accurate indicator of the month-to-month changes in trucking.

Beyond the seasonal adjustment issues, a goal of this paper is to describe important
features of the data set, including the very substantial variability by workday, the declines
during the holidays, and also outliers that suggest weather or other events, including 9/11,
that have affected the pattern of shipping. In that spirit, the first section of this paper
offers a “first look at the data.” Section 2 mines the daily data to determine the pattern
of sales over the workweek – twice as much on Wednesday than on Saturday. Section 3
discusses regression methods for inferring the pattern of sales around the holidays.
Section 4 describes the workday and holiday adjusted monthly index based on the daily
data and compares it with Census methods applied to unadjusted monthly aggregates. It
turns out that the daily data allow important holiday adjustments that the Census methods
to not capture.

Last, in section 5, I offer the suggestion that all these problems with holidays would
disappear if we adopted a different calendar with December extended into January to
keep the New Years effect strictly in the December data, and with the first week of June
given to May to keep the Memorial Day effect strictly in May, and with the end of June
given to July, to keep the July 4th effect strictly in July, and with the last days of August



                                                                                                5
moved to September to keep the Labor Day effect strictly in September. A horse race
between an index based on this new calendar and the best monthly index from the daily
data doesn’t produce a clear winner. Parenthetically, I bring to your attention the
possibility of a more radical revision of the calendar designed to minimize the
information loss caused by the time aggregation. The goal might be to predict the next
month’s daily average given data on previous months’ daily averages, with the 12 months
designed to accomplish this with the highest level of average accuracy, given the
statistical properties of the daily data. This would produce longer months when little is
happening and shorter months where significant changes in the economy are occurring.

Bottom line here: If you desire to know how healthy trucking is at any point in time, it is
essential to get the workday and holiday adjustments right, and the daily data are very
valuable in accomplishing that task. And you should want to know how healthy trucking
is. Healthy trucking is an essential symptom of a healthy modern economy, and the
Ceridian-UCLA Pulse of Commerce helps track and forecast a number of other important
monthly indicators including industrial production. Since trucking is a symptom of
“inventories in motion” the PCI tracks and forecasts the volatile inventory component of
GDP and also imports. Best of all, the Ceridian data are actual transactions recorded
instantaneously, and all this good stuff is available for immediate gratification – no need
to wait until someone fills in a survey form next month.

1. First Look at the Data
The first step in the analysis is to take a close look at the data to identify what are the
biggest adjustment issues.

Weekday Effect
Daily diesel fuel purchases in 2006 divided by the series maximum which occurred on
March 5, 2008 are illustrated in Figure 1. For economists used to looking at images of
monthly data this is an astonishing display. By far the most salient feature is the
rhythmic swing up and down by 50%, 52 times in 2006. This is the variability within the
week: diesel fuel purchases are twice as high on Wednesday and as on Sunday. This
matters for the monthly data because the number of Sundays (or other days) can vary for
the same month from year to year and cause variability in monthly totals that is not
picked up by seasonal adjustment methods that do not include weekday corrections.

Holiday Effects
After the weekly swings, the next most obvious features of Figure 1 are the extreme dips
that correspond with seven major holidays. Though extreme, these dips are disguised by
the similarly extreme swings in sales over the weekdays. To make the holidays
transparent, Figure 2 illustrates the same 2006 data but with the weekday effect removed
via 7-day averages, each of which includes one and only one of each weekday. Here we
see that the holiday with the greatest effect on diesel fuel purchases is the combined
Christmas/New Years week, with sales about 40% below normal. After that come
Thanksgiving, the 4th of July, Labor Day, Memorial Day and Easter, in that order.

Simple seasonal adjustment can deal with these holiday effects if they are confined to a
single month, or if the effects are divided between months in the same way, from year to
year. Easter is an obvious problem since it varies between March and April. Census
seasonal adjustment routines, X11 and X12, include both weekday and holiday
adjustments. Here is what Census says about the holidays, thinking I suppose of retail
sales, and not necessarily trucking:

           US Census(2009) pages 32-33

           Holiday effects (in a monthly flow series) arise from holidays whose dates vary
           over time if (i) the activity measured by the series regularly increases or decreases
           around the date of the holiday, and (ii) this differentially affects two (or more)
           months depending on the date the holiday occurs each year. (Effects of holidays
           with a fixed date, such as Christmas, are indistinguishable from fixed calendar
           effects.) Easter effects are the most frequently found holiday effects in U.S.
           economic time series, since the date of Easter Sunday varies between March 22
           and April 25. Labor Day and Thanksgiving also are potential, though less
           common, sources of holiday effects.


                                                                                               8
The moving Memorial Day effect
Though Census statisticians have concentrated their attention mostly on Easter, and
somewhat on Labor Day and Thanksgiving, there are similar problems for other holidays
that are sometimes near the transitions between months and sometimes in the middle of a
month. For example Memorial Day has an depressing effect on diesel fuel purchases that
is usually confined to May but leaks into June when the Monday Memorial Day holiday
is the last day of May, as it was in 1999, 2004 and 2010, or next-to-last day, as it was in
2005.

Table 1 indicates dates of Memorial Day for each year in the sample, sorted by the date,
from earliest to latest. It is a late Memorial Day that allows the Memorial Day effect to
leak into June. Figure 3 illustrates seven-day average sales for the four weeks from May
18 until June 14. The timing of these Memorial Day waves coincides exactly with the
timing of Memorial Day reported in Table 1, first 2009, then 2003 and 2008, and so on.
These weekly values bottom out about 15% lower at the minimum around Memorial Day
then at the normal periods a week or two later, or earlier. These minima sometimes occur
in the last week of May and sometimes in the first week of June. The first seven-day
average that is exclusively in June occurs on June 7, which is where to look for a
Memorial Day effect that is leaking into June. This is clearly the case for 1999, 2004 and
2010, the three instances when Memorial Day was Monday, May 31st. The value of this
weekly average is about 3% lower than the subsequent data and the corresponding value
on May 31 (the seven-day average of the last week of May) is about 3% higher. Thus
absent adjustment for the timing of Memorial day, the May data are about 3%/4 = 0.75%
underestimated and the June data are 0.75% overestimated, making the May-June growth
overstated by 1.5%, which is an intolerably large error for a series with average monthly
growth of only 3%/12 = .25% and a standard error of 2.8% after correction for month but
not workdays or holidays.

Easter, the 4th of July, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, and New Years all
need attention too
Easter creates an obvious problem for seasonal adjustment since it is sometimes in March
and sometimes in April. We have just discovered that movement of a holiday within a
month (Memorial Day) creates problems that need treatment also Labor day and
Thanksgiving also drift within their respective months.. Furthermore, the Census
assertion that “Effects of holidays with a fixed date, such as Christmas, are
indistinguishable from fixed seasonal effects” ignores the fact that we will make clear
below that the weekday on which the 1st of January or the 4th of July falls affects the
pattern of sales around these holidays, and the division of sales between
December/January and June/July.




                                                                                                                              10
2. Weekday Adjustments
Census statisticians have devised methods using monthly data to infer the weekday
effects from annual differences in monthly values when these differences are correlated
with the annual changes in the weekday composition of the months. But our daily data
allow us a direct measure of the weekday effect. The workday correction used here is
based on 52-week centered averages for each weekday. Although almost a full year of
data, the holidays included in any 52 week average vary over time and these create
unacceptable jumps in the 52-week average. This is cured by eliminating from the
averages all the major holidays and also days within three of a holiday, thus eliminating
most of the days affected by holidays. There are also some outliers that are great enough
to affect these averages. These outliers are of interest beyond the problems they cause for
workday corrections. We turn first to them.


Non-holiday Daily Outliers
Figure 4 illustrates the gallons data separately for each day of the week, with the seven
major holidays and three days on each side excluded. The shape swept out from 1999 to
2010 by the preponderance of the data is the same for each of the days. Wednesday is
when the diesel fuel purchases are greatest. Sunday has the least gallons purchased.

Although most of these data hug together, there are some extreme outliers for most days
of the week, with sales differing by 10% or more compared with the same day a week
earlier or later. These nonholiday extreme outliers are listed in the table below. We will
return to the issue of outliers after further statistical adjustments.

Weekday Adjustment Factors
The Census weekday adjustments are inferred from the correlation of monthly sales with
monthly weekday composition. Since we have the direct daily sales, we don’t need to
infer the weekday effect. We can directly observe it. Our only problems are how to
smooth the data and how to deal with holidays and outliers. We will simply omit the
holidays and outliers, and smooth using a 52 week moving average.

Weekday adjustment factors from January 1999 to June 2010 are illustrated in Figure 5.
These are 52 week centered averages of diesel sales for each weekday relative to the 52
week moving average of Wednesday sales, with holidays and outliers omitted. The logic
for the 52 week average is that this covers a whole year and is not contaminated by
patterns that are confined to specific months, and with 52 observations in each average
we obtain the kind of slow-moving adjustment appropriate to something like the weekly
pattern of sales. To maintain 52 weeks in every average, the first six months and the last
six months are held flat, equal to the 1999 and 2010 averages respectively.

Notice in Figure 5 that Tuesday and Thursday have been competing for second place in
the race for the most diesel sales, with Thursday clearly winning out at the end of the
series. Next in the race at positions 4 and 5 are the weekdays Monday and Friday.
These four days have sales that are all over 80% of Wednesday sales. The very slow
sales days are Saturday (60% of Wednesday in 2010) and Sunday(50% of Wednesday in
2010). Though Saturday and Sunday sales were essentially the same in 1999, a
substantial drift downward of the Sunday sales begins in 2003, and is offset by increases
in Monday, Friday and Saturday sales. I am tempted to suggest this is the rising
influence of Christianity.

We are now in a position to do a weekday adjustment by dividing the data by the
weekday factors illustrated in Figure 5. With this correction, the unadjusted tractor
gallons illustrated in Figure 1 are turned into the weekday-adjusted data illustrated in
Figure 6 where the seven holidays are clearly present, but otherwise the daily data seem
pretty smooth, almost outlier free. But this figure disguises whatever outliers may be
present by choice of scale that is coarse enough to allow the holidays to be displayed.
More on outliers below.

3. Holiday Adjustments
Now that the data have been purged of the weekday effects, the next step is to remove the
holiday effects. Figure 7 through Figure 12 illustrate the weekday adjusted data around
the holiday periods. Specific comments on each holiday are provided below. These
figures make it seem that holiday adjustments will have large effects on the Easter-
affected months, March and April, and on pairs of months surrounding the holidays: May
and June because of Memorial Day, August and September because of Labor Day,
November and December because of Thanksgiving, and December and January because
of New Years.

Easter Weekday Adjusted Daily Sales
As illustrated in Figure 7 the effect of Easter on diesel volumes wanders back and forth
between February and March, which is well understood. But there are at least a couple
of other interesting features evident in the display.
    • The Friday before Easter is more depressed than the Monday afterward, though
        this is after accounting for the fact that Friday is normally a bit lower than
        Monday.
    • The effect of Easter seems to increase with the calendar date, more in April than
        in March.

Memorial Day Weekday Adjusted Daily Sales
When Memorial Day Monday is May 31, diesel purchases are depressed by over 10% on
the Tuesday, June 1, and depressed about 4% on June 2. When Memorial Day is May 29,
there is also an effect on sales on Wednesday June 1. For earlier Memorial Days, there is
no apparent leakage into June. The similarity in the pattern across years is what allows
straightforward and effective adjustment for this holiday.

July 4: Weekday Adjusted Daily Sales
Sales on the 4th of July illustrated in Figure 9 dip about 50% from their late June levels
but this varies across years by about 10%. This noise doesn’t go deep into June, but the
circled date of .June 30 has quite a bit of variability, suggesting some leakage of the July
4th effect into June. If 5% of June 30 sales should have been booked in June, this is
making the June number only 5%/30 days= 0.17 % higher than it should have been,
which is not a large number compared with the other unexplained noise. Furthermore,
the pattern on June 30 across years doesn’t very clearly associate with the weekday of
July 4. But the figure does reveal that a Sunday 4th of July is followed by an equally
depressed level of Monday sales. While that might matter for some calculations, these
event is restricted to July and thus is not a cause of leakage into another month.

August.

Thanksgiving, Weekday Adjusted Daily Sales
The pattern of diesel sales following Thanksgiving seems not affected by the date on
which Thanksgiving occurs, but when Thanksgiving is late enough in November, the
effect leaks into the first couple of days in December. This is most evident in 2002, less
so in 2003/2008 and not much otherwise.

Christmas and New Years, Weekday Adjusted Daily Sales
There is a substantial amount of variability of diesel sales volumes between Christmas
and New Years and in the first week of January, but no weekday effect is apparent in the
figure.

Linear Regression for Holiday Adjustment
Linear regression is the standard tool for doing both weekday and holiday adjustments.
The models estimated with the daily data take the form

                                                            5
         log( gallons t / weekday _ adjt ) = α + ∑ β i Dit + ε it
                                                          i = −5
where the variable weekday_adj is illustrated in Figure 5, where the coefficients
 β-5 ,β-4,…, β5 are holiday effects starting 5 days before the holiday and ending five days
after, and Dit are binary variables equal to 1 if t-i is the holiday and equal to zero
otherwise. While this is entirely conventional way to deal with holidays and weekdays,
treatment of the nonholiday part of the variability in gallons, ε it , is more a matter of
discretion. Census seasonal methods include options that correct for ARIMA structures
on these residuals within the context of seasonal adjustment of monthly data (or other
frequencies). Here we pursue a two-step approach made possible by the availability of
daily data – we first remove the workday and holiday effects from the daily data and then
do the seasonal adjustment on monthly aggregates.

Given the regression coefficients, the data purged of weekday and holiday effects take the
form

                                                   5
         ( gallons t / weekday _ adjt ) / exp( ∑ β i Dit )
                                                 i = −5

          ⎧( gallons t / weekday _ adjt )              for nonholidays
         =⎨
          ⎩ ( gallonst / weekday _ adjt ) / exp( β i ) for holidays

Once these daily data are purged of weekday and holiday effects, they are aggregated into
monthly averages, and then subjected to Census X12 to remove the calendar effects.3


First Attempt: EQ00
Table 13 in an appendix reports a regression with ARMA residuals explaining the
logarithm of weekday-adjusted daily data as a function of indicators selecting each of the
prominent holidays and five days on either side of each. The Christmas and New Years
indicators do not extend the full range because there are only 6 days between these two
holidays. The estimated coefficients on the holiday indicators are translated into holiday
percentage adjustment factors using the formula exp(coeff)-1. These are all illustrated
in Figure 13, which reveals that Christmas has the largest effect (-80%), followed by
Thanksgiving(-63%) which has a distinct asymmetric effect, more after than before.
Probably this is trucking preparing for Black Friday sales and taking it a bit easy in the

  Incidentally, if x is normally distributed with mean μ and variance σ2 then the expected value of exp(-x)
is exp(-μ+σ2 /2 ). This could serve as a basis for shrinkage of the holiday effect when the uncertainty in the
coefficient is large.


                                                                                                           21
week after Thanksgiving. Next in magnitude is New Years (-56%), then Memorial Day
and Labor Day which have almost exactly the same pattern of effects. Last in terms of its
effect on trucking is Easter(-18%), though remember this is on top of a 60% Sunday
effect.

EQ00 Residuals
The holiday part of the regression equation can be used to remove the holiday effects
from the weekday-adjusted daily data by dividing the daily data by the exponent of the
holiday coefficient, a divisor which is constant beyond five days from the holidays. This
works well for the holidays that are always on the same weekday but not so well for the
4th of July, Christmas and New Years which fall on different weekdays in different years.
This section lays the groundwork for equations that allow the holiday effect to be
weekday dependent, first by exploring the outliers in the EQ00 residuals and second by
exploring graphically the weekday patterns of the adjusted data around the holidays.

Outliers in EQ00 Residuals
Table 3 reports the residuals from EQ00 that are larger than 0.1 (10%) in absolute value.
Four of these outliers occur during high-impact Northeast snowstorms listed in Table 4.
One is on the Wednesday after the terrorist attack on 9/11/2001. But most of these
outliers occur late in December, early in January and early in July, close to Christmas,
New Years and the 4th of July. These are the problem holidays that are celebrated on
varying days of the week.

Our daily data allow us to explore the impact of snowstorms on trucking, and in principal
to add weather adjustments to the equation. Figure 14 illustrates the NESIS values per
NOAA for each of the greatest Northeast snowstorms, and the corresponding residuals
from EQ00 during the snowstorms and one day extra at each end, possibly capturing
preparations or postponed travel.

Two Problematic Monthly Transitions: Dec/Jan and June/July
As a first step in exploring the possibility that the noise around the holidays can be
understood, Figure 15 displays January seven day averages of the EQ00 workday and
holiday adjusted data, beginning on the 7th of January and ending on January 31. The 7th
is the first seven-day average that uses data exclusively for the month displayed.
Transitional problems between the months are thus suggested when either the 7th is an
apparent outlier or the last day of the month is an apparent outlier. Figure 15 has
apparent January 7 positive outliers for 2008, 2011 and other years, suggesting that some
of sales that traditionally would have been booked in December were at those times
booked in January. If so, it will make January appear stronger and December appear
weaker. This can matter greatly. January 2008 was the first NBER-official recession
month of the Great Recession. If we want the recession alarm to ring early and loud, it
should be ringing about that time. We need to get this one right.

The same kind of graphs for all 12 months are collected together in Figure 16. Visually,
it appears that January, July and December are the problem months.

The standard errors of EQ00 daily residuals during the monthly transitions reported in
Table 5 further confirm that the problem transition is Dec/Jan, and to a lesser extent
June/July. These summary statistics apply to the days at the ends and beginning of
months, first seven days in each, and then two days in each. The biggest standard error
for the 14 day transition is in Dec/Jan (7.7%) followed by June/July (5.8%). The other
months all have substantially smaller standard errors of these peculiarity measures.
When attention is restricted to two days from each month, it is the Dec/Jan item that is
extreme by a factor of two, as measured by the standard deviation.

June/July Transitions
The goal of this paper is to create monthly aggregates from daily data with adjustments
for weekday and holiday effects applied to the daily data, and with calendar adjustments
applied to monthly aggregates of the adjusted daily data. For that purpose, it is more
revealing to look at weekly data around the troubling holidays rather than the noisier
daily data. Figure 17 illustrates the weekly totals for the first week in July, ending July 7,
and for the last week of June, ending June 30, and for three previous and three subsequent
weeks. The June and July aggregates are basically averages of these weekday totals, with
a couple of extra days. The 4th of July would create problems if some years there is
substantial leakage into June and other years not so much. Figure 17 clearly reveals the
July 7 dip in weekly sales but doesn’t suggest that there is a big problem with leakage
into June.

Though the July 4th effect seems very similar when the data are displayed in Figure 17,
Figure 18 tells a different story. Here the 4th of July effects have been removed from the


                                                                                           28
daily data per EQ00, and the year level-effects have been removed by dividing by yearly
averages. All that remains are the June/July patterns not removed by the EQ00 July
dummy variables. There is clearly a lot of noise remaining in the first week of July, but
not much in the last week of June. This is supporting the conclusion that the volatility in
the June/July comparison is not due to July 4th effects that sometimes leak into June but
rather to the noise strictly within the data during the first week of July.

Though these initial displays do not suggest that the noise in the June/July transition are
susceptible to statistical correction, the pattern during the first week of July could still be
dependent on the weekday on which the 4th of July falls. The problems with the
June/July transition are further revealed in Figure 19 which contains the seven-day
averages of the adjusted data clustered by weekday. Remember if the weekday and
holiday adjustments are working correctly these averages should be generally flat or
trending. Clearly they are not. The patterns for (Monday, Tuesday) (Wednesday)
(Thursday, Friday), Saturday and Sunday are distinctly different, which means that the 4th
of July effect is spread over time depending on the day of the week on which the 4th falls.
Some clustering of these weekdays is required because with only ten years of data there
are not enough instances to allow each weekday to have a distinct pattern of effects. The
figure however supports a very natural clustering: (Mon, Tues), Wednesday, (Thurs, Fri),
Sat, Sun. While I will use dummy variables to allow these patterns to differ, for the
single year of data with a Saturday July 4th (2009) this amounts to discarding these data,
which is a symptom of the overfitting that I am now embarked on. More data, especially
more Saturdays are going to help.

December/January Transitions
The December/January transitions are quite a bit noisier than the June/July transitions,
more dependent on the weekday of the holidays, and more problematic for forming
monthly aggregates. Figure 21 illustrates the weekly data during December and January,
divided by year and week averages. The horizontal axis is the year of the data, each with
its own weekday for Jan 1. For each of these years, the data for eight weeks are
displayed. These weeks are therefore the different series, and the critical weeks ending
December 31 and January 7 are highlighted. Here we see that for the two Thursdays in
the data, both of these weeks are abnormally low. The leakage hypothesis would suggest
that one would be low and one would be high.

                                      Year and Weekday of New Years


Figure 21 displays the seven-day averages of the EQ00 adjusted data clustered by
weekday for the December/ January transition. As is the case with the July 4th holiday,
the beginning of the workweek (Mon, Tues) and the end of the workweek (Thurs, Fri)
form natural groups. The shape of the Wednesday effect seems similar to Saturday and
Sunday, though the 1999 Saturday profile is distinct.

Fully Adjusted Data: EQ03
Based on the displays and discussion above, a EQ02 is estimated that allows the holiday
effects to vary by workday per the groupings in Table 6. EQ03in addition allows the
Dec/Jan pattern in 1999/2000 to be distinct, something that is suggested by the different
timing of the Sunday and Saturday pattern in Figure 21. The estimated regression for
EQ02 is not reported. EQ03 is reported in Table 14 in the appendix.

Holiday Patterns per EQ03

The patterns of the Christmas/New Years effect that come from EQ03 are displayed in
Figure 22 and the corresponding patterns for the July 4th effects are displayed in Figure
23. The adverse effects on trucking “lean left” and the Thurs/Fri effects “lean right”. In
both cases, the holiday is extended into the adjacent weekend: the previous weekend for
the Mon/Tues holidays and the subsequent weekend for the Thurs/Fri holidays.

For the first few days of January, the difference between the Mon/Tues effects and the
Thursday/Friday effects are more than 10%, which can wreak havoc with seasonal
adjustment methods that do not account for this effect. For June, however the difference
among the corrections is mostly confined to June 30 and is not very large. This suggests
that the weekday controls in EQ03 are most important for month totals for Dec/Jan and
not very important for the June/July transitions.

Residuals during Dec/Jan and June/July Transitions: Summary Stats
The effectiveness of the equations EQ02 and EQ03 that allow holiday effects to vary by
holiday weekday compared with EQ00 which does not is summarized numerically by
standard deviations of residuals during each of the Dec/Jan sequences in Table 7 and
likewise for each June/July pair in Table 8 The December/January transitions include
the last week of December and the first week of January, and the June/July transitions
include the last week of June and the first week of July.

The overall standard deviation of the Dec/Jan transition residuals is reduced 33% when
the holiday drift is allowed to be weekday dependent per the groupings in the table which
is the basis for EQ02. The greatest improvements comes for the 2003-Wednesday
pattern, though this is a consequence of overfitting, since there is only one Wednesday
New Year in the sample. The holiday drift per EQ02 actually makes the 2000 data
worse, and this of course is much improved if there is a distinct holiday pattern per EQ03.

Standard deviations of residuals during each of the June/July sequences are reported in
Table 8 which includes both the EQ02 and EQ03 results even though allowing for a
distinct Dec/Jan effect in 1999/2000 has no evident impact on the June/July values.
Overall, allowing the July 4th effect to vary by weekday of the holiday reduces the
residual standard error by 62%, a much larger reduction than the Dec/Jan treatment.

 Note: EQ00 has the same holiday effect regardless of weekday of Holidays

Outliers from EQ03
Though the workday and holiday adjustments remove many of the anomalous
observations in the daily data, many remain. Table 9 and Table 10 report the EQ03
residuals in excess of 5%, 112 in all. For all of our efforts to remove the holiday effects,
Christmas and New Years and Thanksgiving continue to have large numbers of
anomalous observations per the results in Table 10. Table 9 reports large residuals that
are not associated with the holiday leakage problem. Many of the isolated cases are
depressed sales on January and February Sundays, pointing to the need to have a month
correction for our weekday adjustment. The offsetting sequences of abnormalities
generally have a negative followed by a positive, suggesting sales delayed a single day.
The terrorsit attack on 9/11 has the opposite pattern – increased sales on 9/11 and
decreased sales on 9/12, as if truckers rushed to fill their tanks in response to the news.
In addition to the 9/11 effect, three other patterns in Table 9 are explainable by extreme
Northeast snowstorms, but with your help, I think we can track down the explanations of
many of the others, for example, the number one residual on October 28, 2002, -23.8%,
followed by the number three residual the next day, +22.0%.

4. Monthly Data
Though the daily data raise interesting issues on their own, here the goal is only to use the
daily data to help form monthly aggregates corrected for variable workdays and
wandering holidays as well as calendar effects. To set the stage, Figure 24 illustrates
calendar adjusted daily average diesel fuel sales for each month, adjusted with X12,
without workday or holiday corrections. The sawtooth pattern with up and downs
following one after another is very suspicious. It is possible that truckers all over the
country near the end of each month decide collectively whether to purchase diesel in the
current or subsequent month, or, more likely, we are making an error in allocating sales
between adjacent months.

One thing that could give rise to this bi-monthly pattern is the weekday effect since a
month that benefits from an extra Wednesday does so at the expense of adjacent months.
It is therefore anticipated that the apparent “nervousness” of the index illustrated in
Figure 24 will be relieved via the removal of weekday effects. One way to remove the
weekday effects is to use aggregates that have a constant composition of weekdays. The
last 28 days of each month is an option, and an index based on these last-of-the-month
28-day averages is illustrated in Figure 25, which is much smoother than the traditional
index that does not account for workdays.

But, Figure 24 is labeled a straw man since Census statisticians have thought a lot about
how to remove trading day (weekday) effects from the monthly data. After all, the
weekday composition of every month is known, and can be removed from the monthly
totals if the number of months is enough to estimate the weekday effects. I wonder if the
145 months of data are enough to do this with accuracy. Surprise: When the Census X11
seasonal adjustment with trading day effects is applied to the monthly sums, the result is
Figure 26, which is very similar to the 28-day averages. That seems disappointing since
it suggests that the daily data may not be all that useful for improving on Census “trading
day” adjustment.

Monthly Aggregates from Daily Data
Finally, we arrive near the end of this long journey. We use the daily data adjusted for
workday and holiday per EQ01, EQ02 and EQ03 to form monthly averages, and then
adjust these monthly averages for calendar effects using X12. This produces three
monthly series displayed in Figure 27, each transformed into an index, 2007=100. Here
we can see that index based on EQ02 which allows two of the holiday effects to depend
on the holiday weekday is much smoother than the index based on EQ01 which has fixed
holiday effects. There is little difference between EQ03 which allows a distinct New
Years pattern for 1999 and EQ02 which does not. Below these in Figure 28 is an index
based on the monthly sums corrected for workday, holiday and calendar effects per
Census methods.4

    CENSUS holiday adjustments:

         “The basic model used by X-12-ARIMA for Easter and Labor Day effects
         assumes that the level of activity changes on the wth day before the holiday for a
         specified w, and remains at the new level until the day before the holiday. For
         Thanksgiving the model used assumes that the level of activity changes on the
         day that is a specified number of days before or after Thanksgiving and remains at


                                                                                        42
It should be visually apparent that both the EQ02 and EQ03 Indexes aresmoother than the
Census index. This visual impression is confirmed by the means and standard errors of
the change in the log of the Census-based index and the EQ03 based index reported in
Table 11, overall and month by month. Overall, the EQ03 approach reduces the standard
error by 8.3%, but the improvement is concentrated in the months influenced by holidays
not adequately dealt with by Census methods: Memorial Day, the 4th of July, Labor Day,
Thanksgiving and New Years.




       the new level until December 24. The regression variable constructed for the
       holiday effect is, for a given month t, the proportion of the affected time period
       that falls in month t. (Actually, as noted in Table 4.1, these regressors are
       deseasonalized by subtracting off their long-run monthly means.) Essentially the
       same Easter effect variable applies also to quarterly flow time series, but Labor
       Day and Thanksgiving effects are not present in quarterly series. X-12-ARIMA
       does not provide built-in variables for possible holiday effects in stock series.

5. A Radical Alternative: A Calendar That Eliminates the
Leakages
The current Gregorian calendar reflects a compromise between the earth’s cycle around
the sun, the moon’s cycle around the earth and earthly religions that require observances
every seven days. Given the daily data we have the freedom to divide the days of the
year in a way best suited to describing the trucking data.

One idea already explored with some considerable success is the use of only the 28 days
at the end of each month, thereby adjusting for the strong weekly cycle in diesel
purchases. This works pretty well but inappropriately omits data from the beginning of
all months except the 28-day Februaries,5 but more importantly for our purposes it
doesn’t deal with the holiday effects that wander between months from year to year. The
extraction of the holiday effects from the daily data described above has been difficult
and not necessarily entirely successful, which leads us to explore another idea: minor
revisions to the current calendar that prevents the wandering of the holidays by
appropriate expansions/contractions of months. Here are the proposed calendar revisions
that are meant to deal with wandering New Years, wandering Memorial Days, wandering
4ths of July and wandering Labor Days, leaving untouched the wandering Easters:

  An early 13-month proposal was the 1849 Positivist calendar, created by Auguste
Comte. It was based on a 364-day year which included one or two “blank” days. Each of
the 13 months had 28 days and exactly four weeks, and each started on a Monday.

Figure 29 illustrates the effect of this proposed calendar change on the trucking index
with workday and Easter corrections per EQ03, but no other holiday corrections. This
doesn’t seem much smoother than the results already discussed.

Table 12 reports a numerical comparison of the monthly variability of the index based on
the revised calendar with the best adjusted data using the traditional calendar. Overall the
revised calendar reduces the standard deviation of the month-to-month variability by
3.4%, but the month by month comparison is a very mixed bag, with no clear winner.

Timely and Accurate
Among the most important reports that make use of survey-based data sets are the
quarterly National Income and Product Accounts provided by the US Bureau of
Economic Analysis and the monthly Employment Situation Summary provided by the
US Bureau of Labor Statistics. For those who are interested in an early and accurate read
on the health of the economy, these data have two disconcerting features – they are
delayed by at least a month and they are subject to very substantial revisions. The
middle of 2008 was a particularly telling example because the original data provided by
the BEA and the BLS was not suggestive of a recession but the revised data revealed a
very troubled economy. Figure 30 illustrates data on US Real GDP commencing the first
quarter of 2006 and ending the second quarter of 2008.6 The question mark in this figure
is asking for your forecast for the second half of 2008. The initial release by the BEA on
August 28, 2008 had GDP growing substantially in the second quarter, clearly indicating
that the US was not in recession. Based on these data I imagine you might have been
forecasting continued growth through the rest of the year. The first sign of trouble came
with the release almost a year later on July 31, 2009, when the revised data indicated a
clear GDP peak in the last quarter of 2007. Based on these data I imagine you would
have been very worried about the second half of 2008.

Much the same problem afflicted the payroll jobs estimates in the first half of 2008
illustrated in Figure 31. According to the data available on July 3, 2008, payrolls were
declining at a rate well under 100 thousand per month. Keeping in mind that recession-
level declines are 200 thousand per month or more, this together with the early GDP
estimates revealed a troubled economy that had not yet fallen into a full-blown recession.
At the time it seemed possible that the second half of 2008 would be more of the same –
a troubled job market and weak GDP growth, but not recession-level declines. The
subsequent revisions increased the job losses to 150 thousand per month, and more, and
make the first half of 2008 look a lot weaker, but we didn’t know this until Feb 6, 2009.

Conclusion
The most salient feature of the daily diesel data is a very large weekly cycle with
weekend purchases only half of midweek purchases. This matters much for forming a
monthly index because the weekday composition of any given month varies from year to
year. Census seasonal adjustment methods X11 and X12 include an option for weekday
adjustment inferred from monthly data, but with daily data we have direct evidence of the
workday effect. One surprise is how well Census methods using monthly data do in
comparison with direct purging of the weekday effect using the daily data. The next step
after removing the weekday effect from the daily data is holiday adjustment using
traditional dummy-variable regression estimates of the holiday impacts. Though Census
X11 and X12 allow holiday adjustments inferred from monthly data, Census has missed
the way that some of the holiday effects drift back and forth, which is evident in the daily
diesel data.

The bottom line here is that these daily data afford an understanding of the health of the
economy that is a substantial improvement over monthly data. Moreover, these are
actual transactions – real data, in real time.

Appendix:
Monthly Totals Versus Monthly Daily Averages
For those who are choosing seasonally adjustment options in Eviews and in other
software I suspect, I warn you about a mistake I found myself making: opting for “trading
day” adjustments of daily averages. The CENSUS trading day adjustment includes a leap
year correction and assumes that the data are monthly sums. It therefore reduces the
February data in leap years by 1/29. An error in the opposite direction is to seasonally
adjust monthly sums without a Leap Year adjustment. These are both illustrated in
Figure 32 for the three leap years: 2000, 2004 and 2008. See the big discrepancy in
February, with the monthly sums too high and weekday adjusted daily averages too low.
