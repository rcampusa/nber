This paper compares two possible foimats for free trade in the Americas: a
system of spokes surmunding a U.S. hub, and a free trade area. The paper
identifies the sources of welfare change, and it argues that a country's attitude
towards a system depends on whether the arrangement is a complement or a
substitute trading club. The paper argues also that rent-seeking activities, and
costs of administration and transportation, are likely to be higher in a hub-and-
spoke system than in a free trade area.

 HUBS AND SPOKES, AND FREE TRADE IN THE AMERICAS
          by Carsten Kowalczyk and Ronald J. Wonnacott

         In August, 1992, Canada, Mexico and the United States presented a free

trade agreement (FTA) to cover a North American market with a combined GNP

approaching $7 trillion and an annual trade in goods and services among its

members exceeding $270 billion.

         Although this agreement is essentially in a trilateral PTA format, full

ratification by all three countries is not guaranteed. If Canada were not to ratify,

the result could be a Mexico-U.S. bilateral ETA, creating a hub-and-spoke

system in which the United States as the hub would have one bilateral spoke

agreement with Canada (the 1989 Canada-U.S. PTA), and another with Mexico;

in other words, two free trade areas overlapping on the United StatesJ

1 To some extent a hub-and-spoke system has already developed given the free
trade agreement between Israel and the U.S. There are other possible outcomes
that would require the analysis of this paper. One is that the United States
would fail to ratify an agreement with Mexico while a Canada-Mexico agreement
succeeds. This time the hub would be Canada with a Mexican and a U.S. spoke.
While this possibility is theoretically interesting, it is hardly of practical
relevance as it would be a virtually certain non-starter in Canada. We focus,
therefore, on the situation of a U.S. hub. Another outcome requiring this sort of
analysis would be an agreement with bilateral hub-and-spoke provisions in
certain sectors grafted onto a trilateral free trade core in all other sectors.



                                          2
 Moreover, the United States might go on to negotiate additional bilaterals with

 Chile and other countries in the hemisphere.

         While there has been a great deal of analysis of the economics of a

 simple ETA, far less is known about the more complex economics when F1'As

overlap in a hub-and-spoke system.2 This paper examines the welfare effects on

a nation that participates in the development of a hub-and-spoke system, and

compares them to the effects from participating in a simple, expanding FTA.

Using the now familiar North American case as our example, we show that the

expectation for any spoke -- Canath or Mexico -- is that its welfare would be less

in a hub-and spoke system. At the same time, if the analysis is limited to the

effects of preferential trading, then the preferred access by the U.S. hub to spoke

markets likely will lead it to favor a hub-and-spoke system. However, this

judgment by the U.S. will be tempered by broader influences, such as the effect

of a hub-and-spoke system in generating smaller increases in income in the

spoke markets, and hence a smaller increase in U-S. exports; and in generating

higher administrative, transportation, and rent-seeking costs. These and other

considerations can be expected to make a hub-and-spoke system less beneficial

for all participants, thus leading each spoke country to favor an FTA more


2 The overlapping ETA or hub-and -spoke concept is the same as the two-sided
triangle examined in Wonnacott (1975 and 1982). It is also essentially the same
problem as the U.S. star with partner countries at the points described by Yung
C. Park and Jung Ho Yoo (1989). To our knowledge, it was first called the hub-
and-spoke problem in independent studies by Richard Lipsey (1990, pp. 4-5) and
Wonnacott (1990, pp. 3-4). Lipsey examined it again in 1991, and Wonnacott
(1991) provided a detailed statement of some of the issues involved. The
problem was considered further in Kowalczyk and Wonnacott (1991).

strongly, and arguably even leading the hub country to reverse its judgment and

also favor an ETA.3

         Potential applications of this analysis include not only the extension of

free trade to other countries in the Western Hemisphere but also the creation of

complex regional trading structures in Europe, for example among nations in

Eastern and Western Europe or between the former republics of the old Soviet

Union. Will some of these countries become spokes for the EC hub as Poland

and Hungary now seem to be doing? Will Russia become an EC spoke, or will

it become another hub with bilateral spoke agreements with previous Soviet

Republics? Or will it do both? Before such a maze of new trading

configurations is created -- indeed is even considered -- it is important to sort out

the economics of hub-and-spoke systems, and how any such system would

compare to the obvious, much simpler option: a plurilateral ETA covering the

same countries.

         Section 1 of the paper discusses the traditional approach to customs

union theory. Section II presents the methodology used in our analysis. Sction

111 analyzes the economic effects as a hub-and-spoke system develops and

compares this system to a trilateral free trade agreement from the point of view

of the initial spoke, Canada. Section IV compares the two systems from the

3 We recognize that the political fate of any negotiated agreement would depend
on the distribution of any gains and losses across interest groups, on these
groups' relative strengths, and on the political system's ability to transfer income
among them. While political economy considerations of this sort are important,
we believe that focussing on national welfare is useful, particularly at this early
stage of inquiry, as it helps identify how much income there is to be distributed
under each of the different trade regimes.

perspective of the hub, the United States. Section V considers additional costs

related to the hub-and-spoke system such as those from rent-seeking activities.

Section VI, finally, summarizes and presents concluding remarks.



I.       THE NORTH AMERICAN EXAMPLE: A HUB-AND-
         SPOKE SYSTEM CENTERED ON THE UNITED
         STATES, VS. A TRILATERAL CANADA-MEXICO.U.S.
         FTA

         Clearly, the interests of the U.S. hub will not be the same as those of

Canada or Mexico; nor will the interest of these two U.S. partners necessarily be

identical. This study uses terms-of-trade and volume-of-trade effects to examine

the effect on one U.S. partner -- Canada -- were a hub-and -spoke system to

develop.4 The result is then compared to the trilateral ETA alternative. These

two regimes are then compared from the point of view of the U.S. hub.

         Answering the question of what happens to a spoke -. Canada -- were a

hub-and-spoke system to develop involves two steps: (1) an examination of the

effect on Canada of its own bilateral with the United States; and (2) an analysis

of the effect on Canada as the U.S. goes on to sign a bilateral with Mexico,

thereby establishing a hub-and-spoke system.

         To answer the question: "How would Canada compare this hub-and-

spoke outcome to a trilaterai FTA?" a final step is involvet (3) an analysis of



   Terms of trade and volume of trade effects were introduced by Meade (1955).
They were treated formally by Jones (1969), and Ohyama (1972) applied them in
discrete form in an analysis of tax and tariff changes. Kowalczyk (1990) argued
that they constitute an attractive alternative to Viner's trade diversion and trade
creation effects and used them to derive new results.

                                      5
the effect on Canada if it were then to negotiate its own bilateral with Mexico,

thus approximately creating a trilateral ETA.5

          The effects on the U.S. hub involve examining these same three steps

from the U.S. point of view.

         The traditional analysis of preferential trade dates back to Viner (1950)

who introduced the concepts of trade diversion and creation. However, as

Kowalczyk (1990) has argued, these concepts --no matter how defined-- cannot

provide an adequate framework for an assessment of even a simple customs

union (CU), let alone a more complex preferential system like the one

investigated in this paper.6 Among the difficulties is that trade diversion has

two different definitions. Both include the terms-of-trade loss from switching

away from a cheaper outside source of imports to a more expensive union

partner. In addition, one of the definitions includes a volume of trade effect

indeed, using it, Gehrels (1956) and Lipsey (1957) showed that trade diversion

could be welfare improving. A further deficiency is that Viner's terminology is

not exhaustive, not en in very simple environments. For example, our

analysis suggests that Canath could experience more trade with the United States

if the latter were to sign a bilateral agreement with Mexico; neither of Viner's

terms would capture this appropriately.


   It will be shown later that creating a trilateral is, in several respects, more
complicated than this; but this is a useful first approximation.
6 As elsewhere in the literature, CU is defined here as a generic term to include
an PTA. We assume throughout the analysis that tariffs on non-member
countries remain constant. We assume also that non-member countries leave
their tariffs unchanged.

                                          6
    II.     THE MODEL

            Assume throughout that production possibility sets are convex and

 globally differentiable, and that each country has a welfare function that is also

 globally differentiable. To begin, assume only two goods, clothing (C) and food

 (F). The quantity of each consumed is Dc and Df, while the quantity of each

 produced is Xc and Xf. At world price pe, which is the price of a unit of food

 expressed in units of clothing, balanced trade implies that the value of the trading

 nation's consumption bundle is equal to the value of its production bundle; that

is,



                                  + peDf = x<, + pexf



Differentiating this, along with appropriate manipulation, yields7

                              dy = -rn dpe + (p ...pe) dm




7
    Differentiating (1) yields:

                          dDc + pedDf ÷ Dfdpe = dXc + pedxf + Xfdpe

Letting p be the price of food in the domestic market, add and subtract pdDf from
the left-hand side, and pdXf from the right-hand side. Then, noting that the
import of food is m = Df - Xf and that dxc + pdXf = 0 because (Xc, X) is a
point on the production possibility curve, (1') can be reduced to (2). This
derivation is in Caves, Frankel and Jones (1990), pp. 747-749.



                                      7
where p is the price of food in the domestic market, dy is the change in real

income evaluated at the original p. and m is the quantity of food imports.

            To generalize this, interpret m as a vector of imports (including exports

with a negative sign). Vectors p and pe are then the corresponding domestic and

world prices of these tradeables. Finally, recognize that some of the effects of

tariff elimination (or even a fmite tariff reduction) may not be adequately captured

by infinitesimal marginal changes, so (2) must be integrated:




                dy= -         m       dpe+         (ppe). dm
         fYI                                 Jmi




where, for example, P1 and p are the values of pe when tariffs are, respectively,

at their initial value and at their final value.8

            An example of an effect that just the differentiation in (2) would not

capture would occur if one country were to begin importing from its partner

rather than from a cheaper outside country that was initially its only source. In

this case, the first infinitesimally small reduction in its tariff against its partner

would have no effect. Indeed nothing would happen until its tariff reduction was

sufficient to initiate this change in country of origin of its imports.



8 As an alternative to (3), finite changes may be evaluated using the difference
equation:
                                  =   - in apC + (p - pe). Am

                                              8
           Hereafter we will, for the sake of the simplicity, be using equation (2),

 while recognizing that the inner product and integration notation in (3) have been

 dropped only for convenience, but are nonetheless implied throughout.



 III.     THE VIEW FROM A SPOKE: CANADA
          Step One: The Canada-U.S. Bilateral
          In a simple, hypothetical two-country world, the effects on
Canadian real income of Canada-U.S. free trade would be given by:



                                  = - mc. Us dpe + (pe - pe)
                                       I                 II



where mC,      is the vector of Canadian tradables with the United States while p'

and pe are, respectively, the vectors of domestic Canadian prices and world

prices.

          First, consider element I of this equation the terms-of-trade effect

Canada will pay higher prices for its imports from the United States because

Canadian tariffs are eliminated; similarly, Canada will receive a higher price for

its exports to the United States because of U.S. tariff elimination -- with the net

effect of these two changes being ambiguous. (It will be shown later that, in
view of specific conditions applying to Canada-U.S. trade, much of this

ambiguity can be removed.)




                                      9
         Element II -- the volume of trade effect -- shows the benefits to Canada

from an increase in its trade with the United States.9

         In an n-country world, analyzing the effects of a bilateral Canada-

U.S. ETA requires recognition of trade with the rest of the world (ROW). Thus

equation (4), defining the increase in Canadian real income, must be expanded to

include elements Ill and LV below covering Canadian trade with ROW:



                            dyC = - mCi US dpe + (pC - pe) dmC.
                                       I                  11


                                      - mc, ROW dpe + (pC      - pe) clmC.ROW
                                        III                    IV




9 On the import side, with a Canadian tariff creating a distortion between
domestic and foreign prices, the definition of elements I and II as the terms-of-
trade and volume-of-trade effects is straightforward. Some care, however, is
involved in the interpretation of what is happening on the export side, where, in
the absence of any Canadian export tax or subsidy, all export items in element II
become zero since each p' - pe =0. How is the benefit to Canada from increased
exports to be captured? The answer is: through term I. Figure 1, where x
denotes the Canadian export supply schedule and pC is the relative price of x,
illustrates this for one good. Suppose that Canada has no export tax or subsidy
and that at the initial price p6 its exports to the U.S. are given by xc. After its
free trade agreement with the U.S. the price rises to p and Canadian exports
increase to xi. The benefit to Canada is given by area a+b+c, which can be
expressed by the integral,


                                    x'5dp.
                             j p8

Along with similar expressions for other exports this makes up the export side
of term I in (4). We note that benefit a+b+c can be approximated by area a+b+d,
i.e. by i Apc.
                                           10
         The effects on Canada of its ETA with the United States can now be

evaluated as follows:

On the import side
         A.    As Canada extends preferential treatment to the United States,

               Canada switches some of its import purchases from ROW to a

               higher-cost U.S. source. This results in a terms-of-trade loss

               (Ill). However,

        B.     This preferential, zero-tariff treatment of imports from the United

               States lowers the Canadian domestic price. Under standard

               assumptions there is an increase in imports, i.e., new imports

               from the United States in II exceed the replaced imports from

               ROW in IV. Since the resulting volume-of-trade benefit depends

               on the differeQce in these two import flows, it is useful to think

               of!! and IV together as;



                          (pC - pe) [dmC US + dnf' Row]

        C.     There is an increase in Canadian imports from the United States

               in products in which the United States is the least-cost source.

               This provides a volume-of-trade benefit in element II. However,

        D.     This increase in Canadian imports in C may also generate a

               terms-of-trade loss in element I since Canada would be giving up

              any previous terms-of-trade benefit from its own tariff on

              imports from the United States.

                                   11
On the export side

         E.     Canada gets a terms-of-trade gain -- also in element I -- because

                of removal of the U.S. tariff on Canadian exports.

         F.     Following footnote 9 above, this terms-of-trade gain on exports

                in element I also includes the benefit from an increased volume

                of Canadian exports to the United States -- with this effect being

                augmented by the preference Canadian exporters receive in the

                U.S. market in competition with third countries (a benefit that,

                it will become evident, is very important in the Canadian case).

         While the net effect of these six changes taken together is ambiguous in

theory, in practice, for the specific Canada-U.S. ETA case examined here, they

can be expected, on balance, to have a favorable effect on Canadian welfare. The

reason is that positive effect E is likely to exceed negative effect D, while

positive effects B, C and F are likely to exceed the only other negative effect A.

         How can E be expected to dominate D when the tariffs the United States

would be removing in E are often smaller that the tariffs Canada would be

removing in D? The answer is that the prices of so many Canada-U.S. cradables

in manufacturing are determined in the U.S. market; i.e., in these products, the

United States is a classic large country, and Canada a small country. Because, in

such ttadables, Canada faces import prices fixed in the U.S. market, these prices

are unaffected by Canadian tariff removal; thus, in such cases, the negative effect

D disappears. On the other hand, on the large number of exports whose prices

are determined in the U.S. market, Canadian exporters get relief (i.e., higher

                                          12
 post-duty prices) since they must no longer, directly or indirectly, pay a U.S.

 tariff.10 Thus benefit E may be substantial and Canada can expect an overall

 terms of trade improvement)1

          We propose, furthermore, that positive effects B, C and F are likely to

 more than offset negative effect A.12 Specifically, the domain of A is Canada's

 pre-FTA imports from the ROW which represent only 30% of Canada's imports.

 The domain of welfare improving C is the remaining 70% of Canada's imports,

 while the domain of welfare-improving F is the roughly 70% of Canadian

exports that go to the United States.

          The resulting expectation that the Canada-U.S. ETA will, on balance,

benefit Canada has been supported by Cox and Harris (1986), who estimated that

an FTA with the United States would substantially increase Canadian real

income.'3 Indeed their study suggested an even stronger conclusion: just the


10 The relief would only be partial in the selected manufactured exports --
                                                                              e.g.,
 telecommunications and transport equipment -- where Canada does have some
 influence overprice. Also, Canada has some influence over internationalprices
 in resource trade. It is difficult to argue, however, even in these limited sectors,
 that Canada would suffer a significant terms-of-trade loss sincepre-FTA resource
 tariffs by both countries have typically been low or zero. Moreover, Canadian
 resource imports from the United States (on which price changes would damage
Canada) are substantially less than its resource exports to the United States (on
which price changes would benefit Canada). In short, the conclusion that Canada
will get an overall terms-of-trade benefit from the ETA can be expected to stand.
     See Kowalczyk (1990) for an analysis of the first-best trade policy for a
small country.
 12 It was exactly Gehrels' (op. cit.) and Lipsey's (op. cit.) point that even B
alone could dominate A.
 13 In their study, Cox and Harris estimated an increase in Canadian welfare in
the order of 9%. While this was subsequently revised downward to reflect,
among other things, trade liberalization that had already taken place, their
estimate of gains still remained substantial and positive. Cox and Harris took
account of economies of scale, a major source of benefit to Canadian exporters

benefit from acquiring preference in the U.S. market in a bilateral deal is so

important for Canada that it may make the ETA with the United States more

beneficial for Canada than even multilateral free trade would be. In other words,

the preferentialETA benefit for Canada (just part of F) could alone, zvughly

speaking, exceed not only any costs -- in particular in A -- specific to the ETA,

but also any foregone benefits from free trade with the ROW that would be

available only from multilateral free tradej4

         Step Two: A Mexico-U.S. Bilateral FTA
         If the United States were to negotiate an ETA with Mexico alone, the

result would be a hub-and-spoke system in which the U.S. hub would have a

bilateral spoke agreement with Canada on the one hand, and with Mexico on the

other. The effect on Canada would be:

not included in the analysis of this paper. Other investigators have also
estimated net gains, although usually with smaller numerical values; some of
these have also excluded scale economies.
14 There seem to be two inwitive and related explanations for this surprising
conclusion for Canada. The heavy concentration of its trade with the United
States rather than with the ROW keeps the Canadian ETA loss A and the
potential benefit from free trade with the ROW under the GAIT relatively low;
and the large size of the U.S. market makes the benefits of preferential access
there relatively high. It should be emphasized that this is simply the view from
Canada. The effects on world welfare of these two regimes -- a Canada-U.S.
bilateral vs. multilateral free trade -- would of course be quite different.

                                          14
This is the same as equation (5) except that the earlier ROW is now decomposed

into Mexico M, and the remaining ROW.

          A key issue now is whether, from Canada's viewpoint, the Mexico-

U.S. FTA is a complement or a substitute trade agreement.'5 An ETA is a

complement if it indreases imports by its members from outsiders; it is

substitute if it decreases those imports. To illustrate, an ETA will be a

complement if, for example, outsiders produce resources not available within the

ETA, and if increased trade between ETA members increases their demand for

such products from Outsiders. On the otherhand, an ETA will be a substitute if

outsiders produce goods that are substitutes for those produced within the ETA,

with purchases of these goods by ETA members from outsiders therefore being

reduced. For an ETA to be substitute it is important that this effect not be offset

by increased demand for outsiders' goods by the FTA members due to their

increased income generated by the formation of the ETA. This income effect is

potentially very important since, if it is strong enough, it can -- under standard

assumptions -- make a union complementary even if outsiders produce only

products that would otherwise be substitutes. It is, of course, possible that an

agreement may be a complement to one outside country, but a substitute to

another.16




15 These concepts have been introduced in more detail in Kowalczyk and
Wonnacott (1991).
16 See Kowalczyk and Wonnacott, op cit.

                                    15
          If the Mexico-U.S. ETA is a substitute agreement from the point of

view of outsider Canada, with the exports of Canada to the United States and

Mexico falling as a consequence, then, noting footnote 9 above, there will be

damage to Canada in elements I and/or III. This substitutability may reflect

several factors, such as the Canadian loss of export sales to Mexico and the

United States because (1) each of the two countries becomes a more competitive

supplier because of its falling costs under free trade (due, for example, to its

industries' free access to inexpensive imports from the other); (2) Mexico would

switch some of its purchases from Canada to the higher-cost United States; and

(3) the United States would reverse the switching of imports towards Canada

horn lower-cost source Mexico that happened when the United States signed its

ETA with Canada)7

         On the other hand, if the Mexico-U.S. ETA is a complement rather

than a substitute agreement from Canada's point of view, then effects I and III on

outsider Canada will on balance be positive. While it would, in our view, be

overly optimistic to count on this outcome, there are two reasons why it might

occur. One is that resource products -- an important component of Canadian

exports -- are more likely than manufactured goods to complement the growing

Mexican-U.S. trade. However, although resources remain a significant part of

Canadian exports, they no longer dominate, as more than half of Canadian

exports are now manufactured goods, with their higher degree of substitutability.


17 In Viner's terminology, (2) would be trade diversion and (3) the reversal of
previous trade diversion.

                                          16
Accordingly, one has to look to the second reason for the major hope for

complementarity: the increase in income induced by the PTA in the United

States and especially in Mexico,18 with the resulting increase in.their demand

for Canadian exports.

          The conclusion so far may be extended and generalized as follows:



PROPOSITION: As a hub-and-spoke system develops around the U.S. hub, a

spoke like Canada can expect to benefitfrom its own bilateral spoke agreement

with the United States. However, as the United States then goes on to add new

spokes, each substitute agreement will hurt the existing spoke (Canada) while

each complementary agreement will provide fun her benefit to the existing spoke

(Canada). One important hopefor complementarity lies in the expanding

income in the hub (U.S.) and in any new spoke (e.g., Mexico) as a result of

their bilateral.


          Further Observations on the Development of a Hub-and-
          Spoke System in Steps 1 and 2

          If the United States signs a sequence of spoke agreements that are

complements from the Canadian point of view, then Canada will likely benefit

from the expanding prosperity of the hemisphere. On the other hand, suppose

that, for Canada, these new spoke agreements are substitUtes. As the United



 18 To illustrate: If, over a period of, say, 10-15 years, the Mexicans were able
to cut their productivity gap with the United States by just a quarter, their
income could rise by more than a hundred percent.

                                  17
States adds each new spoke, Canada loses and sees its benefit from its own

original FTA with the United States erode. But even in this case, it will still

paradoxically be in Canada's interest to participate as a spoke in this U.S.

centered system rather than to decline. Indeed, the same will remain true even if,

as the United States continues to add spoke agreements throughout the

hemisphere, the Canadian losses come to exceed its gains from its original FTA

with the United States. The same is true for any other spoke: It may lose from

this whole process and therefore wish that it had never taken place; but it will

still have an incentive to participate. The reason for this paradoxical conclusion

is that all a spoke is able to decide is whether it will get the benefits of free trade

with the U.S. hub. If it signs a bilateral with the United States, it gets those

benefits; if it says no, it does not. Its decision has little influence over the U.S.

hub as the United States adds new bilaterals that discriminate against the spoke.

The spoke cannot escape from this problem, whether or not it decides to join the

hub-and-spoke system.

         If this is the only way that a spoke can get free trade with the United

States, it will have not only the incentive of benefiting from the expansion of

its trade with the United States as described above, but also the incentive of

avoiding damage to its present trade. For example, Mexico has viewed a

bilateral free trade agreement with the United States as a way of reducing the risk

of being the target of Super-301 or some other form of U.S. unilateral trade

remedy action. This raises the question: Could aggressive U.S. unilateral

policies like Super-301 be used by the United States to put pressure on its

                                          18
trading partners to participate in a new, highly discriminatory form of U.S.

bilateralism, namely the development of a U.S-centered hub-and-spoke system?

In our judgment, this is not why these unilateral U.S. policies were introduced;

nonetheless, they could be used in this way, either by inadvertence or design.

         Now consider the alternative way for countries in the hemisphere to

liberalize their trade with the United States -- that is, through an expanding

plurilateral FTA. In the simple, three-country North American case that we have

been analyzing, it will now be shown why a U.S. parmer -- Canada -- can be

expected to prefer such a trilateral FTA to a hub-and-spoke system.


         Step Three: A Canada-Mexico Bilateral FTA, Essentially
         Transforming the Hub-and-Spoke System in Step Two
         into a Trilateral FTA. Or, How Does a Trilateral FTA
         Compare to a Hub-and-Spoke System?
         The effects on Canada of this bilateral with Mexico can be shown in

equation (7), as follows:

         On the import side, the elimination of the Canadian tariff on

Mexican goods will have three possible effects:

         1.     Canada will switch some of its import purchases away from

lower-cost sources in the ROW to Mexico. (The Canadian import of clothing

from Mexico rather than the Pacific Rim is one expected example.) As the

Canadian domestic price falls there will, following the reasoning leading to

equation (6), be a volume-of-trade benefit based on the degree to which increased

imports from Mexico in IV exceed decreased imports from the ROW in VI.



                                     19
There will also be a Canadian terms-of-trade loss in V to the degree that Mexico

is a more expensive source than the ROW.

          2.     Canada will restore its imports from Mexico that were switched

earlier to the high-cost United States due to the Canada-U.S. PTA, yielding

Canada a terms-of-trade benefit through I. (In that earlier PTA, the United States

alone got preference in the Canadian market; now Mexico also gets it.) Since

these imports from Mexico will now come into Canada duty free, the Canadian

domestic price will fall and Canadian imports will accordingly increase.

Therefore there will also be a volume-of-trade benefit for Canada whose size will

depend on how much the increase in imports from Mexico in IV exceeds the

reduction in imports from the United States in ji.19

         3.     Finally, Canadian tariff reduction will induce more import

purchases from Mexico in products where Mexico is the least-cost source. This

will cause an additional volume-of-trade benefit for Canada in IV, but an

unfavorable terms-of-trade change in Ill as Canada gives up any favorable terms-

of-trade effect from, its previous tariff against Mexico.

         It is not clear how the three conflicting influences on Canada's terms of

trade cited in the three cases above would compare. It would be difficult to argue



19 Formally, as in equation (6), the volume-of-trade effect taking into account
both IV and H will be:

                            (pc - pe) [c M + dzn US]

where the world price pe is the price at which Canada now purchases from
Mexico.

                                         20
that the total effect on Canadian welfare of increased imports from Mexico would

be negative, however, since in each of the three cases the volume-of-trade effects

are positive.

         Although some ambiguity remains, it is substantially reduced when the

effect on Canadian exports is considered.

         On the export side, the effects on Canada would be unambiguously

positive. Canada would both receive a higher price for its exports to Mexico and

sell more as a result of the elimination of the Mexican tariffs. (Notice that the

Mexican tariff removal eliminates the previous discrimination against Canada

that Mexico established when signing an FTA with the United States.20)

Moreover, there would be another favorable effect Canada-Mexico free trade

would guarantee Canadian industry access to duty-free Mexican inputs that would

keep it globally more competitive -- in particular, in expanding its exports to the

ROW and in allowing it to compete more effectively with U.S. industry in the

United States, Canada and elsewhere. Because of the dominance of the United

States in the Canadian trading picture, restoring Canada's competitive position

vis-a-vis the United States in the U.S. market may paradoxically be where much

of the effect on Canada of its trade liberalization with Mexico would be played

out

         To sum up: the effects on Canada from its bilateral with Mexico point

to an expectation of net gain. Since this third bilateral would, to a substantial


20 Again, following footnote 9, the effects of both the increase in exports and
the higher price received for them would appear in element HI.

                                      21
degree, transform a hub-and-spoke into an FTA,21 this implies that for a spoke

such as Canada, a trilateral ETA is preferred to a hub-and-spoke system -- with

key reasons being that an ETA alone provides Canadian finns with duty-free

access to inexpensive Mexican inputs and the expanding Mexican market, along

with full escape from discrimination there in competition with U.S. firms.

         This conclusion can very simply be illustrated by considering the

limiting case in which all countries in the hemisphere are included in an ETA.

Then Canada would look out on a hemisphere in which it would enjoy tariff-free

trade in all directions, with the expected gains from trade this implies. Compare

this to a hemisphere-wide hub-and-spoke system, in which Canada would see free

trade as it looks to the United States, but face a Byzantine maze of

discriminatory trade restrictions as it looks towards other hemispheric countries.




21 This is not a precise transformation, since the creation of a full bilateral
ETA would still require an agreement by all three countries on certain issues --
in particular the reformulation of bilateral rules of origin. Moreover, once the
United States has more than 2 or 3 spoke agreements, transforming such a hub-
and-spoke system into a plurilateral FTA by bilateral agreements among spokes
becomes essentially impossible because of the large number of such agreements
that would be required.
      Furthermore, two things could come from a bilateral negotiation that
would not come from U.S.-Mexico and Canada-Mexico bilaterals: First, there
could be a large potential benefit to Canada from a thiateral negotiation, insofar
as Canada would get the same favorable non-tariff access to the U.S. market as
Mexico -- for example, in U.S. government procurement contracts. On the other
hand, a trilateral might increase the likelihood of a reopening of the Canada-U.S.
ETA, which is far more important to Canada than any free trade arrangement
with Mexico. This has been expressed as a concern by Gordon Ritchie, the
former deputy Canadian nde negotiator in the Canada-U.S. ETA (Hill and
Wonnacott, 1991, p. 11). While there is a serious potential problem, it is not
guaranteed that Canada would lose from such a reopening; it is possible that it
might benefit.

                                        22
          Moreover, what is true for Canada is also true for Mexico or any other

potential U.S. spoke partner down the road, regardless of when it may be

included in the sequence. Each such partner could expect net benefits from its

own bilateral with the United States, but might well be damaged by U.S. spoke

bilaterals with other countries. But whether or not a partner is damaged, it can

be expected to prefer an expanding plurilateral free trade area to a hub-and-spoke

system
         22

          This preference by each U. S. partner for an FTA will be strengthened

in the last section when we go beyond this theory of preferential trading to

consider some of the other effects of a hub-and-spoke system on the participating

countries. But first, consider the view from the U.S; hub.



IV.       THE VIEW FROM THE HUB

         For the U.S. hub, the analysis yields fewer clear expectations at each

stage than it did for a spoke. Rather than attempting to carefully catalog often

conflicting details of benefits and costs, we will sketch the argument.

         A Hub-and-Spoke System
         In its existing bilateral FTA with Canada, a key question for the United

States is how its likely terms-of-trade loss as a relatively large country from

giving up its own tariff -- i.e., the flip side of the terms-of-trade benefit acquired


22 One important reason that other counthes can be expected to take much the
same view as Canada is because, like Canada, they are relatively small when
compared with the United States. Indeed, because they are economically even
smaller than Canada, this role is in fact clearer in their case.

                                      23
by Canada -- will compare with its gains from increased trade, including the

benefits it gets from flee access to the Canadian market and from the preferences

it acquires there.

         Moreover, for the "large" United States, this continues to be the key

trade-off every time it adds a bilateral with Mexico or any other country in the

hemisphere, all of which are relatively small: How does its terms-of-trade loss

compare to its benefits from increased trade, including those resulting from the

preference it acquires in each spoke market not only in competition with

counthes outside the hemisphere but also in competition with its other spoke

partners within.23

         A Hub-and-Spoke System Compared to an FTA
         Does the United States prefer a hub-and-spoke system to an F1'A?

Unlike its partners, it could look out over a hub-and-spoke hemisphere and see

free trade in all directions with all the benefits of an FTA inéluding (1) free

market access to all its hemispheric partners and (2) the preference it would get

in each hemispheric market in competition with all counthes outside the

hemisphere. In addition, a hub-and-spoke would provide the United States with

an advantage not available in an ETA -- namely, the preference it would get in

eh.spoke market (e.g. Mexico) in competition with all other spokes such as

Canada. Moreover, the fact that it would be the only country in the hemisphere


23 Of course, at each stage the United States faces other costs (e.g., from
switching its import purchases from a lower-cost outside source to its new spoke
partner) and other benefits (e.g., from reversing some of the switching that
occurred previously when it signed on earlier spokes).

                                        24
to get free-trade access to all spoke markets would give it a location advantage

over other spokes, with potential tax and other benefits this could imply.

         However, other factors would tend to make a plurilateral ETA relatively

more attractive for the United States than a hub-and-spoke system. To illustrate:

because U.S. partners Canada and Mexico would likely acquire higher real

income under a plurilateral ETA, U.S. exports and hence U.S. real income would

tend to be greater.24 There is no clear answer as to which regime the United

States would prefer. Also, there are factors, such as economies of scale, that are

not discussed here that the United States (and its partners) would have to take

into account in comparing the two systems.


V.       FURTHER PROBLEMS IN A HUB-AND-SPOKE
         SYSTEM

         There are several reasons why total hemispheric income would likely be

less in a hub-and-spoke system than in a plurilateral ETA -- reasons that will

reinforce the preference of each U.S. partner for an ETA, and that may even lead

the U.S. hub, the country most likely to prefer a hub-and-spoke system, to also

judge an ETA superior.


24 The effects on the United States of moving from a hub-and spoke system to
an ETA could be dealt with more formally by examining a U.S. equation similar
to (7), except of course that the roles of Canada and the United States would be
reversed. It is now the United States -- the outsider to the third-stage Canada-
Mexico bilateral — that would have to address the question of whether that
bilateral would be a substitute or a complement Higher real income in Canada
and Mexico would make it more likely that the United States would view this
bilateral as a complement and hence prefer an ETA. On the other hand, the U.S.
loss of preference in the markets of Canada and Mexico would make it more
likely that the United States would view the Canada-Mexico bilateral as a
substitute and hence prefer a hub and spoke.

                                      25
          The Waste of Real Resources in a Hub-and-Spoke System
          Due to Higher Administrative and Transport Costs

          The analysis so far applies to a hub-and-spoke system in which the

U.S. hub has consistent bilaterals with all the spokes (i.e., its tariffs and NTBs

aethesameiniradewitheachspoke--not,say,atariffofzeminj
one spoke, and 2% with another). Since even such a consistent system would be

a more complex trading network than an FTA, there would be a waste of the
extra time and effort that management, economists, lawyers, and accountants

would have to devote to determining the least expensive trade and investment

patterns throughout this maze. To illustrate, should some direct Brazil-Mexico

trade be re-routed through the only duty-free path available, i.e., through the

United States? While the extra time required to answer such questions would

provide a private payoff to lawyers, economists, and accountants, froma broader

point of view it would be an unnecessary waste of these resources. Moreover

when such a re-routing does take place, it implies a further waste due to higher

transport costs.

         All these wastes may escalate if it is no longer assumed that all

bilaterals are consistent.



         The Costs or Rent-Seeking in a Hub-and-Spoke System
         As a hub-and-spoke system develops, the question arises: which

country will be the next spoke? There is then the possibility of lobbying

pressure by rent-seeking firms in the hub to influence the selection of the next


                                        26
country or sequence of countries and the form of the bilateral agreement with

each so as to provide these firms with the best configuration of special

preferences. The argument here is parallel to the traditional one in which rent-

seeking firms seek to establish special benefits from the creation of, say, a

monopoly position. Both preference in a foreign market and a domestic

monopoly position are created by restricting the entry of competitors; in the case

of trade preference described here, the restricted entry is into spoke markets by

competitors from other spokes (and from outside the hemisphere).25 In either

case, rent seeking represents a social waste, though, of course, it may provide a

benefit to the firms that engage in this activity. Moreover, it need not be

limited to firms in the hub; firms in spoke countries and prospective spoke

countries may also engage in rent-seeking attempts to influence the sequencing

of bilaterals.

         This means that one oft-cited advantage of a bilateral ETA -- it allows

the two countries to tailor an agreement to their own special needs --must be

recontlered.. True, this ability to tailor remains an advantage (though not

necessarily a decisive one) of a bilateral over a multilateral negotiation in which

the agenda may be set or even heavily influenced by third countries with other

problems. But it is a disadvantage of a bilateral if it is one of the spoke


    Mi ETA, like a hub-and-spoke system, also restricts entry by competitors
from outside the hemisphere. The difference is that an PTA does not restrict
entry by competitors from within the hemisphere and one would expect,
therefore, less intense rent-seeking in an ETA. One would also expect less
administrative and transport cost waste in an ETA because it would be less
complex. It goes without saying that, in comparing the two systems, it is the
difference in any of these wastes that is relevanL

                                       27
agreements in a hub-and-spoke system, since the ability to tailor means an

increase in the incentives for rent seeking, and a greater risk of inconsistencies in

the bilaterals.


          Problems or Managed Trade: Greater in a Hub-and-
          Spoke?
          Negotiators may have an incentive to include elements of managed trade

in any ETA, since this may allow them to satisfy two constituencies at once:

(1) the free trade provisions required by the ETA generate support from free

traders, while (2) the managed trade provisions, with their cartel-like, market-

sharing provisions, protect employment and generate support from

protectionists, If a country is comparing a bilateral spoke agreement to joining

an existing FTA, can anything be said about the likelihood of negotiating free

trade provisions versus managed trade provisions?

          It is possible for a spoke bilateral to include more &ee trade provisions

than could be achieved in the expansion of an ETA. Indeed, as already noted, one

of the traditionally cited advantages of a bilateral is that greater progress in

liberalizing trade may be possible for two countries than for more than two.

Nonetheless, conceding this, we still, on balance, have a concern that there may

be a greater risk that two countries, in the relative freedom of negotiating a

bilateral, may cartelize markets in managed trade configurations. This risk may

also be greater, the fewer the industries covered. In either respect, the fewer the

players, the easier it may be for cartel-like arrangements to be set up by

negotiators who, recognizing the political resistance to their trade agreement that

                                           28
must be overcome, may have an incentive to neutralize some opposition groups

by providing them with managed trade provisions. True, by protecting existing

producers, managed trade reduces short-run adjustment cost; however, in the long

run, the protection these producers receive may leave them less able to meet

foreign competition, and the whole process of reallocating resources to capture

benefits from freer trade will be deterred.



VI.      CONCLUDING REMARKS

         In either a North American or Western Hemisphere context in which the

U.S. is, in many goods, the "large country" and other countries are small, the

development of a hub-and-spoke system centered on the United States can be

expected to provide each spoke with real income benefits on signing its own

bilateral agreement with the United States, but gains or losses as the United

States signs bilateral agreements with other spokes, depending on whether each

new agreement is a complement or substitute. However, in either case a spoke

can be expected to prefer an expanding FFA



    There are a number of alternatives besides the polar hub-and-spoke and
trilateral ETA outcomes considered here. For example, there might be a trilateral
core agreement covering issues on which the three countries could agree, plus a
U.S. bilateral on other more contentious issues with one or each of the other
two countries. In this case the resulting agreement would be a combination of
core (FTA) characteristics and bilateral (hub-and-spoke) characteristics -- unless
all the bilazerals are on exclusively bilateral issues. An example would be low-
wage service trade along the Mexican-U.S. border, where a U.S.-Mexico bilateral
would not affect Canada in any way and would therefore not have any
discriminatory hub-and-spoke implications. Compare this to a Mexican-U.S.
bilateral agreement on, say, government procurement which clearly could create
discrimination against Canada.

                                       29
          For the U.S. hub, each spoke agreement will generate a net benefit or

loss, depending heavily on how its term-of-trade losses as a "large country"

compare to the benefits it receives from its increaed volume of trade and

preferred location. Will the United Statesprefer a hub-and-spoke to an expanding

PTA? If the analysis is limited to the effects of preferential trading -- that is,

preferred access by the U.S. hub to spoke markets -- then the conclusion is that

the U.S. will prefer a hub-and-spoke system. However, that judgment will be

eroded and perhaps reversed by broader considerations, such as the effect of a hub-

and-spoke system in generating smaller increases in income in spoke markets --

and hence   a smaller increase in U.S. exports to these markets; and the

expectation that higher administrative, transportation and rent-seeking wastes iii

a hub-and-spoke system will have a depressing effect on the real income of all

participating countries including the U.S. hub -- especially if, as is almost

certain, the spoke bilaterals are inconsistent.

         As a final note, one might cast the net even wider into somewhat more

speculative territory. Would a hub-and-spoke system encourage a new form of

U.S. "domestic-export protectionism" aimed at protecting U.S. firms against

foreign competition, not just in the domestic market as always, but also in the

markets of spoke countries where U.S. exporters would be protected by

preferential treatment? The problem with such protectionism is that it could

block initiatives by the U.S. administration to further liberalize trade, either in

the GAIl' or by transforming the hub-and-spoke system into a plurilateral PTA.

"Protectionist" U.S. exporters might resist either type of liberalization because it

                                         30
would strip them of their special preference in spoke markets. Moreover, this

protectionism might effectively be disguised as support for free trade, since its

proponents could claim that all they would be doing would be to defend an

existing set of U.S. bilateral free trade agreements. The U.S. administration,

traditionally under fire from protectionism in any case, might find it even more

difficult to resist this new and more subtle form. An additional question to

consider is whether, in the development of a hub-and-spoke system, the U.S.

might be perceived as attempting to enlarge its already dominant role in the

hemisphere through a nding structure that would leave hemispheric markets

carved up into a patchwork of what the United States would view as preferences,

but that its partner countries would view as damaging discrimination. Indeed,

such a preferential system could prove not to be sustainable over any significant

period of time.
