Evolution of Assessments of the Economics of Global Warming: Changes in the DICE model,
1992 – 2017

                                           ABSTRACT

Many areas of the natural and social sciences involve complex systems that link together multiple
sectors. Integrated assessment models (IAMs) are approaches that integrate knowledge from two
or more domains into a single framework, and these are particularly important for climate change.
One of the earliest IAMs for climate change was the DICE/RICE family of models, first
published in Nordhaus (1992), with the latest version in Nordhaus (2017, 2017a). A difficulty in
assessing IAMs is the inability to use standard statistical tests because of the lack of a
probabilistic structure. In the absence of statistical tests, the present study examines the extent of
revisions of the DICE model over its quarter-century history. The study finds that the major
revisions have come primarily from the economic aspects of the model, whereas the
environmental changes have been much smaller. Particularly sharp revisions have occurred for
global output, damages, and the social cost of carbon. These results indicate that the economic
projections are the least precise parts of IAMs and deserve much greater study than has been the
case up to now, especially careful studies of long-run economic growth (to 2100 and beyond).

I. Introduction

        Many areas of the natural and social sciences involve complex systems that
link together multiple physical or economic sectors. This is particularly true for
climate change, which has strong roots in the natural sciences and requires social
and policy sciences to solve in an effective and efficient manner. As understanding
progresses across the different fronts, it is increasingly necessary to link together
the different areas to develop effective understanding and efficient policies. In this
role, integrated assessment analysis and models play a key role. Integrated
assessment models (IAMs) can be defined as approaches that integrate knowledge
from two or more domains into a single framework. These are sometimes
theoretical but are increasingly involve computerized dynamic models of varying
levels of complexity.
       One of the earliest IAMs for climate change was the DICE/RICE family of
models, developed starting in 1989 and published in Nordhaus (1992, 1994). The
DICE (Dynamic Integrated model of Climate and the Economy) and RICE (Regional
Integrated model of Climate and the Economy) models have gone through several
revisions since their first development. An intermediate version was Nordhaus
(2008). The latest published version is DICE-2016R (Nordhaus 2017, 2017a), with a
complete description of the penultimate model in Nordhaus and Sztorc (2013).
Since the earliest versions, the DICE model has been through many iterations,
incorporating more recent economic and scientific findings and updated economic
and environmental data.
       One of the major shortcomings of IAMs is that their structure makes it
extremely difficult to use standard econometric techniques to assess their reliability
– a feature that is shared with earth systems models and other large simulation
models. In the absence of statistical tests, the present study examines the extent and
area of revisions of the DICE model from its earliest publication in 1992 to its latest
version published in 2017. This retrospective gives a flavor for changes in the
underlying economic and earth sciences, data revisions, correction of mistakes, as
well as the pure passage of time. In addition, for those estimates that have included
estimated errors in past studies, it is possible to compare the actual revisions with
the estimated errors.
       Before presenting the details, I will highlight the results. The major revisions
in the modeling have come from the economic sectors, whereas the environmental
changes have been much smaller. In terms of elementary inputs, future global
output was revised upwards massively over the years. Estimates of 2100 global
output has been revised up by a factor of 3½ since the 1990 period. The second
                                                                                          2
major revision has been in the damage function, which has been revised upwards by
60%. None of the other major input variables or functions have had anywhere near
those levels of revisions. (The reasons for the revisions will be discussed below.)
       In terms of major output variables, the major revision occurred for the
estimate of the social cost of carbon (SCC). The estimate of the 2015 SCC increased
from $5 to $31 per ton of CO2. As we will see below, this was the results of
compounded revisions in driving variables. Most of the environmental variables had
relatively small revisions, and ones that were within the estimated error bounds.
For example, 2100 temperature increase was originally 3.2 °C and was revised
upwards to 4.3 °C in the latest version. Industrial emissions were revised downward
slightly over the years.


    II.    Methods and Results

           a. Methods
   The approach to determining the impact of revisions was the following. I began
with the 1992 GAMS version of the DICE model (“DICE.1.2.3”).2 Fortunately, the
1992 GAMS code was compatible with the 2017 software, so it could be run to
duplicate the 1992 results. In the first estimates shown here, I will simply compare
the estimates or projections in the two models. In the last section, I will show the
sources of the changes.3




2The "1" indicates that it is a one-region model; the "2" that it is the second major version;
and the "3" indicates that it uses the third-round estimate of the data. Documentation for
this version is contained in Nordhaus (1992a).

3It will be instructive to indicate that the task of converting models is not always trivial.
The earlier model was in 1989 US dollars at market exchange rates, while the latest model
was in 2010 US international dollars. If we look at the US price index for GDP, the ratio of
2010 to 1989 prices is 1.57. However, this is not representative of the world because of the
changing composition of output and growth rates of different countries. If we take the ratio
of real to nominal GDP for the IMF data for market exchange rates, the ratio is 1.52 for
1985 (the last year with actual data for the 1992 model). The IMF’s calculation of the global
price level change from 1989 to 2010 is 2.02 for the PPP concept and 1.70 for the MER
concept. We have taken a reflator of 2.0 to represent the PPP concept. This adjustment is
only important for the first step in the process (v6). For the second step, which adjusts to
2015 levels of output, the reflator becomes irrelevant.
                                                                                                 3
          b. Results for 2015
       It is useful to examine the results for 2015. These are historical data in the
latest version (subject of course to revisions) but are projections in the earliest
version. The 1992 version used data from the mid-1980, so the projections to 2015
can be seen as 30-year-ahead forecasts. Table 1 shows the projections and actual
values for 2015. The errors were large in many areas. The first column shows the
estimates for 2015 in the 1992 model, while the second column shows the estimate
for 2015 from the 2017 model, which are actual data. The third numerical column
shows the change from 1992 to 2017, which is the forecast error in the 1992 model.
       Output and population were underestimated substantially. Emissions and
other forcings were overestimated because the rate of decarbonization was
underestimate. Concentrations were correctly projected, while temperature was
overestimated (as with most earth system models). The largest error was the social
cost of carbon (SCC), which was hugely underestimated because the different factors
compounded. An interesting note is that the SCC was actually not calculated in the
early version of the model and was first introduced in the 2008 version, so
estimates of the SCC for early versions are retrospective estimates.
          c. Projections for 21004
       Table 1 provides a guide to the errors that arise in IAMs like the DICE model,
and it also shows how model histories can track errors when models have a
sufficiently long history. Table 2 shows the estimated total revisions between 1992
and 2017 for major variables.
      The first three columns are similar to those in Table 1. The last two columns
show estimated uncertainties (measured as standard deviations) from two studies
of uncertainty (Nordhaus 2008, 2017a). The first estimate used the 2008 DICE
model and made estimates of uncertainty for several variables. These are shown in
the uncertainty column labeled “2008.” The second study calculated the standard
deviation of the variables using the DICE-2016R model, and are shown as “2017.”
      The pattern of revisions for 2100 shown in Table 2 is similar to the pattern of
errors in Table 1 for 2015. The most striking revision in the driving variables is a
massive upward revision in world GDP. A major part of this revision is moving from
market exchange rates (common until about 2000) to purchasing power parity
exchange rates. A second change is the feature that early versions of the DICE model


4We have used the label “2100” in this study. Strictly speaking, the year was 2105 in the
DICE model.
                                                                                            4
as well as other energy-economy models were based on estimates that had a strong
stagnationist bias, with sharply falling productivity growth after 2025 (see
Nordhaus and Yohe 1983, Table 2.7). Factors driving emissions and forcings, by
contrast, were revised downward sharply.
       If we look at the bottom group of variables in Table 2, we see an interesting
pattern. Emissions, concentrations, and forcings were generally underestimated, but
by a relatively small fraction. However, economic variables such as output, damages,
and the SCC were massively underestimated. This finding, that the economic
variables were the major sources of uncertainty, is one of the most striking results
of the current retrospective.
      As a final comparison, Table 3 shows the DICE 1992 and 2016R models and
compares them with the IPCC reports of approximately the same dates (IPCC 1990,
2014). The first IPCC report had a “business as usual” scenario that is comparable to
the DICE model baseline. The fifth report abandoned this approach and instead had
representative concentrations pathways, for which the RCP 8.5 is the closest to a
business as usual case. Note the upward revision in 2100 temperature in both IPCC
and DICE model approaches.
          d. Uncertainty estimates
      Additionally, it is useful to determine whether estimates of the forecast errors
were helpful in understanding the potential forecast errors. Systematic studies of
forecast errors using Monte-Carlo-type techniques were undertaken for the 2008
model and the 2016R model. The latter set are more comprehensive but they have
the drawback of being retrospective error estimates.
       Table 4 shows the “error forecast ratio,” which is the ratio of the change in
forecasts between 1992 and 2017 relative to the estimated forecast uncertainty
(measured as the standard deviation). Conceptually, these are similar to t-ratios
although they do not have a formal probabilistic structure. Designate xi(m, n) as the
observation or projection of variable xi for a future period m when estimated at date
n. Using this notation, the ultimate prediction error in 2100 relative to the 1992
model is xi(2100, 2100) - xi(2100,1992)] = [xi(2100, 2100)- xi(2100, 2017)]+ [xi(2100,
2017)- xi(2100, 1992)]. Table 4 shows the second of the two terms. Because this
calculation omits the first term, this means that the ultimate error is very likely to be
substantially larger than the second term, so the ratio shown in Table 4 is an
underestimate of the ultimate error forecast ratio.
      Notwithstanding this reservation, note that the largest error ratios are in the
order of 1 and occur for temperature, per capita output, output, damages, and the

                                                                                        5
SCC. These estimates indicate that, while the projection errors to date and in some
cases are very large (for example for the SCC), structural estimates of the underlying
processes indicate that the uncertainties for variables like the SCC and output are
intrinsically also extremely high. So we should not be surprised that output or SCC
estimates have been substantially revised, or that there are more major revisions in
sight.
    III.   Decomposition of the changes
    A final question is the source of the changes for the projections of different
variables with respect to revisions in the model structure and the economic and
environmental data. The approach is straightforward in principle but complicated in
practice. It involves starting with the earliest version of 1992 and then introducing
model and data differences between 1992 and 2017 models one step at a time. We
then evaluate the impact on different variables at each step. We can thereby
determine how large are the revisions for the important variables, and the sources
of the revisions. There is of course some ambiguity in this approach to the extent
that there are interdependencies among revisions. However, most of the step-by-
step changes come in a natural order, so the results are likely to be insensitive to
ordering.
       Table 5 shows the adjustments made step by step. We label the changes as
being different “versions” marked by vj. Some of the steps or versions are trivial or
make checks and will not be included in the discussion below. It is important to note
that the sequence is a logical progression and not a temporal set of steps. Some of
the earliest steps (such as the change to 2010$) came at the end, while there were
several changes in the carbon cycle modeling in the intervening years.
       It will be useful to show two important examples. Table 6 shows the
decomposition for the social cost of carbon for 2015. This, it will be recalled, has the
largest single revision. The change comes from multiple variables. The largest
contributor is the revision in the treatment of the carbon cycle, while the others are
primarily economic variables such as the damage function and the utility function.5
With the exception of emissions intensity, all the revisions were upwards.
      Table 7 shows a similar calculation for 2100 temperature increase. The total
change here is much smaller, with the largest contributor being the carbon cycle.
Most of the other changes were modest and were both positive and negative. (The

5The change in the utility function involved both a change in the rate of time preference
and a change in the elasticity of the marginal utility of consumption. These affect the real
return and the impact of changes in productivity growth on different variables.
                                                                                               6
line “DICE-2016R” refers to all other contributing factors that were not individually
estimated.)
      Tables 8 and 9 show the complete set of revision results for the years 2015
and 2100. The first column is the replication of the results for DICE-1992. The first
column is useful for non-economic variables because it is in different prices. The
second column (v6) updates the price level to that in the current study and is the
version used for the endpoint comparisons in the prior sections.
      The changes for selected variables are usefully displayed in Figures 1 and 2.
Figure 1 shows the decomposition of the changes for variables in 2015, while Figure
2 shows for variables in 2100. The figures also show projections from the 1990 and
2014 IPCC reports as well as standard errors of the estimates where those are
available.
    A complete compilation is provided in Tables 8 and 9. The sources of the changes
differ by variable. Here are some of the highlights. In this discussion, I will ignore
the first line in the table, which is simple price-level change. In each of these
decompositions, I examine what changes in model design or in data led to the major
changes in the output variable from 1992 to 2017.
    If we look at the change in 2015 global output due to model changes, it is not
     surprising that most of the change came from the adjustment of the level of
     2015 output. Other net changes for 2015 output were minor.
    The major environmental variables for 2100 were relatively stable. Emissions
     and concentrations wobbled around with revisions, but there were only
     minor net changes. These were stable in part because the mechanisms that
     drive these processes were relatively well understood in the 1990s and
     partially because there are no ambiguities in how to measure the variables.
    The huge increase in projected 2100 global output was partially because of
     the upward revision in the base 2015 output, but primarily because of a
     major change in projected productivity growth. For output, there are both
     measurement and process issues. It is clear that the mechanism underlying
     productivity growth is non-stationary, which makes forecasting extremely
     difficult.
    Most changes in economic variables are driven by upward revisions in the
     measures of output and in TFP (productivity) growth, as discussed above.




                                                                                        7
   IV.    Conclusions
   This paper analyzes the changes in the DICE model analysis of the economics of
climate change over the last quarter century. Over that period, the central analytical
structure of the model has remained the same, while most of the components have
been revised in small or large ways, and there have been major revisions and
improvements in most of the underlying data.
    The major message of the study is simple. The projections of most environmental
variables (such as emissions, concentrations, and temperature change) have seen
relatively small revisions (with the emphasis here on relatively). However, there
have been massive changes in the projections of the economic variables, including
those that were forecast in 1992 and have now been realized in 2017. The stability
of the environmental variables largely reflects that these were relatively well-
understood by the early 1990s, and therefore modeling of these components within
IAMs could be based on a solid scientific foundation.
    By contrast, the dominant underlying change in the results of this IAM has been
in the economic sectors, particularly in the measurement or prospect of current and
future global output per capita. A useful example is the revision in global output for
2015. The level of 2015 output (in 2010$) was revised upwards by 35% over the
period. Most of this was conceptual, involving the change from market exchange
rates to purchasing power parity. The major revision in the 2100 outlook for output
was a change from the stagnationist view of global growth in the 1980s and 1990s
to a view of continued rapid growth today. This change can be seen by comparing
the survey in Nordhaus and Yohe (1983) with that of Christensen et al (2017). As a
result of these two changes, projected 2100 output per capita was revised upward
by a factor of 3½ over the period. This major upward revision drove all economic
variables, including damages and the social cost of capital.
   A further major revision has been in the damage function. There was essentially
no established aggregate damage function in the early 1990s, and this module of the
DICE model was put together based on very rudimentary primary information.
   Another large change has been in the rate of decarbonization, where the
revisions have been to lower emissions per unit output over the period. This was
largely due to the upward revision in output (which was not well measured)
compared to a stable estimate of emissions (which was relatively well measured).
   Perhaps the most dramatic revision has been the social cost of carbon (SCC). The
SCC for 2015 has been revised upwards from $5 to $31 per ton of CO2 over the last

                                                                                     8
quarter-century. This is the result of several different model changes as shown in
Table 6. While this large a change is unsettling, it must be recognized that there is a
large estimated error in the SCC. The estimated (5%, 95%) uncertainty band for the
SCC in the 2016R model is ($6, $93) per ton of CO2. This wide band reflects the
compounding uncertainties of the temperature sensitivity, output growth, damage
function, and other factors. Moreover, it must be recognized that analyses of the
social cost of carbon were not widespread until after 2000. Finally, estimates of the
SCC are both highly variable across model and specification and have increased
substantially over the last quarter-century. If we take early estimates of the SCC
from two other well-known models (PAGE and FUND), these were close to estimates
in the DICE1992 model.
    A final result concerns the estimated uncertainty of the estimates. Because of
their non-statistical structure, it is difficult to estimate the uncertainties associated
with future forecasts of IAMs. Two sets of formal estimates of uncertainty for the
model (in 2008 and 2017) were examined and compared with actual errors. While a
complete comparison is not available, the actual errors to date (measured as
forecast revisions) are reasonably within the error bands. This suggests that studies
of the uncertainties of IAM projections are an important companion to standard
projections as a way of signaling the reliability of different projections (a recent
multi-model study of uncertainty is in Gillingham et al. 2015).
    Both earlier studies and the results of this retrospective indicate that the
economic components and projections are the least precise and the most deserving
of future study. This applies especially to studies of long-run economic growth (to
2100 and beyond). Aside from climate-change policies, uncertainties and revisions
about economic growth are likely to be the major factors behind changing prospects
for climate change in the years to come.

   Table 8. Decomposition of the changes in important variables, 2100vii
The table shows the impact of different revisions on each variable for the 2100
projected level. For example, the top left column labelled “Industrial emissions”
shows the impact of the change in the variable labeled “Changed variable.” That is,
moving from v6 to v7 made a correction for initial (2015) output. This increased
projected 2100 emissions by 7 percent.

   Table 9. Decomposition of the changes in important variables, 2015 viii
The table shows the impact of different revisions on each variable for the 2015
projected level. For example, the top left column labelled “Industrial emissions”
shows the impact of the change in the variable labeled “Changed variable.” That is,
moving from v6 to v7 made a correction for initial (2015) output. This increased
projected 2015 emissions by 7 percent.

Figure 1. Changes in estimates for variables in 2015 ix
The figure shows the level of the variable for each version. For example, moving
from 1989 $ to 2010 $ had no effect on emissions but doubled output. The red
circles at the left are estimates from IPCC (1990), the green triangles at the right are
estimates from IPCC (2014). The arrows are 2016 estimates plus or minus one
standard deviation from Nordhaus (2017a). Where the line ends without an arrow,
the figure is off the chart.

Interpretation of legend on horizontal axis:
1965$:          DICE-1992 model (in 1989 $)
2010$:          DICE-1992 model (reflated to 2010$)
Q, K:           Adjustment for estimated output, capital in 2015
E, M:           Adjustment for estimated emissions and concentrations in 2015
DamF:           Change to 2017 damage function
TFP:            Change to level and growth of TFP (productivity) in 2017 model
Sigma:          Change to level and growth of global CO2/output ratio in 2017 model
Ufn:            Change to 2017 utility function
ClMod:          Change to 2017 climate model
CCyc:           Change to 2017 carbon cycle and parameters
ClPar:          Change to 2017 climate sensitivities
Abate:          Change to 2017 abatement function
