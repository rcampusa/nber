The Impact of Entrepreneurial Risk Aversion on Wages in General Equilibrium

                                              ABSTRACT

One of the leading theories of entrepreneurship is that less risk averse individuals become entrepreneurs
and more risk averse individuals become their employees. Kihlstrom and Laffont (1979) formalized
this insight in an elegant and widely taught general equilibrium model. However, their model has not
been further developed. A reason may be that their main comparative static result, that an economy-wide
increase in risk aversion lowers the equilibrium wage, appeared to require the assumption that all agents
had identical risk aversion index, throwing out their motivating insight and indicating that the model
is intractable. In this note we prove this comparative static result on risk aversion and wages in general
equilibrium, retaining agent heterogeneity in risk aversion and the endogenous division of agents into
less risk averse entrepreneurs and more risk averse workers, without adding any assumptions not already
in the original paper. Besides the intrinsic value of the result, we hope to increase the usefulness of
the Kihlstrom and Laffont (1979) model for other researchers and to facilitate improvement in its exposition
for the many graduate courses in which it is taught.

1       Introduction


Kihlstrom and Laffont (1979) (hereafter KL) and Lucas (1978) developed the two most popular

theories of entrepreneurship (Parker 2009, chapter 2). According to KL, entrepreneurship is de-

termined by risk aversion, with the less risk averse agents employing the more risk averse agents.

According to Lucas (1978), entrepreneurship is determined by managerial talent, with the more

talented agents employing the less talented agents. Written at the same time, KL and Lucas (1978)

have now accumulated 1,553 and 2,627 Google Scholar citations, respectively (accessed March 17,

2015). However, the otherwise parallel paths of these papers have diverged in one important re-

spect: whereas both papers have inspired vast amounts of empirical work, only Lucas (1978) has

been extended theoretically.1 To take a couple of widely cited examples, Evans and Jovanovic

(1989) extended Lucas’s model to the case of finance constraints, and Maksimovic and Phillips

(2002) extended it to two sectors across which managerial talent differs.


There could, of course, be many reasons why subsequent authors have found Lucas (1978) more

amenable to theoretical development than KL. Here we focus on one possible reason: readers were

discouraged by the apparent intractability of the KL model for comparative static analysis. Their

only comparative static result is that an increase in risk aversion lowers the equilibrium wage.2 This

result is intuitive: greater risk aversion causes agents to prefer wage work over entrepreneurship,

and also causes entrepreneurs to hire fewer workers. Nevertheless, in order to prove this result KL

set aside the motivating insight of their model that less risk averse agents employ more risk averse

agents. Instead, they in effect assumed that all agents had identical risk aversion index.


In this note we will prove the comparative static result on risk aversion and wages in general

equilibrium, retaining agent heterogeneity in risk aversion and the endogenous division of agents

into less risk averse entrepreneurs and more risk averse workers, without adding any assumptions

not already in KL. Besides the intrinsic value of the result, we hope to increase the usefulness of KL

for other researchers and to facilitate improvement in its exposition for the many graduate courses
    1
     Our assertion that KL has not been extended theoretically is based on our review of papers that cite it that
themselves have at least 25 Google Scholar citations. This is not to say that all such papers are purely empirical,
just that those with theoretical models invoke KL rather than build on their model.
   2
     They also include in their section on comparative statics the result that firm employment decreases with the risk
aversion of the entrepreneur (theorem 3), but they attribute this result to Baron (1970).

in which it is taught.


In the next section we will present the KL model briefly. In section 3 we will prove our result,

which is a revised version of KL theorem 4. In the following section we will show by example that

an interior solution to the KL model exists. Section 5 concludes.




2       KL Model Setup


KL identify the set of agents with the interval [0,1]. Individual α ∈ [0, 1] has the von Neumann

Morgenstern utility function u(I, α) where I ∈ [0, ∞) represents income. Agents are characterized

by the Arrow-Pratt absolute risk aversion measure r(I, α) = − uuIII (I,α)
                                                                     (I,α)
                                                                           , where r(I, α) is a strictly

increasing function of α for each I.3


Each agent can become an entrepreneur and use without cost a technology defined by a continuous

production function y = g(L, x) where y ≥ 0 is output, L ≥ 0 is the labor input and x is the

value taken by a nondegenerate random parameter x̃ with support [0, x̄], 0 < x̄ < +∞. The

objective stochastic distribution of x̃ is assumed to be the same for all firms. KL also assume

the marginal product gL is continuous and positive, and the second derivative gLL is continuous

and nonpositive, on [0, +∞) × [0, x̄]. Thus g exhibits nonincreasing returns to scale for each x.

In addition, g(0, x) = g(L, 0) = 0 for all x ∈ [0, x̄] and L ∈ [0, +∞), while g(L, x) > 0 on

(0, +∞) × (0, x̄].


The price of output is 1 and labor is hired at a competitive wage w. Agents can become en-

trepreneurs and receive an uncertain income of g(L, x̃) − wL, or they can become workers and

receive the market wage w. To avoid the problem of bankruptcy, KL assume that all individuals

begin with A units of income and that entrepreneurs are unable to hire workers who cannot be
                            A
paid if x̃ = 0. Thus L ≤    w   must hold.


The equilibrium in KL is then pinned down by three key steps. First, an individual who becomes
    3
    KL add the assumption that r is strictly increasing rather than non-decreasing in α in a Lemma (p. 725) that
precedes their proof of existence of equilibrium (theorem 1).




                                                       3
an entrepreneur chooses employment L(w, α) ∈ [0, A/ω] which solves4


                                         Max Eu(A + g(L, x̃) − wL, α).                                              (1)
                                           L



The assumptions on u and g guarantee that L(w, α) exists. If either uII < 0 or gLL < 0, then

L(w, α) will be unique.5


Second, the certainty equivalent wage w(α) of agent α is defined by6


                    Eu[A + g(L(w(α), α), x̃) − w(α)L(w(α), α), α] = u(A + w(α), α).                                 (2)


Thus, under market wage w(α), agent α is indifferent between work and entrepreneurship. More-

over, w(α) is continuous and monotonically decreasing:7 the more risk averse is the agent, the lower

is the wage that makes him indifferent between entrepreneurship and wage work.


Finally, a general equilibrium where the labor market clears is characterized by a marginal en-

trepreneur α̂ such that8
                                            Zα̂
                                                  L(w(α̂), α) dα = 1 − α̂,                                          (3)
                                            0

where agents with α ∈ [0, α̂] are entrepreneurs and agents with α ∈ (α̂, 1] are workers.


Thus, knowing α̂, we know the equilibrium wage w(α̂), and knowing w(α̂), we know L(w(α̂), α) for

every entrepreneur α ∈ [0, α̂]. KL go on to demonstrate the uniqueness of this equilibrium in their

theorem 2.
   4
     This is equation (3) on page 724 of KL.
   5
     The existence of L(w, α) is guaranteed by the continuity of the expectation operation, u, and g, plus the fact
that L is bounded in [0, Aw
                            ]. If either uII < 0 or gLL < 0, the objective function is strictly concave, so L(w, α) will
be unique. This last assumption is made in both theorem 1 and theorem 2 of KL.
   6
     This is equation (7) on page 724 of KL.
   7
     Prior to theorem 1 proving existence of equilibrium, KL add the assumption that u(I, α) is everywhere a contin-
uous function of α, from which the continuity of w(α) follows.
   8
     This is equation (14) on page 728 of KL. They use notation α̂∗ but we simplify it to α̂ for further use in our
proof.




                                                           4
3    Risk Aversion and the Equilibrium Wage


KL state their comparative static result as theorem 4, which we reproduce exactly here, noting

that α̂ is defined by KL as the marginal entrepreneur:


      Theorem 4: If (i) in equilibrium, all entrepreneurs are identical, (ii) either gLL < 0 or

      uII < 0, (iii) g(L, x) and gL (L, x) are both monotonically increasing (or decreasing)

      functions of x, and (iv) L(w, α̂) is an interior solution and a decreasing function of w,

      then an increase in the Arrow-Pratt absolute risk aversion measure r(I, α̂) for all I,

      lowers the equilibrium wage.


Unlike assumptions ii - iv, assumption i does not appear earlier in KL. To appreciate the importance

of assumption i, recall that the division of agents between entrepreneurs and workers is endogenous.

The only way, then, to guarantee that all entrepreneurs are identical in equilibrium is to assume that

all agents are identical. In this case, equilibrium is only possible when all agents are indifferent

between becoming entrepreneurs or becoming workers: otherwise there is either no demand for

labor or no supply of labor. With the wage determining the labor demand of every identical firm,

indifferent agents must divide between entrepreneurs and workers so as to provide enough firms to

exactly employ all the agents who do not operate firms. That is, in equilibrium the wage adjusts so

as to allow the division of indifferent agents between entrepreneurs and workers to clear the labor

market.


As theorem 4 is written, it is clear that equation (3) no longer applies because α̂ no longer divides

agents between entrepreneurs in [0, α̂] and workers in (α̂, 1]. In other words, it is no longer the case

that in equilibrium the less risk averse agents employ the more risk averse agents. Accordingly, KL

do not use equation (3) in their proof of theorem 4. Moreover, their statement of theorem 4 is at

odds with their remark 2 that immediately follows their statement of the theorem:


      Remark 2: The intuitive basis for the result is as follows. Since, in equilibrium, workers

      are the most risk averse individuals, an economy-wide increase in risk aversion increases

      the supply of workers and this tends to lower the wage. This tendency is reinforced

      by demand changes implied by theorem 3 which applies because of assumption iii.

                                                   5
       Specifically, theorem 3 implies that an increase in the entrepreneurs’ aversion to risk

       reduces the demand for labor.


Given assumption i, it is not meaningful to state that “in equilibrium, workers are the most risk

averse individuals,” and the economy-wide increase in risk aversion increases the supply of workers

only in the sense that each (identical) firm employs fewer workers at a given wage. Our main goal

in this note is thus to restate and prove theorem 4 so as to maintain the applicability of equation

(3) and fulfill the original intent of KL as embodied in their remark 2 quoted above.


Let the assumptions in KL theorem 1 (existence), KL theorem 2 (uniqueness), and KL theorem

3 (L(w, α) decreasing in entrepreneurial risk aversion) hold9 , as well as the assumption in their

Lemma (risk aversion increasing in α, not merely non-decreasing). We do not make assumption i

above. We can then state and prove the following revised version of KL theorem 410 :


THEOREM 4 (REVISED). An increase in the Arrow-Pratt absolute risk aversion measure r(I, α)

for all α ∈ [0, 1] and for all I lowers the equilibrium wage.


PROOF: Recall that the certainty equivalent wage w(α) is a continuous and monotonically decreas-

ing function of α. We can therefore invert this function to obtain the continuous and monotonically

decreasing function α(w), which gives the risk aversion index of the agent who is indifferent between

wage work and entrepreneurship at wage w. We can then rewrite equation (3):

                                           α(
                                           Z ŵ)
                                                L(ŵ, α) dα = 1 − α(ŵ),                                           (4)
                                            0


where ŵ is the equilibrium wage. Now consider an economy-wide increase in risk aversion to

r0 (I, α) > r(I, α), α ∈ [0, 1]. This implies α0 (ŵ) < α(ŵ), because when risk aversion increases,

holding w constant, the risk aversion index of the marginal agent must decrease, since otherwise the

marginal agent prefers wage work. r0 (I, α) > r(I, α), α ∈ [0, 1] also implies L0 (w, α) < L(w, α),11
   9
     Theorem 3 uses the assumption that L(w, α) < A       w
                                                            , but we actually do not need this assumption for our proof
below.
  10
     We interpret α as a pure index in our proof. An alternative proof, in which we interpret α as a parameter of
the utility function, is available at http://acsweb.ucsd.edu/~yif014/proof2-note-kl1979.pdf. In the alternative
proof we do not need assumption iii stated in KL theorem 4 above.
  11
     If, for some α, L(w, α) is not interior, then L0 (w, α) = L(w, α).



                                                          6
holding w constant, since L(w, α) is decreasing in risk aversion by KL theorem 3. Now rewrite

equation (4) as equation (5):

                                      0 (ŵ 0 )
                                     αZ

                                              L0 (ŵ0 , α) dα = 1 − α0 (ŵ0 ),                          (5)
                                       0


where ŵ0 is the new equilibrium wage. Comparing the two equations, it is clear that at the

equilibrium wage such that equation (4) holds (ŵ0 = ŵ), the left-hand side of equation (5) is

smaller than the right-hand side: there is an excess supply of labor. Because α0 (w) is decreasing

and L0 (w, α) is decreasing in w, a fall in ŵ0 (ŵ0 < ŵ) will restore labor market clearing. Q.E.D.


The seemingly innocuous assumption that L(w, α) is decreasing in w conceals some subtlety. As

KL explain in their remark 4 (p. 731), this holds if either (a) r(I, α) is a constant function of I, (b)

g(L, x) and gL (L, x) are both monotonically increasing (or decreasing) functions of x and r(I, α) is

a non-increasing function of I, or (c) g(L, x) satisfies g(L, x) = xh(L) and − IuuIII(A+I,α)
                                                                                      (A+I,α)
                                                                                              ≤ 1 for all I.

Those interested can read the proof of remark 4 in KL. Here, in order to build intuition, we simply

note that these conditions are needed because changing w also changes entrepreneurial income,

which (in general) affects their risk aversion and therefore their labor demand. For example,

consider assumption (b). If w increases, entrepreneurial income decreases, hence risk aversion

increases (or remains unchanged), reinforcing the negative effect on labor demand.




4    An Example with an Interior Solution


As mentioned above, in theorem 3 KL demonstrate that L(w, α) is decreasing in entrepreneurial

risk aversion, as indexed by α. Naturally this result requires that L(w, α) is interior. Although KL
                                                                                              A
are able to prove that L(w, α) > 0 in equilibrium, they have to assume L(w, α) <              w.   To prove

that the comparative static result in theorem 3 is not vacuous, we will now provide an example in

which we prove that L(w, α) is interior in equilibrium. We hope this example will also be useful

for pedagogy.


Let u(I, α) = I 1−α where I ∈ [0, ∞) and α ∈ (0, 1). This functional form satisfies the assumptions

made on u and risk attitudes: if α > β, then r(I, α) = − uuIII (I,α)
                                                                (I,α)
                                                                      = αI > βI = r(I, β). Let the
                                         
                                          0 with probability 1 − λ

production function be y = xL where x =                                    and λ ∈ (0, 1). We will

                                         

then show there exists a unique equilibrium wage w > 0 and L(w, α) ∈ (0, A
                                                                         w ) for all α.


For each agent α, labor demand L(w, α) solves

For this concave objective function, the first order condition is sufficient to find L that maximizes

                                                                                   w ) is indeed guaranteed by

w ∈ (0, λx̄).


The certainty equivalent wage is defined by


                   (A + w)1−α = (1 − λ)[A − wL(w, α)]1−α + λ[A + (x̄ − wL(w, α))]1−α .                     (9)


Substituting L(w, α) from (8) yields

                                        1            1                          1
                    (A + w)1−α [k α x̄ + (1 − k α )w]1−α = (1 − λ)(Ak α x̄)1−α + λ(Ax̄)1−α


If w = 0, then k = 0 and LHS −RHS = −λ(Ax̄)1−α < 0; if w = λx̄, then k = 1 and LHS −RHS =

(Ax̄ + λx̄2 )1−α − (Ax̄)1−α > 0 . Therefore, by continuity, there must exist a w ∈ (0, λx̄) defined by

(9), which guarantees that L(w, α) is an interior solution.

5    Conclusion


We have proved that in the model of KL an economy-wide increase in risk aversion lowers the

wage that clears the labor market, while retaining agent heterogeneity in risk aversion and the

endogenous division of agents into less risk averse entrepreneurs and more risk averse workers.

This result is of interest in its own right and also appears to fulfill the original vision of KL. By

showing that comparative statics are possible in their model without setting aside its fundamental

insight, we hope to encourage other researchers to extend their theory, rather than only invoke it

as has occurred in the literature to date. We also provided a simple example that establishes the

existence of an interior solution to their model and should be useful in the many graduate courses

in which KL is taught.
