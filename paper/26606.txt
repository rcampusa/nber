Drawing Conclusions from Structural Vector Autoregressions Identified on the Basis of Sign
Restrictions

                                         ABSTRACT

This paper discusses the problems associated with using information about the signs of certain
magnitudes as a basis for drawing structural conclusions in vector autoregressions. We also
review available tools to solve these problems. For illustration we use Dahlhaus and Vasishtha's
(2019) study of the effects of a U.S. monetary contraction on capital flows to emerging markets.
We explain why sign restrictions alone are not enough to allow us to answer the question and
suggest alternative approaches that could be used.

   Drawing structural conclusions on the basis of dynamic correlations requires identifying

information with which to interpret the correlations observed in the data. Because many re-

searchers have doubts about the validity of this identifying information, it has become a very

common practice to use information about the signs of certain magnitudes as a basis for iden-

tification in structural vector autoregressions. Prominent examples include Aastveit, Bjørn-

   What all the above studies have in common is that they highlight a subset of the identified

set as if researchers might be confident that the answer to structural questions of interest

falls within that subset. The problem with doing this has been noted by Baumeister and

Hamilton (2015, 2018) and Watson (2019). However, the nature of this problem still appears

not to be recognized by many applied researchers. For this reason, it is useful to raise these

issues again in the context of a particular empirical example in order to explain the nature

of the problem and describe the tools available to solve it.



                                              2
   In this paper we do so using for illustration the following question: "What happens to

capital flows to emerging markets when U.S. monetary policy becomes more contractionary?"

This is an interesting and important question, and the paper by Dahlhaus and Vasishtha

(2019) does a nice job of trying to answer it.

   When U.S. interest rates go up, as they did for example in May 2013, it could affect

emerging market capital flows through several different channels. If the cause of the higher

U.S. interest rates was a strengthening of the U.S. economy, the improvement in real invest-

ment opportunities in the U.S. could divert some of the capital flows that had been going

to emerging markets back to the United States. On the other hand, if the cause of higher

U.S. interest rates was a move toward a more contractionary U.S. monetary policy in the

absence of any changes in economic fundamentals, that also could induce investors to hold

a higher fraction of their assets in U.S. financial instruments. Distinguishing between these

channels is one of the goals of Dahlhaus and Vasishtha.

   The authors' approach to identification -- that is, the way they propose to separate the

effects of different channels like the two described above -- uses a combination of sign re-

strictions and zero restrictions. Their sign restrictions are that a U.S. monetary contraction

would increase the 3-year-ahead fed funds futures rate but lower U.S. inflation and output

growth. Improving U.S. fundamentals, by contrast, would mean higher interest rates cou-

pled with higher inflation and output growth.        Thus the sign restrictions might allow us

to distinguish between the two channels.     Their additional zero restriction is that a U.S.

monetary contraction raises fed funds futures but does not change the current fed funds rate.



                                                 3
Their monetary policy shock is thus in the spirit of a "forward guidance shock" studied by

Gürkaynak, Sack, and Swanson (2005) and Swanson (2017).




1      Mechanical details of the algorithm.

We want to focus our discussion on how this identification actually works.         To do so we

first need to wade into the details underlying the computational algorithm that the authors

use.   The algorithm is based on that developed for sign-restricted VARs by Uhlig (2005)

and Rubio-Ramírez, Waggoner and Zha (2010) as extended to allow for zero restrictions in

Baumeister and Benati (2013).

    The algorithm is based on a first-order vector autoregression (VAR) using n = 6 different

variables. These variables are collected in an (n × 1) vector yt consisting of the U.S. fed

funds rate, the U.S. 36-month-ahead fed funds futures rate, the U.S. inflation rate, the U.S.

industrial production growth rate, the VIX (a measure of U.S. stock-price uncertainty as

reflected in the prices of stock options), and the first principal component of a set of capital

flows to emerging markets.

    Step 1 in this algorithm estimates a reduced-form first-order vector autoregression for

these n = 6 variables:


                           yt    = ^
                                   c + ^ yt-1 + ^
                                                et             t = 1, 2, ..., T.            (1)
                         (n×1)    (n×1)   (n×n)(n×1)   (n×1)


The first row of this system is obtained from an ordinary least squares (OLS) regression of

the fed funds rate on a constant and one lag of each of the six variables in the VAR. The


                                                   4
first element of ^
                 et is the error one would make in trying to forecast the fed funds rate in

month t based on values of the six variables observed at t - 1. Associated with these six

forecasting regressions is a variance-covariance matrix of the forecast errors,



                                            ^ = T -1         T
                                                             t=1 ^  et .
                                                                 et ^
                                           (n×n)


For example, the (1,1) element of ^ is the average squared error we would make in predicting

the fed funds rate on the basis of the OLS regression.

       Step 2 in the algorithm is to draw random values (m) and (m) from the asymptotic

distribution of the OLS estimates ^ and ^ .1                 This step will be repeated many times to

generate a number of different draws (m = 1, 2, ..., M ).

       Step 3 of the algorithm generates a random (n × n) matrix Q(m) . Each Q(m) that we draw

will be an orthonormal matrix, that is, Q(m) Q(m) = In , the (n × n) identity matrix. The

distribution is uniform with respect to a certain measure (known as the Haar measure) over

the set of possible orthonormal matrices,2 and for this reason the distribution is sometimes

thought to be uninformative -- more on this below. We then calculate the Cholesky factor

P(m) of the value for (m) that was drawn in step 2 (that is, P(m) is a lower-triangular

matrix satisfying P(m) P(m) = (m) ). The proposal is to interpret the observed n reduced-

   1
     The asymptotic distribution is the same as the Bayesian posterior distribution that results from using
uninformative priors for  and . For this reason, this step is sometimes equivalently described as generating
draws for (m) and (m) from the Bayesian posterior distribution obtained using uninformative priors. We
will discuss the Bayesian interpretation of the algorithm more below.
   2
     For the case of a VAR with only n = 2 variables, the set of possible orthonormal matrices can be sum-
marized as either rotations or reflections with some angle . In this case, a draw from the Haar distribution
could be obtained by first generating the angle  from a uniform distribution over the unit circle (that is,
all angles are equally likely) and then flipping a fair coin to use this angle either as a reflection or rotation;
see Baumeister and Hamilton (2015, p. 1973).

form residuals t = yt - c - yt-1 as coming from a set of n structural shocks vt according

to t = P(m) Q(m) vt where the structural shocks each have unit variance and are uncorrelated

                        
with each other (E (vt vt ) = In ). Note that every vt we think of in this way is consistent

with the observed properties of the reduced-form residuals t , because


          E (P(m) Q(m) vt vt
                            (m) (m)
                             Q P ) = P(m) Q(m) E (vt vt
                                                      
                                                        )Q(m) P(m)

                                      = P(m) Q(m) Q(m) P(m) = P(m) P(m) = (m) .


Thus every proposed structural shock vt satisfying t = P(m) Q(m) vt also satisfies the condi-

tion that E (t t ) = (m) .

   Step 4 of the algorithm imposes the sign and zero restrictions.     Suppose we label the

monetary policy shock as the first element of vt . We induce a further rotation of P(m) Q(m)

such that its (1,1) element (the effect of the monetary shock on the current fed funds rate)

is zero, and flip sign of the first column so that the (2,1) element is positive (a monetary

contraction should raise the 3-year-ahead fed funds futures rate). We then check whether

the (3,1) and (4,1) elements are negative (a monetary contraction should lower both inflation

and output).    If yes, we keep the first column of P(m) Q(m) (denoted (m) ) as a plausible

effect on impact of a U.S. monetary policy contraction on each of the six variables in the
                       s
system, and use (m) (m) as a plausible effect on each of the six variables s months after

a U.S. monetary contraction. If not, we discard the draw m and generate another.

   The structural impulse-response functions for horizon s (shown as the solid lines in Fig-

ure 4 in Dahlhaus and Vasishtha) correspond to the median values of retained draws for
      s
 (m) (m) . Their 68% credible sets correspond to the lower 16% and upper 16% values

                                             6
for the set of retained draws.


2     Implications of the algorithm.

Note that there are two ways in which a random-number generator plays a role in this

algorithm.   The first is in step 2, in which we drew values for (m) and (m) from the

asymptotic distribution of the OLS estimates ^ and ^ . This step reflects uncertainty in a

form that economists are very familiar with, which is sampling uncertainty. We only have a

finite number T of observations on yt , and because of this we don't know the true values of

 and . We have an estimate ^ , but we understand that the true value might be bigger

or smaller than this.   To capture the implications of this uncertainty, we generate many

possible values (m) , some of which are bigger than ^ and some of which are smaller. We

use the distribution of generated (m) to remind us that the true value might be bigger or

smaller than the estimate ^.

    A random-number generator is also used in step 3 of the algorithm, which generated a

draw for Q(m) from the Haar distribution on orthonormal matrices. The randomness here

came only from the researcher's random-number generator, and has nothing whatever to do

with the data or the difficulty we have in estimating objects of interest from a finite sample.
                                 s
    The randomness of (m) (m) (generated draws for the structural impulse-response

coefficients) thus comes from a combination of two sources: (1) sampling uncertainty that

arises because we only have a finite number of observations and (2) uncertainty that comes

purely from a random-number generator used by the researcher.



                                              7
       We can see how much each of these sources of randomness contributes by shutting down

the first one altogether.3       Suppose that instead of generating values for (m) and (m) in

step 2 we just fixed (m) = ^ and (m) = ^ for every m. This amounts to proceeding as if we

have no sampling uncertainty at all, that is, as if we had an infinite sample of observed data

(T - ) so that we could know the true values  and  with no sampling uncertainty.

Our figure 1 plots the median values for the structural impulse-response function sets for this

modification of Dahlhaus and Vasishtha's algorithm.4             On impact a monetary contraction

raises the 3-year-ahead fed funds futures rate, lowers inflation and output, and has zero

effect on the contemporaneous fed funds rate. All this is guaranteed by the algorithm by

construction -- a draw would not have been retained unless all of the above were satisfied.

Effects generally decay slowly from those impacts -- this is a feature of the simple dynamics

implied by the OLS estimate of the autoregressive coefficients ^ . The most interesting

features might be the last two panels, which show that a U.S. monetary contraction raises

U.S. stock price volatility and reduces emerging market capital flows.              These conclusions

were not imposed by the authors.

       The values plotted in Figure 1 are the medians of the set of retained draws. Figure 2

focuses on one magnitude of particular interest -- the effect on emerging market capital flows

one month after a U.S. monetary policy contraction -- and plots the probability distribution

of the set of retained draws. The median of this distribution (-0.41) is the value plotted at

   3
       Similar exercises are reported by Baumeister and Hamilton (2018) and Watson (2019).
   4
     This and the figures below are based on M = 100, 000 generated draws for Q(m) of which 21,383 were
retained. We thank Tatjana Dahlhaus for generously sharing her data to allow us to perform this exercise.



                                                    8
horizon s = 1 in the last panel of Figure 1. But remember that this probability distribution

has nothing to do with uncertainty in the data but instead came entirely from the random-

number generator used by the researcher. By construction, every one of the draws in Figure

2 is perfectly consistent with everything we've observed in the data (^ and ^ ) and with all

of the identifying restrictions we've imposed. There is no basis whatever from anything we

see in the data or anything coming from the identifying restrictions to prefer one of these

draws over any other.

       And yet the probability distribution in Figure 2 does seem to favor some of these draws

over others, seeming to regard values near the median as more likely than others.                    The

only thing that makes them more likely was that the Haar distribution implicitly assumed

that they were more likely. Some researchers seem surprised by this observation, since it is

commonly believed is that the Haar distribution is uninformative. While it is true that the

Haar distribution is uninformative about the angle of rotation associated with the matrix

Q, the object the researcher is interested in is not the angle of rotation of Q but instead

magnitudes like those plotted in Figure 1, namely elements of impulse-response functions.

The impulse-response functions are a nonlinear function of the angle of rotation.5                      A

nonlinear transformation of a uniform distribution no longer has a flat distribution, but has

more mass for some values than for others.6        Whenever researchers use the Haar distribution
   5
     The matrix Q itself is a nonlinear transformation of the angle of rotation . For example, in the case
of a rotation matrix for n = 2,
                                                  cos  - sin 
                                         Q() =                    .
                                                  sin  cos 

   6
       This was one of the main points made by Baumeister and Hamilton (2015).



                                                    9
in an algorithm, they are implicitly assuming that some answers to their question are more

plausible than others.

    Thus, whenever the set of retained draws is summarized in terms of a median and 68%

credibility sets, a researcher is using more than just the information observed in the data and

more than the information represented by the identifying sign and zero restrictions. The

researcher is also relying on an implicit ranking of possible outcomes. This implicit ranking

is an artifact of step 3 of the algorithm described in Section 1. Although many researchers

tend to treat step 3 of the algorithm as an incidental mechanical detail, in practice it is a

often a key factor that led them to draw the conclusions that they did.


3     Possible solutions.

There are four ways that researchers could address this issue: (1) report the identified set; (2)

bring in additional weakly identifying information; (3) bring in fully identifying information;

or (4) use a combination of the above. We now describe each in turn.

    Report the identified set.

    If the researcher wants to rely on nothing more than the sign and zero restrictions and

what is observed in the data, there is no justification for reporting the median or a 68%

interval of the set of retained draws.     Instead the researcher should report the full set

of all retained draws.     For fixed ^ and ^ as here, as the number of generated draws

M  , this corresponds to the set of all the values that are consistent with ^, ^ and

the identifying restrictions. This is known as the identified set associated with the fixed ^



                                               10
and ^ . The identified sets for structural impulse-response functions are plotted in Figure

3. The identifying assumptions allow only a single possibility (namely, the number zero) for

the effect on impact of the monetary policy shock on the fed funds rate. Thus the identified

set for the value at horizon 0 in the first panel in Figure 3 contains only the single value zero.

But after one month the effect on the fed funds rate could be positive or negative.          The

effect on impact on inflation or output of a monetary contraction cannot be positive, but the

identified set extends all the way to zero, and after one month the effect could be positive.

And the conclusion from the identified set is that the effect of a monetary contraction on

VIX or emerging market flows could be essentially anything at near horizons. As the horizon

s - , each identified set shrinks back to a tight interval around zero. This is because

^ s - 0 meaning 
                ^ s  - 0 for any finite .

   Again we emphasize that this is not at all the usual argument that you can't conclude

anything if a 95% confidence interval includes the number zero. We are not talking about a

confidence interval in the usual sense here. The usual confidence interval represents uncer-

tainty that would go away if we had an infinite number of observations. We have generated

the bounds in Figure 3 assuming we in fact do have an infinite number of observations and

that there is no uncertainty at all about the true reduced-form coefficients. The uncertainty

instead comes from the fact that, if all we're willing to assume are the stated sign and zero

restrictions, then even perfect knowledge of the true reduced-form coefficients would not

be enough to determine the magnitude or even the sign of the effect of a monetary policy

contraction on emerging market capital flows.



                                               11
   Bring in additional weakly identifying information.

   A second alternative is to bring in some additional information not just about the sign

but also about the magnitude of certain parameters. This is implicitly what a researcher

is doing if the distribution in Figure 2 is treated as if telling us that some elements in the

identified set are more likely than others. Indeed, the algorithm in Section 1 can be given

a Bayesian interpretation in which the researcher began before seeing the data with some

prior beliefs about the relative likelihood of different possible outcomes. The problem with

this motivation is that it is far from clear where the information is coming from that enabled

us to think some possibilities were more likely to be true than others before we observed the

data.

   Following this approach correctly would require the researcher to be explicit about what

we know from economic theory or other data that gave us a basis for regarding some elements

in the identified set as more likely than others.    In other words, we need to defend the

conclusion that a value like -0.41 in Figure 2 is the most likely value given what we observe

in the data and what we expected on the basis of prior information. We may have lots of

information, from both economic theory and earlier data sets, that some responses of the U.S.

Federal Reserve to inflation and output are more plausible than others. An explicit Bayesian

approach allows us to incorporate any prior information like this as well as represent how

much confidence we have in that prior information. But this information would be quite

unlikely to take the form of a Haar distribution over rotation matrices Q. Baumeister and

Hamilton (2018, 2019) provide a number of examples of how prior information might be



                                             12
used in practice.

      Use fully identifying assumptions.

      Another approach is to look for some other variables or information that give us complete

identification, that is, information that would enable us, if we knew for certain the values

of the reduced-form coefficients, to know for certain the effects of a monetary contraction

on emerging market flows. One popular approach developed by Stock and Watson (2012,

2018) and Mertens and Ravn (2014) is to find an instrumental variable that is correlated

with a monetary policy shock but uncorrelated with other shocks. Dahlhaus and Vasishtha

actually develop such a potential instrument in the form of xt , which denotes the cumulative

changes in the 3-year-ahead fed funds futures on the days in month t when there was a

monetary policy announcement.         They use this variable as a robustness check, rerunning

their sign-restricted VAR in which the second variable in their original system is replaced

with xt . Using xt in this way results in a system that is still unidentified and that is still

subject to the critique raised above.

      Another way that a variable like xt could be used is directly as an instrument for a

monetary policy shock.7        This produces a framework that is fully identified. Stock and

Watson (2012, 2018) and Mertens and Ravn (2014) describe some ways in which this can

be done.      Noh (2019) and Paul (forthcoming) note that the IV approach is in fact very

easy to implement using OLS regressions. Specifically, we add the current value of xt as an

  7
     For additional discussion of the use of changes in interest rates in a narrow window around FOMC
announcements as an instrument for monetary policy shocks, see Nakamura and Steinsson (2018), Hamilton
(2018), and Zhang (2019).

additional explanatory variable in each of the regressions in (1):


                           yt    = ~
                                   c + ~ yt-1 + ~ xt + ~
                                                       et .                                (2)
                         (6×1)     (6×1)   (6×6)(6×1)   (6×1)(1×1)   (6×1)


For example, the first row of (2) is estimated from an OLS regression of the fed funds

change at t on a constant, the proxy xt at date t, and lagged values of the 6 variables in the

original system.   Noh and Paul showed that if the instrument is valid and relevant, then

the estimated value of ~ s~ would in an infinite-sized sample be proportional to the true

response of each of the 6 variables in yt+s at date t + s to a monetary shock at date t; in

other words, ~ s~ gives a consistent estimate (up to a constant of proportionality) of the

magnitude we're interested in. The usual confidence intervals around the estimate ~ s~ tell

us how uncertain we are about the conclusion given that we've only observed a finite number

of observations.

   Combining approaches.

   It is also possible to combine the best features of the various approaches. For example,

we may think that xt is a reasonable proxy, but we're not completely sure that it's a valid

instrument, or may have concerns that it is a weak instrument, in which case we would be

back to an unidentified system. Likewise, we may have some other possible zero restrictions

that would produce an identified system, but again we may have some doubts about these

restrictions.   All such approaches can be viewed within a Bayesian context in which we

use prior distributions to summarize our uncertainty about the validity of instruments or

confidence in zero restrictions.    A prior distribution that holds that a certain coefficient

is probably close to zero is a strict generalization of an identifying assumption that the

                                                 14
coefficient is exactly equal to zero. Nguyen (2019) demonstrates how to perform inference

in a system in which we have doubts about the validity of instruments and doubts about other

identifying information. Note that such an approach can be viewed as a strict generalization

of both the Rubio-Ramírez, Waggoner and Zha (2010) and Baumeister and Benati (2013)

approaches to sign-restricted VARs and the Stock and Watson (2012, 2018) and Mertens

and Ravn (2014) approaches to VARs estimated with instrumental variables.


4    Conclusions.

As we noted in the introduction, the method used by Dahlhaus and Vasishtha (2019) is quite

well established in the literature. We could have used any of the nearly hundred prominent

studies listed there as alternative examples with which to make our points.       Although

reporting subsets of structural values consistent with sign restrictions has seen widespread

acceptance, we think it is useful to remind researchers of the problems with doing so and of

the alternatives that avoid these criticisms.
