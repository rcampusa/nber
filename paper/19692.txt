This paper develops a methodology for predicting the impact of trade liberalization on exports by industry
(3-digit ISIC) based on the pre-liberalization distribution of exports by product (5-digit SITC). Using
the results of Kehoe and Ruhl (2013) that much of the growth in trade after trade liberalization is in
products that are traded very little or not at all, we predict that industries with a higher share of exports
generated by least traded products will experience more growth. Using our methodology, we develop
predictions for industry-level changes in trade for the United States and Korea following the U.S.-Korea
Free Trade Agreement (KORUS). As a test for our methodology, we show that it performs significantly
better than the applied general equilibrium models originally used for the policy evaluation of the North
American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).

1. Introduction

       Employing the insight from Kehoe and Ruhl (2013) that products (5-digit SITC) that are
traded very little or not at all are disproportionately responsible for changes in aggregate trade
following trade reform, we hypothesize that they are important for predicting changes in
industry-level (3-digit ISIC) trade after trade reform. We develop a methodology to classify
products as least traded and compute the share of exports in an industry accounted for by these
least traded products. We predict that industries with the highest shares of exports accounted for
by least traded products will experience the largest increases in trade. Using this methodology,
we predict what industries will experience the largest increases in trade between the United
States and Korea following the signing of their free trade agreement. We aggregate our
industries in order to contrast our predictions with those from standard general equilibrium
models that use alternative industry definitions.
       To demonstrate the usefulness of our methodology, we compare the actual changes in
bilateral industry-level trade between Canada, Mexico, and the United States during NAFTA
with the predictions our methodology would have yielded had we developed our methodology
before the implementation of NAFTA. We compare the accuracy of our projections with those
of a standard model that was used to predict the effects of NAFTA. We show that, in the case of
NAFTA, our methodology performs better in its predictions, and we use the results from our
evaluation of NAFTA to develop predictions not only for the relative growth of trade by industry
between Korea and the United States, but also for the absolute level of growth of trade for each
industry.

2. Growth in trade on the extensive margin

       In this section, we develop a methodology based on the insight from Kehoe and Ruhl
(2013): Much of the growth in trade following a trade liberalization occurs within the set of
products that were not traded or were traded very little. We refer to growth in trade from
products that were not previously traded or were traded very little as growth on the extensive
margin or the new products margin. We refer to growth in trade from products that were
previously traded in large amounts as growth on the intensive margin. Our methodology, based
on that of Kehoe and Ruhl (2013), allows our cutoff for what products we consider to be least



                                                    1
traded to vary across country pairs in order to take into account the relative importance of each
product for a country’s trade.
       We define a product to be a 5-digit SITC Rev. 2 code, and, following Kehoe and Ruhl
(2013), we sort all of the products from lowest to highest by their average value of trade over the
first three years in our sample. (We average over three years to minimize the measure’s
dependence on any particular year.) Starting with the products with the least trade in the first
three years, we then sum the value of trade in the base year until we accumulate a set of products
that accounts for 10 percent of total trade in the base year. If a product is in that set, we classify
it as a least traded product. Within the set of least traded products are products from different
industries, where an industry — here a 3-digit ISIC Rev. 2 code — is itself a collection of
products. A list of our industries and their descriptions are given in table 1. Adapting a
concordance developed by Muendler (2009), we map each of the 1,836 5-digit SITC codes into
one of 37 3-digit ISIC codes, and then compute the share of trade accounted for by least traded
products with each industry. How prevalent are these least traded products across industries? In
table 2 we report the fraction of trade in an industry accounted for by least traded products in
1989. There are substantial differences across industries. For example, least traded products
made up 67 percent of total textile exports (ISIC 321) from the United States to Korea in 2005,
but only 7 percent of exports in the pottery, china, and earthenware industry (ISIC 361).

3. Predictions for U.S.-Korea FTA

       The United States and Korea signed a free trade agreement, KORUS, in 2007, which was
enacted in 2012. To make our predictions for the effects of KORUS, we look at bilateral trade at
the product level between the United States and Korea from Comtrade and identify products as
least traded or not using the base year of 2005. Using our concordance, we aggregate products
into 3-digit ISIC industries and compute the share of least traded products in each industry. How
is the level of least traded products in an industry related to the growth in trade in that industry
following liberalization? Kehoe and Ruhl (2013) show that growth in the least traded products
can be explosive after liberalization, so it follows that industries with more least traded products
would be expected to grow faster after liberalization than industries with fewer least traded
products. Therefore our prediction is that industries with higher shares of least traded products
will experience more growth than industries with lower shares of least traded products.


                                                   2
       We formulate our prediction of trade growth by industry as a simple linear function of the
share of exports accounted for by least traded products in that industry. Specifically, we predict
that the growth in each industry will be
                                       z j = a + bs j ,                                   (1)

where j is the industry, z j is the growth in exports deflated by GDP growth of the exporting

country, s j is the share of exports accounted for by least traded products in that industry, and a

and b are constants. Here  is the average growth rate of non–least traded products, and  is
the additional growth generated by least traded products. As long as b > 0 , all values for a and
b give the same predictions for the relative growth across industries. One way we evaluate
predictions versus observed changes in the data is to calculate correlations. Any series of
predictions by industry of the form (1) generates the same correlation with a series of
observations by industry if b is positive.
       We use observations from the experience of NAFTA to set the parameters in equation (1)
to make predictions on the impact of KORUS by industry. Using data for the United States,
Canada, and Mexico over 1989–2009, which is covered in the following section, we set
  3.63 and   160.10 for Korean exports to the United States, which are the weighted
averages of  and  for Canadian and Mexican exports to the United States. Similarly, we set
  10.95 and   197.66 for Korean imports from the United States to the weighted averages
of  and  for Canadian and Mexican imports from the United States. We anticipate that future
research will develop better methods of calculating  and  . For now our primary focus
remains on predicting the relative levels of growth across industries, for which  and  are
irrelevant as long as   0.
       Table 2 reports our predictions for each of our 3-digit ISIC industries. Our predictions
vary widely across industries: For Korean exports to the United States, our predictions range
from an decrease of 3.6 percent in exports of beverages (ISIC 314) to an increase of 156.5
percent in exports of industries whose products are entirely least traded, such as glass and glass
products (ISIC 362). For U.S. exports to Korea, our predictions have a similar variation. A
noticeable difference between our predictions on U.S. exports compared with our predictions on




                                                  3
Korean exports is that there are more industries in which we predict that exports will grow less
than GDP. There are also fewer sectors whose products are entirely least traded.

4. Predictions from other models

       We compare our predictions with those from Kiyota and Stern (2007) based on the
methodology and assumptions of the Brown-Deardorff-Stern model (Brown 1992, 1994, Brown,
Deardorff, and Stern, 1992, 1995, Brown and Stern, 1989) and those from Yaylaci and Shikher
(2013) based on the Ricardian framework of Eaton and Kortum (2002). Kiyota and Stern (2007)
predict the changes in total imports and exports for 14 industries, as well as two service
industries that we ignore, for Korea and the United States following liberalization. To make our
results comparable to theirs, we aggregate the ISIC industries into their industries and compute
the share of least traded products in each of those industries. Kiyota and Stern do not provide an
exact concordance between the ISIC codes and their industries, so we develop one.
       Kiyota and Stern focus on trade flows between Korea and the World and the United
States and the World, whereas our methodology predicts bilateral trade flows. To make our
predictions comparable to theirs, we assume that exports from the United States to the World,
not Korea, grow by the factor  and similarly for exports from Korea to the World, not the
United States. This assumption allows us to keep our predictions of the form (1) using U.S.-
Korea data. We use these data on trade flows to identify the set of least traded products (LTP).
Mechanically, we multiply a by the fraction of trade accounted for by the United States for
Korea, and by Korea for the United States. For example, in table 3, for predicting Korean
exports to the World, we set a to -0.53 ( = (-3.63)(0.146) ) since Korean exports to the United
States account for 14.6 percent of Korean exports to the World in 2005.
       Tables 3 and 4 compare our results with those of Kiyota and Stern. As we see, there are
significant differences in the predictions between the two methods, especially for U.S. exports:
Our predictions have correlations with theirs that range from −0.35 for U.S. imports to 0.70 for
Korean exports.
       Yaylaci and Shikher (forthcoming) predict the changes in bilateral trade for 15
manufacturing industries between the United States and Korea following liberalization. Yaylaci
and Shikher lack predictions for the agricultural industry, so we exclude it from our predictions
after classifying products as least traded. We follow the same methodology for computing the


                                                 4
share of least traded products in each of their industries after aggregating our ISIC industries into
their industries. Table 5 shows our predictions using our methodology and their industry
definitions compared with the predictions of Yaylaci and Shikher. Again, there are significant
differences between them, with a correlation of only 0.43 between our predictions and those of
Yaylaci and Shikher for Korean exports to the United States and only 0.19 for U.S. exports to
Korea.

5. Evaluating our methodology in the context of NAFTA

         In this section, we evaluate the predictive power of our methodology by using it to
“predict” the impact of NAFTA. We compare the proportion of trade within each industry that
comes from least traded products with the results from the data showing how much each industry
grew. In particular, we compute the growth for each industry normalized by GDP according to
                                            æ xijT
                                                 k
                                                     / yiT1    ÷ö
                                            ç
                                   z = 100 çç k 1
                                    k
                                                            -1÷÷ ,                         (2)
                                    ij
                                            çè xijT0 / yiT0    ÷÷ø

where xijtk is exports from country i to country k , in industry j at time t , and yit is current

price GDP in country i . We set T1 = 2009 and T0 = 1989 . We calculate our metrics for

comparing our predictions with the data on industry trade growth from the regression
                                                                     2
                                 min åj=1 wj (a +bs j - zdata
                                                         j ) .
                                         38
                                                                                           (3)
                                  a,b


We run this regression for each country pair (we suppress the subscripts for time and countries)
where s j is the share of least traded products in each industry. Again,  is the average growth

of non–least traded products and  is the difference between the average growth rate of least
traded products and that of non–least traded products. This regression is the source of our
estimates for  and  for KORUS in section 3. The growth rates for each industry and the
share of least traded products in each industry, as well as the regression results, are reported in
tables 6–8. Notice that the squared correlation coefficient is the R2 of this simple regression.
         If  were small, it would indicate that, although the share of least traded products in an
industry is still well correlated with how much that industry grew, there is actually not a large
difference between the growth rates of least traded products and non–least traded products. We
find that for all country pairs our estimates of  are large, however, indicating that differences


                                                      5
in growth rates between least traded products and non–least traded products are indeed large and
significant. Setting   28.41and   114.46 would have been the best linear prediction
based on the least traded products data for U.S. exports to Canada, indicating that between 1989
and 2009, exports in the least traded set grew by 86.05 (  28.41  114.46 ) percent more than
U.S. GDP, while other exports grew 28.41 percent less than U.S. GDP. Had we used 1989 trade
data to predict 2009 U.S. exports to Canada by simply guessing that exports in the least traded
set would grow by more than other exports, we would account for 0.28 (  0.532 ) of the variation
in relative export patterns. Since we weight our industries by their share of trade in the base
period, we recover that the weighted share of least traded products is 0.10, and so our results
imply the best prediction of the growth of total exports from the United States to Canada is 16.97
(  28.41  (0.1)(114.46) ) percent less than the growth of U.S. GDP.
       Using industry-level data, we have estimated the average growth rates of non–least traded
products as the regression coefficient  and the average growth rates of least traded products as
the sum    . To test the consistency of our methodology, we derive alternative estimates for

 and  using only product-level data, and we label these alternative estimates  and  . That
is, we compute
                                                     xiTk 1 / yiT1    
                                             100  k
                                              k
                                                                     1
                                             i
                                                     xiT / yiT        
                                                     0           0    

                                                    xiTk1 / yiT1    
                                         ik  100                1  ik ,
                                                    xiT / yiT
                                                        k            
                                                    0           0    

where xitk and xitk are respectively exports of all products and exports of only least traded

products from country i to country k at time t , and yit is current price GDP in country i , and

again we set T1  2009 and T0  1989 . Table 9 and Figure 1 show that we obtain very similar

results regardless of whether we use our product-level estimates or our industry-level regression
coefficients, since the weighted correlation between  and  is 0.97 while the weighted
correlation between  and  is 0.91. Furthermore, it follows that if  and    are the
average growth rates of non–least traded products and least traded products, respectively, then
   si is the expected growth rate in an industry with initial share si of least traded products.

6. Predictions of NAFTA models

       To develop a baseline for judging whether our predictions for NAFTA performed well or
not, we follow Fox (1999) and Kehoe (2005) and evaluate the performance of one of the most
prominent of the models built to analyze NAFTA, the Brown-Deardorff-Stern (BDS) model
(Brown 1992, 1994; Brown, Deardorff, and Stern, 1992, 1995; Brown and Stern, 1989). In this
section, we compare the predictions made by the BDS model with the observed growth in trade
following NAFTA, while in the appendix we perform similar comparisons for two alternative
models of NAFTA.
       The BDS model made predictions at the industry level, where each of their 23 industries
is defined as an aggregate of ISIC 3-digit codes. After aggregating our ISIC industries into the
BDS industries, we compute the percentage growth in exports for each industry deflated by GDP
growth. We report the export growth rates for the BDS industries and the predictions of the BDS
model in tables 10–12.
       We select 1989 as our base year, since that is when Mexico and the United States adopted
the Harmonized System (Canada adopted the Harmonized System in 1988). As Kehoe and Ruhl
(2013) point out, finely disaggregated trade data are not comparable before and after the
adoption of the Harmonized System. For this reason, we start our analysis in 1989 in order to
have the same starting period for all countries. We use 2009 as our endpoint, since that is the
actual year for full implementation of the NAFTA. Our results are robust to selecting 2007 as
our endpoint, which we could do to avoid entangling the effects of NAFTA with the effects of
the 2008–2009 recession and the fall in trade that accompanied it.
       To compare the predictions of the BDS model with the changes in trade patterns in the
data, we calculate the weighted correlation coefficient between the model prediction and the
data, where the weights  j are the 1989 trade volumes. We also calculate the weighted

regression coefficients a and b from solving
                                                                           2
                                     å          w j (a + bz model          )
                                         23

                              a ,b


over the 23 industries in the BDS model. The deviation of the estimated coefficient b from 1
indicates how poorly the model does in predicting the signs and the absolute magnitude of the
changes in the data. Notice that these interpretations are unrelated to those from our least traded

exercise. We focus on the resulting correlations from the regressions to compare their
effectiveness at predicting relative changes in industry trade.
       We report the calculated coefficients for exports from Canada to the United States in
table 10. The BDS model does a poor job of predicting Canadian exports to the United States:
The weighted correlation between the prediction and the data is negative (−0.28), and the linear
function of the prediction that comes closest to the data involves multiplying all of the predicted
growth rates by −3.33 and adding 21.82. The weak relationship between the predicted growth
rates and actual growth rates can be seen in figure 2, which is a bubble plot showing this
regression line where the bubble sizes correspond to the each industry’s weight. The BDS model
does somewhat better in predicting exports from the United States to Canada.
       Table 13 contains the corresponding statistics for all six of the bilateral North American
trade pairs. Notice that the BDS model had almost no predictive power for the impact of
NAFTA by industry. In a regression on the pooled data for all six pairs, the coefficient b put on
the predictions of the BDS model is 0.17, and when we allow b to differ by country pair, the
weighted average is −0.94.
       It is worth stressing that this failure of the BDS model is not specific to this particular
model. We focus on the BDS model because it is a widely used and well-documented model
built to analyze the impact of NAFTA, and it has predictions for all directions of bilateral trade
between Mexico, Canada, and the United States. Kehoe (2005) argues that two other models that
were very prominent in policy discussions of NAFTA, the Cox-Harris model of Canada (Cox,
1994, 1995; Cox and Harris 1985, 1992a, 1992b), and the Sobarzo model of Mexico (Sobarzo,
1992a, 1992b, 1994, 1995), also perform poorly in this sort of exercise. In the appendix, we
show that we achieve similar results with the Sobarzo model and the Cox-Harris model as well.
It is also important to note that the sorts of models used to analyze NAFTA are still being
employed to analyze trade policies around the world, so we expect our predictions to fare
similarly against those from more recent papers. See, for example, Brown, Kiyota, and Stern
(2005), Ciuriak and Chen (2007), DeRosa and Gilbert (2004), Francois, Rivera, and Rojas-
Romagosa (2008), Lips and Rieder (2005), U.S. International Trade Commission (2004), as well
as Kiyota and Stern (2007).
       To make the predictions from our methodology comparable to the BDS predictions, we
compute the share of least traded products in each of the BDS industries and resolve the


                                                  8
regression in equation (3) using the BDS defined industries. Our results are reported in tables 10
through 12 alongside the results from the BDS model. We find that the initial fraction of least
traded products in an industry performs well as a predictor of future relative trade growth across
industries, considerably outperforming the BDS model for each country pair. The least traded
products prediction is best for exports from the United States to Canada and from Canada to
Mexico. For exports from the United States to Canada, the weighted correlation between the
proportions of least traded products and the changes in trade that occurred is 0.54. This implies
that any prediction for increases in exports of the form    si , where si is the fraction of

exports of industry i accounted for by least traded products in 1989, would have a correlation of
0.54 with the changes that occurred in the data if  is positive. Figure 3 provides a bubble plot
of the least traded product share of each industry compared with how much it grew, as well as
our regression line.
       Table 13 summarizes the results of performing this exercise for all six of the North
American trade relations, and in all cases they do better than that for the BDS model. As Kehoe
(2005) explains, the models used to predict the impact of NAFTA could not pick up increases in
exports on the extensive margin, or new products margin, because of the assumptions made in
these models. In particular, the sorts of Armington aggregators and Dixit-Stiglitz utility
functions used in these models, along with no fixed costs of exporting, allowed only increases on
the intensive margin. Table 14 compares the results of our predictions using the ISIC industries
with our predictions using the BDS industries, and we see that the results are similar across the
two industry definitions.
       Products that report zero trade in 1989 are classified as least traded products, and if they
report positive trade in 2009, that is counted toward the growth rate for least traded products.
Notice, however, that the number of zero traded products has no influence on our shares si of
least traded products in each industry in 1989. This means that the essential products in terms of
generating any predictive power from our exercise are not products reporting zero trade, but
products that are positively traded, although with very small amounts of trade. Arkolakis (2010)
shows that the importance of products with small, non-zero trade to overall trade growth can be
explained by marketing costs and the number of consumers a product has. This additional
margin for growth is diminishing for products with large amounts of trade and causes products
with small, yet positive trade to experience higher levels of growth.

                                                  9
         As we have mentioned, there was a decline in trade relative to GDP during the 2008–
2009 recession. Additionally, it is possible to start our analysis in 1988 for trade that involves
Canada, as that country switched to the Harmonized System a year earlier than did the United
States and Mexico. Table 15 shows that our least traded products exercise outperforms the BDS
model regardless of whether we exclude the 2008–2009 recession or start our analysis a year
earlier for bilateral relations involving Canada.
         To get some idea of what drives our results, let us examine an industry where the simple
least traded products exercise does better than the BDS model: Canadian exports of chemicals to
the United States, which grew 99.6 percent while the BDS model predicted −3.1 percent.
Looking at the disaggregated trade data for this industry shows that the chemicals industry is
made up of 318 5-digit SITC categories. Of the 318 categories, 296 are least traded Canadian
exports. Compared with Canadian GDP, the 38 percent of 1989 exports of chemicals that are
least traded increase by 187 percent, while the other 62 percent increase by only 47 percent. The
growth in least traded products is far from uniform: For example, exports of the code 51571
(Sulphonamides) increases by 3,424 percent more than Canadian GDP, 58241 (Polyamides in
primary forms) increases by 4 percent, and 52213 (Chlorine) decreases by 28 percent.
         Although our exercises look at changes in the value of trade, our results are driven by
changes in quantities rather than changes in prices. To show this, we examine all products for
which we have quantity data and decompose the changes in real value into changes in price and
changes in quantity, where real value is taken to be the reported level of trade converted to the
exporting country’s national currency and then deflated by the exporting country’s producer
price index. We then compute a weighted average of this decomposition, using the initial trade
value as each products weight. To reduce the effect of outliers we do not include products in the
top and bottom 5 percentage of products in terms of the percent of growth accounted for by
changes in quantity. These results are shown in table 16, where we see that on average, nearly
all changes in value are due to changes in quantities, although this share is slightly lower when
Mexico is the exporter. When more than 100 percent of the change is due to changes in
quantities, this indicates that prices decreased while the total value of trade increased or vice
versa.

7. Conclusions

       This paper provides a methodology for predicting changes in bilateral trade across
industries following a trade liberalization. Using this methodology, we provide estimates for
growth in trade across industries for the United States and Korea following KORUS. We also
evaluate our methodology in the context of NAFTA and show that our methodology — which
exclusively focuses on least traded products — would have yielded better predictions than the
general equilibrium models employed at the time. Our results suggest that researchers should
include the new products margin in any analysis of the impact of trade reform. We hope this
finding will spur the development of models that are consistent with the expansion of trade on
the new products margin so that we can improve our ability to predict the effects of trade reforms
and so that we can perform counterfactual analyses of alternative reforms.

Appendix: Other models of NAFTA

       As shown in Kehoe (2005), the poor predictions of the BDS model are not unique, and
other applied general equilibrium models predicting the effects of NAFTA performed similarly
poorly. To show that our results extend beyond just the BDS model of NAFTA, we examine the
Sobarzo model of Mexico (Sobarzo, 1992a, 1992b, 1994, 1995) and the Cox-Harris model of
Canada (Cox, 1994, 1995; Cox and Harris 1985, 1992a, 1992b).
       The Cox-Harris model predicted the changes in exports and imports between Canada and
the World for 14 different industries. Since a concordance from the ISIC classification to the
Cox-Harris industries is not provided in the original paper, we adapt the one provided in Kehoe
(2005). We use imports and exports from Canada to the World, both as reported by Canada,
from Comtrade as our base data and follow the same methodology we used for evaluating the
BDS model. Since the Cox-Harris predictions are for total imports and exports for Canada, we
follow the same procedure as we have done for the Kiyota and Stern (2007) predictions for
Korea, using the World as a trading partner. In our results shown in table A1, we see that the
results are similar to what we found when evaluating the BDS model. The Cox-Harris model
had very little predictive power for both imports and exports, whereas using the share of least
traded products in each industry performed significantly better at matching the relative changes
in industry trade; achieving a weighted correlation of the data of 0.39 for exports and 0.56 for
imports compared with the weighted correlations of 0.06 and 0.04, respectively, for the Cox-
Harris model.
       The Sobarzo model predicted the changes in imports and exports between Mexico and
North America for 21 different industries. Since Sobarzo does not provide a concordance
between ISIC and its industries, we adapt the concordance given in Kehoe (2005). We use the
same base 5-digit SITC data as we did for the BDS exercise, constructing the share of least
traded products for imports and exports between Mexico and the United States and Mexico and
Canada separately. We then use these shares to compute a weighted share of least traded
products for imports and exports between Mexico and North America. After that we again
follow the same methodology as we did for the BDS exercise, and we find that the Sobarzo
model does poorly in predicting both imports and exports between North America and Mexico.
As summarized in table A2, the weighted correlation between the Sobarzo models predictions
and the data is negative (−0.12) for imports from North America to Mexico, whereas the


                                                12
correlation between the share of least traded products in an industry and the industry’s growth is
much higher (0.43). For exports to North America from Mexico, the correlation between the
predictions and the data is much better (0.47) and in fact does better than using the share of least
traded products (0.04), however our regression shows that in terms of magnitude the Sobarzo
model drastically under predicted the actual growth that took place ( a  81.13 and b  3.06 ).
The poor performance of the least traded exercise seems to stem from defining the set of least
traded products for Mexico with Canada and the United States jointly rather than Mexico-
Canada and Mexico-U.S. separately. In particular, in table 9 we see that when we consider them
separately and compute the growth rates directly from the product data, exports of least traded
products grow by 476.67 percent more than non–least traded products for Mexican exports to
Canada and by 123.86 percent more for Mexican exports to the United States. When considered
jointly and estimated from Sobarzo industry data, however, exports of least traded products grow
only by 15.73 percent more than non–least traded products for Mexican exports to its North
American neighbors. How the aggregation of individual countries into regions affects the
predictions from our least traded exercise is something that merits further study.
