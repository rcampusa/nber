This paper uses laboratory experiments to directly test a central prediction of disclosure theory:
that strategic forces can lead those who possess private information to voluntarily provide it. In a
simple two-person disclosure game, we find that senders disclose favorable information, but
withhold less favorable information. The degree to which senders withhold information is
strongly related to their stated beliefs about receiver actions, and their stated beliefs are accurate
on average. Receiver actions are also strongly related to their stated beliefs, but receiver actions
and beliefs suggest they are insufficiently skeptical about non-disclosed information in the
absence of repeated feedback.

1 Introduction
       From the number of calories in a croissant to the fuel efficiency of a car,
businesses routinely have private information about the quality of their products that
potential customers would like to know. Businesses then face a decision – should they
reveal or withhold this information?
       A central result in information economics is that market forces can lead firms to
voluntarily and completely disclose such information, as long as the information is
verifiable and the costs of disclosure are small (Viscusi 1978, Grossman and Hart 1980,
Grossman 1981, Milgrom 1981). The mechanism behind this result is simple: consumers
will treat all non-disclosing companies the same, so the best businesses among those that
do not disclose have an incentive to separate themselves through disclosure. Applied
iteratively, this logic produces unraveling in the quality of non-reporting firms, so that in
equilibrium consumers correctly infer the very worst from non-disclosure. In other
words, no news is bad news.
       The policy relevance of the unraveling result is clear. Information can be
important for markets to function properly, and this result suggests that voluntary
disclosure could solve asymmetric information problems across a variety of domains.
Moreover, this result points to policies that should increase the extent of disclosure. For
example, some cities send hygiene scorecards that restaurants can voluntarily post on
their doors, which is an attempt to make disclosure both low cost and verifiable.
       Yet, the unraveling logic rests on strong assumptions around the ability
of consumers to make inferences about a business’s decision to withhold information. In
practice, voluntary disclosure is far from complete (Mathios 2000, Luca and Smith 2015,
Bederson et al 2018). Many restaurants did not post their hygiene grades unless required
to; many universities only publicized rankings in which they did well; and many grocery
store food items did not include nutritional information until it was mandated. However,
because multiple factors can lead to failures of voluntary disclosure, it is difficult to
cleanly test the unraveling prediction and the role of consumer inferences about non-
disclosure.
       The goal of our paper is to investigate the unraveling predictions using lab
experiments that are complex enough to capture the main strategic tensions of the theory


                                               2
yet simple enough for subjects to easily understand these tensions. In our experiments,
there are two players: an information sender (e.g., the firm) and an information receiver
(e.g., the consumer). The sender receives private information that perfectly identifies the
true state (e.g., the firm’s true quality level). The sender then makes a single decision:
whether or not to disclose this information to the receiver. As a result, the sender cannot
misrepresent the state.1 In many markets, such as those with truth-in-advertising laws,
firms choose whether or not to reveal information, but can only disclose verifiable
information. By prohibiting dishonest reporting, we mirror this feature, and also
reproduce the assumptions underlying the unraveling prediction.
        After the sender decides whether or not to disclose her private information, the
receiver must guess the state. If the sender has revealed the state (a whole number
between 1 and 5), the receiver knows it with certainty. Otherwise, the receiver must infer
the true state based on the sender’s decision to withhold information and on the
distribution from which states are drawn, which is common knowledge. Reflecting many
market transactions, the sender and receiver do not have aligned interests. The sender
earns more when the receiver guesses that the state is higher, and the receiver earns more
when their guess is closer to the true state.
        With these payoffs, the logic of unraveling leads to a unique sequential
equilibrium: senders should always reveal their information (unless the state takes the
lowest possible value, in which case they are indifferent between revealing and not), and
receivers should correctly guess that the state takes the lowest possible value when
senders do not reveal their information.
        Consistent with the theoretical predictions, we find high overall rates of disclosure
– and almost full disclosure at the highest states. However, in contrast with the full
unraveling prediction, some senders do not disclose intermediate states. Importantly, and
for the first time in the literature, we elicit sender beliefs about receivers and find
evidence that this unpredicted non-disclosure is driven by the belief that not disclosing
intermediate states is optimal given receiver actions. Moreover, we find that sender
beliefs are correct on average, which means that the unpredicted non-disclosure we

 This is in contrast with existing experiments on strategic information transmission where senders can
engage in “cheap talk” (Cai and Wang 2006, Wang, Spezio, and Camerer 2011).


                                                    3
observe is optimal.
       These departures from equilibrium leave senders better off because receivers
mistakenly guess that non-disclosed states are higher than they actually are. We also elicit
receiver beliefs of sender behavior, and we find evidence that receivers over-guess non-
disclosed states because they are insufficiently skeptical about undisclosed information –
the extent to which no news is bad news.
       To measure the degree to which receivers are naive about non-disclosed
information, we employ a structural model of receiver guesses that also allows receivers
to be confused and hold social preferences. We first measure the degree of confusion and
social preferences using guesses when states are actually disclosed. These out-of-sample
estimates are not sufficient to explain receiver mistakes when states are not disclosed, so
we enrich the model to allow receivers to be naive about sender strategies. We measure
the degree of naivete by estimating the mixture between correct beliefs and naive (“level-
1” or “cursed”) beliefs that best explains receiver mistakes, both at the aggregate level
and at the individual level. Most individual level estimates are close to the extremes (no
naivete or full naivete), and the degree of naivete implied by these individual level
estimates is highly correlated with the stated beliefs of subjects.
       Finally, we find that receiver mistakes decrease with immediate, direct, and
repeated feedback, which eventually leads senders in this case towards disclosing all but
the worst states, a direction more in line with theory. However, we find that when there is
no immediate and repeated feedback or when feedback is at the aggregate level, the rate
of convergence is much slower. Moreover, if we also fix subjects in the same role
throughout the experiment, then we find that the decrease in receiver mistakes and sender
non-disclosure over rounds is no longer statistically significant.
       These results help to shed light on the economics of voluntary disclosure. In
situations where immediate and direct feedback about non-disclosed information is
limited, our findings suggest there is reason to be skeptical that full unraveling will occur.
One reason for limited feedback could be infrequent transactions, as in the markets for
house or car purchases. Even in markets with frequent transactions, feedback can be
limited when consumers are inattentive or unable to process feedback about non-
disclosed information. For example, when restaurants choose not to disclose their



                                              4
hygiene ratings or calorie counts, it can be difficult or time-consuming for consumers to
assess this information immediately after having completed their meal. The impact of
feedback is especially policy-relevant, as policymakers have discussed various
informational interventions related to disclosure.
       This paper provides three main contributions, which are discussed in more detail
in the next section. First, we complement existing empirical studies from the lab and field
by providing evidence of strategic naivete in verifiable disclosure using a novel and clean
laboratory experiment. Second, we elicit beliefs from both senders and receivers, which
provides direct evidence on the underlying mechanisms behind non-disclosure. Third, we
vary the feedback provided to subjects, and explore its role in producing convergence to
equilibrium behavior.
       The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes three related
literatures and our contributions to each. Section 3 lays out the disclosure game and its
equilibrium features. Section 4 describes our experimental design, and Section 5 reports
the results of our experiments. A brief discussion of the results is offered in Section 6.


2 Related Literature
       Our paper draws on and contributes to three literatures: the literature on voluntary
disclosure, the literature on communication experiments, and the literature on beliefs and
play in games.


2.1 Voluntary Disclosure
       Voluntary disclosure is appealing from a policy perspective because it can
improve consumer welfare even without mandatory disclosure policies, which are often
opposed by industry groups and challenging to implement and enforce. The classic
unraveling result suggests that the same benefits as mandatory disclosure can be achieved
simply by ensuring that disclosed information is verifiable and the related costs are low.
This has inspired a number of measures, including standardized information displays,
certification agencies, and truth-in-advertising laws.
       In practice, voluntary disclosure is observed in many industries, but is far from




                                              5
complete.2 As summarized in Dranove and Jin (2010), this incompleteness has motivated
two strands of theories to account for why unraveling does not occur. One strand
emphasizes external factors such as disclosure cost and consumer knowledge before
disclosure, while the other strand focuses on a seller’s strategic incentives. As an example
of the latter, sellers may choose not to obtain data on product quality in order to avoid
future demand for disclosure (Matthews and Postlewaite 1985).
           Other examples of strategic incentives include product differentiation (Board
2009) and countersignaling with multiple quality dimensions (Feltovich, Harbaugh, and
To 2002). The seller’s strategic incentive can also be dynamic: one may refrain from
disclosure even if he has favorable information at hand, as he fears that today’s disclosure
may make it harder to explain non-disclosure in the future when the information turns out
non-favorable (Grubb 2011). In another example of dynamic incentives, a pharmaceutical
firm may prefer to be silent about the potential health risks of its products because of
litigation risk, but this may crowd out positive disclosures (Marinovic and Varas 2015).
         In this paper, we use lab experiments to exclude these additional reasons for limited
disclosure and therefore create a test environment closer to the original, classical theory.
The strategic incentives for disclosure that we study are also present in the subsequent
literature, so our results can potentially inform the wider literature as well. For instance,
persistent naivete about non-disclosure could be combined with any of the additional
forces given above to produce new predictions for verifiable disclosure.
           Our work also draws on the literature in behavioral economics, which has posited
that if buyers are naive about the quality of non-disclosed information, sellers may not
disclose all of their private information. Eyster and Rabin (2005) consider this possibility
in the context of their “cursed equilibrium” concept, and Gabaix and Laibson (2006) and
Heidhues, Koszegi, and Murooka (2016) consider it in the context of shrouded attributes.
Mullainathan, Schwartzstein, and Shleifer (2008) present a model of coarse thinking that
highlights how informational spillovers from one environment to another can make non-
disclosure more persuasive than it would otherwise be. Likewise, in the accounting
literature, Hirshleifer and Teoh (2003) consider the impact of naivete on financial

                                                      6
disclosures. In their model, receivers can be naive about non-disclosed information, but
they can also be inattentive to disclosed information.
         Our findings are also consistent with growing field evidence on attention and
inference in disclosure contexts. Brown, Camerer, and Lovallo (2012) find that firms
with lower quality movies choose to engage in “cold openings” (i.e. they withhold
movies from critics until the movie is released). Their data suggest that customers do not
fully infer that movies with cold openings tend to be worse. Brown, Camerer, and
Lovallo (2013) demonstrate how data on movie openings can be used to differentiate
between equilibrium and non-equilibrium behavior (specifically related to the extent that
naivete limits unraveling in settings of verifiable disclosure).
         We add to these literatures in several ways. Our primary contribution is to provide
evidence of receiver naivete in voluntary disclosure through a controlled laboratory
experiment where beliefs are elicited. In addition, we show this naivete is not easily
eliminated, even if receivers are provided information about aggregate disclosure
behavior and have played as senders for some rounds. Moreover, we show that subjects
drawn from the same population appear strategically sophisticated in the role of sender,
but strategically naive in the role of receiver.3


2.2 Communication Experiments
         Our design borrows many features from the cheap talk experiments of Cai and
Wang (2006) and Wang, Spezio, and Camerer (2010). For instance, we follow both of
these experiments in describing the sender’s type using “secret” numbers and in starting
messages to the receiver with “The number I received is.” In addition, our type space and
payoffs are similar to those found in Wang, Spezio, and Camerer (2010).
         The key difference in our experimental design is that the sender’s messages must
be truthful. Hence, our experiment tests models of verifiable disclosure, rather than cheap
talk. There are only a limited number of experiments that include verifiable disclosure,
and there are important design differences between these experiments and ours. Three of

  In fact, this asymmetry exists at an aggregate level even when subjects play as both senders and receivers,
which suggests that receiver choices may be more “strategically complex” than sender choices. For
instance, receivers need to undertake hypothetical thinking, which has been shown to be difficult in voting
games (Esponda and Vespa 2014).


                                                     7
these papers (Forsythe, Isaac, and Palfrey 1989, King and Wallin 1991, and Dickhaut,
Ledyard, Mukherji, and Sapra 2003) are focused on disclosure in asset markets (as in
Milgrom and Roberts 1986). These experiments feature a sender (the asset seller) who
decides whether to disclose the asset’s quality to receivers who compete with each other
through an auction mechanism. Forsythe, Isaac, and Palfrey (1989) find “unravelling of
both the prices paid for blind-bid items and the quality levels of these items.” King and
Wallin (1991) and Dickhaut, Ledyard, Mukherji, and Sapra (2003) complement these
findings by also showing what happens when there is a possibility that senders may not
be informed about the asset’s quality. The latter goes beyond the former by considering
both partially informed senders and partially informative messages. These experiments
represent a valuable test of disclosure in asset markets, but the use of auctions
(particularly first-price) introduces room for other biases to drive disclosure decisions.
       In addition, Forsythe, Lundholm, and Rietz (1999) compare disclosure to cheap
talk in reducing adverse selection, and they find that reports converge to the unraveling
predictions. Their verifiable disclosure treatment differs from our experiments in that
receivers have a more complicated choice (what price to ask for the product), and senders
can choose not to take that price.
       Concurrent to but separate from our study are two new papers that use
experiments to study verifiable disclosure. Benndorf, Kübler, and Normann (2015) study
a disclosure game in a labor market setting where multiple senders compete through the
use of disclosure. Unlike our experiments, the receiver in their experiment is a computer
that uses an automated strategy, so there is no room for receiver naivete to impact
disclosure (our primary object of study). Hagenbach and Perez-Richet (2015) investigate
a verifiable disclosure game where sender payoffs are not necessarily monotonic in the
state space. More recently, Li and Schipper (2018) implement a disclosure game where
the number of states varies between and within-subject. They find that there is little
difference in behavior between treatments, but that subjects have trouble applying their
learning with one state space to another state space. Also, like Hagenbach and Perez-
Richet (2015), they allow senders to report a subset of the message space.
       In two experiments that study lying aversion, senders have three options: tell the
truth, lie, or not disclose. Non-disclosure takes the form of vague messages in the case of



                                              8
Serra-Garcia, van Damme, and Potters (2011) and silence in the case of Sanchez-Pages
and Vorsatz (2009), so the latter is closer to our experiment. However, unlike in our
experiments, in Sanchez-Pages and Vorsatz (2009) non-disclosure carries a cost. Even
with this cost, some senders choose not to disclose. Serra-Garcia, van Damme, and
Potters (2011) find that intermediate senders sometimes use vague messages, which
receivers do not make correct inferences about. Agranov and Schotter (2012) study the
use of both vague and ambiguous messages, and find that an announcer in coordination
games might want to use such messages.
         Relative to this literature, we believe that our experiments present a simpler and
more direct test of classic verifiable disclosure theory. In addition, to the best of our
knowledge, our experiment is the first to elicit beliefs about receiver guesses and sender
strategies, to vary the feedback provided to subjects, to contrast fixed roles with role
switching, or to provide information about aggregate sender behavior. All four design
elements, separately and in combination, are used to generate new insights on voluntary
disclosure.


2.3 Beliefs and Play in Games
         Central to any strategic interaction is the set of beliefs that people hold about each
other. This has given rise to work in the experimental economics literature based on the
following question: Do people hold correct beliefs about how other people play and do
they best respond to these beliefs?
         While economists typically infer beliefs from actions, stated beliefs can provide
further evidence on both the belief formation process and the ways in which people react
to their own stated subjective beliefs. For example, Costa-Gomes and Weizsacker (2008)
find that subjects often do not best respond to stated beliefs about sender strategies, while
Rey Biel (2009) finds much higher rates of best responding to these beliefs in simpler
games.
         Building on this literature, we ask subjects to state their beliefs about receiver
guesses and sender strategies. This allows us to compare stated beliefs across treatment
arms and also to see whether subjects are acting in line with their beliefs. We find a
strong, positive, and statistically significant correlation between beliefs about receiver


                                               9
guesses and the probability of the sender reporting the underlying state. Likewise, we
find a strong, positive, and statistically significant correlation between implied beliefs
about the underlying state (based on beliefs about sender strategies) and receiver guesses
of the underlying state, which suggests that their actions incorporate beliefs about sender
strategies. Furthermore, we demonstrate asymmetry between the correctness of sender
beliefs and the correctness of receiver beliefs. While sender beliefs are correct on
average, average receivers are insufficiently skeptical about undisclosed information.
This asymmetry motivates senders to withhold non-favorable information more than
theory predicts.


3 The Disclosure Game
        The one-shot disclosure game we study involves two agents: an information
sender and an information receiver. At the beginning of the game, nature determines the
state b (which can be interpreted as the sender’s type) by taking a draw from a probability
distribution F with full support over a finite state space B, which is a subset of the real
numbers. The sender knows the realized state, but ex ante, the receiver knows only the
distribution of possible states.
        The sender has two possible actions, and the receiver is aware that these are the
only two actions available to the sender. The sender can either report the state to the
receiver or make no report. This report must be truthful and cannot be vague. Thus, the
set of actions M available to a sender of type b is just M(b)={b,null}.4
        Regardless of whether or not they receive a report from the sender, the receiver
takes an action a from a finite space A, which is also a subset of the real numbers and
contains B. We interpret this action as guessing the type of the sender.
        The true state and the receiver’s action determine the payoffs for the two parties.
The sender’s utility is given by a function          ( ), which is concave, monotonically
increasing in the receiver’s action, and independent of the state. The receiver’s utility is
given by a function        ( , ), which is concave in the receiver’s action a and reaches its
maximum when a is equal to b. In other words, the receiver benefits more from selecting

4
 In the model of Milgrom (1981), senders are allowed to report a range of states, but we consider a simpler
message space in order to reduce the strategic complexity of the game, which could add cofounding factors.


                                                   10
an action that is closer to the true state, while the sender benefits the most when the
receiver’s action is as high as possible. These utility functions produce a strong conflict
of interest when the state is low.
         When the set of receiver actions A is sufficiently rich, the techniques found in
Milgrom (1981) can easily be adapted to show that in every sequential equilibrium of this
disclosure game, the sender always reports the state (unless it is the minimum element in
B), and if there is no report, the receiver takes the action that is the minimum element in
B.5 In other words, the sender always reports his or her type (unless it is the worst
possible type), and the receiver always guesses the sender is the worst possible type if
they do not report. When the realized state is the minimum element in B, the sender is
indifferent between reporting or not, so any mixture over these actions is consistent with
equilibrium.


4 Experimental Design
         In our experiments, subjects completed 45 rounds and then, depending on the
session, specific additional tasks. Subjects were told at the beginning of the experiment
that they would complete additional tasks, but were given no details about the tasks they
would face later. The appendix contains the full set of instructions given before the start
of the experiment. Instructions for an additional task were presented to subjects on the
computer screen just before the start of a task.6
         At the end of each session, subjects were paid, privately and in cash, their show-
up fee plus any additional earnings from the experiment. Over the course of the
experiment, subjects had the opportunity to accumulate or lose “Experimental Currency
Units” (or ECUs). At the end of the experiment, each subject’s ECU balance was
converted into U.S. dollars at a treatment and role-specific rate, and their final payment
was rounded up to the nearest non-negative whole dollar amount.




5
  In the appendix, we show that sender strategies in all other Bayesian Nash equilibria of this game cannot
satisfy a condition that is clearly consistent with the behavior we observe. As a consequence, subject
choices are not in line with other Bayesian Nash equilibria of this game.

  Our experiment was programmed and run using the z-Tree software package (Fischbacher 2007).


                                                    11
4.1 Main Sessions
        Our main sessions were conducted at the Computer Lab for Experimental
Research (CLER) facility at the Harvard Business School (HBS). In this laboratory,
subjects are separated with dividers, and each subject was provided with a personal
computer terminal.


4.1.1   In Each Round
        In each round, subjects were randomly matched into pairs. To reduce reputational
effects, subjects were matched anonymously and were told that it was very unlikely they
would be paired with the same subject in consecutive rounds. For a session size of 14, the
actual likelihood of being paired with the same subject in consecutive rounds is 7.7%.
        In each round and for each pairing, one subject was the sender, and the other
subject was the receiver. To reduce framing effects, the sender was referred to as the “S
Player”, and the receiver was referred to as the “R Player”.
        For each pair, the computer drew a whole number from 1 to 5, called the “secret”
number. Thus, the state space was B={1,2,3,4,5}. Each of these numbers was equally
likely to be drawn, and both senders and receivers were made aware of this probability
distribution over the state space.
        Each sender was shown the secret number for their pairing and then made their
decision while the receivers waited. Senders were given the option to either “report” or
“skip”, with no time limit on their decision.
        After all senders made their decisions, the receivers’ screens became active. If a
sender decided to report their secret number, the receiver they were paired with was
shown this message: “The number I received is”, followed by the actual secret number. If
a sender decided instead to skip any reporting, the area for messages on the receiver’s
screen was left blank. Subjects were told that these were the only two actions available to
senders, so that if the area for messages on the receiver’s screen was left blank, the
instructions were clear that it was because the sender chose not report the secret number.




                                                12
         Below the area for messages, receivers were asked to guess the secret number,
and these guesses could be any half unit between 1 and 5. Thus, the set of actions was
A={1,1.5,2,2.5,3,3.5,4,4.5,5}.7 There was also no time limit for receiver decisions.
         Receiver payoffs in each round were                   = 110 − 20| − | . , where b is the
secret number and a is the receiver’s guess.8 These payoffs decrease monotonically as the
guess moves further from the secret number. The sender payoffs in each round were
        = 110 − 20|5 − | . . These payoffs are independent of the secret number and
increase monotonically with receiver guesses because guesses cannot be higher than 5.
These payoffs are similar to the quadratic specification found in Crawford and Sobel
(1982) when there is a large bias towards higher actions. Because we use just a small
number of states and actions, the payoffs could be shown in a table, so that subjects did
not need to know or interpret these functional forms.
         With these payoff functions, there was a clear misalignment of interests between
senders and receivers. Receiver payoffs were higher when their guesses were closer to the
secret number, and sender payoffs were higher when the receiver made higher guesses.
Subjects were told in the instructions about these two features of sender and receiver
payoffs.


4.1.2    Treatment Variation
         Our primary treatment variations occurred along two dimensions. First, we varied
the information provided as feedback to subjects after each round (no feedback vs.
feedback), and second, we varied the way that roles were assigned (fixed role vs. random
role). Both sources of variation were used to study the channels through which subjects
learn in this setting. We ran three combinations: “no feedback & fixed role”, “no
feedback & random role”, and “feedback & random role”.




7
  The action space of receivers was made sufficiently rich that the unique sequential equilibrium involves
full unraveling.
8
  We allowed subjects accrue ECU in all rounds because payoffs could vary substantially between roles and
realizations of the state, and we wanted performance to play a larger role than luck in final payments. Cai
and Wang (2006) use similar payoff functions and also paid subjects every round. However, this approach
introduces the possibility of wealth and portfolio effects. To ameliorate such effects, subjects were not told
the cumulative payoffs they had earned so far in the experiment.


                                                     13
        In our “no feedback” treatments, subjects were given no information after
completing each round. After all receivers had made their decisions, subjects proceeded
to a screen that required them to click “OK” to start the next round. After all subjects had
pressed this button, the next round began. In contrast, in our “feedback” treatment,
subjects were told four pieces of information after each round: the actual secret number,
whether the sender reported the secret number, the receiver’s guess of the secret number,
and their own payoff. After all subjects pressed the “OK” button on the screen containing
this feedback, the next round began.
        In our “fixed role” treatment, subjects were randomly assigned a role at the
beginning of the session, and they stayed in that role throughout the entire experiment.
Instead, in our “random role” treatments, subjects were randomly assigned roles before
each round, so that roles might change after each round. In both cases, a subject was
equally likely to be assigned either role. As a result, the likelihood of a subject
experiencing both roles by round 5 in the “random role” treatments was 93.75%. In the
random role treatment, ECU were converted into U.S. dollars at a rate of 200 to 1, but to
equalize expected payments across subjects in the fixed role treatment, ECU were
converted at a rate of 150 to 1 for senders and 250 to 1 for receivers.
        To reduce social considerations, subjects in the feedback treatment were not told
the payoffs for the other player in their pairing, though it could be deduced using the
payoff table. In addition, between rounds subjects only received feedback about their
pairing, not all pairings in the session.


4.1.3   Belief Elicitation and Additional Tasks
        After completing 45 rounds, subjects were asked to guess both the rate at which
senders reported each secret number and the average receiver guess of non-reported
secret numbers during the preceding 45 rounds. The purpose of these questions was to
assess whether subject beliefs about sender strategies influenced their decisions as
receivers and whether subject beliefs about receiver guesses influenced their decisions as
senders. These guesses were not incentivized, but in a recent paper, Trautmann and
Kuilen (2015) show that such “introspective” elicitation can yield accurate beliefs.




                                              14
         We waited until all 45 rounds were complete to elicit beliefs in order to avoid
distorting choices during those rounds. While we asked subjects to assess behavior over
all 45 rounds, because beliefs may change over the course of the experiment, especially
in the face of feedback, stated beliefs may reflect beliefs of opponent actions in just the
final few rounds.9
         After beliefs were elicited, subjects completed an additional task. In our main
sessions, subjects either completed a “high incentives” task or an “aggregate feedback”
task. The “high incentives” task was designed to better understand the impact of
incentives on mistakes. This task mirrored an earlier choice, but with much higher
incentives. In this task, subjects played once more in the role of sender or once more in
the role of receiver, but in both cases they played against a computer instead of a human,
and the computer played a strategy that was designed to mimic the unobserved decision
of a previous opponent. Subjects were not reminded of the choices they had made
previously.
         When in the role of receiver, subjects were told that the computer sender would
not report the secret number and that the secret number would be from a random past
round in which the secret number was not reported. When in the role of sender, subjects
were told that if they reported the secret number, the computer receiver would guess that
number, and if they did not report, the computer receiver would repeat the guess of a
receiver from a random past round where the secret number was not reported. To get as
much information as possible from the sender decisions, we used the “strategy” method
in which senders made a decision for each possible secret number before seeing the
actual secret number. The payoffs from this task were added to the ECU earned in the
first 45 rounds.
         Importantly, for this decision the payoffs of the subject were ten times the rate in
the initial 45 rounds. This design allows us to hold fixed the strategy of the opponent, so
that the impact of incentives can be isolated to just one side of the pairing. Niederle and
Vesterlund (2007) use a similar approach to hold fixed opponent strategies.10

9
  We will examine this possibility during our analysis the experimental data. For example, we compare
stated beliefs also to opponent actions in the last block of rounds (see Figure 1 and Table 5).
10
   There are two potential confounds for this task. First, in this choice, there are no payoff consequences for
their opponent, so social preferences related the opponent’s payoffs are no longer in play. Second, the


                                                      15
         In addition, to better understand the interaction between beliefs and information,
we used a second additional task in which subjects were shown information about the
play of all subjects in the first 45 rounds, guessed again a non-disclosed secret number
from a previous round, and then played 5 more rounds just as in the first 45 rounds. The
payoffs from this task were added to the ECU earned in the first 45 rounds.
         We call this task the “aggregate feedback” task because subjects were shown the
number of times that each secret number was reported and not reported for all subjects
during the first 45 rounds of their session. This provided enough information to determine
both the average reported secret number and the average non-reported secret number.


4.2 10-State Robustness Sessions
         To get a sense for how the size of the state space might impact our findings, we
ran an additional robustness sessions with 10 secret numbers, where
B={1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}, which is twice as large as the state space in the main sessions.
Here again we allow receivers to guess half-unit intervals, so the action space is
A={1,1.5,2,2.5,…,9,9.5,10}.
         To keep payoffs in a comparable range to the main sessions, the distance from the
ideal action is divided in half in the payoff functions, so that receiver payoffs are                    =
                           .
110 − 20|( − )/2|              and sender payoffs are            = 110 − 20|(10 − )/2| . . As a
result, in these robustness sessions the payoffs for senders and receivers when the
receiver guesses a and the secret number is b is the same as when the receiver guesses a/2
and the secret number is b/2 in the main sessions.
         Aside from increasing the set of secret numbers and changing the payoff table, the
experimental design and instructions are the same as in the main sessions. In order to
ensure sufficient statistical power, we did not vary treatments in the robustness sessions –
all subjects completed the “no feedback & random role” treatment. We also conducted
these robustness sessions in the CLER facility at HBS.



random round could be drawn from any part of the experiment, so if there is a large time trend in behavior,
the subject may choose differently because of additional uncertainty over actions.


                                                    16
5 Results
       This section examines sender and receiver behavior in both our main sessions and
robustness sessions. To provide a complete picture of behavior, we look both at choices
pooled across rounds and how choices evolve from round-to-round.


5.1 Subjects in the Main Sessions
       In our main sessions, we observed 324 subjects complete a total of 14,580
decisions, which corresponds to 7,290 pairings. Over 23 sessions, the mean session size
was 14.1. We used a show-up fee of $5, and on average subjects earned $26.60. The
minimum payment was $14 and the maximum payment was $37.
       We assigned 114 subjects to “no feedback & fixed role” sessions, 120 subjects to
“no feedback & random role” sessions, and 90 subjects to “feedback & random role”
sessions. All subjects in the no feedback & fixed role sessions completed the “high
incentives” additional task, and all subjects in the no feedback & random role and
feedback & random role sessions completed the “aggregate feedback” additional task.
       In terms of demographics, we had roughly an equal number of men and women,
and a large majority of subjects were undergraduates and native English speakers.
Around 15% of subjects reported having a friend present in the room during the session.
In the regressions presented in this paper, we either control for these demographic factors
or use subject fixed effects.


5.2 Sender Disclosures and Receiver Guesses
       When pooling across rounds, our primary qualitative findings are that senders
disclose favorable states more often than less favorable states and that receivers tend to
over-guess non-disclosed states, and these features are summarized by Table 1.
       Looking first at senders, the average reporting rate is above 80% when the draw is
equal to the average state (a secret number of 3) and above 90% when the draw is 4 or 5.
For lower draws, however, the average reporting rate drops to 44.5% for draws of 2 and
11.0% for draws of 1. The theoretical predictions are a reporting rate of 100% for draws
of 2 and anywhere between 0% and 100% for draws of 1.




                                             17
        Between treatments, the sender reporting rate differs the most for draws of 2.
When the draw is 2, the reporting rate is not significantly different (for a two-tailed test
of proportions) between the no feedback & fixed role treatment and the no feedback &
random role treatment (p-value=0.840), but is significantly different between either of
those treatments and the feedback treatment (p-value=0.0117 for the fixed role treatment
and p-value=0.0185 for random role treatment). This difference is reflected in the average
secret number when the secret number is not reported. When there is no disclosure, the
average secret number is smaller in the feedback treatment than in the no feedback
treatments, though it is only statistically significant (for a two-tailed t-test) between the
no feedback & random role and feedback & random role treatments (p-value=0.0148).
        Table 1 also presents average receiver guesses by treatment, conditional on
whether the sender reports 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or nothing. Because senders are not allowed to
misreport, one may expect receivers to guess exactly the reported number if the sender
discloses it. This expectation is largely confirmed when the reported number is 3 or 4, but
with some deviation when the reported number is close to either extreme. In particular,
receivers tend to over-guess at the low extreme (1, 2) and under-guess at the high extreme
(5). Over and under-guessing of disclosed secret numbers at the extremes is analyzed in
detail using a structural estimation in a subsequent section.
        When senders choose not to disclose, receivers guess 2.243 on average in the no
feedback & fixed role treatment and 2.283 on average in the no feedback & random role
treatment, and this is not significantly different (p-value=0.3472 for a two-tailed t-test).
In the feedback & random role treatment, the average guess is lower (1.897) and this
significantly different from the other treatments at the 1% level. There is a similar pattern
for the average amount of over-guessing (how far the guess is above the actual secret
number). The amount of over-guessing is similar and not significantly different between
the two treatments without feedback (p-value=0.6557), and the treatment with feedback
is significantly different from the other treatments at the 1% level.


5.2.1   Robustness Check: 10-State Sessions
        There are 84 subjects in our 10-state robustness sessions, and as mentioned
previously, all subjects in those sessions were assigned to the no feedback & random role



                                              18
treatment. Table 2 provides the summary of player actions in the no feedback & random
role treatment for the main sessions and for the 10-state robustness sessions. As when
there are 5 secret numbers, the reporting rate increases monotonically with the secret
number in the sessions with 10 secret numbers. The reporting rate for a secret number of
3 in the robustness sessions is 41.2%, which is comparable to and not statistically
different from the reporting rate for a secret number of 2 in the primary study of 42.6%
(p=0.7379 for a two-tailed test of proportions). In addition, the reporting rate in the
robustness sessions for secret numbers of 5, 7, and 9 are similar and not statistically
different from the reporting rates for 3, 4, and 5 in the main sessions.
       A secret number of 3 in robustness sessions and a secret number of 2 in main
sessions are also comparable in the sense that a risk neutral sender would not want to
report secret numbers of 3 in the robustness sessions (when pooling choices across
rounds). The average guess for a non-reported secret number is 3.419 with a 95%
confidence interval of 3.254 to 3.584. As in the main sessions, the average guess is above
the average actual non-reported secret number in the robustness sessions. In the
robustness sessions, the average non-report secret number is 2.616, which is 0.803 below
the average guess.
       We also find a similar pattern in over and under-guessing when secret numbers
are reported. Once again, guesses are higher than reported secret numbers for low secret
numbers and lower than reported secret numbers for high secret numbers, though the
effect is smaller for high secret numbers.
       In short, our primary qualitative findings for sender and receiver behavior in the
main sessions – incomplete disclosure by senders and over-guessing of non-reported
states by receivers – are robust to enlargement of the state space.


5.3 Departures from the Highest Expected Payoff
       To quantify the impact of incomplete disclosure and receiver over-guessing on
payoffs, we measure how far a subject is from taking the payoff-maximizing action in
each decision problem, which provides a rough sense for the size and consequences of
the “mistakes” they are making. To do this, we construct the average opponent strategy
from our data, determine the expected payoffs for each possible action, and then calculate


                                             19
how far the expected payoffs for the taken action are from the highest expected payoff for
taking any action.11 For senders, the possible actions are reporting or not reporting the
secret number. For receivers, we just consider the guesses that are available to them,
which is important because they are limited to guessing half-units.12
        Table 3 reports the monetary losses that result from the actions taken in our main
sessions, our robustness sessions, and in our high incentives task. Across these settings,
we find that receivers are between 9.3% and 13.3% away on average from the highest
expected payoff and that senders are between 3.4% and 7.3% away on average from their
highest expected payoff. In all settings and roles, the losses are significantly different
from zero at a 1% level (using a two-sided t-test). We also show the losses of receivers
relative to the payoffs they would make in the unraveling equilibrium. These losses range
from 19.9% to 26.4%.
        In addition, Table 3 illustrates two more findings. First, senders have smaller
losses than receivers in all settings. Second, when incentives are increased tenfold,
receivers continue to have similar percentage losses. Receiver losses in the first 45 rounds
of the no feedback & fixed role treatment of the main sessions are not significantly
different from receiver losses in the high incentives task (p=0.5510). This does not appear
to be driven by low power, as sender losses are significantly different in the same
comparison (p=0.0260).
        These losses are reflected in the size of receiver mistakes, as measured by the
distance from the guess with highest expected payoff (normalized by the size of the state
space). Across treatments, receivers are 14.1% to 17.1% away from the guess with the
highest expected payoff. Even when payoffs are increased tenfold, receivers are still
14.4% away, and as the state space is stretched in the robustness treatment, receivers are
still 15.7% away.
        Our calculations take an ex-ante perspective, so when determining the highest
expected payoff for receivers, we assume that all states are equally likely to happen and
determine the average sender behavior separately for each state. In addition, we pool


11
   Because the minimum possible payoff can be negative, we normalized payoffs by the distance from the
minimum possible payoff for the realized state.

   We thank an anonymous referee for suggesting this method.

together all rounds when determining average sender and receiver behavior, which is
equivalent to assuming that a subject is equally likely to face an opponent from any
round. While this is exactly the way that opponents are determined in the high incentives
task, such an assumption may not be suitable for treatments where we observe learning.
       To adjust for dynamic considerations, in Table 5 we calculate sender and receiver
losses with the assumption that a subject is equally likely to face any opponent from the
previous block of 5 rounds. However, the magnitude of the losses does not change
dramatically with the change in reference group. Across treatments in the main sessions,
average sender losses range from 5.1% to 6.8%, and the average receiver losses range
from 9.4% to 12.9%.


5.4 Stated Beliefs: Senders
       As described in Section 4, after all 45 rounds were completed and before any
additional tasks were undertaken, we asked subjects to guess the average receiver guess
when the secret number was not reported over all 45 rounds. The responses of those who
played the role of sender at least once are given in Panel A of Table 4.
       Subjects in the fixed role treatment have the highest average guess (2.273),
followed by those in the no feedback & random role treatment (2.143), and the feedback
& random role treatment (1.617). The first two are similar in size and are not
significantly different (p=0.4330 for a two-tailed t-test). However, stated beliefs are
significantly different between both of no feedback treatments and the feedback treatment
at a 1% level. As shown in Panel B of Table 4, these guesses are close to the actual
averages (2.243, 2.283, and 1.897), particularly for the no feedback treatments.
       We find that sender disclosure decisions are largely consistent with their beliefs
about receiver guesses. Regardless of treatment, over 85% of decisions are consistent
with reporting if and only if the secret number is below the belief of the average receiver
guess of the non-reported secret number. Over the last 15 rounds, this rate rises to 89.1%
in the fixed role treatments, to 91.3% in the no feedback & random role treatment, and to
92.1% in the feedback and random role treatment. It may not be surprising that the rate of
consistency increases given that beliefs are collected after all 45 rounds are complete.




                                             21
5.5 Stated Beliefs: Receivers
       After all 45 rounds were complete, we also ask subjects who played the role of
receiver at least once to guess the percentage of senders who reported each secret number
over all 45 rounds. The frequency of their responses is given in the three panels of Figure
1, along with the average guesses and the actual rates each secret number was reported.
       Larger bubbles correspond to a larger number of guesses in an interval of 5
percentage points, and the thick line corresponds to the average guess. While there is
clear heterogeneity in the stated beliefs of subjects, the bulk of guesses follow the
average rate. One exception is that there are a large number of guesses above the average
guess for a secret number of 3. However, the two upper lines, which represent the actual
reporting rate, pass through this region, so these higher guesses represent accurate beliefs.
The thin line represents the reporting rate for the last 15 rounds, and the medium line
represents the average reporting rate for all 45 rounds.
       Regardless of the treatment, average guesses for reporting rates of draws of 2 and
3 are well below the actual averages, and they are significantly different at a 1% level for
all treatments (for a two-tailed t-test). Although the differences in this gap between
treatments are not significant, the feedback treatment has the largest gap between average
guess and actual average for draws of 2 (18.3%).
       Because receiver beliefs of sender disclosure strategies are significantly different
from the actual disclosure rate of an average sender, this suggests that receivers are not
sufficiently skeptical about non-disclosure. More importantly, this misbelief is present in
all treatments and was reported after subjects have played 45 rounds. This implies that
repeated play might have a limited role in correcting the mistaken beliefs of receivers.
       Though subjects were asked to guess the reporting rate for all 45 rounds, it seems
plausible that their guesses would be closer to the actual reporting rate for the more
recent rounds. However, the gap between average guesses and actual rates increases if we
just consider actual rates in the last 15 rounds.
       Comparing treatments, the average guess of the disclosure rate for draws of 2 is
very similar between the no feedback treatments (26.8% for fixed roles and 27.7% for
random roles). The average guess is higher for the feedback treatment (32.0%), but this is
not significantly different from the no feedback treatments (p-value=0.2113 for fixed


                                              22
roles and p-value=0.2252 for random roles). However, the results of our structural
estimation help to reveal a significant difference in receiver stated beliefs between
treatments.


5.6 Structural Model
        To help understand the source of receiver mistakes, we estimate a structural
model of receiver decision-making that allows for three types of biases: confusion, social
preferences, and naivete about non-disclosed information.


5.6.1   Guesses of Disclosed Secret Numbers
        As discussed above, some subjects do not guess the secret number correctly, even
when it has been disclosed. These mistakes suggest that some subjects may not
understand the game or may understand the game but choose to guess differently from
the true disclosed number because of social preferences. Measuring the extent of these
behavioral factors when secret numbers are disclosed can be helpful, as the same
behavioral factors may affect receiver behavior when they face the more complicated
situation of non-disclosure.
        We estimate confusion and the social preferences of the subjects jointly. Here we
make two functional form assumptions. First, we assume that confusion results in a
receiver sometimes guessing in a uniform random way. In the Level-k model of choice,
this is often designated as the “level-0” behavior. Because we are using a representative
agent model, this is as if some fraction of agents are level-0 agents. Second, we assume
that receivers sometimes use social preferences that take the form proposed by Fehr and
Schmidt (1999). Note that only one parameter of this model (advantageous inequality)
will have consequence for receiver decisions. Together, these two forces give us three
parameters to estimate: the probability of uniform random guessing, the probability of
using social preference, and a parameter of the Fehr-Schmidt model of social preferences.
        The parameters of this model were estimated to maximize likelihood of the
observed receiver guesses (of disclosed secret numbers), using the Nelder–Mead method
with 1,000 random started values, and the standard errors were computed using 1,000




                                             23
bootstrapping samples. These results, along with the likelihoods and predicted levels of
over-guessing are provided in Table 5 Panel A.
       For comparison, we estimate the model for each treatment separately. Each
estimation sample excludes receivers who have a large fraction of mistaken choices when
secret numbers are disclosed (more than 75% of choices). Not surprisingly, the fraction
of such receivers decreases with feedback and role switching. Overall, 8.8% (5 of 57) are
classified this way in the no feedback & fixed role treatment, 5.8% (7 of 120) in the no
feedback & random role treatment, and 2.2% (2 of 90) in the feedback & random role
treatment.
       Excluding these outliers allows us to estimate the confusion of the rest of the
subject pool more precisely. In particular, we find that 11.4% of the remaining receivers
are confused in the no feedback & fixed role treatment. This fraction declines to 7.8% if
we add role switching and down further to 4.6% if we add both role switching and round-
by-found feedback. This pattern suggests that role switching and full feedback help to
reduce subject confusion.
       In contrast, the estimates of social preferences are comparable across treatments,
and robust to whether the sample includes the outlier subjects or not. These results
suggest that only 3.4% to 4% of receiver decisions are impacted by social preferences.
For the advantageous inequality parameter, the estimate is 0.434 for the treatment of no
feedback and fixed roles, and 0.411 for the other two treatments. The value of 0.434
implies that it is optimal for a receiver with such social preferences to over-guess secret
numbers of 1 by 1.5, secret numbers of 2 by 1, and secret numbers of 3 and 4 by .5. The
value of 0.411 has similar implications, except that secret numbers of 1 are only over-
guessed by 1 instead of 1.5.
       To determine whether this model does a good job of explaining receiver mistakes,
we compare it to a model of receiver guesses based on the Quantal Response Equilibrium
(QRE) approach of McKelvey and Palfrey (1995). That approach assumes that receivers
have Logit demand for each action based on the expected payoffs to taking each action
given the empirical distribution of opponent actions. It has a free parameter often
interpreted as the sensitivity of errors to expected payoffs, which we estimate using
maximum likelihood. As shown in Table 6 Panel A, our model with confusion and social



                                             24
preferences has a higher likelihood than QRE for all three treatments. It is also better able
to predict the observed levels of over-guessing, as measured by the average distance from
actual over-guessing.


5.6.2   Model of Naivete for Non-Disclosed Secret Numbers
        To see the extent to which confusion and social preferences may be driving
receiver mistakes when secret numbers are not disclosed, we apply the out-of-sample
estimates of confusion and receiver mistakes to guesses of non-disclosed secret numbers.
To accommodate strategic uncertainty, we initially assume that receivers are risk neutral
expected utility maximizers over ex-post payoffs and hold correct beliefs about the
frequency of non-disclosed secret numbers. This corresponds to the columns labeled
“Model” in Table 5 Panel B. Across all three treatments, this model struggles to explain
the aggregate levels of over-guessing we observe: the average distance between actual
receiver guess and the predicted guess (with non-disclosed secret numbers) ranges from
1.212 to 1.408.
        To better explain receiver mistakes, we further assume that receivers are naive,
and the corresponding estimates appear in the columns labeled “+ Naive”. To be specific,
this extended model includes the same out-of-sample estimates of confusion and social
preferences, but allows receivers to have a belief that is a mixture between the correct
prior and a fully naive prior. At one extreme, their beliefs are correct (equal to the
empirical frequency of non-disclosed secret numbers when the secret number is not
reported). At the other extreme, their beliefs are fully naïve (each state is equally likely).
The latter corresponds to “level-1” beliefs in the Level-k approach and fully cursed
agents in the Cursed Equilibrium approach. Thus, the mixture parameter can be
interpreted as the extent of receiver naivete.
        Once again, the parameter was estimated using the Nelder–Mead method using
1,000 random started values, and the standard errors were computed using 1,000
bootstrapping samples. Because this parameter is set-identified, the “+ Naive” columns of
Table 5 Panel B present estimates of the lower and upper bounds of this parameter at the




                                              25
aggregate level (when subject choices are pooled together in each treatment).13 The
estimated bounds of this parameter suggest that on aggregate, receiver beliefs are best
described as a mixture between correct beliefs and 4% to 58.6% fully naive beliefs in the
no feedback & fixed role treatment, 2.9% to 56.2% fully naive beliefs in the no feedback
& random role treatment, and 0.1% to 14% fully naive beliefs in the feedback & random
role treatment. While these bounds are wide and the lower bounds are close to zero,
adding naivete significantly increases the model’s likelihood and substantially improves
its ability to explain over-guessing. The average distance between actual and predicted
guesses is reduced from a range of 1.212 to 1.408 to a range of 0.085 to 0.240.
         To investigate potential heterogeneity among individuals, we also estimate the
lower and upper bounds of the naivete parameter at the individual level for each
treatment.14 Figure 2 shows the distribution of the lower and upper bounds: it turns out
that the degree of naivete is quite heterogeneous between subjects. Also, there is a
significant difference in the lower bound, upper bound, and set average of this parameter
between the no feedback & fixed role treatment and the feedback & random role
treatment (p= 0.0440, p= 0.0176, and p= 0.0146 respectively using a two-sided Wilcoxon
rank-sum test).
         Since a level of naivete corresponds to a belief about the frequency of each secret
number, we can calculate the average non-disclosed secret number implied by each
estimate of individual beliefs. For the same individual, we can also calculate the average
non-disclosed secret number implied by that individual’s stated beliefs. Figure 3 presents
the scatter plot between these two numbers (using the set average of the estimated
parameter). Overall, their correlation is 0.3222, which decreases with feedback and role
switching: 0.5222 with no feedback & fixed roles, 0.2985 with no feedback & random
roles, and 0.2408 with feedback & random roles.
       Much of the difference in correlations is driven by just 14 subjects who have stated
beliefs that appear naive (average guess of non-disclosed secret numbers >2.50) and
estimated beliefs that appear sophisticated (average guess of non-disclosed secret


13
   The naivete parameter is set identified because while there is a continuous interval of naivete levels, there
are only a discrete number of guesses to map them onto.
14
   The aggregate level estimates of confusion and social preferences were applied at the individual level.
There were insufficient observations to estimate all three parameters at the individual level.


                                                      26
numbers <2.50). If we remove these subjects (8 are from the no feedback & random role
treatment and 6 are from the feedback & random role treatment), the correlations are
0.5222, 0.5202, and 0.3845 respectively. Also, without these subjects, there is a
significant difference in stated beliefs between the no feedback & fixed role treatment
and the feedback & random role treatment (p=0.0424 for a two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum
test). In other words, other than the few outliers, most subjects demonstrate significant
consistency between stated beliefs and estimated beliefs. Feedback and role switching
tend to weaken this correlation, possibly because stated beliefs are given after all 45
rounds of play while the estimated belief reflects the average belief that subjects hold
during the 45 rounds. As shown below, there are more round-by-round changes in subject
behavior when they can learn from role switching and feedback.


5.7 Round-by-Round Dynamics: Sender Disclosures
       Next, we analyze the dynamics of behavior across 45 rounds and with varying
levels of feedback, starting with sender behavior. Figure 4 shows the overall sender
reporting rate for each treatment by block of 5 rounds, and Figure 5 shows the sender
reporting rate for each treatment for each of the first three secret numbers separately. As
in Figure 1, the dotted line represents the feedback treatment and the solid line represents
the fixed role treatment. Without controlling for any other factors, it appears that there is
an increasing trend for draws of 2 and 3 for the feedback treatment and possibly for the
other treatments as well. However, these effects could be confounded with demographic
differences between subjects or differences in the composition of each session.
       Table 6 investigates these trends using regression analysis with demographic
controls and session fixed effects or subject fixed effects. When not using subject fixed
effects, we also include a dummy variable for whether the draw is above the sender’s
guess of the average receiver guess of non-disclosed numbers.
       In specifications 1 and 2, all draws are included in the analysis, but separate
dummy variables are provided for each of the draws. In keeping with our previous
findings, the probability of reporting increases monotonically with the draw and the
difference between a draw of 1 and any other draw is statistically significant at the 1%
level holding round, draw, and individual characteristics fixed.


                                             27
In terms of dynamics, we find that the reporting rate is much lower in the first 5 rounds,
and this effect is statistically significant at the 5% level for both specifications. There
appears to be a small positive time trend on the reporting rate even for the no feedback
treatment, but this effect is only significant at the 10% level. There also appears to be a
positive and significant difference between treatments in the time trend, but this is only
significant at the 10% level between the no feedback & fixed role treatment and the
feedback & random role treatment.
        If we look just at draws of 2 (specifications 3 and 4), there is not a statistically
significant time trend for the no feedback & fixed role treatment, but there is a
statistically significant difference between this treatment and the feedback treatment. The
effect size is also relatively large for the difference in time trends between these two
treatments.
        In these regressions, we also see that the impact of beliefs is largely and highly
significant. Controlling for the draw itself, along with time trends and individual
characteristics, the probability of reporting increases almost 25% if the sender believes
that the receiver will guess lower than the draw (taking stated beliefs at face value).


5.8 Round-by-Round Dynamics: Receiver Guesses
        Figure 6 plots the average receiver guess for each block of 5 rounds, conditional
on senders not reporting. While all three treatments start out at a similar place, the
feedback treatment appears to diverge from the others and has a clearer time trend.
        Panel B of Table 4 provides more detail on these trends, but again without any
controls. The guess of non-reported secret number appears to be decreasing for all
treatments, but this is a bit misleading, as the actual secret number is also decreasing for
all treatments. If we look instead at the amount of over-guessing, it appears that the
feedback treatment has the biggest drop, with almost no over-guessing in the final block
of 15 rounds.
        Table 7 shows the output of a number of regressions on the dynamics of receiver
guesses. All specifications include both a version with individual demographic controls
and subject fixed effects. Looking at specifications 1 and 2, there is a large and


                                              28
statistically significant impact guessing in the first 5 rounds: guesses are much higher
during those rounds. In the no feedback & fixed role treatment, there is not a statistically
significant time trend otherwise. However, there is a large and statistically significant
difference in time trends between this treatment and the feedback treatment.
         As with senders, beliefs appear to have a large and highly significant impact on
guesses. For receivers, we use their stated beliefs of sender strategies to generate an
implied belief of the average non-reported secret number using an equal probability of
each state and Bayes’ Rule. Controlling for time trends and individual factors, we find in
specification 1 that there is a very high correlation between these implied beliefs and
what subjects guess.
         To investigate why receiver guesses decrease over time in the feedback treatment,
we examine whether changes from one guess of a non-disclosed secret number to the
next guess of a non-disclosed secret number are related to the types of mistakes made and
whether feedback was received. Table 8 shows the results of several regression
specifications based on this objective. For specifications 1 and 2, we find strong evidence
that subjects who were informed in the feedback treatment that they guessed too high
decreased their guesses the next time they had an opportunity to do so. This effect is
statistically significant at the 1% level for both specifications.15
         There are two potential concerns with these results. First, if subjects have access
to other sources of learning, we would expect this effect to exist for all treatments, and it
does. However, the effect is stronger for subjects receiving feedback. Second, mean
reversion from extreme guesses could produce similar results because very high guesses
are almost surely over-guesses and very low guesses are almost surely not over-guesses.
In specifications 3 and 4, we examine whether the effects we observe in specifications 1
and 2 hold also for intermediate guesses. We find that the effect in the no-feedback
treatment diminishes, but the effect in the feedback treatment stays large. It is statistically
significant in specification 3 and has a p-value of 0.05 in specification 4.




15
  Unlike over-guessing, there is not a statistically significant relationship between receiving feedback and
under-guessing for any of the specifications. However, this asymmetry could be driven by the fact that
under-guessing occurs less often, so may be underpowered.


                                                     29
5.9 Learning from Aggregate Reporting
       The final question we address is whether providing information about aggregate
sender strategies impacts behavior. As shown previously, we find evidence that reported
beliefs about sender strategies are not skeptical enough and are strongly correlated with
actual guesses, so information about sender strategies could potentially improve guesses
and disclosure rates.
       To test this, we examine the choices of subjects who completed the aggregate
feedback additional tasks, which are all subjects in the two random role treatments. As
mentioned previously, after 45 rounds the subjects are shown the corresponding
aggregate information. We then have subjects play 5 more rounds, and we compare the
reporting rates and guesses in these rounds to the reporting rates and guesses made in the
last 5 rounds of the first 45 rounds. These results are provided in Table 9.
    This table compares the reporting rates for the 5 rounds just before and just after the
information is provided. For senders in the feedback treatment, the reporting rates do not
significantly differ for a two-sided t-test, nor does the average secret number when
senders make no disclosure. The same is true if we look at subjects in the no feedback
treatment. The table also compares the guesses made when senders did not report their
secret number. If anything, the information intervention causes guesses to rise on
average. However, there is not a significant difference in guesses before and after the
informational intervention for either of the treatments.


6 Discussion
       Our findings shed light on a fundamental inference problem that prevents full
unraveling in voluntary disclosure, and the conditions under which full unraveling is
most likely to occur. In contexts with little or no feedback, receivers are not sufficiently
skeptical about undisclosed information. In our experiments, these mistakes can persist
for the full 45 rounds of the experiment, and as a result, information senders can profit by
limiting disclosure. However, round-by-round feedback about mistakes can result in
behavior that converges to the predictions based on full unraveling.
       Our results also shed light on the factors that may limit voluntary disclosure in the
field, and the situations in which we might expect voluntary disclosure to be an effective


                                             30
policy. These findings suggest that unless buyers receive fast and precise feedback about
mistakes after each transaction, market forces can be insufficient to close the information
gap between sellers and buyers.
       For the products that naturally offer such feedback – say cereals that taste crunchy
and t-shirts that hold color fast – voluntary disclosure may converge to the unraveling
predictions after a buyer purchases the product many times. However, for product
attributes with less immediate feedback – such as the fat content of salad dressing and the
cleanliness of a restaurant kitchen – voluntary disclosure may not converge to the
unraveling results. In these situations, mandatory disclosure may be necessary if the
policy goal is complete disclosure. However, there is growing evidence that mandating
disclosure may not be sufficient for achieving the desired outcomes (Loewenstein,
Sunstein, and Golman 2014, Jin, Luca, Martin 2018), which calls for more future
research.

Table 3. Payoff losses for senders and receivers (main sessions, robustness sessions, and
high incentives task). In Panel A, the payoff loss is the fraction of the highest expected payoffs
that was not achieved for a given decision (relative to the expected payoffs for that decision). In
Panel B, the payoff loss is the fraction of the equilibrium payoffs that was not achieved for a
given decision (relative to the expected payoffs for that decision). All payoffs have been
normalized by the minimum payment that could be achieved with a decision. Expectations are
formed treating all secret numbers as equally likely and assuming there is an equal chance of
facing players in the other role from any round of the same session. Receiver losses are just for
rounds where the secret number is not reported. In Panel C, we calculate the distance from the
guess with highest expected payoff divided by the width of the state space (5 or 10).

1 Experimental Instructions
Welcome
You are about to participate in an experiment on decision-making, and you will be paid for your
participation in cash, privately at the end of the experiment. What you earn depends partly on
your decisions, partly on the decisions of others, and partly on chance.
Please silence and put away your cellular phones now.
The entire session will take place through your computer terminal. Please do not talk or in any
way communicate with other participants during the session.
We will start with a brief instruction period. During the instruction period you will be given a
description of the main features of the experiment and will be shown how to use the computers. If
you have any questions during this period, raise your hand and your question will be answered so
everyone can hear.
Instructions
The experiment you are participating in consists of 45 rounds. At the end of the final round, you
will complete an additional task, be asked to fill out a questionnaire, and then will be paid the total
amount you have accumulated during the course of the session (in addition to the $5 show up
fee). Everybody will be paid in private. You are under no obligation to tell others how much you
earned.
The currency used during these 45 rounds is what we call “Experimental Currency Units” (ECU).
For your final payment, your earnings during these 45 rounds will be converted into US dollars at
the ratio of 200:1 (200 ECU=$1). They will then be rounded up to the nearest (non-negative)
dollar amount.
In the first round, you will be matched with one other person, and you are equally likely to be
matched with any other person in the room. You will not know whom you are matched with, nor
will the person who is matched with you. One of you will be assigned to be S Player and the other
to be the R Player for that round. You are equally likely to be assigned to either role. In the
second round, you will once again be randomly matched with one other person (most likely with a
different person than in the first round) and randomly assigned a role, and this will be repeated
until 45 rounds are complete.
In each round and for every pair, the computer program will generate a secret number that is
randomly drawn from the set {1,2,3,4,5}. The computer will then send the secret number to the S
Player. After receiving this number, the S Player will choose whether or not to report the secret
number to the R Player. If the S Player chooses to report the number, the R Player will receive
this message from the S Player: “The number I received is” followed by the actual secret number.
Otherwise, the R Player will receive no message.
After seeing the message or not, the R Player will guess the value of the secret number. The
earnings of both players depend on the value of the secret number and the R Player’s guess.
The specific earnings are shown in the table below, which is displayed again before the S Player
and R Player make their choices. In each cell of the table, the payoff for the S Player is on the
left, and the payoff for the R Player is on the right. As you can see from the table, the S Player
earns more when the R Player makes a higher guess, and the R Player earns more when their
guess is closer to the secret number.

2 Other Bayes Nash Equilibria

In the disclosure game presented in this paper, nature moves first by selecting the secret
number, which creates a game of incomplete information. A standard solution concept for
such games is Bayes Nash Equilibrium (BNE). BNE have two defining characteristics:
strategies are optimal given beliefs and beliefs are correct (according to Bayes’ Rule) on
the equilibrium path. Because there are no requirements for strategies and beliefs off the
equilibrium path, both can be constructed so that otherwise “reasonable” deviations are
ruled out. As a consequence, games of incomplete information can end up with a
multitude of BNE, some of which seem implausible. For our game, this can produce
partial disclosure BNE.

Definition: A partial disclosure Bayes Nash Equilibrium (BNE) of our game is a BNE in
which senders of multiple types put a positive probability on not reporting.

For instance, when the set of receiver actions is sufficiently rich, there can exist a BNE of
our disclosure game in which senders of all types do not report and receivers take an
action that is as close to the average realization of the state space as possible. This is
supported by a receiver strategy in which the action closest to the bottom of the state
space is taken when the sender reports, regardless of what the sender reports. Clearly,
guessing 1 when the sender has reported 5 is not optimal, but because senders never
report in this equilibrium, that node of the extensive form game is never reached, so the
receiver’s payoffs are not improved by deviating.

To show that the data in our experiment are not consistent with any partial disclosure
BNE, we show that there is a condition that is inconsistent with all such equilibria. This
condition is clearly evident in our experimental data, so we can conclude that we do not
observe behavior that is consistent with a partial disclosure BNE.

Proposition: In every partial disclosure BNE of our game, it cannot be that all secret
numbers above the minimum are reported with a positive probability.

This proposition is simple to prove. By definition, every partial disclosure BNE has at
least two types that choose non-reporting with a positive probability. Thus, the
Proposition is equivalent to saying it is not possible (in a BNE) to simultaneously have
more than one type not reporting with positive probability (partial disclosure) and all
types reporting with positive probability.

Because on-path beliefs must be correct in a BNE, the guess of the non-reported number
must be below the highest type. By contradiction, assume that all numbers above the
                                            52
minimum are reported with a positive probability. In that case, the highest type that puts a
positive probability on not reporting always has a profitable deviation to reporting, since
the receiver will be guess the secret number in that case. But this cannot be true in a
BNE.

In our data, we observe a positive probability of reporting in every secret number above
the minimum, hence according to the Proposition, it cannot be a partial disclosure BNE.

3 NYU Robustness Sessions

We ran additional sessions of the “no feedback & random role” treatment with five secret
numbers (as in the main sessions) in the Center for Experimental Social Science (CESS)
laboratory at New York University (NYU). These sessions were excluded from our main
sessions because beliefs were not elicited from subjects in these sessions. Instead, we use
these sessions to perform additional robustness checks for our results that do not require
data on beliefs. We also use them to examine behavior in other additional tasks.


3.1 Experimental Design: Other Additional Tasks

In addition to the “aggregate feedback” additional task, we ran five other additional tasks
at NYU that do not appear in our main sessions. In the first, which we call the “risk” task,
subjects completed the well-known measure of risk aversion introduced by Holt and
Laury (2002). For this measure, subjects make 10 choices between a safer lottery
(payments of $2.00 or $1.60) and riskier lottery (payments of $3.85 or $0.10) in which
the probability of the high payment was the same within each choice, but varied across
choices. A risk-neutral decision maker would choose the lottery with a 40% chance of $2
over the lottery with a 40% chance of $3.85, but the lottery with a 50% chance of $3.85
over the lottery with a 50% chance of $2. The switching point in this “multiple price list”
can be viewed as a reflection of the risk preferences of each subject. This task was
incentivized by randomly selecting one of their 10 choices, realizing the chosen lottery,
and adding any earnings to the show-up fee and earnings from the first 45 rounds.

The aim of this task was to see whether subject choices were related to the risk
preferences of subjects. Risk preferences can impact receiver guesses when there is
uncertainty about the underlying state, and risk aversion can push guesses of non-
reported secret numbers higher when the distribution of non-reported secret numbers is
skewed towards lower numbers because higher guesses produce lower variation in
payments. For instance, given the overall reporting rates for the “fixed role & no
feedback” treatment reported in Table 2, the unconstrained optimal guess for a risk
neutral agent would be 1.6156, and for a risk averse agent with the preferences
U(x)=x^.75, the optimal guess would be 1.6725. Note that the predicted difference is
small, even for substantial changes in risk preferences, so we might not expect to see a
strong relationship between receiver guesses and risk preferences.

We call the second additional task the “other” task. In this task, subjects played once
more in the role of sender and once more in the role of receiver, but in both cases, they
played against a computer instead of a human (and were told this was the case). This
                                            54
computer played a strategy designed to mimic the past decision of another player. This
type of task is designed to keep the strategic decisions the same as in previous choices,
but to remove the payoff implications for others. By comparing these choices with
previous choices, we can determine whether sender and receiver choices were impacted
by social concerns related to the payoffs of the subject they were paired with.16 Niederle
and Vesterlund (2007) use a similar approach to separate preferences for competition
from social preferences. Note that this task is identical to the “high incentives” task, but
with a normal payoff rate. As in the “high incentives” task, guesses in this task are
potentially impacted both by changes in the payoff implications for senders and by the
fact that behavior may be changing over rounds because of learning.17

In the third task, which we call the “self” task, subjects played once more in the role of
sender and once more in the role of receiver, and in both cases, they also played against a
computer instead of a human. However, this time the computer played a strategy
designed to mimic the past decisions of that same subject. This type of task is designed to
assess whether subjects can best respond to accurate beliefs, under the assumption that
they form accurate beliefs about their own strategies. A similar approach was used by
Ivanov, Levin, and Niederle (2010) in examining the role of beliefs in the Winner’s
Curse. However, guesses in this task are also potentially impacted by the fact that
behavior may be changing over rounds.

In the fourth task, which we call the “computer” task, subjects played 5 additional rounds
in the role of receiver against a computer sender. In this task, subjects were told that the S
player (computer) would report the secret number if that would “maximize their earnings
given the guesses of all other participants (besides yourself) in the proceeding round.” In
practice, this meant that the computer reported the secret number if it was above the
average guess for all other subjects in the previous round who did not receive a report.
The payoffs from this task were added to the ECU earned in the first 45 rounds. The aim
of this task was to assess whether any failures of unraveling in the first 45 rounds were
due solely to the fact that receivers believe senders were potentially non-optimizing or
poorly informed humans, which may be a good assumption for small firms, but not
necessarily large firms.

In fifth task, which we call the “average reports” task, subjects were shown the average
reported secret number from all subjects in that session from the first 45 rounds and then


16
   The various ways in which social considerations could potentially impact receiver guesses in our game is
discussed in this appendix.
17
   The latter produces several possible confounds. For example, subjects may have learned to play
differently, or subjects may have changed their beliefs about what other subjects have learned. We thank an
anonymous referee for pointing this out.
                                                    55
completed the same steps as in the “aggregate feedback” task. Because the number of
rounds in which the secret number was reported was not provided, there was not enough
information for subjects to fully pin down the average non-reported secret number. For
instance, the average reported secret number would be 4 if the secret number was
reported in just one round where the secret number was 4 (leaving the average non-
reported secret number near 3), and the average reported secret number would also be 4 if
all senders with secret numbers of 3, 4, and 5 reported (leaving the average non-reported
secret number near 1.5). However, by placing additional assumptions on the actions of
senders, more information can be gleaned from the average reported secret number. For
instance, by assuming monotonic reporting rules and the same cut-off for all senders, the
average non-reported secret number can fully pinned down from the average reported
secret number.


3.2 Results: Robustness

In our sessions at NYU, we also used a show-up fee of $5, and on average subjects
earned $25.25. Table A1 shows the summary statistics for the NYU sessions. All 212
subjects at NYU were assigned to the “no feedback & random role” treatment. NYU
subjects were more likely to self-report as undergraduates, female, and non-native
English speakers than our HBS subjects.

Table A2 compares the actions of senders and receivers across schools. At NYU, there is
less disclosure of less favorable draws and more disclosure of more favorable draws,
which produces a lower average secret number when senders do not report. Also, at NYU
receivers are more pessimistic about non-reported secret numbers. However, the extent to
which receivers overestimate non-reported secret numbers is very similar between
schools (0.481 and 0.448) and is not statistically significant at the 10% level using a 2-
sided t-test.

3.3 Results: Other Additional Tasks

In the NYU sessions, 38 subjects completed the risk additional task, 26 the other task, 38
the self task, 42 the computer task, 30 the average reports task, and 38 the aggregate




                                            57
feedback task.18 Here we examine results for the risk task and the other task, as they were
designed specifically to examine other forces besides belief biases that could explain
receiver over-guessing. Results for the other tasks are available in Jin, Luca, and Martin
(2015).

We first look at the 38 subjects who completed the risk additional task. When a subject
has more than one switch point in the Holt-Laury multiple price list, then risk preferences
are hard to ascertain, but just 3 subjects had multiple switch points. For the 35 subjects
that had consistent switch points, 5 had a switch point that is consistent with risk
neutrality. Another 3 subjects had switch points consistent with being risk loving, and the
rest of subjects were consistent with being risk averse. There was a fair bit of variation in
switch points: 5 subjects switched from the safe lottery to the risky lottery when there
was a 50% chance of the high payment, 8 switched when there was a 60% chance, 7
when there was a 70% chance, and 5 when there was an 80% chance.

We used an OLS regression of receiver guess onto switch point. Controlling for the
number of rounds that a receiver had spent as a sender or receiver up to that point and for
subject fixed effects, the coefficient on switch point is positive, but is small (0.031) and
not significant (p=0.261).19

Second, we explore the role of social preferences in guessing of non-reported secret
numbers. For evidence of this, we examine 26 NYU subjects who completed the other
additional task. As mentioned previously, these subjects guessed the secret number from
an earlier round, but now without payoff implications for the sender. If social preferences
were a leading explanation for higher guesses, we would expect a decrease in guesses in
this task. Instead, the average guess increased by 0.206, which is not statistically
significant at a 10% level (two-sided t-test, p=0.1866).20

The increase in guesses after social considerations are minimized provides suggestive
evidence of a punishment motive towards those who do not disclose. Instead of providing
a force pushing away from equilibrium (higher guesses for non-reported secret numbers),
social considerations appear to be pushing behavior towards equilibrium (lower guesses
for non-reported secret numbers).

   Unlike the additional tasks completed in our main sessions, the addition tasks completed in our NYU
sessions are potentially under-powered because even though there were 212 subjects in total, each subject
only completed one additional task and there were six possible additional tasks.
19 However, there is just a single data point per subject, so it should be note that this analysis may be

underpowered.
20 Once again, there is just a single data point per subject, so this analysis may be underpowered.

4 Social Preferences

Social preferences can impact receiver behavior differently depending on whether or not
the sender discloses the secret number, and when the sender discloses, the realization of
the secret number. The realization of the state matters because it impacts the distribution
of payoffs and individuals have been shown to hold preferences over the distribution of
payoffs.

First, when senders disclose the secret number, social preferences could lead receivers to
over-guess very low secret numbers. Because of the concavity of the payoff function,
when receivers make very low guesses, sender payoffs are very low. In many standard
social preference models, agents lose utility when they experience guilt over making
much higher payoffs than their opponent. Such models would predict that receivers
would make higher guesses, even when the secret number is not reported. For instance,
standard models of fairness would say that some individuals could feel “bad” about
accurately guessing the revealed state when the state is 1 (payoffs: -29, 110) due to
feelings of guilt.

However, as shown in structural model of receiver guesses, the estimated prevalence of
social preference is under 5% for disclosed secret numbers in all three treatments. At this
rate, social preferences are not prevalent enough to impact the strategic incentives for
unraveling.

Second, when senders do not disclose the secret number, the same forces of guilt may be
at work. However, because receivers are now uncertain of the state, we have to account
for the interaction between risk and social preferences. We know of no model of fairness
under risk that would suggest that the impact of social motivations would get stronger
with risk. As a consequence, we would expect the impact of guilt to be no greater with
non-disclosure than with disclosure.

Thus, given the small size of the possible impact of social preferences in the case of
disclosure, it seems unlikely that social preferences are driving a substantial part of the
over-guessing when senders do not disclose. In fact, our structural estimation shows that
without naivete, a combination of social preferences and confusion is insufficient to
explain the extent of receiver over-guessing.

On top of this, if there is a social norm of disclosing, then receivers might wish to punish
non-disclosure, even if the chances of re-matching are low. We find evidence of just such
behavior in the “other” additional task conducted in our NYU sessions. These
punishments should further dampen receiver guessing with non-disclosure.
