                                              ABSTRACT

Inflation targeting is a monetary-policy strategy that is characterized by an announced numerical inflation
target, an implementation of monetary policy that gives a major role to an inflation forecast and has
been called forecast targeting, and a high degree of transparency and accountability. It was introduced
in New Zealand in 1990, has been very successful in terms of stabilizing both inflation and the real
economy, and has, as of 2010, been adopted by about 25 industrialized and emerging-market economies.
The chapter discusses the history, macroeconomic effects, theory, practice, and future of inflation
targeting.

1. Introduction

Inflation targeting is a monetary-policy strategy that was introduced in New Zealand in 1990. It
has been very successful in stabilizing both inflation and the real economy. As of 2010 it has been
adopted by around 25 industrialized and non-industrialized countries. It is characterized by (1)
an announced numerical inflation target, (2) an implementation of monetary policy that gives a
major role to an inflation forecast and has been called forecast targeting, and (3) a high degree
of transparency and accountability (Svensson (2008)). Inflation targeting is highly associated with
an institutional framework that is characterized by the trinity of (1) a mandate for price stability,
(2) independence, and (3) accountability for the central bank, but there are examples of highly
successful inflation targeters, such as Norges Bank, that lack formal independence (although their
de facto independence may still be substantial).


1.1. An announced numerical inflation target

The numerical inflation target is for advanced countries typically around 2 percent at an annual
rate for the Consumer Price Index (CPI) or core CPI, in the form of a range, such as 1-3 percent in
New Zealand; or a point target with a range, such as a 2 percent point target with a range/tolerance
interval of ±1 percentage points in Canada; or a point target without any explicit range, such as
2 percent in Sweden and the U.K. and 2.5 percent in Norway. The diﬀerence between these forms
does not seem to matter in practice. A central bank with a target range seems to aim for the middle
of the range. The edges of the range are normally interpreted as “soft edges,” in the sense that
they do not trigger discrete policy changes and inflation just outside the range is not considered
much diﬀerent from just inside. Numerical inflation targets for emerging markets and developing
countries are typically a few percentage points higher than 2 percent.
    In practice, inflation targeting is never “strict” but always “flexible,” in the sense that all
inflation-targeting central banks (“central bank” is used here as the generic name for monetary
authority) not only aim at stabilizing inflation around the inflation target but also put some weight
on stabilizing the real economy, for instance, implicitly or explicitly stabilizing a measure of resource
utilization such as the output gap; that is, the gap between actual and potential output. Thus, the
“target variables” of the central bank include not only inflation but other variables as well, such
as the output gap.1 The objectives under flexible inflation targeting seem well approximated by a
   1
     The term “inflation nutter” for a central bank that is only concerned about stabilizing inflation was introduced in
a paper by Mervyn King at a conference in Gerzensee, Switzerland, in 1995 and later published as King (1997). The


                                                           1
standard quadratic loss function consisting of the sum of the squared inflation gap to the target
and a weight times the squared output gap, and possibly also a weight times squared policy-rate
changes (the last part corresponding to a preference for interest-rate smoothing).2 However, for
new inflation-targeting regimes, where the establishment of “credibility” is a priority, stabilizing
the real economy probably has less weight than when credibility has been established (more on
credibility below). Over time, when inflation targeting matures, it displays more flexibility in the
sense of putting relatively more weight on stabilizing resource utilization. Inflation-targeting central
banks have also become increasingly transparent about being flexible inflation targeters. Section
4.1 discusses some such developments of inflation targeting.


1.2. Forecast targeting

Because there is a lag between monetary-policy actions (such as a policy-rate change) and its
impact on the central bank’s target variables, monetary policy is more eﬀective if it is guided by
forecasts. The implementation of inflation targeting therefore gives a main role to forecasts of
inflation and other target variables. It can be described as forecast targeting, that is, setting the
policy rate (more precisely, deciding on a policy-rate path) such that the forecasts of the target
variables conditional on that policy-rate path “look good”, where “look good” means that the
forecast for inflation stabilizes inflation around the inflation target and the forecast for resource
utilization stabilizes resource utilization around a normal level.3


1.3. A high degree of transparency and accountability

Inflation targeting is characterized by a high degree of transparency. Typically, an inflation-
targeting central bank publishes a regular monetary-policy report which includes the bank’s forecast
of inflation and other variables, a summary of its analysis behind the forecasts, and the motivation
for its policy decisions. Some inflation-targeting central banks also provide some information on,
or even forecasts of, its likely future policy decisions.
    This high degree of transparency is exceptional in view of the history of central banking. Tra-
ditionally, central-bank objectives, deliberations, and even policy decisions have been subject to
terms “strict” and “flexible” inflation targeting were to my knowledge first introduced in a paper of mine presented
at a conference at the bank of Portugal in 1996, later published as Svensson (1999b).
    2
      The policy rate (instrument rate) is the short nominal interest rate that the central bank sets to implement
monetary policy.
    3
      The idea that inflation targeting implies that the inflation forecast can be seen as an intermediate target was
introduced in King (1994). The term “inflation-forecast targeting” was introduced in Svensson (1997), and the term
“forecast targeting” in Svensson (2005). See Woodford (2007) and Woodford (2010a) for more discussion and analysis
of forecast targeting.


                                                         2
considerable secrecy. It is diﬃcult to find any reasons for that secrecy beyond central bankers’ de-
sire not to be subject to public scrutiny (including scrutiny and possible pressure from governments
or legislative bodies). The current emphasis on transparency is based on the insight that monetary
policy to a very large extent is the “management of expectations.” Monetary policy has an impact
on the economy mostly through the private-sector expectations that current monetary-policy ac-
tions and announcements give rise to. The level of the policy rate for the next few weeks matter
very little to most economic agents. What matters is the expectations of future policy rates, which
expectations aﬀect longer interest rates that do matter for economic decisions and activity.
   Furthermore, private-sector expectations of inflation aﬀect current pricing decisions and infla-
tion for the next few quarters. Therefore, the anchoring of private-sector inflation expectations
on the inflation target is a crucial precondition for the stability of actual inflation. The proximity
of private-sector inflation expectations to the inflation target is often referred to as the “credibil-
ity” of the inflation-targeting regime. Inflation-targeting central banks sometimes appear to be
obsessed by such credibility, but this obsession is for good reason. If a central bank succeeds in
achieving credibility, a good part of the battle to control inflation is already won. A high degree of
transparency and high-quality, convincing monetary-policy reports are often considered essential to
establishing and maintaining credibility. Furthermore, a high degree of credibility gives the central
bank more freedom to be “flexible” and also stabilize the real economy (see Svensson (2002) for
more discussion).
   Whereas many central banks in the past seem to have actively avoided accountability, for in-
stance by not having explicit objectives and by being very secretive, inflation targeting is normally
associated with a high degree of accountability. A high degree of accountability is now considered
generic to inflation targeting and an important component in strengthening the incentives faced by
inflation-targeting central banks to achieve their objectives. The explicit objectives and the trans-
parency of monetary-policy reporting contribute to increased public scrutiny of monetary policy.
In several countries inflation-targeting central banks are subject to more explicit accountability.
In New Zealand, the Governor of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand is subject to a Policy Target
Agreement, an explicit agreement between the Governor and the government on the Governor’s
responsibilities. In the U.K., the Chancellor of the Exchequer’s remit to the Bank of England
instructs the Bank to write a public letter explaining any deviation from the target larger than
one percentage point and what actions the Bank is taking in response to the deviation. In several
countries, central-bank oﬃcials are subject to public hearings in the Parliament where monetary


                                                  3
policy is scrutinized; and in several countries, monetary policy is regularly or occasionally subject
to extensive reviews by independent experts (for instance, New Zealand, the U.K., Norway, and
Sweden).4


1.4. Outline

This chapter is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly discusses the short history of inflation
targeting and the macroeconomic eﬀects of inflation targeting so far. Section 3 presents a theory of
inflation targeting and “forecast targeting” more generally, where projections of the target variables
(inflation and resource utilization) take center stage and where the policy problem is to choose a
policy-rate path rather than a policy function so as to minimize a forecast. The section also
discusses the role of uncertainty about the state of the economy and the model of the transmission
mechanism, and the role and use of judgment in monetary policy. Section 4 discusses the practice
of inflation targeting, more precisely the developments of practical inflation targeting since its
inception in 1990 in New Zealand, the special issue of the publication of policy-rate paths, and
the examples of Sveriges Riksbank (the central bank of Sweden), which is ranked as one of the
world’s most transparent central banks, and Norges Bank (the central bank of Norway), which is
a late-comer to the inflation-targeting camp but is a pioneer in applying explicit optimal policy as
an input in the policy decision. These two examples are also chosen because I know more about
them than about other inflation targeters. The section also reports on the debate and research
on possible preconditions for emerging-market economies to join the inflation-targeting camp. The
final section, section 5, discusses two potential future issues for inflation targeting, whether it would
be advantageous to move on to price-level targeting and whether inflation targeting needs to be
modified in the light of the recent financial crisis and deep recession.


2. History and macroeconomic eﬀects

So far, since its inception in the early 1990s in New Zealand, Canada, the U.K., and Sweden,
inflation targeting has been a considerable success, as measured by the stability of inflation and the
stability of the real economy. There is no evidence that inflation targeting has been detrimental
to growth, productivity, employment, or other measures of economic performance. The success is
    4
      Reviews of monetary policy or aspects thereof include, for New Zealand, Svensson (2001), for the U.K., Kohn
(2008), for Norway, the annual Norges Bank Watch, for instance, Svensson, Houg, Solheim, and Steigum (2002),
and for Sweden, Giavazzi and Mishkin (2006). Svensson (2010a) provides a general discussion of the evaluation of
inflation targeting, including the possibility of continuous real-time evaluation.



                                                       4
both absolute and relative to alternative monetary-policy strategies, such as exchange-rate targeting
or money-growth targeting. No country has so far abandoned inflation targeting after adopting it
(except to join the euro area), or even expressed any regrets.5 For both industrial and non-industrial
countries, inflation targeting has proved to be a most flexible and resilient monetary-policy regime
and has succeeded in surviving a number of large shocks and disturbances, including the recent
financial crisis and deep recession.6 7
    Although inflation targeting has been a success in stabilizing both inflation and the real economy
in the small- and medium-sized industrial countries that have introduced it, the United States, the
euro area, and Japan have not yet adopted all the explicit characteristics of inflation-targeting, but
they all seem to be taking steps in that direction. Reservations against inflation targeting have
mainly suggested that it might give too much weight to inflation stabilization to the detriment of
the stability of the real economy or other possible monetary-policy objectives. The fact that real-
world inflation targeting is flexible rather than strict and the empirical success of inflation targeting
in the countries where it has been implemented seem to confound those reservations (Roger and
Stone (2005)).
    A possible alternative to inflation targeting is money-growth targeting; that is, the central
bank has an explicit target for the growth of the money supply. Money-growth targeting has been
tried in several countries but been abandoned, since practical experience has consistently shown
that the relation between money growth and inflation is too unstable and unreliable for money-
growth targeting to provide successful inflation stabilization. Although Germany’s Bundesbank
oﬃcially conducted money-growth targeting for many years, it often deliberately missed its money-
growth target in order to achieve its inflation target, and is therefore arguably better described
   5
      However, there has certainly been some criticism of aspects of inflation targeting in some countries and over
time considerable developments, some in response to criticism, within the practice of inflation targeting (see section
4.1).
   6
      As summarized by Rose (2007): “A stable international monetary system has emerged since the early 1990s.
A large number of industrial and a growing number of developing countries now have domestic inflation targets
administered by independent and transparent central banks. These countries place few restrictions on capital mobility
and allow their exchange rates to float. The domestic focus of monetary policy in these countries does not have any
obvious international cost. Inflation targeters have lower exchange rate volatility and less frequent ‘sudden stops’ of
capital flows than similar countries that do not target inflation. Inflation targeting countries also do not have current
accounts or international reserves that look diﬀerent from other countries. This system was not planned and does not
rely on international coordination. There is no role for a center country, the IMF, or gold. It is durable; in contrast
to other monetary regimes, no country has been forced to abandon an inflation-targeting regime. Succinctly, it is the
diametric opposite of the post-war system; Bretton Woods, reversed.”
   7
      A study from the IMF, Carvalho Filho (2010), gives a preliminary appraisal of how countries with inflation
targeting have fared during the current crisis. It finds that, since August 2008, IT countries lowered nominal policy
rates by more and this loosening translated into an even larger diﬀerential in real interest rates relative to other
countries. IT countries were less likely to face deflation scares and saw sharp real depreciations not associated
with a greater perception of risk by markets. There is also some weak evidence that IT countries did better on
unemployment rates and that advanced IT countries had relatively stronger industrial production performance and
higher GDP growth rates than their non-IT peers.

as an implicit inflation targeter (see Svensson (1999c, 2009d) for more discussions and references).
Many small and medium-sized countries have tried exchange-rate targeting in the form of a fixed
exchange rate, that is, fixing the exchange rate relative to a center country with an independent
monetary policy. For several reasons, including increased international capital flows and diﬃculties
in defending misaligned fixed exchange rates against speculative attacks, fixed exchange rates have
become less viable and less successful in stabilizing inflation. This has led many countries to instead
pursue inflation targeting with flexible exchange rates.


2.1. History

New Zealand was the first country to introduce an explicit inflation target. Like most OECD
countries, New Zealand had experienced high and variable inflation in the 1970s and the first part
of the 1980s. Monetary policy was tightened and inflation fell in the latter part of 1980s. The
Reserve Bank Act of 1989 established the policy framework that is now call inflation targeting.
The key aspects of the framework were (1) an inflation target for monetary policy, (2) central
bank independence, (3) accountability of the central bank (through making the target public and
holding the Governor of the Reserve Bank responsible for achieving it). The framework chosen
was part of a more far-reaching reform of the central government administration in New Zealand.
As noted above, an institutional framework of the trinity of (1) a mandate for price stability,
(2) independence, and (3) accountability is highly associated with inflation targeting, although
there are examples of highly successful inflation targeters, such as Norges Bank, that lack formal
independence.
       As noted by Goodhart (2010), “one of the most interesting facets of the 1989 RBNZ Act is
that one of the main motives for it did not come from monetary policy or monetary analysis at
all. Instead, intense dissatisfaction had developed with the intervention, meddling, and direct
(micro) management with all aspects of the economy by the previous (National) government, led
by Sir Robert Muldoon.” Thus, a significant purpose of the Act was to make the Reserve Bank
“Muldoon-proof.” Although the formulation of the Reserve Bank Act received strong support from
Charles Goodhart, the path-breaking Act was the result of the eﬀorts of far-sighted policymakers
and civil servants of the Reserve Bank and Treasury in New Zealand rather than academic research
on suitable monetary-policy frameworks.8 Furthermore, as emphasized by Nelson (2005), until
   8
     Singleton, Hawke, and Grimes (2006) provides an authorative history of the origin of the Reserve Bank Act and
the development of the Reserve Bank and monetary policy in New Zealand 1973-2002. Goodhart (2010) discusses
the political economy of creation of the Act.


                                                        6
the mid-1980s, many politicians, and policy circles generally, in New Zealand subscribed to a
nonmonetary view of inflation. Behind the introduction of the Reserve Bank Act was also a
fundamental change in policymaking doctrine from a nonmonetary to a monetary approach to
inflation analysis and control.
   Inflation targeting spread quickly to other advanced economies, see table 2.1. Canada adopted
inflation targeting in 1991. The U.K. and Sweden adopted inflation targeting in 1992 and 1993
after currency crises and the collapse of their fixed exchange-rate regimes. Finland and Australia
also adopted inflation targeting in 1993. By 2010, about 10 industrialized and 15 emerging-market
and developing countries had adopted explicit inflation targeting.9

   While the new inflation targeters during the 1990s were mostly advanced economies, an increas-
ing number of developing and emerging-market economies have adopted inflation targeting since
1997. By 2010, the majority of inflation targeters were emerging-market and developing countries.
Among these countries, the shift toward inflation targeting has been a gradual process. In South
America, movement toward inflation targeting began in the early 1990s, but full-fledged inflation
targeting was adopted only in the late 1990s and early 2000s, following the 1998 financial crisis.
In Europe, the transition economies of Central and Eastern Europe began introducing inflation
targeting in the late 1990s as part of their comprehensive economic reforms, while in East Asia,
   9
     Pétursson (2004b) and Freedman and Ötker-Robe (2009) provide an overview of the countries’ back-
ground/motivation for adopting inflation targeting. See also Freedman and Laxton (2009).


                                                 7
inflation targeting began to be adopted in the early 2000s as countries emerged from monetary tar-
geting under International Monetary Fund-supported programs following the 1997 Asian financial
crisis. Inflation targeting will probably continue to spread among emerging-market economies and
developing economies.
       As mentioned above, the U.S., the euro area, and Japan have not yet adopted all the explicit
characteristics of inflation targeting, but they have all taken steps in that direction, and the practical
remaining diﬀerences to explicit inflation targeting are arguably small. As noted by Walsh (2009a),
“... even if no additional central banks adopt inflation targeting, or if some current inflation
targeters abandon it, inflation targeting will have had a lasting impact on the way central banks
operate. Even among central banks that do not consider themselves inflation targeters, many of
the policy innovations associated with inflation targeting are now common. Most prominently,
transparency has spread from inflation targeters to non-inflation targeters.”


2.2. Macroeconomic eﬀects

Early empirical work on the macroeconomic eﬀects of inflation targeting provided some support
for the view that inflation targeting improves macroeconomic performance (for instance, Bernanke,
Laubach, Mishkin, and Posen (1999), Corbo, Landerretche, and Schmidt-Hebbel (2001), Neumann
and von Hagen (2002), and Truman (2003)), but these studies suﬀer from having a relatively small
number of observations. In the following I briefly summarize some more recent studies.


2.2.1. Inflation

Figures 2.1 and 2.2 plot average inflation for inflation targeting and non-inflation-targeting OECD
countries and for a group of emerging-market economies, respectively.10 Evidently, all groups of
countries have enjoyed lower and more stable inflation. However, there seems to be a diﬀerence
between the inflation targeters and the non-inflation targeters in the two groups. For the OECD
countries, the development is more or less the same for inflation targeters and non-inflation tar-
geters. For the emerging-market economies, inflation in the group of inflation targeters has come
down from a higher level than in the non-inflation targeting countries.
  10
     In figure 2.1, all countries with hyper-inflation periods are excluded. Inflation targeters: Australia, Canada,
Czech Republic, Hungary, South Korea, New Zealand, Norway, Slovak Republic, Sweden, and the United Kingdom.
Non-inflation targeters: Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Ireland, Japan, Lux-
embourg, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland, and the United States. (The OECD countries excluded are thus
Iceland, Mexico, Poland, and Turkey.)
  In figure 2.2, the inflation targeters include: Chile, Columbia, Indonesia, Israel, South Africa, Mexico, Philippines,
and Thailand. The non-inflation targeters in 2.2 include: China, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Egypt,
El Salvador, India, Malaysia, Morocco, Nigeria, Pakistan, Panama, Tunisia, Singapore, and Taiwan.

    Formal empirical analysis reaﬃrms the visual impression from the figures. Ball and Sheridan
(2005), Lin and Ye (2007), and Angeriz and Arestis (2008) consider subgroups of the OECD-
countries and find that the eﬀects of inflation targeting on average inflation and inflation variability
is insignificant. Mishkin and Schmidt-Hebbel (2007) find the same for the OECD countries in their
sample.11 Batini and Laxton (2007), Gonçalves and Salles (2008), and Lin and Ye (2009) consider
groups of emerging-market economies and find significant eﬀect of inflation targeting on average
inflation and typically also on inflation variability.12
    As pointed out by Gertler (2005) in the discussion of Ball and Sheridan (2005), many of the
non-inflation targeters in OECD sample (if not just about all) have adopted monetary policies that
are very similar in practice to formal inflation targeting. This lack of sharpness in the classification
scheme make the results for the OECD-countries hard to interpret. In fact, it may suggest the
opposite conclusion, namely that inflation targeting has indeed been quite eﬀective for the OECD
countries. Empirical studies using samples including both OECD and developing/emerging-market
economies typically find beneficial eﬀects of inflation targeting on average inflation and inflation
volatility (for instance, Hyvonen (2004), Pétursson (2004a), Vega and Winkelried (2005), Mishkin
and Schmidt-Hebbel (2007), and Pétursson (2009)).
  11
      Fang, Miller, and Lee (2009) consider OECD countries and include lagged eﬀects of inflation targeting. They
report significant evidence that inflation targeting does lower inflation rates for the targeting countries in the short
run. The eﬀects occur after the year of adopting inflation targeting and decay gradually.
  12
      Surprisingly, Gonçalves and Salles (2008) does not find a significant eﬀect of inflation targeting on the volatility
of inflation.

2.2.2. Inflation expectations

There is relatively robust empirical evidence that an explicit numerical target for inflation an-
chors and stabilizes inflation expectations (Johnson (2002), Levin, Natalucci, and Piger (2004),
Gürkaynak, Levin, and Swanson (2006), Batini and Laxton (2007), Gürkaynak, Levin, Marder,
and Swanson (2007), and Ravenna (2008)). In particular, Gürkaynak, Levin, and Swanson (2006)
compare the behavior of daily bond yield data in the U.K. and Sweden (both inflation targeters) to
that in the U.S. (a non-inflation targeter). They use the diﬀerence between far-ahead forward rates
on nominal and inflation-indexed bonds as a measure of compensation for expected inflation and
inflation risk at long horizons. For the U.S., they find that forward inflation compensation exhibits
highly significant responses to economic news. For the U.K., they find a level of sensitivity similar to
that in the U.S. prior to the Bank of England gaining independence in 1997, but a striking absence
of such sensitivity since the central bank became independent. For Sweden, they find that forward
inflation compensation has been insensitive to economic news over the whole period for which they
have data. These findings support the view that a well-known and credible inflation target helps
to anchor the private sector’s long-run inflation expectations. Recently, International Monetary
Fund (2008) considered which monetary-policy frameworks had been most successful in anchoring
inflation expectations in the wake of the oil and food price shocks in 2007, and found that “in
emerging economies, inflation targeting seems to have recently been more eﬀective than alternative



                                                  10
monetary-policy frameworks in anchoring expectations.” Table 2.2 reports the percentage-point
response of expected headline inflation 1, 3, 5 and 6—10 years ahead to a 1 percentage-point change
in actual inflation for emerging-market economies. In inflation-targeting emerging economies, the
response of expected headline inflation 1, 3, and 5 years ahead is zero, whereas it is positive for
non-inflation targeters.

market economies.

2.2.3. Output

Skeptics of inflation targeting worry that the regime is too focused on inflation and that attempts
to control inflation will generate instability in the real economy and possibly also lower growth
(see, for instance, Friedman and Kuttner (1996), Friedman (2002), and Cecchetti and Ehrmann
(2002)). Figure 2.3 shows the average output growth and volatility before and after the adoption
of inflation targeting for inflation-targeting countries in OECD and for a group of emerging-market
economies.13 It also gives the output performance for the non-inflation targeting (NT) countries in
OECD and for the NT countries in the group of emerging-market economies. For the NT countries,
the threshold years are 1998 for the OECD countries and 2001 for the emerging-markets economies.
The panels give no basis for the pessimistic claim that inflation targeting adversely aﬀects growth
or average growth volatility.
       Formal empirical analysis confirms the impression from the figure. Ball and Sheridan (2005)
find no significant eﬀect of inflation targeting on average output growth or output volatility in
their sample of 20 OECD countries.14 However, as for the results on inflation discussed above,
the lack of sharpness in the classification scheme for the OECD-countries makes the results hard
to interpret. Goncalves and Carvalho (2009) show that among 30 OECD countries the inflation-
  13
    The group of countries are the same as in figures 2.1 and 2.2 (see footnote 10).
  14
    Fang, Miller, and Lee (2009) find that the inflation targeters in their sample of OECD countries achieve lower
output growth and higher output-growth variability in the short run while this eﬀect disappears in the longer run.

targeting countries suﬀer smaller output losses in terms of sacrifice ratios during disinflationary
periods than non-targeting counterparts. According to their estimates a targeter saves around 7
percent in output losses relative to a non-targeter for each percentage point of inflation decline.
Batini and Laxton (2007) and Gonçalves and Salles (2008) consider emerging-market economies
and find that inflation targeting reduce the volatility in output growth/the output gap. There is
no significant eﬀect of inflation targeting on growth.


2.2.4. Summary of eﬀects of inflation targeting

While macroeconomic experiences among both inflation targeting and non-inflation targeting de-
veloped economies have been similar, inflation targeting has improved macroeconomic performance
among developing economies. Importantly, there is no evidence that inflation targeting has been
detrimental to growth, productivity, employment, or other measures of economic performance in
either developed and developing economies. Inflation targeting has stabilized long-run inflation


                                                      12
expectations. No country has so far abandoned inflation targeting after adopting it (except to join
the euro area), or even expressed any regrets. For both industrial and non-industrial countries,
inflation targeting has proved to be a most flexible and resilient monetary-policy regime, and has
succeeded in surviving a number of large shocks and disturbances, including the recent financial
crisis and deep recession.15 The success is both absolute and relative to alternative monetary-policy
strategies, such as exchange-rate targeting or money-growth targeting.


3. Theory

As mentioned above, in practice, inflation targeting is never “strict” but always “flexible”, in the
sense that all inflation-targeting central banks not only aim at stabilizing inflation around the
inflation target but also put some weight on stabilizing the real economy, for instance, implicitly or
explicitly stabilizing a measure of resource utilization such as the output gap between actual output
and potential output. Thus, the target variables of the central bank include not only inflation but
other variables as well, such as the output gap. The objectives under flexible inflation targeting
seem well approximated by a quadratic loss function consisting of the sum of the squared inflation
deviation from target and a weight times the squared output gap, and possibly also a weight
times the squared policy-rate change (the last part corresponding to a preference for interest-rate
smoothing).
      Because there is a lag between monetary-policy actions (such as a policy-rate change) and its
impact on the central bank’s target variables, monetary policy is more eﬀective if it is guided by
forecasts. The implementation of inflation targeting therefore gives a main role to forecasts of
inflation and other target variables. It can be described as forecast targeting, that is, setting the
policy rate (more precisely, deciding on a policy-rate path) such that the forecasts of the target
variables conditional on that policy-rate path stabilize both inflation around the inflation target
and resource utilization around a normal level.
      Because of the clear objective, the high degree of transparency and accountability, and a sys-
tematic and elaborate decision process using the most advanced theoretical and empirical methods
as well as a sizeable amount of judgment, inflation targeting provides stronger possibilities and
incentives to achieve optimal monetary policy than previous monetary-policy regimes. Therefore,
a theory of inflation targeting is to a large extent a theory of optimal policy, with the objective
function given by the objective function of flexible inflation targeting.
 15
      See footnote 7.


                                                  13
      However, there are a few aspects that make inflation targeting diﬀer from standard textbook
treatments of optimal policy that I would like to take into account. Textbook optimal policy
consists of setting up an optimization problem, where the objective function is maximized subject
to the model of the economy once and for all, which results in an optimal policy function that
expresses the policy rate(s) as a function of the state of the economy. The implementation of the
optimal policy then consists of mechanically setting the policy rate according to the optimal policy
function, assuming that the private sector understands and believes that policy is set that way and
can use that and other information to form rational expectations.
      This textbook approach to optimal policy does not rely on forecasts. However, in inflation
targeting, forecasts take a central place. Indeed, flexible inflation targeting can be said to consist
of choosing at each policy decision not only a policy rate but a whole (explicitly or implicit,
announced or not) policy-rate path such that the forecast of inflation conditional on that policy-rate
path stabilizes inflation around the inflation target and the forecast of the real economy stabilizes
resource utilization around a normal level. Thus, forecasts are essential tools in the policy process,
and policy is not about picking a policy function once and for all and then following it but about
picking a policy-rate path at each policy decision.
      Thus, the theory I will try to develop in this section will emphasize the use of forecasts and
that the object of choice is, counter to most theory of optimal policy, not a policy function but
a policy-rate path. First, I will start from the standard treatment of optimal monetary policy in
a linear-quadratic setting. Then I will emphasize the role of forecasts, reformulate the optimal
policy problem in terms of choice between alternative feasible projections. I will show how the
optimal policy projection and the set of feasible forecasts can be illustrated with the help of a
modified Taylor curve, a forecast Taylor curve, which is closely related to the original Taylor
curve in Taylor (1979) that illustrates the tradeoﬀ between stabilizing inflation and stabilizing the
output gap. Then I will briefly discuss so-called targeting rules and take up some issues about
implementation and determinacy of the equilibrium. Although most of the discussion is under the
assumption of commitment in a timeless equilibrium (Woodford 2003, 2010b), I will also briefly
discuss optimization under discretion and degrees of commitment. Finally, I will discuss issues of
uncertainty and the application of judgment in monetary policy.
      I am not implying that the policy of all inflation-targeting central banks are well described
by this theory.16 The theory is by nature an idealization, in a similar way in which standard

      Although most inflation-targeting policymakers would probably agree that inflation targeting is about choosing

consumption theory is an idealization of actual consumer behavior. The theory is a theory of ma-
ture inflation targeting, a theory of my view of what is potential best-practice inflation targeting,
although not quite yet actual best-practice inflation targeting. But I believe actual inflation tar-
geting, with one innovation and improvement after another, is moving in this direction, and that
some inflation-targeting central bank are pretty close. In section 4, I will discuss the developments
of practical inflation targeting and give some indication that inflation targeting in Norway and
Sweden, for instance, may not be far from this theory.
    Since there may still be some misunderstandings of what real-world inflation targeting is, let me
also emphasize and repeat two things that inflation targeting is not.17 First, real-world inflation
targeting is not strict inflation targeting, that is, it does not have a loss function such as  =
(  −  ∗ )2 , where   denotes inflation in period  and  ∗ is the inflation target. That is, inflation
targeting is not only about stabilizing inflation around the inflation target. Inflation targeting is in
practice always flexible inflation targeting, in the sense that there is also weight on stabilizing the
real economy. Second, real-world inflation targeting is not that the policy rate responds only to
current inflation, with an instrument rule such as  = (  −  ∗ ) or  − −1 = (  −  ∗ ), where
 is the policy rate in period  and  is a positive constant. Inflation targeting instead implies
that the policy rate responds to much more than current inflation, namely to all information that
aﬀects the forecast of inflation and the real economy. Thus, a theory of inflation targeting cannot
start from such a loss function or such an instrument rule.


3.1. A linear-quadratic model of optimal monetary policy

A linear model of an economy with forward-looking variables can be written in the following prac-
tical state-space form,18
                                ∙             ¸        ∙        ¸             ∙       ¸
                                     +1                                       
                                                  =                +  +               +1                   (3.1)
                                    +1|                                     0

Here,  is an  -vector of predetermined variables in period  (where the period is typically a
quarter);  is an  -vector of forward-looking variables;  is generally an  -vector of (policy)
a policy-rate path so that the resulting forecast of inflation and the real economy “looks good,” they may not agree
on the precise criteria for what “looks good” means, for instance, that this can assessed with an explicit quadratic
loss function.
  17
      Some misunderstandings were aired at the ECB conference “Key Developments in Monetary Economics” where
a preliminary version of this chapter was presented.
  18
      The linear model can be derived as the standard loglinearization of a nonlinear DSGE model. For monetary
policy, the changes in variables are usually no more than a few percent, so the assumptions underlying the linearization
are likely to be fulfilled. Adolfson, Laséen, Lindé, and Svensson (2009) shows in detail how the Riksbank’s operational
DSGE model, Ramses, can be written in this form.



                                                            15
instruments but in most cases there is only one policy instrument, the policy rate, so  = 1;
 is an  -vector of i.i.d. shocks with mean zero and covariance matrix  ; , , and , and
 are matrices of the appropriate dimension; and, for the stochastic process of any variable  ,
+ | denotes E + , the rational expectation of the realization of + in period  +  conditional
on information available in period . The forward-looking variables and the instruments are the
nonpredetermined variables.19
       The variables can be measured as diﬀerences from steady-state values, in which case their
unconditional means are zero. Alternatively, one of the components of  can be unity, so as to
allow the variables to have nonzero means. The elements of the matrices , , , and  are in
practice often estimated with Bayesian methods and their point estimates are then assumed fixed
and known for the policy simulations. Then the conditions for certainty equivalence are satisfied.
       The upper block of (3.1) provides  equations determining the  -vector +1 in period  + 1
for given  ,  ,  , and +1 

                                      +1 = 11  + 12  + 1  + +1                                   (3.2)

where  and  are partitioned conformably with  and  as
                                 ∙          ¸           ∙    ¸
                                   11 12                1
                            ≡                    =                                                          (3.3)
                                   21 22                2

The lower block provides  equations determining  in period  for given +1| ,  , and  

                                        = −1

We hence assume that the  ×  submatrix 22 is nonsingular. In particular, the matrix  need
not be singular.20 21
  19
      A variable is predetermined if its one-period-ahead prediction error is an exogenous stochastic process (Klein
(2000)). Hence, the non-predetermined variables have one-period-ahead prediction errors that are endogenous. For
(3.1), the one-period-ahead prediction error of the predetermined variables is the stochastic vector +1 .
  20
     Without loss of generality, we assume that the shocks  only enter in the upper block of (3.1), since any shocks
in the lower block of (3.1) can be redefined as additional predetermined variables and introduced in the upper block.
  21
     In a backward-looking model, a model such as the one of Rudebusch and Svensson (1999), there are no forward-
looking variables. That is, there is no vector  of forward-looking variables, no lower block of equations in (3.1),
and the vector of target variables  only depends on the vector of predetermined variables  and the (vector of)
instrument(s)  .

       As an example, we can take a standard New Keynesian model,

                                 −  ∗ = ( +1| −  ∗ ) + ( − ̄ ) +                                (3.5)

                                  ̄+1 =  ̄ + +1                                                      (3.8)
                                             − 1
                                  ̄+1 =          ( ̄ + +1 )                                          (3.9)
                                              

Equation (3.5) is the Phillips curve (aggregate-supply relation), where   denotes inflation,  ∗ is
the inflation target,  is a discount factor,  denotes output, ̄ denotes potential output,  − ̄
is the output gap, and  is a so-called cost-push shock.22 Equation (3.6) is the aggregate-demand
relation, where  denotes the policy rate and ̄ the neutral real rate. Equations (3.7)-(3.9) give
the dynamics of the cost-push shock, potential output, and the neutral rate. The neutral rate and
potential output satisfy
                                                        1
                                                ̄ =     (̄   − ̄ )
                                                         +1|
This equation is satisfied by (3.8) and (3.9). The vector of predetermined variables is  ≡
(  ̄  ̄ )0 , and the vector of forward-looking variables is  ≡ (    ). This example is special
in that all predetermined variables are exogenous variables and there are no endogenous predeter-
mined variables. It is straightforward to rewrite the equations (3.5)-(3.9) on the form (3.1) and
thereby identify the matrices , , , and .
       Let  be an  -vector of target variables, measured as the gap to an  -vector  ∗ of target
levels. This is not restrictive, as long as we keep the target levels time invariant. If we would like to
examine the consequences of diﬀerent target levels, we can instead let  refer to the absolute level
of the target variables and replace  by  −  ∗ everywhere below. We assume that the target
variables can be written as a linear function of the predetermined, forward-looking, and instrument
variables,                                  ⎡ ⎤               ⎡    ⎤

where  is an  × ( +  +  ) matrix and partitioned conformably with  ,  , and  .23
  22
     Calvo-style price setters that are not reoptimizing prices are assumed to index prices to the inflation target.
  23
     For plotting and other purposes, and to avoid unnecessary separate program code, it is often convenient to
expand the vector  to include a number of variables of interest that are not necessary target variables or potential
target variables. These will then have zero weight in the loss function.

future period losses,

and Λ is a symmetric positive semidefinite matrix containing the weights on the individual target
variables.
       As an example, under flexible inflation targeting with no interest-rate smoothing, the period
loss function can be written as the standard quadratic loss function,

                                        = (  −  ∗ )2 + ( − ̄ )2                                 (3.13)

where  ∗ denotes the inflation target, the output gap is used as a measure of resource utilization
around a normal level, and the relative weight on output-gap stabilization, , is positive under
flexible inflation targeting. The target variables are here the inflation gap,   −  ∗ , the gap between
inflation and the inflation target  ∗ , and the output gap,  − ̄ , the gap between output and
potential output, so the vector of target variables satisfies  ≡ (  −  ∗   − ̄ )0 . Then the matrix
Λ is a diagonal matrix with the diagonal (1 ).
       The optimization is here under the assumption that commitment in a timeless perspective is
possible. The case of optimization under discretion is discussed in section 3.8.24 The optimization
results in a set of first-order conditions which, combined with the model equations (3.1), results in a
system of diﬀerence equations (see Söderlind (1999) and Svensson (2009b)). The system of diﬀerence
equations can be solved with several alternative algorithms, for instance, those developed by Klein
(2000) and Sims (2002) (see Svensson (2005) and Svensson (2009b) for details of the derivation and
application of the Klein algorithm).25
       Under the assumption of optimization under commitment in a timeless perspective, the solution
  24
      See Woodford (2010b) for a detailed discussion of optimization under commitment, commitment in a timeless
perspective, and discretion.
   25
      The system of diﬀerence equations can also be solved with the so-called AIM algorithm of Anderson and Moore
(1983) and Anderson and Moore (1985) (see Anderson (2010) for a recent formulation). Whereas the Klein algorithm
is easy to apply directly to the system of diﬀerence equations, the AIM algorithm requires some rewriting of the
diﬀerence equations. Previously, the AIM algorithm have appeared to be significantly faster for large systems (see
Anderson (2000) for a comparison between AIM and other algorithms), but a new Matlab function, ordqz, makes the
Klein algorithm much faster. The appendix of Adolfson, Laséen, Lindé, and Svensson (2009) discusses the relation
between the Klein and AIM algorithms and shows how the system of diﬀerence equations can be rewritten to fit the
AIM algorithm.

The matrices  and  depend on , , , , Λ, and , but they are independent of . That
they are independent of  demonstrates certainty equivalence (the certainty equivalence that holds
when the model is linear, the loss function is quadratic, and the shocks and the uncertainty are
additive); only probability means of current and future variables are needed to determine optimal
policy (and the optimal projections to be discussed in section 3.3). The  -vector Ξ−1 consists of
the Lagrange multipliers of the lower block of (3.20), the block determining the projection of the
forward-looking variables.26

partitioned conformably with  and  . If  ≡ 0, the instrument rule is an explicit instrument
rule; if  6= 0, the instrument rule is an implicit instrument rule. In the latter case, the instrument
rule is actually an equilibrium condition, in the sense that the policy rate in period  and the
forward-looking variables in period  are then simultaneously determined.27
       If the instrument rule is combined with (3.1), the resulting system of diﬀerence equations can
be solved for a solution (3.14)-(3.16), except that there is no vector of Lagrange multipliers Ξ . In
that case the matrices  and  depend on , ,  and  , but not on .

     See Svensson (2003b) and Svensson and Woodford (2005) for more discussion of explicit and implicit instrument
rules.

   The model (3.1) can also be solved for a given targeting rule, a linear combination of leads and
lags of the target variables projection (Giannoni and Woodford (2003), Svensson and Woodford
(2005)),
                                                

                                                =− 

where  denotes the largest lag,  denotes the largest lead in the targeting rule, and  for  =
−  − +1   are  × matrices (we need as many rows in (3.19) as the number of instruments).
As shown by Giannoni and Woodford (2003) and Giannoni and Woodford (2010), the first-order
conditions for an optimum can be written in the form (3.19) after elimination of the Lagrange
multipliers. Targeting rules are further discussed in section 3.6.
   How could optimal policy or policy with a given instrument rule be implemented? The standard
theory of optimal monetary policy is not very explicit on this point. One interpretation of the above
analysis would be that the central bank once and for all calculates the optimal instrument rule 
in (3.17), alternatively picks a given instrument rule  in (3.18), and then publishes the instrument
rule and makes a public commitment to use it to set its policy rate forever. The private sector then
believes in the commitment to the instrument rule, combines it with the model in (3.1), calculates
the corresponding rational-expectations equilibrium, and makes its decisions accordingly. The
resulting equilibrium is then the equilibrium described by the equations (3.14)-(3.16) (for the given
instrument rule (3.18), without the Lagrange multipliers).
   However, this is not the way monetary policy is implemented by any real-word central bank. No
central bank announces a specific instrument rule and commits to follow it forever. For one thing,
the optimal instrument rule would depend on a long list of predetermined variables (not to speak
of the Lagrange multipliers), and the optimal instrument rule would be much too complicated to
be communicated. Any simple given instrument rule, such as a Taylor rule, would be too simple
and imperfect for the central bank to stick with it (see Svensson (2003b)).
   In the real world, an inflation-targeting central bank instead announces the current level of the
policy rate, gives some indication of future policy rates or even publishes a full policy-rate forecast,
and usually also publishes a forecast of inflation and the real economy. The private sector then
responds to this information, and the actual equilibrium results. This is the kind of monetary
policy and its implementation that I try to model next. In particular, forecasts and projections of
the policy rate, inflation, and the real economy take center stage.

3.2. The projection model and the feasible set of projections

Let  ≡ {+  }∞
                    =0 denote a projection (a conditional mean forecast) in period  for any vector of

variables  , where +  denotes the mean forecast of the realization of the vector in period  + 
conditional on information available in period . We refer to  as the horizon of the forecast +  .
The projection model for the projections (         ) in period  uses that the projection of the
zero-mean i.i.d. shocks is zero, +  = 0 for  ≥ 1. It can then be written as
                              ∙               ¸     ∙          ¸

for  ≥ 0, where
                                                      = |                                          (3.22)

where | is the estimate of predetermined variables in period  conditional on information available
in the beginning of period . The introduction of this notation here allows the realistic possibility
that the central bank has imperfect information about the current state of the economy and, for
instance, as in Svensson and Woodford (2005) estimates the current state of the economy with the
help of a Kalman filter, a case that is further discussed in section 3.9.1. Thus, “ ” and “|” in
subindices refer to projections (forecasting) and estimates (“nowcasting” and “backcasting”) in the
beginning of period , respectively. The feasible set of projections for given | , denoted T (| ),
is the set of projections (         ) that satisfy (3.20)-(3.22). We call T (| ) the set of feasible
projections in period . It is conditional on the estimates of the matrices , , , and  and the
estimate of the current realization of the predetermined variables | .


3.3. Optimal policy choice

The policy problem in period  is to determine the optimal projection in period . The optimal
projection is the projection (̂   ̂ ̂  ̂  ) that minimizes the intertemporal forecast loss function,
                                                         ∞
                                                         X
                                            L(  ) =             +                                (3.23)
                                                          =0

where the period forecast loss, +  , is specified as

                                            +  = +  0 Λ+                                    (3.24)


                                                          21
for  ≥ 0. The minimization is subject to the projection being in the feasible set of projections for
given | , T (| ).28
          For the standard quadratic loss function (3.13), the corresponding period forecast loss function
is
                                  +  = ( +  −  ∗ )2 + (+  − ̄+  )2                            (3.25)

where  +  and +  − ̄+  are the forecast in period  of inflation and the output gap, respec-
tively, in period  +  .
          When the policy problem is formulated in terms of projections, we can allow 0   ≤ 1, since
the above infinite sum in (3.23) will normally converge also for  = 1. Again, the optimization is
done under commitment in a timeless perspective (Woodford (2003), Woodford (2010b)).
          The intertemporal loss function (3.23) with the period forecast loss function (3.24) introduces
a preference ordering over projections of the target variables,   . We can express this preference
ordering as the modified intertemporal loss function,
                                                X    ∞

where the modification is the added term 1 Ξ0−1 ( − −1 ). In that term, Ξ−1 is as mentioned
the vector of Lagrange multipliers for the equations for the forward-looking variables from the
optimization problem in period −1,  is the projection of the vector of forward-looking variables
in period  that satisfies the projection model (3.20) and the initial condition (3.22), and −1 is
the optimal projection in period  − 1 of the vector of forward-looking variables in period  (−1 is
predetermined in period  and normalizes the added term and makes it zero in case the projection
 coincides with the projection −1 but does not aﬀect the choice of optimal policy). As
discussed in Svensson and Woodford (2005), the added term and the dependence on the Lagrange
multiplier Ξ−1 ensure that the minimization of (3.26), under either discretion or commitment,
results in the optimal policy under commitment in a timeless perspective.29
          The optimal policy choice, which results in the optimal policy projection, can now be formal-
ized as choosing   in the set of feasible projections in period  so as to minimize the modified

       This added term is closely related to the recursive saddlepoint method of Marcet and Marimon (1998), see
Svensson (2009b) and Woodford (2010b) for more discussion.

   The set of feasible projections T (| ) is obviously very large and contains infinitely many
diﬀerent policy projections. The presentation of the alternative policy projections generated by
alternative policy-rate paths (for instance, as described in Laséen and Svensson (2010)), can be
seen as an attempt to narrow down the set of infinite alternative feasible policy projections to a
finite number of alternatives for the policymaker to choose between.
   For a given linear projection model and a given modified quadratic intertemporal loss function,
it is possible to compute the optimal policy projection exactly. By varying the parameters of
the modified intertemporal loss function it is possible to generate alternative policy projections.
Generating alternative policy projections in that way has the advantage that the policy projections
are on the eﬃcient frontier, to be specified below. However, the policymaker may still prefer to see
a few representative alternative policy projections constructed with alternative policy-rate paths
that are not constructed as optimal policy projections. The methods to construct policy projections
for alternative anticipated policy-rate paths presented in Laséen and Svensson (2010) is one way
to do this.
   As discussed in Svensson and Woodford (2005) and Giannoni and Woodford (2003), commitment
in a timeless perspective can alternatively be implemented by imposing the constraint

instead of adding the extra term to the period loss function. Let T (|  Ξ−1 ) denote the subset of
the feasible set of projections that satisfy (3.28) for given | and Ξ−1 and call this the restricted
feasible set of projections. Then the optimal policy projection is also the solution to the problem

                      minimize L(  ) subject to (         ) ∈ T (|  Ξ−1 )        (3.29)


3.4. The forecast Taylor curve

The optimal policy projection, the restricted set of feasible projections, and the eﬃcient restricted
set of projections can be illustrated using a modified Taylor curve, a forecast Taylor curve. Whereas
the original Taylor curve involves unconditional variances (to be precise, standard deviations in
figure 1 of Taylor (1979)) of ex post outcomes, the forecast Taylor curve involves the discounted
sum of squared inflation-gap and output-gap forecasts ex ante (see Svensson (2010a) for applications

Let us call the discounted sums                   =0        ( +  −  ∗ )2 and                 =0         (+  − ̄+  )2 the sum of
squared inflation gaps and output gaps, respectively (keeping in mind that we actually mean
inflation-gap and output-gap forecasts). We can now illustrate the restricted set of feasible projec-
tions, T (|  Ξ−1 ), in the space of sum of squared inflation and output gaps. In figure 3.1, the
sum of squared inflation gaps is plotted along the horizontal axis and the sum of squared output
gaps is plotted along the vertical axis. The restricted set of feasible projections is the set on and
above the curve through the point P. The eﬃcient restricted set of feasible projections, the eﬃcient
frontier of the restricted set of feasible projections, is given by the boundary, the curve through the
point P.
   In the figure, we can also illustrate isoloss lines of the intertemporal forecast loss function as
negatively sloped lines with the slope 1. An isoloss line closer to the origin corresponds to a
lower loss. The optimal policy projection is given by the tangency point P between the eﬃcient
frontier and an isoloss line, the policy projection in the restricted set of feasible projections that
gives the lowest intertemporal loss.
   The eﬃcient frontier consists of the projections in the set of restricted feasible projections that
are eﬃcient, in the sense that there is no other projection in the restricted feasible set that has a


                                                                       24
lower sum of squared inflation gaps without having a higher sum of squared output gaps. Obviously,
the optimal policy projection is in the eﬃcient set.
   Section 4.3 and 4.4 show applications of these ideas in practical policy.


3.5. Optimal policy projections

Under the assumption of optimization under commitment in a timeless perspective, the optimal
policy projection can be described by the following diﬀerence equation,
                                  ∙          ¸ ∙         ¸∙             ¸

                                                =                                                (3.30)
                                    ̂+                 Ξ+ −1
                               ∙             ¸       ∙             ¸
                                 ̂+ +1               ̂+ 

                                   Ξ+               Ξ+ −1
                                                     ∙             ¸
                                                         ̂+ 
                                       ̂+  = ̃                                             (3.32)
                                                        Ξ+ −1

for  ≥ 0, where ̂ = | and Ξ−1 = Ξ−1 . The matrices  ,  , and ̃ are the same as above.
   Alternative optimal projections can be constructed by varying the weights in the matrix Λ
and the discount factor . The use of alternative optimal projections has the advantage that the
projections considered are eﬃcient in the sense of minimizing an intertemporal loss function. That
is, each projection is such that it is not possible to reduce the discounted sum of squared future
projected deviations of a target variable from its target level without increasing the discounted
sum of squared such future projected deviations of another target variable (this assumes that the
positive symmetric semidefinite matrix Λ is diagonal). In figure 3.1, the eﬃcient subset of the set of
feasible projections, the eﬃcient frontier of the set of feasible projections, is given by the negatively
sloped curve through the point P. There are obvious advantages to restricting policy choices to be
among eﬃcient alternatives. Projections constructed with an arbitrary instrument rule (or with
arbitrary deviations from an optimal instrument rule) are generally not eﬃcient in this sense. That
is, they correspond to points in the interior of the feasible set of projections, points north-east of
the curve through point P in figure 3.1.
   Projections can obviously also be constructed for a given instrument rule,
                                      ∙         ¸            ∙         ¸
                                        +                 + 
                          +  =              ≡ [  ]             
                                        +                 + 

The resulting projection will satisfy equations such as (3.30)-(3.32), although without any Lagrange
multipliers, where the matrices  and  depend on , ,  and  . For arbitrary instrument rules,
the projections will not be eﬃcient.

                                                   25
3.6. Targeting rules

As discussed in Svensson (2003b) and Svensson (2005), the monetary-policy decision process makes
the current instrument-rate decision a very complex policy function of the large amounts of data
and judgment that have entered into the process. I believe that it is not very helpful to summarize
this policy function as a simple instrument rule such as a Taylor rule. Furthermore, the resulting
complex policy function is a reduced form, which depends on the central-bank objectives, its view
of the transmission mechanism of monetary policy, and the judgment it has exercised. It is the
endogenous complex result of a complex process. In no way is this policy function structural, in the
sense of being invariant to the central bank’s view of the transmission mechanism and private-sector
behavior, or the amount of information and judgmental adjustments. Still, much current literature
treats monetary policy as characterized by a given instrument rule that is essentially structural
and invariant to changes in the model of the economy. Realizing that the policy function is a
reduced form is a first step in a sensible theory of monetary policy. But, fortunately, this complex
reduced-form policy function need not be made explicit. It is actually not needed in the modern
monetary-policy process.
       There is a convenient, more robust representation of monetary policy, namely in the form
of a targeting rule, as discussed in some detail in Svensson and Woodford (2005) and Svensson
(2003b) and earlier in more general terms in Svensson (1999a). An optimal targeting rule is a first-
order condition for optimal monetary policy. It corresponds to the standard eﬃciency condition
of equality between the marginal rates of substitution and the marginal rates of transformation
between the target variables, the former given by the monetary-policy loss function, the latter
given by the transmission mechanism of monetary policy. An optimal targeting rule is invariant to
everything else in the model, including additive judgment and the stochastic properties of additive
shocks. Thus, it is a compact and robust representation of monetary policy, much more robust than
the optimal policy function. A simple targeting rule can potentially be a practical representation
of robust monetary policy, a robust monetary policy that performs reasonably well under diﬀerent
circumstances. Giannoni and Woodford (2003) and Giannoni and Woodford (2010) provide general
derivations of optimal targeting rules/target criteria, and they are further discussed in Woodford
(2007), Woodford (2010a), and Woodford (2010b).30 31
  30
     Walsh (2004) shows a case of equivalence between targeting rules and robust control.
  31
     Previously, Bank of England and the Riksbank assumed a constant interest rate underlying its inflation forecasts,
with the implication that a constant-interest-rate inflation forecasts that overshoots (undershoots) the inflation target
at some horizon such as two years indicates that the policy rate needs to increased (decreased). This is a far-from-
optimal targeting rule that has now been abandoned, as discussed in section 4.2.


                                                           26
   In this framework, a given targeting rule would have the form
                                              
                                              X
                                                      ++  = 0
                                             =− 

for  ≥ 0. In the simplest New Keynesian model with the Phillips curve (3.5) and the loss function
(3.13), the optimal targeting rule has the projection form

                                      
                    +  −  ∗ +     [(+  − ̄+  ) − (+ −1 − ̄+ −1 )] = 0   (3.33)
                                      

for  ≥ 0 (Svensson and Woodford (2005)).
   Optimal targeting rules remain a practical way of representing optimal monetary policy in the
small models usually applied for academic monetary-policy analysis. However, for the larger and
higher-dimensional operational macromodels used by many central banks in constructing projec-
tions, the optimal targeting rule becomes more complex and arguably less practical as a represen-
tation of optimal monetary policy. Optimal policy projections, the projections corresponding to
optimal policy under commitment in a timeless perspective, can however easily be derived directly
with simple numerical methods, without reference to any optimal targeting rule. For practical opti-
mal monetary policy, policymakers actually need not know the optimal targeting rule. Even less do
they need to know any policy function. They only need to ponder the graphs of the projections of
the target variables that are generated in the policy process and choose the projections of the target
variables and the policy rate that look best relative to the central bank’s objectives, as illustrated
in section 4.3.


3.7. Implementation and equilibrium determination

The policy decision can be characterized by (̂  ̂  ), the optimal projection of the policy rate and
the target variables. The policy decision also determines the Lagrange multipliers Ξ to be used in
the loss function and policy decision in period  + 1.
   How can we model how the policy is implemented and how the (rational-expectations) equi-
librium is determined? The central bank announces (or somehow communicates) ̂ and ̂  (and
possibly more details of its optimal projection) and sets the current policy rate in line with the
policy-rate path,  = ̂ . Let us assume that the central-bank projections are credible and hence
believed by the private sector.
   In particular, assume that private-sector expectations of next period’s forward-looking variables
are equal to the central bank’s forecast and are rational and equal to E +1 . The forward-looking

                                                        27
variables  and the target variables  in period  are then determined by Eq. (3.4), given 
and E +1 , and (3.10), given  ,  , and  . The next period’s predetermined variables +1
are then determined next period by (3.2), given  ,  and next period’s shocks +1 . Then next
period’s policy decision then determines ̂+1 and ̂ +1 , given +1|+1 and Ξ+1 ≡ Ξ . This way
a rational-expectations equilibrium is implemented.
     Is the equilibrium determinate? As discussed in Svensson and Woodford (2005), this may require
an out-of-equilibrium commitment which may be explicit or implicit.32 That is, the central bank
commits to deviate from ̂ if the economy deviates from the optimal projection.33 For instance, if
realized inflation   exceeds the inflation projection ̂  , the central-bank may set a higher policy
rate according to
                                                 = ̂ + (  − ̂  )

where   0. In the example discussed in Svensson and Woodford (2005), the Taylor Principle of
  1 ensures determinacy. Another example of an out-of-equilibrium commitment in that example
is
                                                          
                              = ̂ + {  −  ∗ +     [( − ̄ ) − (−1 − ̄−1 )]}                       (3.34)
                                                          
where
                                                
                                    − ∗ +      [( − ̄ ) − (−1 − ̄−1 )] = 0
                                                
is the optimal targeting rule, the first-order condition for optimal policy, in the standard New
Keynesian model with the Phillips curve (3.5) and the loss function (3.13). Here, the out-of-
equilibrium commitment (3.34) implies that any positive deviation from the optimal targeting rule
(in the sense of too high inflation or too high output) would result in a higher policy rate. A
suﬃciently high value of , usually not very diﬀerent from unity, ensures determinacy.
     Importantly, in this setup the object of choice of the central bank and what is communicated
to the private sector is  , the policy-rate path, not the policy function,  (although there is a one-
to-one correspondence between the optimal policy-rate path and the optimal policy function).34
   32
      For instance, in the standard New Keynesian model, the predetermined variables are exogenous. If the central
bank implements policy by letting the policy rate respond to the predetermined variables only, the policy rate will
be exogenous. Then, by the arguments of Sargent and Wallace (1975), the equilibrium may be indeterminate.
   33
      In Svensson and Woodford (2005) the precise timing of these operations is made explicit so as to avoid any
simultaneity problems.
   34
      There is a one-to-one correspondence between the optimal policy-rate path and the optimal policy function
 =  ̃ (for which the policy instrument responds to the predetermined variables ̃ ≡ (0  Ξ0−1 )0 ), but there is a
continuum of implicit instrument rules (for which the policy instrument responds also to forward-looking variables)
consistent with the optimal policy. For instance, the implicit instrument rule  = ( −  )̃ +  is consistent
with the optimal policy for any value of the scalar , since in equilibrium  =  ̃ . However, the determinacy
properties (the eigenvalue configuration) may of course depend on .

3.8. Optimization under discretion and the discretion equilibrium

The previous discussion is under the assumption that commitment in a timeless perspective is
possible. Under optimization under discretion, the central bank minimizes the intertemporal loss
function (3.11) in period , taking into account that it will reoptimize again in period  + 1 (and
that this reoptimization is anticipated by the private sector). Oudiz and Sachs (1985) derive an
iterative algorithm for the solution of this problem (with the unnecessary simplification of  = ),
which is further discussed in Backus and Driﬃll (1986), Currie and Levine (1993), and Söderlind
(1999). This algorithm is briefly described here.35
      Since the loss function is quadratic and the constraints are linear, it follows that the solution
will be linear and the minimized intertemporal loss will be quadratic. Reoptimization in period
+ 1 subject to (3.1) and given +1 will result in the policy rate +1 , the forward-looking variables
+1 , and the minimized intertemporal loss in period  + 1 satisfying

                                                    +1 = +1 +1                          (3.35)

                                                    +1 = +1 +1                          (3.36)

where the matrices +1 , +1 , and +1 and the scalar +1 are determined by the decision
problem in period  + 1. These matrices and the scalar are assumed to be known in period ; only
+1 and +1 will matter for the decision problem in period .
      By taking expectations of (3.36) and using (3.2), we have

                           +1| = +1 +1| = +1 (11  + 12  + 1  )           (3.38)

Using (3.38) in the lower block of (3.1) and solving for  results in

                                                    = ̄  + ̄                          (3.39)

where

                              ̄ ≡ (22 − +1 12 )−1 (+1 11 − 21 )                 (3.40)

                              ̄ ≡ (22 − +1 12 )−1 (+1 1 − 2 )                    (3.41)

(we assume that 22 − +1 12 is nonsingular). Using (3.39) in the upper block of (3.1) then
gives
                                          +1 = ̃  + ̃  + +1                        (3.42)

       The optimization problem in period  is now to minimize

problem without forward-looking variables, albeit with time-varying parameters. The solution will

 . The solution to the problem is a fixed point (   ) of the mapping and a corresponding  .
It can be obtained as the limit of (   ) when  → −∞.
       Thus, the solution and the discretion equilibrium is
                           ∙    ¸ ∙        ¸

will satisfy
                                                      = ̄ + ̄                               (3.46)

       The matrices  and  depend on , , , , Λ, and , but they are independent of . This
demonstrates the certainty equivalence of the discretionary equilibrium.

3.8.1. The projection model, the feasible set of projections, and the optimal policy
        projection

Under discretion, the projection model for the projections (         ) can be written

                                         + +1 = ̃+  + ̃+                                    (3.47)

                                               +  = ̄+  + ̄+                                (3.48)
                                                           ⎡           ⎤
                                                             + 
                                               +  =  ⎣ +  ⎦                                        (3.49)
                                                              + 
for  ≥ 0, where
                                                         = |                                          (3.50)

The feasible set of projections for given | , T (| ) is then the set of projections that satisfy
(3.47)-(3.50). The optimal policy projection is then the solution to the problem

                           minimize L(  ) subject to (         ) ∈ T (| )

    Policy under discretion is here modeled as assuming that in each period  +  ≥ , private-sector
expectations in period  +  of the forward-looking variables and the policy rate in period  +  + 1,
+ +1| and + +1| , are determined by its belief that the central bank will reoptimize in period
 +  + 1.37 This means that the private-sector expectations of the forward-looking variables and
the policy rate satisfy                  ∙                 ¸
                                               + +1|
                                                               =  + +1|+ 
                                               + +1|
where + +1|+ , the private-sector expectations in period  +  of the predetermined variables in
period  +  + 1 is given by
                                       + +1|+ = ̃+ |+ + ̃+ 

In particular, private-sector expectations in period  of the forward-looking variables and the policy
rate in period  + 1 satisfy
                                  ∙             ¸
                                      +1|
                                                    =  +1| =  (̃| + ̃ )                          (3.51)
                                      +1|
The central bank’s forecast in period  of the forward-looking variables in period  + 1 depends on
its forecast for both its policy rate in period  + 1, +1 , according to

                          +1 = ̄+1 + ̄+1 = ̄(̃| + ̃ ) + ̄+1 
  37
     Recall that private-sector rational expectations are denoted by a vertical bar in the subindex  +  |, whereas
central-bank projections are denoted by a comma in the subindex  +   .


                                                               31
If the central bank’s forecast of its policy rate is consistent with its reoptimization in period  + 1,
it will satisfy
                                    +1 =  +1 =  (̃| + ̃ )

and be equal to the private-sector expectations of the policy rate, +1| . Then the central bank’s
forecast of the forward-looking variables, +1 , will be equal to the private-sector expectations,
+1| , since

     +1 = ̄+1 + ̄+1 = ̄+1 + ̄ +1 =  +1 =  (̃| + ̃ ) = +1| 

where we have used (3.46).
    Thus, the specification of the projection model under discretion, (3.47)-(3.50), implies that the
central bank considers alternative policy-rate paths and associated forecasts for the predetermined
and forward-looking variables, taking into account that those forecasts would not be credible and de-
viate from private-sector expectations. The private-sector expectations are here consistently equal
to the optimal policy projection under discretion. In contrast, the specification of the projection
model under commitment, (3.20)-(3.22), implies that the central bank considers alternative policy-
rate paths and associated forecasts for the predetermined and forward-looking variables under the
assumption that these alternative forecasts are credible.


3.8.2. Degrees of commitment

Commitment and discretion raise intriguing issues. Which is the more realistic description of actual
monetary-policy decisions is not obvious. In Bergo (2007), the then Deputy Governor of Norges
Bank provides a fascinating discussion of how Norges Bank tries to implement optimal policy under
commitment. My own view so far has been that central-bank staﬀ should propose to policymakers
policy alternatives that are consistent with commitment in a timeless perspective, in the hope
that policymakers would restrict their choices to those alternatives. This is the view underlying
Adolfson, Laséen, Lindé, and Svensson (2009), for instance. How diﬀerent the outcomes under
commitment and discretion will depend on many things and how relevant these diﬀerences are for
policymaking is an empirical issue that to my knowledge has not been resolved.38
    An interesting idea is to consider not only the extremes of commitment and discretion but
also a continuum in between. Schaumburg and Tambalotti (2007) present a simple framework for
  38
     Furthermore, as discussed by Dennis (2008), the relative performance of commitment in a timeless perspective
and discretion is an intriguing issue and depends on circumstances and how policy performance is evaluated. See
Woodford (2010b) for more discussion of commitment, commitment in a timeless perspective, and discretion.


                                                       32
analyzing monetary policy in such a continuum, what they call quasi-commitment, between the
extremes of commitment and discretion. Quasi-commitment is characterized by a given probability
of a central bank reneging from a commitment. That probability can be interpreted as a measure of
the lack of credibility of the central bank’s policy, and they examine the welfare eﬀects of a marginal
increase in credibility. The main finding in their simple framework is that most of the welfare gain
from increased commitment accrues at relatively low levels of credibility. The magnitude of the
welfare gain is smaller when there is less inflation bias under discretion, that is, less average excess
of inflation over the inflation target.


3.9. Uncertainty

In this subsection, I briefly discuss two kinds of uncertainty, namely uncertainty about an im-
perfectly observed state of the economy and uncertainty about the model and the transmission
mechanism of monetary policy.


3.9.1. Uncertainty about the state of the economy

It is a truism that monetary policy operates under considerable uncertainty about the state of the
economy and the size and nature of the disturbances that hit the economy. This is a particular
problem for forecast targeting, under which the central bank, in order to set its interest-rate in-
strument, needs to construct conditional forecasts of future inflation, conditional on alternative
interest-rate paths and the bank’s best estimate of the current state of the economy and the likely
future development of important exogenous variables. Often, diﬀerent indicators provide conflicting
information on developments in the economy. In order to be successful, a central bank then needs
to put the appropriate weights on diﬀerent information and draw the most eﬃcient inference. In
the case of a purely backward-looking model (of the evolution of the bank’s target variables and the
indicators), the principles for eﬃcient estimation and signal extraction are well known. But in the
more realistic case where important indicator variables are forward-looking variables, the problem
of eﬃcient signal-extraction is inherently more complicated.
   In the case where there are no forward-looking variables, it is well known that a linear model
with a quadratic loss function and a partially observable state of the economy (partial information)
is characterized by certainty equivalence. That is, the optimal policy is the same as if the state
of the economy were fully observable (full information), except that one responds to an eﬃcient
estimate of the state vector rather than to its actual value. Furthermore, a separation principle


                                                  33
applies, according to which the selection of the optimal policy (the optimization problem) and the
estimation of the current state of the economy (the estimation or signal-extraction problem) can be
treated as separate problems. In particular, the observable variables will be predetermined and the
innovations in the observable variables (the diﬀerence between the current realization and previous
prediction of each of the observable variables) contain all new information. The optimal weights to
be placed on the innovations in the various observable variables in one’s estimate of the state vector
at each point in time are provided by a standard Kalman filter (see, for instance, Chow (1973),
Kalchbrenner and Tinsley (1975), and LeRoy and Waud (1977)).
    The case without forward-looking variables is, however, very restrictive. In the real world,
many important indicator variables for central banks are forward-looking variables, variables that
depend on private-sector expectations of the future developments in the economy and future policy.
Central banks routinely watch variables that are inherently forward-looking, like exchange rates,
bond rates and other asset prices, as well as measures of private-sector inflation expectations,
industry order-flows, confidence measures, and the like. Forward-looking variables complicate the
estimation or signal-extraction problem significantly. They depend, by definition, on private-sector
expectations of future endogenous variables and of current and future policy actions. However,
these expectations in turn depend on an estimate of the current state of the economy, and that
estimate in turn depends, to some extent, on observations of the current forward-looking variables.
This circularity presents a considerable challenge for the estimation problem in the presence of
forward-looking variables. Pearlman, Currie, and Levine (1986) showed in a linear (non-optimizing)
model with forward-looking variables and partial symmetric information that the solution can be
expressed in terms of a Kalman filter, although the solution is much more complex than in the
purely backward-looking case. Pearlman (1992) later used this solution in an optimizing model to
demonstrate that certainty equivalence and the separation principle apply under both discretion
and commitment in the presence of forward-looking variables and symmetric partial information.
    Svensson and Woodford (2003) extended this previous work on partial information with forward-
looking variables by providing simpler derivations of the optimal weights on the observable variables,
and clarifying how the updating equations can be modified to handle the circularity mentioned
above.39 They also provided a simple example, in the standard New Keynesian model, that clarifies
several issues raised by Orphanides (2003). He has argued, for instance, with reference to real-time
  39
     Gerali and Lippi (2008) provide a toolkit of Matlab routines that applies the algorithms of Svensson and Woodford
(2005).




                                                         34
U.S. data from the 1970s, that it is better that monetary policy disregards uncertain data about the
output gap and responds to current inflation only. The findings in Svensson and Woodford (2003)
are diﬀerent and in line with the conventional wisdom. First, they found that the monetary-policy
response to the optimal estimates of the current output gap is the same as under certainty, that
is, that certainty equivalence applies. Second, the optimal weights put on the noisy observations,
the indicators, used in constructing the optimal estimate of the output gap depends on the degree
of uncertainty. For instance, when the degree of noise in an indicator of potential output is large,
the optimal weight on that indicator becomes small.40


3.9.2. Uncertainty about the model and the transmission mechanism

Recognizing the uncertain environment that policymakers face, recent research has considered
broader forms of uncertainty for which certainty equivalence no longer applies. While this may
have important implications, in practice the design of policy becomes much more diﬃcult outside
the classical linear-quadratic framework.
       One of the conclusions of the Onatski and Williams (2003) study of model uncertainty is that,
for progress to be made, the structure of the model uncertainty has to be explicitly modeled. In
line with this, Svensson and Williams (2007b) develop a very explicit but still relatively general
form of model uncertainty that remains quite tractable. They use a so-called Markov jump-linear-
quadratic (MJLQ) model, where model uncertainty takes the form of diﬀerent “modes” (or regimes)
that follow a Markov process. The approach allows the user to move beyond the classical linear-
quadratic world with additive shocks, yet remains close enough to the linear-quadratic framework
that the analysis is transparent. Optimal and other monetary policies are examined in an extended
linear-quadratic setup, extended in a way to capture model uncertainty. The forms of model uncer-
tainty the framework encompasses include: simple i.i.d. model deviations; serially correlated model
deviations; estimable regime-switching models; more complex structural uncertainty about very
diﬀerent models, for instance, backward- and forward-looking models; time-varying central-bank
judgment–information, knowledge, and views outside the scope of a particular model (Svensson
(2005))–about the state of model uncertainty; and so forth. Moreover, the methods also apply
to other linear models with changes of regime which may capture boom/bust cycles, productiv-
ity slowdowns and accelerations, switches in monetary and/or fiscal policy regimes, and so forth.
  40
    Svensson and Woodford (2004) derive an equlibrium with optimal monetary policy in a general linear-quadratic
model with asymmetric information, where then central bank has less information than the private sector. Aoki
(2006) provides an application to the standard New Keynesian model with a particular assumption about the central
bank’s information set. See Woodford (2010b) for more discussion of the case of asymmetric information.


                                                       35
With algorithms for finding the optimal policy as well as solutions for arbitrary policy functions
it is possible to compute and plot consistent distribution forecasts–fan charts–of target variables
and instruments. The methods hence extend certainty equivalence and “mean forecast targeting,”
where only the mean of future variables matter (Svensson (2005)), to more general certainty non-
equivalence and “distribution forecast targeting,” where the whole probability distribution of future
variables matter (Svensson (2003b)).
   Certain aspects of the MJLQ approach have been known in economics since the classic works
of Aoki (1967) and Chow (1973), who allowed for multiplicative uncertainty in a linear-quadratic
framework. The insight of those papers, when adapted to the MJLQ setting, is that in MJLQ
models the value function for the optimal policy design problem remains quadratic in the state, but
now with weights that depend on the mode. MJLQ models have also been widely studied in the
control-theory literature for the special case when there are no forward-looking variables (see Costa
and Fragoso (1995), Costa, Fragoso, and Marques (2005), do Val, Geromel, and Costa (1998), and
the references therein). More recently, Zampolli (2006) uses an MJLQ model to examine monetary
policy under shifts between regimes with and without an asset-market bubble, although still in a
model without forward-looking variables. Blake and Zampolli (2005) provide an extension of the
MJLQ model to include forward-looking variables, although with less generality than in Svensson
and Williams (2007b) and with the analysis and the algorithms restricted to observable modes and
discretion equilibria.
   The MJLQ approach is also closely related to the Markov regime-switching models which have
been widely used in empirical work. These methods first gained prominence with Hamilton (1989)
which started a burgeoning line of research. Models of this type have been used to study a host
of empirical phenomena, with many developments and techniques summarized in Kim and Nelson
(1999). More recently, the implications of Markov switching in rational expectations models of
monetary policy have been studied by Davig and Leeper (2007) and Farmer, Waggoner, and Zha
(2009). These papers focus on (and debate) the conditions for uniqueness or indeterminacy of
equilibria in forward-looking models, taking as given a specified policy rule.
   Relative to this previous literature, Svensson and Williams (2007b) provides a more general ap-
proach for solving for the optimal policy in MJLQ models that include forward-looking variables.
This extension is key for policy analysis under rational expectations, but the forward-looking vari-
ables make the model nonrecursive. The recursive saddlepoint method of Marcet and Marimon
(1998) can then be applied to express the model in a convenient recursive way, and an algorithm


                                                 36
for determining the optimal policy and value functions can be derived.
    The more general case where modes are unobservable and decision makers infer from their ob-
servations the probability of being in a particular mode is much more diﬃcult to solve. The optimal
filter is nonlinear, which destroys the tractability of the MJLQ approach.41 Additionally, as in most
Bayesian learning problems, the optimal policy will also include an experimentation component.
Thus, solving for the optimal decision rules will be a more complex numerical task. Due to the
curse of dimensionality, it is only feasible in models with a relatively small number of state vari-
ables and modes. Confronted with these diﬃculties, the literature has focused on approximations
such as linearization or adaptive control.42 Svensson and Williams (2007a) develops algorithms to
solve numerically for the optimal policy in these cases.43 Due to the curse of dimensionality, the
Bayesian optimal policy (BOP) is only feasible in relatively small models. Confronted with these
diﬃculties, Svensson and Williams (2007a) also considers adaptive optimal policy (AOP).44 In this
case, the policymaker in each period does update the probability distribution of the current mode
in a Bayesian way, but the optimal policy is computed each period under the assumption that the
policymaker will not learn in the future from observations. In the MJLQ setting, the AOP is signif-
icantly easier to compute, and in many cases provides a good approximation to the BOP. Moreover,
the AOP analysis is of some interest in its own right, as it is closely related to specifications of
adaptive learning which have been widely studied in macroeconomics (see Evans and Honkapohja
(2001) for an overview). Further, the AOP specification rules out the experimentation which some
may view as objectionable in a policy context.
  41
     The optimal nonlinear filter is well-known, and it is a key component of the estimation methods as well (Hamilton
(1989) and Kim and Nelson (1999)).
  42
      In the first case, restricting attention to (sub-optimal) linear filters preserves the tractability of the linear-
quadratic framework. See Costa, Fragoso, and Marques (2005) for a brief discussion and references. In adaptive
control, agents do not take into account the informational role of their decisions. See do Val, Geromel, and Costa
(1998) for an application of an adaptive control MJLQ problem in economics. In a diﬀerent setting, Cogley, Colacito,
and Sargent (2007) have recently studied how well adaptive procedures approximate the optimal policies.
  43
      In addition to the classic literature (on such problems as a monopolist learning its demand curve), Wieland
(2000), Wieland (2006) and Beck and Wieland (2002) have recently examined Bayesian optimal policy and optimal
experimentation in a context similar to ours but without forward-looking variables. Eijﬃnger, Schaling, and Tesfase-
lassie (2006) examine passive and active learning in a simple model with a forward-looking element in the form of
a long interest rate in the aggregate-demand equation. Ellison and Valla (2001) and Cogley, Colacito, and Sargent
(2007) study situations like ours but where the expectational component is as in the Lucas-supply curve (−1   ,
for example) rather than our forward-looking case ( +1 , for example). Ellison (2006) analyzes active and passive
learning in a New Keynesian model with uncertainty about the slope of the Phillips curve.
  44
      Optimal policy under no learning, adaptive optimal policy, and Bayesian optimal policy have in the literature
also been referred to as myopia, passive learning, and active learning, respectively.

3.10. Judgment

Throughout the monetary-policy decision process in central banks, a considerable amount of judg-
ment is applied to assumptions and projections. Projections and monetary-policy decisions cannot
rely on models and simple observable data alone. All models are drastic simplifications of the
economy, and data give a very imperfect view of the state of the economy. Therefore, judgmental
adjustments in both the use of models and the interpretation of their results–adjustments due to
information, knowledge, and views outside the scope of any particular model–are a necessary and
essential component in modern monetary policy. Any existing model is always an approximation of
the true model of the economy, and monetary-policy makers always find it necessary to make some
judgmental adjustments to the results of any given model. Such judgmental adjustments could refer
to future fiscal policy, productivity, consumption, investment, international trade, foreign-exchange
and other risk premia, raw-material prices, private-sector expectations, and so forth.
       One way to represent central-bank judgment is as the central-bank’s conditional mean estimate
of arbitrary multidimensional stochastic “deviations”–“add factors”–to the model equations, as
in Reifschneider, Stockton, and Wilcox (1997) and Svensson (2005). The deviations represent
additional determinants–determinants outside the model–of the variables in the economy, the
diﬀerence between the actual value of a variable and the value predicted by the model. It can
be interpreted as model perturbations, as in the literature on robust control.45 Svensson (2005)
discusses optimal monetary policy, taking judgment into account, in backward- and forward-looking
models. Svensson and Tetlow (2005) show how central-bank judgment can be extracted according
to the method of Optimal Policy Projections (OPP). This method provides advice on optimal
monetary policy while taking policymakers’ judgment into account. Svensson and Tetlow (2005)
demonstrate the usefulness of OPP with a few example projections for two Greenbook forecasts
and the FRB/US model. An early version of the method was developed by Robert Tetlow for a
mostly backward-looking variant of the Federal Reserve Board’s FRB/US model. The resulting
projections have been referred to at the Federal Reserve Board as “policymaker perfect-foresight
projections”–somewhat misleadingly. A description and application of the method is given in
Federal Reserve Board (2002), the Federal Reserve Board’s Bluebook for the FOMC meeting on
May 2, 2002.
       Section 4.3 gives another example of the application of judgment, from the Riksbank’s policy
  45
    See, for instance, Hansen and Sargent (2008). However, that literature deals with the more complex case when
the model perturbations are endogenous and chosen by nature to correspond to a worst-case scenario.

decision on February 2009. In the middle of the recent financial crisis and rapidly deteriorating
economic situation, the Riksbank posted forecasts quite diﬀerent from the forecasts generated by
the Riksbank’s models.


4. Practice

In this section on the practice of inflation targeting, I first discuss some development of practical
inflation targeting since its introduction in New Zealand in 1990. Then I make some brief comments
on the publication of policy-rate paths and describe the recent practice of two inflation-targeting
central banks that I know more about; the Riksbank, which is ranked as one of the world’s most
transparent central banks, and Norges Bank, which has been a pioneer in applying explicit optimal
monetary policy as an input in its policy decision. Finally I also comment on the issue of what
preconditions are appropriate for emerging-market economies that consider inflation targeting.


4.1. Some developments of inflation targeting

Inflation targeting was introduced in New Zealand in 1990.46 The Reserve Bank of New Zealand
was the first central bank in the world to implement such a monetary policy setup, so it could not
rely on the experience of other inflation-targeting central banks. Likewise, it had little experience in
constructing inflation projections. During the 1990s, the Bank gradually established credibility and
anchored inflation expectations on the inflation target. The Bank also accumulated an increased
understanding of the transmission mechanism of monetary policy and increased confidence in its
ability to fulfil the inflation target. This allowed the Bank some more degrees of freedom, and a
gradual move towards more flexible and medium-term inflation targeting was to a large extent a
natural consequence. It is possible that a shorter horizon and somewhat higher weight on inflation
stabilization in the beginning may have contributed to establishing initial credibility.
    Initially, the Bank had a rather rudimentary view of the transmission mechanism and mostly
emphasized the direct exchange rate channel to CPI inflation.47 The Bank also had a rather
short policy horizon of 2—4 quarters within which it would attempt to meet the inflation target
(see the Bank’s Briefing of October 1996, Reserve Bank of New Zealand (1996)). The Bank’s
view of the transmission mechanism evolved gradually over the years to emphasize other channels
  46
     See Svensson (2001) and, in particular, Singleton, Hawke, and Grimes (2006) for the developments of inflation
targeting in New Zealand.
  47
     See Svensson (2000) and Svensson (2001) for a discussion of the channels of the transmission mechanism of
monetary policy.

of transmission, especially the aggregate-demand channel. The Monetary Policy Statement of
December 1995, for instance, contains a box with a brief and preliminary discussion of the concept
of potential output, which is so central in modern views of the transmission mechanism. With the
introduction of the Forecasting and Policy System (FPS) in 1997 (Black, Cassino, Drew, Hansen
et al. (1997)), which built on Bank of Canada’s then state-of-the-art Quarterly Projection Model
(QPM) (Poloz, Rose, and Tetlow (1994)), the Bank had developed a fully-fledged modern view of
the transmission mechanism in an open economy in line with best international practice. With the
introduction of the FPS, the Bank started to publish an interest-rate forecast in 1997, much earlier
than any other inflation-targeting central bank.
    Parallel to these developments, the Bank lengthened its policy horizon and took a more flexible
interpretation of the inflation target. Indeed, in its Briefing of November 1999, Reserve Bank of
New Zealand (1999), the Bank completely subscribes to the idea of flexible inflation targeting:

      “Our conclusion, on the whole, has been to adopt a more medium-term approach,
      which attaches more weight to the desirability of stabilising output, interest rates and
      the exchange rate, while still aiming to keep inflation within the target range.”

The Bank mentioned some steps taken in this direction that include:

    • “The widening of the inflation target range, from 0 to 2 percent to 0 to 3 percent...”

    • “A lengthening of the horizon at which policy responses to inflation pressures are directed,
      from 6 to 12 months to something more like 12 to 24 months. This means that, provided the
      medium-term inflation outlook is in line with the target, near-term shifts in the price level
      are more likely to be accepted without policy reaction.”

    • “Some de-emphasis of the edges of the target range as hard and precise thresholds...”

    • “The shift from an MCI target to a cash interest rate instrument for implementing monetary
      policy. This change has lessened the need for frequent intervention in the financial markets,
      and has resulted in more interest rate stability.”48
   48
      From June 1997 to March 1999, the Reserve Bank used a so-called Monetary Conditions Index (MCI) both as
an indicator and as an instrument in implementing monetary policy. The real MCI was constructed by combining
the 90-day real interest rate with the real exchange rate (expressed in terms of a trade-weighted index, the TWI),
with a weight of 0.5 on the exchange rate. (Using the nominal interest rate and exchange rate results in the nominal
MCI.) The MCI was supposed to measure the overall stance of monetary policy: the degree to which monetary policy
is deemed to resist either inflationary or deflationary tendencies. However, from the complexity of the transmission
mechanism, with diﬀerent channels, diﬀerent lags and diﬀerent strengths of the eﬀects, it is apparent that a simple
summary index like the MCI will be unreliable. For instance, the relative eﬀect of interest rate and exchange rate


                                                        40
    Regarding the policy horizon, inflation targeting has sometimes been associated with a fixed
horizon, such as two years, within which the inflation target should be achieved. However, as is
now generally understood, under optimal stabilization of inflation and the real economy there is
no such fixed horizon at which inflation goes to target or resource utilization goes to normal. The
horizon at which the inflation forecast is close to the target and/or the resource-utilization forecast
is close to normal depends on the initial situation of the economy, the initial deviation of inflation
and resource utilization from target and normal and the nature and size of the estimated shocks
to the economy (Faust and Henderson (2004), Giavazzi and Mishkin (2006), Smets (2003)). In line
with this, many or even most inflation-targeting central banks have more or less ceased to refer to
a fixed horizon and instead refer to the “medium term.”49
    With the linear models of the transmission mechanism that are standard for central banks,
reasonable equilibrium and optimal paths for inflation and resource utilization approach the target
and a normal level asymptotically, including the case when the policy rate is an estimated empirical
function of observable variables. More precisely, the resulting equilibrium forecasts on period  of
such models for the inflation and output gaps in period  +  ,  +  −  ∗ and +  − ̄+  ,
changes on output and inflation varies with the channel, the time horizon, and how persistent these changes are
expected to be by households and firms. Thus, there is no reason to believe that the relative weight on the exchange
rate, taken to be 0.5 by the Reserve Bank, is stable. In line with this, attempts to estimate the relative weights
have resulted in diﬀerent and very uncertain estimates. The numerous problems of the MCI are discussed in Stevens
(1998). In my review of monetary policy 1990-2000 in New Zealand (Svensson (2001)), one of my conclusions was that
the uncritical use of the MCI had contributed to too tight policy in 1997/98 during the Asian crisis. In March 1999,
the Reserve Bank abandoned this unusual way of implementing monetary policy and instead moved to a completely
conventional implementation, by setting the Oﬃcial Cash Rate (OCR).
   With regard to the operational framework and how monetary policy was managed in pursuit of the inflation target,
my overall conclusion was that “the period (mid 1997 to March 1999) when the Reserve Bank used a Monetary
Conditions Index (MCI) to implement monetary policy represents a significant deviation from best international
practice. This has now been remedied, and monetary policy in New Zealand is currently entirely consistent with the
best international practice of flexible inflation targeting, with a medium-term inflation target that avoids unnecessary
variability in output, interest rates and the exchange rate. Only some marginal improvements, mostly of a technical
nature, are recommended.”
  49
     The Policy Target Agreement for the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (Reserve Bank of New Zealand (2007)) states
that “the policy target shall be to keep future CPI inflation outcomes between 1 and 3 per cent on average over the
medium term.” The Bank of England (Bank of England (2007)) states that “the MPC’s aim is to set interest rates
so that inflation can be brought back to target within a reasonable time period without creating undue instability in
the economy.” The Reserve Bank of Australia states (Reserve Bank of Australia (2008)) “[m]onetary policy aims to
achieve this [a target for consumer price inflation of 2-3 per cent per annum] over the medium term.” Norges Bank
states in its Monetary Policy Report that “Norges Bank sets the interest rate with a view to stabilising inflation
close to the target in the medium term.” In contrast, the Bank of Canada (Bank of Canada (2006)) mentions a more
specific target time horizon: “[T]he present policy of bringing inflation back to the 2 per cent target within six to eight
quarters (18 to 24 months) is still appropriate generally, although specific occasions may arise in which a somewhat
shorter or longer time horizon might be appropriate.” At the time of writing (March 2010) the Riksbank mostly uses
the phrase “in a couple of years,” but some documents (hopefully not for very long) still use the phrase “within two
years.”

denote eigenvalues with modulus below unity, and  = 0 1  denotes the forecast horizon. This
means that the inflation-gap and the output-gap forecast for a particular forecast horizon are a
linear combination of terms that approach zero exponentially and asymptotically. There is hence
no particular horizon at which the forecast for the inflation or output gap is zero. Generally, a
lower (higher) relative weight () on output-gap stabilization implies that the inflation gap (the
output gap) goes to zero faster (slower) (Svensson (1997)). Furthermore, for any given horizon, the
size of the inflation or output gap depends on the initial inflation and output gap. Because of this,
half-time, meaning the horizon at which the gap has been reduced to a half of the initial gap, is a
more appropriate concept than a fixed horizon for describing the convergence of the forecast to the
long-term mean values.50


4.2. Publishing an interest-rate path

As mentioned, inflation targeting is characterized by a high degree of transparency. Typically,
an inflation-targeting central bank publishes a regular monetary-policy report which includes the
bank’s forecast of inflation and other variables, a summary of its analysis behind the forecasts, and
the motivation for its policy decisions. Some inflation-targeting central banks also provide some
information on, or even forecasts of, its likely future policy decisions.
       Indeed, a current much-debated issue concerning the further development of inflation targeting
is the appropriate assumption about the policy-rate path that underlies the forecasts of inflation
and other target variables and the information provided about future policy actions. Tradition-
ally, inflation-targeting central banks have assumed a constant interest rate underlying its inflation
forecasts, with the implication that a constant-interest-rate inflation forecast that overshoots (un-
dershoots) the inflation target at some horizon such as two years indicates that the policy rate needs
to increased (decreased) (Jansson and Vredin (2003), Vickers (1998)). Increasingly, central banks
have become aware of a number of serious problems with the assumption of constant interest rates.
  50
     A possible definition of half-time, , is the solution to the equation |1 | = 12, where 1 is the eigenvalue
with the largest modulus, so  = − ln 2  ln |1 |.


                                                              42
These problems include that the assumption may often be unrealistic and therefore imply biased
forecasts, imply either explosive or indeterminate behavior of standard models of the transmission
mechanism of monetary policy, and at closer scrutiny be shown to combine inconsistent inputs in
the forecasting process (such as some inputs such as asset prices that are conditional on market
expectations of future interest rates rather than constant interest rates) and therefore produce in-
consistent and diﬃcult-to-interpret forecasts (Leitemo (2003), Woodford (2005))). Some central
banks have moved to a policy-rate assumption equal to market expectations at some recent date
of future interest rates, as they can be extracted from the yield curve. This reduces the number
of problems mentioned above but does not eliminate them. For instance, the central bank may
have a view about the appropriate future interest-rate path that diﬀers from the market’s view.
A few central banks (notably the Reserve Bank of New Zealand already in 1997, Norges Bank in
2005, the Riksbank in 2007, and the Czech National Bank in 2008) have moved to deciding on and
announcing a policy-rate path; this approach solves all the above problems, is the most consistent
way of implementing inflation targeting, and provides the best information for the private sector.
The practice of deciding on and announcing optimal policy-rate paths is now likely to be gradu-
ally adopted by other central banks in other countries, in spite of being considered more or less
impossible, or even dangerous, only a few years ago (Svensson (2007), Woodford (2005), Woodford
(2007), Svensson (2009c)).51


4.3. The Riksbank

In January 1993, the Riksbank announced an inflation target of 2 percent for the CPI, with a
tolerance interval of ±1 percent, to apply from 1995. (The tolerance interval was considered
unnecessary and abolished in June 2010.) In 1999, the Riksbank became independent, and a
six-member executive board was appointed. The board members are individually accountable with
one vote each and the Governor has the tie-braking vote. There are normally six monetary-policy
meetings per year. After a meeting the policy decision and a Monetary Policy Report or Update
are released the next morning. Since February 2007, the Riksbank publishes not only a forecast
of inflation and the real economy but also a policy-rate path in its report/update. Minutes from
the policy meeting are published about two weeks after the meeting. Since June 2007, the minutes
are attributed. Since April 2009, the votes and any dissents are published in the press release the
  51
     Gosselin, Lotz, and Wyplosz (2008) provide a theoretical analysis of transparency and opaqueness about the
central bank’s policy-rate path.

of the most transparent central banks in the world (Dincer and Eichengreen (2009), Eijﬃnger and
Geraats (2006)).
       The Riksbank has announced that it conducts flexible inflation targeting and aims at stabilizing
both inflation around the inflation target and resource utilization around a normal level. Figure 4.1
shows some policy options for the Riksbank at the policy meeting in July 2009. Panel a shows three
alternative repo-rate paths (the repo rate is the Riksbank’s policy rate), named Main, Low, and
High. Panel c shows the corresponding forecasts for CPIF inflation (the CPI calculated with a fixed
interest rate regarding housing costs) for the three repo-rate paths. Panel d shows corresponding
output-gap forecasts for the three repo-rate paths. Panel b, finally, shows the tradeoﬀ between
the mean squared gaps for the inflation- and output-gap forecasts. The mean squared gap for
the inflation- and output-gap forecast is the sum of the squared gaps over the forecast horizon
divided by the number of periods within the forecast horizon.52 The point marked Main shows,
for the Main repo-rate path, the mean squared gap for the inflation- and output-gap forecasts
along the horizontal and vertical axis, respectively. The points marked Low and High show the

line shows an isoloss line corresponding to equal weight on inflation and output-gap stabilization
( = 1). (The line is almost horizontal because the scales of the axes are so diﬀerent.) We see
that the High repo-rate path is dominated by the Main and Low repo-rate path. The majority
of the board voted in favor of the Main alternative. Thanks to the high level of transparency of
the Riksbank, the attributed minutes from the meeting (available in English on the Riksbank’s
web page, www.riksbank.com) reveal a lively debate about the decision, including whether a zero
repo-rate was a feasible alternative or not. (I dissented in favor of the Low alternative.)
   Figure 4.2 shows an example of how judgment is applied to result in a diﬀerent forecast than
the model one. The four panels a-d show the forecast of the repo-rate, CPIF, GDP growth, and
the output gap at the policy meeting in February 2009. The dash-dotted curves show the forecast
from the Riksbank’s DSGE model Ramses (Adolfson, Laseen, Lindé, and Villani (2007), Adolfson,
Laseen, Lindé, and Villani (2008)) when an estimated policy function is applied. The dashed curve
shows the forecast from the Riksbank’s Bayesian VAR model BVAR. The dotted curves, finally,
shows the Riksbank’s forecast of the four variables as presented in the Monetary Policy Report.
Taking into the account the severe financial crisis and the rapidly deteriorating economic situation,
the Riksbank lowered the repo-rate by 100 basis points to 1 percent, much lower than the repo-rate
paths suggested by the models, and still had a more pessimistic view of GDP growth and the output
gap than the models.


4.4. Norges Bank

Norway adopted an inflation target of 2.5 percent for monetary policy in March 2001. Norges Bank
focuses on an index for core inflation. It is explicit about being a flexible inflation targeter and in
explaining what that means: “Norges Bank operates a flexible inflation targeting regime, so that
weight is given to both variability in inflation and variability in output and employment” (Norges
Bank (2009)). Thus, Norges Bank can be seen as attempting to stabilize both the inflation gap
and the output gap, which is consistent with minimizing a conventional intertemporal quadratic
loss function.
   The policy rate is set by the Bank’s executive board. Decisions concerning the policy rate
are normally taken at the executive board’s monetary-policy meeting every sixth week. At three
of these meetings, normally in March, June and October/November, Norges Bank publishes its
Monetary Policy Report with an explicit instrument-rate path and corresponding projections of

CPI inflation, a measure of core inflation, the output gap, and the policy rate. The uncertainty
of the forecast is illustrated with probability distributions (uncertainty intervals), as in figure 4.3
from the policy meeting in January 2008 (Bank of England and the Riksbank, for instance, also
illustrate the uncertainty with the help of uncertainty intervals). The main scenario is the mean of
the probability distributions. It is normally assumed that the distribution is symmetric.
   Oﬃcially, Norges Bank started to publish its own policy-rate forecast in the Inflation Report
of November 2005. However, already in the Inflation Report of March 2005, it published graphs
of alternative policy-rate paths and corresponding inflation and output-gap forecasts. These are
reproduced in figure 4.4, panels a, c, and d. In panel b, I have computed and plotted the corre-
sponding mean squared gaps for the three alternatives. The two negatively sloped lines show an
isoloss line for  = 1 and  = 03 (the latter is the steeper line). The bank chose the Main alterna-
tive. Norges Bank is the only central bank that has announced that it applies a specific  when it
computes optimal policy in its macroeconomic model. Bergo (2007) and Holmsen, Qvigstad, and
Røisland (2007) report that optimal policy with  = 03 has replicated policy projections published
by Norges Bank (with a discount factor of 099 and a weight on interest-rate smoothing of 02).
Disregarding interest-rate smoothing, panel b shows that the Main alternative is marginally better
then the High alternative for  = 03

    The decision process starts with the staﬀ producing optimal policy projections under commit-
ment.53 Although optimal policy projections with the medium-sized DSGE-model NEMO (Brubakk
and Sveen (2009)) is used as an input in the decision process, weight is also put on simple interest-
rate rules, such as the Taylor rule. Judgements are then added to the model-based projections.
The projections are then discussed by the board which might ask for additional adjustments based
on their judgments.
    Norges Bank has also published a set of criteria that it uses when judging between diﬀerent
instrument-rate paths. The first two criteria can be understood as verbal forms of optimality
conditions. The other three provide for interest-rate smoothing, robustness and cross-checking.
The criteria also work as an agenda for the internal discussions, see Holmsen, Qvigstad, Røisland,
and Solberg-Johansen (2008).
    Like many other central banks, Norges Bank indicates how it will react should certain dis-
turbances occur by presenting alternative scenarios in the Monetary Policy Report. The exact
specification of the shocks in the illustrations diﬀers over time. The shifts are specified such that,
if shocks of the same type and size occur, the alternative instrument-rate path is the Bank’s best
estimate of how it would react in such a situation. The shifts are consistent with the main scenario
  53
     The staﬀ normally use commitment in a timeless perspective as the main normative benchmark, but they have
also considered alternatives such as the quasi-commitment in Schaumburg and Tambalotti (2007) (see section 3.8.2).

in the sense that they are based on the same loss function guiding the response of the central bank.
   The Monetary Policy Report includes an account of the disturbances that have led to a change
in the instrument-rate forecast from the previous report. This “interest-rate account” is a model-
based illustration of how the change in the policy-rate forecast from the previous report can be
decomposed by diﬀerent exogenous shocks to the model. The illustration shows how changes in
the assessment of international and domestic economic variables as well as changes in the shock
processes have aﬀected the policy-rate path. The interest-rate account serves as a tool for commu-
nicating commitment. When the central bank commits to a reaction pattern under commitment,
a change in the instrument-rate forecast should reflect economic news and not re-optimization of
monetary policy. With an interest-rate account, the public is better able to check whether the
central bank responds to news only or whether it re-optimizes.


4.5. Preconditions for inflation targeting in emerging-market economies

An oft-heard objection to inflation targeting (at least before Batini and Laxton (2007)) is that it
is costly in terms of institutional and technical requirements, making the framework unsuitable for
some emerging-market economies. A detailed exposition of this point was made in Eichengreen,
Masson, Savastano, and Sharma (1999), who argued that technical capabilities and central bank



                                                                                48
autonomy were severely lacking in most emerging-market economies (including several that sub-
sequently adopted inflation targeting).54 Such countries, the argument goes, would be better oﬀ
sticking with a “conventional” policy framework, such as an exchange-rate peg or money-growth
targeting. The preconditions include (International Monetary Fund (2005, chapt. 4) and Ba-
tini and Laxton (2007)) institutional independence of the central bank; a well-developed technical
infrastructure in terms of forecasting, modeling and data availability; an economy with fully dereg-
ulated prices, not overly sensitive to commodity prices and exchange rates, and with minimal
dollarization; and a healthy financial system with sound banks and well-developed capital markets.
    To assess the role of preconditions for the adoption of inflation targeting, Batini and Laxton
(2007) administered a survey to 21 inflation-targeting central banks and 10 non-targeting central
banks in emerging-market countries. The version of the survey given to inflation-targeting central
banks focused on how policy was formulated, implemented, and communicated and how various as-
pects of central banking practice had changed before and during the adoption of targeting. Survey
responses were cross-checked with independent primary and secondary sources and in many cases
augmented with “hard” economic data. The evidence indicates that no inflation targeter had all
the preconditions in place before adopting inflation targeting. Furthermore, their evidence suggests
that it does not appear to be necessary for emerging-market countries to meet a stringent set of
institutional, technical, and economic preconditions before successfully adopting inflation target-
ing. Instead, the feasibility and success of targeting appears to depend more on the authorities’
commitment and ability to plan and drive institutional change after introducing targeting. Con-
sequently, policy advice to countries that are interested in adopting targeting could usefully focus
on the institutional and technical goals central banks should strive for during and after adopting
targeting in order to maximize its potential benefits.
    In a study of the experiences of Brazil, Chile, the Czech Republic, Indonesia, South Africa,
and Turkey, de Mello (2008) concludes that many of the preconditions associated with inflation
targeting had not been fulfilled when these countries adopted inflation targeting. Nevertheless, he
finds that “these deficiencies have not undermined the implementation of inflation targeting where
policy eﬀorts have been focused on addressing them” (p. 10).
    In an extensive survey, Freedman and Ötker-Robe (2009) describe the experiences of a number
  54
     Others who stressed the conceptual relevance of “preconditions” include Agenor (2000); Schaechter, Stone, and
Zelmer (2000); Carare, Schaechter, Stone, and Zelmer (2002); Khan (2003); and the May 2001 World Economic
Outlook. See also Masson, Savastano, and Sharma (1997). More neutral or benign views on the conceptual relevance
of “preconditions” can instead be found in Truman (2003); Jonas and Mishkin (2003); Debelle (2001); and Amato
and Gerlach (2002).

of countries with the introduction and implementation of inflation targeting regimes, and discuss
how they fared in meeting the various conditions that some have argued are needed in advance of
introducing inflation targeting. They find that the country experiences are not supportive of the
view that countries have to satisfy a long list of preconditions before adopting inflation targeting
but that some elements were important in making the inflation-targeting framework more feasible
and less challenging: (i) price stability as the overriding monetary policy goal; (ii) absence of fis-
cal dominance; (iii) central bank instrument independence; (iv) broad domestic consensus on the
prominence of the inflation target; (v) some basic understanding of the transmission mechanism,
and a reasonable capacity to aﬀect short-term interest rates; and (vi) reasonably well-functioning
financial system and markets. They suggest that these elements could perhaps be viewed as the
conditions conducive to the introduction of a successful inflation-targeting framework. In particu-
lar, they conclude: “There is no single most eﬀective path toward adoption of inflation targeting.
It would certainly be a mistake to think that all the conditions for a successful implementation of
inflation targeting need to be in place before the framework could be launched. As country experi-
ences show, in many countries that now have successful inflation targeting, some of the conditions
were not in place at the outset, but the authorities worked over time to establish them, and also
learned by doing. It would similarly be a mistake, however, to think that all the conventional con-
ditions would arrive spontaneously. The central banks have to initiate the process and make their
best eﬀort to establish the true conditions and work with the government toward that objective”
(p. 19—20).


5. Future

This section discusses two potential future issues for inflation targeting — whether it would be ad-
vantageous to move on to price-level targeting and whether inflation targeting needs to be modified
in the light of the recent financial crisis and deep recession.


5.1. Price-level targeting

A possible future issue is whether flexible inflation targeting should eventually be transformed into
flexible price-level targeting. Inflation targeting as practised implies that past deviations of inflation
from target are not undone. This introduces a unit root in the price level and makes the price level
not trend-stationary, that is, nonstationary even after the removal of a deterministic trend. That is,



                                                   50
the conditional variance of the future price level increases without bound with the horizon. In spite
of this, inflation targeting with a low inflation rate is referred to as “price stability’. An alternative
monetary-policy regime would be “price-level targeting’, where the objective is to stabilize the price
level around a price-level target.55 That price-level target need not be constant but could follow
a deterministic path corresponding to a steady inflation of two percent, for instance. Stability of
the price level around such a price-level target would imply that the price level becomes trend-
stationary, that is, the conditional variance of the price level becomes constant and independent
of the horizon. One benefit of this compared with inflation targeting is that long-run uncertainty
about the price level is smaller. Another benefit is that, if the price level falls below a credible
price-level target, inflation expectations would rise and reduce the real interest rate even if the
nominal interest rate is unchanged. The reduced real interest rate would stimulate the economy
and bring the price level back to the target. Thus, price-level targeting may imply some automatic
stabilization. This may be highly desirable, especially in situations when the zero lower bound
on nominal interest rates is binding, the nominal interest rate cannot be further reduced, and the
economy is in a liquidity trap, as has been the case for several years in Japan (and during the recent
deep recession in several other countries). Whether price-level targeting would have any negative
eﬀects on the real economy remains a topic for current debate and research (Svensson (2002)).
Recently several central banks, especially Bank of Canada, have shown new interest in price-level
targeting and several reviews of new and old research have been published, for instance, Ambler
(2009), Amano, Carter, and Coletti (2009), Deutsche Bundesbank (2010), and Kahn (2009).


5.2. Inflation targeting and financial stability: Lessons from the financial crisis56

At the time of writing (April 2010), the world economy was beginning to recover from the financial
crisis and the resulting deep recession of the global economy, and there is a lively debate about what
caused the crisis and how the risks of future crises can be reduced. Some blame loose monetary
policy for laying the foundation for the crisis, and there is also a lively debate about the future
of monetary policy and its relation to financial stability. In this section I discuss the lessons for
inflation targeting after the crisis. My view is that the crisis was not caused by monetary policy
but mainly by regulatory and supervisory failures in combination with some special circumstances,
  55
     See Berg and Jonung (1999) for a discussion of the good experience of price-level targeting in Sweden during
the Great Depression.

Nyberg, Irma Rosenberg, Hyun Shin, Frank Smets, and Staﬀan Viotti for discussions of these issues.



                                                       51
such as low world real interest rates and U.S. housing policy. Ultimately, my main conclusion for
monetary policy from the crisis so far is that flexible inflation targeting, applied in the right way
and using all the information about financial factors that is relevant for the forecast of inflation
and resource utilization at any horizon, remains the monetary policy before, during, and after the
financial crisis that has the best chance to stabilize both inflation and the real economy. But a
better theoretical, empirical, and operational understanding of the role of financial factors in the
transmission mechanism is urgently required and needs much work, work that is already underway
in academia and in central banks.
   As described in the previous sections, flexible inflation targeting means that monetary policy
aims at stabilizing both inflation around the inflation target and resource utilization around a
normal level, keeping in mind that monetary policy cannot aﬀect the long-term level of resource
utilization. Because of the time lags between monetary-policy actions and their eﬀect on inflation
and the real economy, flexible inflation targeting is more eﬀective if it relies on forecasts of inflation
and the real economy. Therefore, flexible inflation targeting can be described as “forecast targeting”:
the central bank chooses a policy-rate path so that the forecast of inflation and resource utilization
stabilizes both inflation around the inflation target and resource utilization around a normal level or
achieves a reasonable compromise between the two. The forecasts of inflation and the real economy
are then conditional on the central bank’s view of the transmission mechanism, an estimate of the
current state of the economy and a forecast of important exogenous variables. The central bank
uses all relevant information that has an impact on the forecast of inflation and the real economy.
In this framework, the central bank takes financial conditions such as credit growth, asset prices,
imbalances, potential asset price bubbles and so on into account only to the extent that they have
an impact on the forecast of inflation and resource utilization. Inflation and resource utilization are
target variables, that is, variables that the central bank tries to stabilize. Financial conditions are
not target variables. Instead, they are only indicators, as they provide information to the central
bank about the state of the economy, the transmission mechanism and exogenous shocks. Financial
conditions then aﬀect policy rates only to the extent that they have an impact on the forecast of
inflation and resource utilization.
   Now, is there any reason to modify this view of monetary policy given the experience of the
financial crisis so far? Let me approach this question by first asking what the causes of the financial
crisis were, whether monetary policy contributed to the crisis, and whether a diﬀerent monetary
policy was warranted and could have prevented or reduced the size of the crisis.


                                                   52
5.2.1. Did monetary policy contribute to the crisis, and could diﬀerent monetary policy
          have prevented the crisis?

Many have claimed that excessively easy monetary policy by the Federal Reserve after 2001 helped
cause a bubble in house prices in the U.S., a bubble whose inevitable bursting proved to be a major
source of the financial crisis.57 However, as I see it, the crisis was mainly caused by factors that
had very little to do with monetary policy and were mostly due to background macro conditions,
distorted incentives in financial markets, regulatory and supervisory failures (also when central
banks have been responsible for regulation and supervision), information problems, and some spe-
cific circumstances, including the U.S. housing policy to support home ownership for low-income
households.58
       The macro conditions preceding the crisis included low world real interest rates associated with
global imbalances, as well as the Great Moderation, with a long period of very stable growth and
stable low inflation, which led to a systematic underestimation of risk and very low risk premia in
financial markets. There were distorted incentives for commercial and investment banks to increase
leverage that were made possible by lax regulation and supervision and the lack of an appropriate
bank resolution regime. There were also distorted incentives to exercise less due diligence in loan
origination because of securitization and to conduct regulatory arbitrage by setting up oﬀ-balance-
sheet entities, which for various specific reasons ended up still eﬀectively remaining on the balance
sheet. There were also distorted incentives for traders and fund managers to take excessive risks
because of myopic and asymmetric remuneration contracts. There were eventually enormous in-
formation problems in assessing the risks of extremely complex asset-backed securities, and there
was a huge underestimation of the potential for correlated systemic risks. None of these causes had
anything to do with monetary policy, except that monetary policy may have contributed to the
Great Moderation.
       Regarding the role of Federal Reserve monetary policy in the crisis, there are two relevant
questions. First, was the low interest rate reasonable given the information available at the time?
Second, could a diﬀerent monetary policy with higher interest rates have prevented the crisis? The
first question, whether the low interest rate was reasonable given the available information, is the
  57
    See, for instance, Taylor (2007).
  58
     See Bean (2009) for an extensive and excellent discussion of the crisis, including the credit expansion and
housing boom, the macroeconomic antecedents, the distorted incentives, the information problems, the amplification
and propagation of the crisis into the real economy, the policy responses, and the lessons for monetary policy and
economics generally. Bank for International Settlements (2009) provides a more detailed account of the possible
macro- and microeconomic causes of the crisis.



                                                       53
relevant one when evaluating monetary policy. It is more relevant to evaluate policy taking into
account the information available ex ante to the policymaker rather than information ex post that
was unknown to the policymaker at the time (see Svensson (2010a) on evaluating monetary policy
ex ante and ex post). During the period in question, given the information available, there was a
genuine and well-motivated fear of the U.S. falling into a Japanese-style deflationary liquidity trap,
and the optimal policy in such a situation is a very expansionary monetary policy.59 It may be
that, in retrospect, the risk of deflation was exaggerated, but there was no way to know this ex
ante. Hence, I consider the expansionary policy very appropriate. Adding some ex post evaluation,
one can note that it did not lead ex post to very high inflation or an overheated economy.60
       The second question, whether a diﬀerent monetary policy could have prevented the crisis, is
relevant when assessing to what extent monetary policy can be blamed for causing the crisis,
notwithstanding if it was reasonable from an ex ante perspective. The credit growth and the
housing boom in the U.S. and elsewhere were very powerful. Real interest rates were low to a large
extent because of global imbalances, and the global saving glut and investment shortage. I believe
that somewhat higher interest rates would have made little or no diﬀerence. Empirical evidence
indicates that only a small portion of house-price increases can be attributed to monetary policy.61
Bernanke (2010) shows that the recent phenomenon of a higher share of adjustable-rate mortgages
was unlikely to have significantly increased the sensitivity of house prices to monetary policy. The
availability of new, more exotic mortgage types mattered much more for initial mortgage payments
than the level of short-term interest rates. In my view, interest rates would probably have had to be
raised very high so as to cause considerable damage to the real economy in order to stop the credit
growth and housing boom. That could have thrown the U.S. right into Japanese-style deflation
and eventually a liquidity trap.62 Certainly, higher interest rates would have had no impact on
the regulatory problems, distorted incentives and information problems mentioned above (although
they could have ended the Great Moderation with a deep recession and deflation).63

and Neri (2008).
  62
     Assenmacher-Wesche and Gerlach (2009) study the responses of residential property and equity prices, inflation
and economic activity to monetary policy shocks in 17 countries in the period 1986-2007, using single-country VARs
and panel VARs in which they distinguish between groups of countries depending on their financial systems. The
eﬀect of monetary policy shocks on GDP is about a third of the eﬀect on property prices. Thus, to increase policy
rates so as to lower property prices by 15 percent would result in 5 percent lower GDP.
  63
     Kohn (2008), after extensive discussion, concludes that there is insuﬃcient evidence that low interest rates would
have contributed much to the house-price boom and that higher interest rates would have had much dampening eﬀect
on it.



                                                          54
    However, going beyond the Federal Reserve’s actual monetary policy, perhaps it is possible that
the emphasis on its readiness to relax monetary policy aggressively in the wake of a sharp fall in
asset prices, as expressed by Greenspan (2002) for example, may have induced expectations of a
floor under future asset prices and contributed to the asset-price boom, the so-called Greenspan
put (Miller, Weller, and Zhang (2002)). Arguably, this is more of a communication issue than one
of actual policy, and less emphasis on the readiness to clean up after a sharp fall in asset prices
might have been a preferable alternative.
    The IMF (International Monetary Fund (2009, chapt. 3)) has investigated the role of monetary
policy in causing financial crises. A large number of countries and financial crises were included in
the sample. The conclusion is that “the stance of monetary policy has not generally been a good
leading indicator of future house price busts. . . There is some association between loose monetary
policy and house price rises in the years leading up to the current crisis in some countries, but loose
monetary policy was not the main, systematic cause of the boom and consequent bust.” Further-
more, the overall relationship between the stance of monetary policy and house-price appreciation
across countries in the years before the current crisis is statistically insignificant and economically
weak, and monetary policy diﬀerences explain only about 5 percent of the variability in house price
appreciation across countries.64
    What conclusions can we draw so far from the financial crisis about the conduct of monetary
policy and any need to modify the framework of flexible inflation targeting? One obvious conclusion
is that price stability is not enough to achieve financial stability (Carney (2003), White (2006)).
Good flexible inflation targeting by itself does not achieve financial stability, if anyone ever believed
it would.
    Another conclusion is that interest-rate policy is not enough to achieve financial stability. Spe-
cific policies and instruments are needed to ensure financial stability. Instruments like supervision
and regulation, including appropriate bank resolution regimes, are more eﬀective in promoting fi-
nancial stability. In many countries, the responsibility for these instruments rests on authorities
other than the central bank. Generally, to the extent financial instability depends on specific dis-
tortions, regulation is most eﬀective if it aims to attack these distortions as close to the source as
possible. To counter the observed procyclicality of existing regulation, macro-prudential regula-
tion that is contingent on the business cycle and financial indicators may need to be introduced
  64
     The relationship for the euro area countries is less weak, but for reasons explained by Bernanke (2010) it is
potentially overstated. See also Dokko, Doyle, Kiley, Kim et al. (2009).




                                                       55
to induce better financial stability. Possible macro-prudential regulation includes variable capital,
margin, and equity/loan requirements. As expressed by Bean (2009), “the best approach is likely
to involve a portfolio of instruments.”


5.2.2. Distinguish monetary policy and financial-stability policy

More generally, what is the relation between financial stability and monetary policy? Financial
stability is an important objective of economic policy. A possible definition of financial stability
is a situation when the financial system can fulfil its main functions (of submitting payments,
channeling saving into investment, and providing risk sharing) without disturbances that have
significant social costs. I find it helpful to conceptually distinguish financial-stability policy from
monetary policy. Diﬀerent economic policies and policy areas, such as fiscal policy, labor market
policy, structural policies to improve competition, etc., can be distinguished according to their
objectives, the policy instruments that are suitable for achieving the objectives, and the authority
or authorities controlling the instruments and responsible for achieving the objectives.
    Monetary policy in the form of flexible inflation targeting has the objective of stabilizing both
inflation around the inflation target and resource utilization around a normal level. The suitable
instruments are under normal circumstances the policy rate and communication, including possibly
a published policy-rate path and a forecast of inflation and the real economy. In times of crisis, as
we have seen during the current crisis, other more unconventional instruments can be used, such as
fixed-rate lending at longer maturities, asset purchases (quantitative easing), and foreign-exchange
intervention to prevent currency appreciation. The authority responsible for monetary policy is
typically the central bank.
    The objective of financial-stability policy is maintaining or promoting financial stability. Under
normal circumstances the available instruments are supervision, regulation, and financial-stability
reports with analyses and leading indicators that may provide early warnings of stability threats. In
times of crisis, there are instruments such as lending of last resort, variable-rate lending at longer
maturities (credit policy, credit easing), special resolution regimes for financial firms in trouble,
government lending guarantees, government capital injections, and so forth.65 The responsible
authority or authorities vary across countries. In some countries it is the central bank, in other
   65
      Gertler and Kiyotaki (2010) develop a canonical framework to help organize thinking about credit market
frictions and aggregate economic activity in the context of the current crisis. They use the framework to discuss
how disruptions in financial intermediation can induce a crisis that aﬀects real activity and to illustrate how various
credit market interventions by the central bank and/or the Treasury of the type seen during the crisis might work to
mitigate the crisis.



                                                          56
countries there is a separate financial supervisory authority, sometimes the responsibility is shared
between diﬀerent institutions. In Sweden, the Financial Supervisory Authority is responsible for
supervision and regulation, the Riksbank is responsible for lending of last resort to solvent banks
and for promoting a safe and eﬃcient payment system, while the National Debt Oﬃce is responsible
for bank guarantees and the resolution of failed banks. During times of crisis, these authorities
cooperate closely with the Ministry of Finance.
       My point here is that financial-stability policy and monetary policy are quite diﬀerent, with
diﬀerent objectives, instruments, and responsible authorities, the latter with considerable diﬀerences
across countries. This does not mean that there is no interaction between them. Financial stability
directly aﬀects the financial markets, and financial conditions aﬀect the transmission mechanism
of monetary policy. Problems in financial markets may have a drastic eﬀect on the real economy,
as the current financial crisis has shown. Monetary policy aﬀects asset prices and balance sheets
and can thereby aﬀect financial stability. But the fact that financial-stability policy and monetary
policy are conceptually distinct, with distinct objectives and distinct suitable instruments, has
to be taken into account when considering the lessons of the financial crisis for monetary policy.
Thus, because the policy rate is a blunt and unsuitable instrument for achieving financial stability,
it makes little sense to assign the objective of financial stability to monetary policy, although it
may make sense assign that objective to the central bank, if the central bank gets control of the
appropriate supervisory and regulatory instruments.66


5.2.3. Conclusions for flexible inflation targeting

What are the specific conclusions for flexible inflation targeting? One important lesson from the
financial crisis is that financial factors may have a very strong and deteriorating eﬀect on the trans-
mission mechanism, making standard interest-rate policy much less eﬀective. This motivates more
research on how to incorporate financial factors into the standard models of the transmission mech-
anism used by central banks. A rapidly-increasing volume of such research is now being produced
by academic and central-bank researchers and presented at an increasing number of conferences on
financial factors and monetary policy. Important and challenging questions include how potential
output and neutral real interest rates are aﬀected by financial factors and financial distortions (Cur-
dia and Woodford (2009), Walsh (2009b)), and what impact financial factors have on the general
  66
    Blinder (2010) discusses how much of the responsibility for financial-stability policy should rest with the central
bank.




                                                          57
equilibrium eﬀects of alternative policy-rate paths on inflation and resource utilization forecasts.67
Even with much better analytical foundations concerning the role of financial factors in the trans-
mission mechanism, there will of course, as always, be considerable scope for the application of
good judgment in monetary policy.
       Another conclusion, which is not new, is that consideration of the impact of financial factors
on the forecast of inflation and resource utilization may require longer forecast horizons. Several
inflation-targeting central banks (including the Bank of England, Norges Bank, and the Riksbank)
have for other reasons already extended their forecast horizon from the previously common two years
to three years. There is nothing that in principle prevents an inflation targeter from considering
forecasts beyond a three-year horizon, but in practice there is usually little information about
anything at longer horizons except the tendency to revert to the long-term average.
       What about “leaning against the wind” (as advocated by, for instance, Borio and White (2003)
and Cecchetti, Genberg, and Wadhwani (2002)), the idea that central banks should raise the interest
rate more than what appears to be warranted by inflation and resource utilization to counter rapid
credit growth and rising asset prices? It has sometimes not been quite clear whether advocates of
leaning against the wind mean that credit growth and asset prices should be considered targets and
enter the explicit or implicit loss functions alongside inflation and resource utilization, or whether
they mean that credit growth and asset prices should still be considered just indicators and are
emphasized only because credit growth and asset prices may have potential negative eﬀects on
inflation and resource utilization at a longer horizon. In the latter case, leaning against the wind
is a way to improve the stability of inflation and resource utilization in the longer run. Then it is
completely consistent with flexible inflation targeting.68
       However, in line with the previous discussion, instruments other than interest rates are likely to
be much more eﬀective in avoiding excessive credit growth and asset- price booms, and are therefore
more appropriate to use as a first-best alternative. Interest rates that are high enough to have a
noticeable eﬀect on credit growth and asset prices may have strong negative eﬀects on inflation and
  67
     Walsh (2009b) points out that when financial factors cause distortions, these distortions will in general introduce
corresponding terms in a loss function for monetary policy that is a second-order approximation to household welfare.
Curdia and Woodford (2009) present a model where the second-order welfare approximation is a standard quadratic
loss function of inflation and the output gap between output and potential output, but where potential output is
aﬀected by financial factors. Then inflation and the output gap remain the target variables, with and without financial
factors. The neutral rate in the model, that is, the real rate consistent with output equal to potential output, is then
also aﬀected by financial factors.
  68
      Adrian and Shin (2010a) and Adrian and Shin (2010b) argue, in a model with a risk-taking channel as in
Borio and Zhu (2008), that short interest-rate movements may have considerable eﬀects on the leverage of securities
broker-dealers in the market-based financial sector outside the commercial-banking sector. However, new regulation
may aﬀect the magnitude of these aﬀects, and the size of the market-based financial sector may end up being smaller
after the crisis. In Europe, the commercial banks dominate the financial sector.



                                                          58
resource utilization, and a central bank will probably rarely have suﬃcient information about the
likely beneficial longer-horizon eﬀects on inflation and resource utilization for the trade-oﬀ to be
worthwhile and motivated.69
       In particular, if there is evidence of rapidly rising house prices and mortgage loans, and these
developments are deemed to be unsustainable and a possible bubble, there are much more eﬀective
instruments than policy rates. Restrictions on loan-to-value ratios and requirements of realistic
cash-flow calculations for house buyers with realistic interest rates are much more eﬀective in putting
a break on possible unsustainable developments than a rise in the policy rates. In particular, more
transparency about future policy rates, in the form a policy-rate path published by the central
bank, may help in providing realistic information about future interest rates.
       Suppose, however, that, for some reason, the appropriate and eﬀective instruments to ensure
financial stability are not available, for instance, because of serious problems with the regulatory and
supervisory framework that cannot be remedied in the short run. In such a second-best situation,
if there is a threat to financial stability, one may argue that, to the extent that policy rates do have
an impact on financial stability, that impact should be taken into consideration when choosing the
policy-rate path to best stabilize inflation and resource utilization. Such considerations could result
in a lower or higher policy-rate path than otherwise, in order to trade oﬀ less eﬀective stabilization
of inflation and resource utilization for more financial stability. However, so far all of the evidence
indicates that in normal times that tradeoﬀ is very unfavorable, in the sense that the impact of
policy rates on financial stability is quite small and the impact on inflation and resource utilization
is significantly larger, so an optimal tradeoﬀ would still have little impact on financial stability. A
good financial-stability policy framework is necessary to ensure financial stability. Monetary policy
cannot serve as a substitute.
       Ultimately, my main conclusion from the crisis so far is that flexible inflation targeting, applied
in the right way and using all the information about financial factors that is relevant for the forecast
of inflation and resource utilization at any horizon, remains the monetary policy before, during, and
after the financial crisis that has the best chance to stabilize both inflation and the real economy.
But a better theoretical, empirical and operational understanding of the role of financial factors
in the transmission mechanism is urgently required and needs much work, work that is already
  69
     Kohn (2006) specifies three conditions that should be fulfilled for central banks to take “extra action” to deal
with a possible asset-price bubble: “First, policymakers must be able to identify bubbles in a timely fashion with
reasonable confidence. Second, a somewhat tighter monetary policy must have a high probability that it will help to
check at least some of the speculative activity. And third, the expected improvement in future economic performance
that would result from the curtailment of the bubble must be suﬃciently great.” He concludes, also in Kohn (2008)
and after thorough considerations, that those conditions would rarely be met. See also Kohn (2009).


                                                         59
underway in academia and in central banks.
   The outcome might very well be that financial factors are considered to have a larger role in
aﬀecting the transmission mechanism and as indicators of future inflation and resource utilization.
If so, central banks would end up responding more to financial indicators, in the sense of adjusting
the policy rate and policy-rate path more to a given change in a financial indicator. However,
this would not mean that financial factors and indicators have become independent targets besides
inflation and resource utilization in the explicit or implicit central-bank loss function. Instead,
it would be a matter of responding appropriately to financial indicators in order to achieve over
time the best possible stabilization of inflation around the inflation target and resource utilization
around a normal level.
