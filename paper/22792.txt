E-Cigarette Minimum Legal Sale Age Laws and Traditional Cigarette Use among Rural Pregnant
Teenagers

                                              ABSTRACT

Teenagers under the age of 18 could legally purchase e-cigarettes until states passed e-cigarette minimum
legal sale age laws. These laws may have curtailed pregnant teenagers ability to use e-cigarettes for
smoking cessation and increased prenatal cigarette smoking rates as a result. We investigate the effect
of e-cigarette minimum legal sale age laws on prenatal cigarette smoking and birth outcomes for underage
rural teenagers using data on all births from 2010 to 2016 from 32 states. We find that e-cigarette minimum
legal sale age laws increased prenatal smoking in a given trimester by 0.6 percentage points (pp) overall.
These effects were disproportionately concentrated in pre-pregnancy smokers. There was little evidence
of the laws having any effect on pre-pregnancy non-smokers, suggesting that ENDS MLSAs increased
prenatal smoking rates by reducing cigarette smoking cessation instead of by causing new cigarette
smoking initiation. Our results may indicate an unmet need for assistance with smoking cessation among
pregnant teenagers.

Introduction

       Smoking is one of the leading causes of poor birth outcomes in the United States (U.S.

Department of Health and Human Services, 2014). For this reason, women smokers may be

especially motivated to quit smoking during pregnancy, with subsequent health benefits for

both themselves and their offspring.

       The relatively recent introduction of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) (which

people vape rather than smoke) has provided pregnant women with a smoking cessation

product option similar in some respects to FDA-approved nicotine replacement therapies (e.g.

patch, gum) and smoking cessation medications (e.g. Chantix, Zyban). However, the safety of

using ENDS for smoking cessation during pregnancy has received an inconclusive grade from

the United States Preventive Services Task Force (Siu & Force, 2015). Vaping nicotine during

pregnancy is risky primarily because nicotine, which is in most ENDS, is harmful to the

developing fetus (Royal College of Physicians, 2016).

       Minimum legal sale age (MLSA) laws have long been in place for traditional cigarettes.

While there is evidence that these laws reduce smoking among youth (Ertan Yörük & Yörük,

2016) many youth continue to find ways to evade these laws. For example, in 2016 7.7% of

teens giving birth smoked. One option that pregnant teens may consider to reduce or quit

cigarette smoking during their pregnancy is to use ENDS. If ENDS access is restricted by ENDS

MLSA laws, then the ENDS MLSA laws could have unintended effect of reducing prenatal

smoking cessation. The extent to which pregnant teens switch from cigarette smoking to ENDS,

and the extent to which this switching is reduced by ENDS MLSAs, could indicate an unmet

desire and need for smoking cessation assistance.


                                                2
       The objective of our paper is to evaluate the effect of ENDS MLSAs on prenatal smoking

of traditional cigarettes and on birth outcomes. Our paper is the first to explore the effect of

ENDS MLSAs on pregnant teens’ smoking. A previous study found that among adult pregnant

women living in states that comprehensively banned indoor smoking of traditional cigarettes in

public places, indoor vaping restrictions increased smoking in a given trimester by 2.0

percentage points (pp), or 31% of the mean. However, these indoor vaping restrictions had no

measurable impact on birth outcomes including low birth weight, premature birth, small-for-

gestational age, and Apgar 5 score (Cooper & Pesko, 2017).

       The current paper revisits the important question of the impact of ENDS regulations on

prenatal smoking and birth outcomes using ENDS MLSAs as an alternative source of policy

variation, and focusing on pregnant teens. In addition, we look carefully at which demographic

groups are most affected, and find that the effects are concentrated on rural teens. A second

contribution of our paper is the use of longitudinal data to explore the effects of ENDS MLSAs

on smoking. Four studies have explored this question using cross-sectional two-way fixed

effects models, and there is some disagreement among the estimates. Three of these studies

found that ENDS MLSAs increased teen smoking by approximately 0.8 to 1.0 pp (Dave, Feng, &

Pesko, 2019; Friedman, 2015; Pesko, Hughes, & Faisal, 2016), while a fourth study used

Monitoring the Future data and found that ENDS MLSAs decreased smoking participation of

high school seniors by 2.0 pp (Abouk & Adams, 2017). At least one other study suggests that

ENDS are complements with cigarettes, although within a sample of primarily adult cigarette

smokers (Cotti, Nesson, & Tefft, 2018). Our study will help shed light on this issue using a

longitudinal analysis.


                                                 3
           A key assumption underlying our analysis is that in the absence of ENDS MLSA

restrictions, prenatal smoking would have followed parallel trends in counties with and without

such restrictions. We find that this parallel trends assumption is satisfied for rural areas, and

that within these counties ENDS MLSAs increased smoking in a given trimester by 0.6 pp overall

(4.8% of the mean). These effects are concentrated among teens who smoked in the 3 months

prior to their pregnancy, suggesting that overall rates of prenatal smoking increased because of

reduced smoking cessation rather than new smoking initiation. The parallel trends assumption

is not satisfied for urban and suburban areas, suggesting that we can provide little insight on

the effects of ENDS MLSAs in these areas. We also find little evidence that ENDS MLSAs

affected birth outcomes in any setting, though that may reflect low power to detect effects.

           Our focus on rural areas is important because rural areas account for a disproportionate

share of teen pregnancies: 4.9% of rural 15 to 19 year old females give birth compared to 3.8%

in urban areas and 2.4% in suburban areas. Additionally, since 2007, the rate of teen births has

fallen more slowly in rural counties than in urban and suburban counties, so the gap in teen

birth rates between rural and urban areas is increasing (Hamilton, Rossen, & Branum, 2016).

Prenatal smoking rates are also much higher among rural underage pregnant teens—in 2010

13.7% of rural underage pregnant teens smoked compared to 8.8% in suburban areas and 2.9%

in urban areas.1 Therefore, our focus on rural areas captures a disproportionate share of teen

prenatal smokers.



Background


1
    Based on author calculations using birth record data.

                                                            4
        Pregnant women have a high interest in quitting smoking: 55% of women smoking 3

months before their pregnancy are successfully able to quit smoking during their pregnancy

(Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2015). One study estimated a relatively high

cigarette tax elasticity of demand among pregnant women smokers of 1.0 (Colman, Grossman,

& Joyce, 2003). Despite these high rates of successful quitting during pregnancy, the healthcare

delivery system may not be assisting with smoking cessation during pregnancy as well as it

could. According to data from four states in the 2009-2010 Pregnancy Risk Assessment

Monitoring System, 75.4% of pregnant women receiving prenatal care and still smoking in the

third trimester had been offered counseling, self-help materials, or referral to a state quitline,

but only 19.1% had been specifically advised to use nicotine replacement therapy (NRT)

(Kapaya, Tong, & Ding, 2015). The low rate of NRT prescribing for pregnant women may be

because nicotine is a developmental toxicant that in itself could harm the fetus.2 However,

potential harms to the fetus from NRT should be compared to potential benefits to the fetus

from reduced prenatal smoking. A recent randomized controlled trial found some evidence

(p<0.10) of reductions in prenatal smoking from nicotine patches, and no changes in birth

outcomes (Coleman et al., 2012); however, the precision of the estimates was significantly

limited by low sample sizes and low rates of compliance with the treatment regime. It is also




2
 Pharmacotherapy interventions for tobacco cessation for pregnant women continue to receive an incomplete
grade from the United States Preventive Services Task Force due to uncertain evidence of the overall health
benefits (U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, 2015); however, the Affordable Care Act now requires state Medicaid
programs to cover pharmacotherapies for smoking cessation without cost sharing for pregnant women (Centers
for Medicare & Medicaid Services, 2011) and new private health insurance plans are required to cover smoking
cessation products as well (American Lung Association, 2017).


                                                        5
possible that the use of NRT during pregnancy could reduce the infant’s post-natal exposure to

second hand smoke, but this hypothesis is untested.

       If pregnant women are unsatisfied with the services they are receiving for smoking

cessation through prenatal care, including the lack of nicotine replacement therapy prescribing,

or if these services are not available, they may look elsewhere for help in quitting. Evidence

from a systematic review of randomized controlled trials suggests that ENDS may be effective in

eliminating and reducing cigarette consumption (Hartmann-Boyce et al., 2016). Given low

utilization of nicotine replacement therapy among pregnant women, it is possible that pregnant

women may disproportionately look to ENDS to reduce cigarette consumption.

       Data on ENDS use among pregnant women is limited. The nationally-representative

2013-14 Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health interviewed 388 adult pregnant women,

and of these 13.8% currently smoked, 4.9% currently vaped, and 28.5% of current smokers also

vaped (Kurti et al., 2017). Among women of reproductive age in the same survey, 20.1%

currently smoked, 5.9% currently vaped, and 22.5% of current smokers also vaped (Lopez et al.,

2018). These numbers may provide suggestive evidence of interest among pregnant women in

using ENDS for smoking cessation because while the use of both products fell during pregnancy,

cigarette use fell much more substantially (by approximately 40%) than ENDS use rates

(approximately 17%). Additionally, among smokers, ENDS use rates were higher for pregnant

women than other comparable women (29.2% compared to 22.5%), perhaps because pregnant

women were more likely to try to use ENDS to reduce or quit smoking. One small randomized

controlled trial of pregnant women in Connecticut and Massachusetts who were unable to quit




                                                6
smoking on their own found that 14% vaped during pregnancy, usually in an effort to try to quit

(Oncken et al., 2017).

       Among teens generally, according to two national surveys, 2014 was the first year that

more teens vaped ENDS over the past 30 days than smoked cigarettes (Arrazola et al., 2015;

Miech, Johnston, O'Malley, Bachman, & Schulenberg, 2014). In response to rising ENDS use

among youth, states have enacted ENDS MLSAs to reduce access to ENDS. MLSAs mimic laws

that have long been in place in all states to reduce youth access to conventional tobacco

products. ENDS MLSAs have been rolled out slowly over time. Five states had passed ENDS

MLSAs by the end of 2010, 7 by the end of 2011, 12 by the end of 2012, 24 by the end of 2013,

39 by the end of 2014, and 47 by the end of 2015. By the end of 2016 all states had MLSAs in

place because the Food and Drug Administration's Deeming Rule imposed an ENDS MLSA law of

18 nationally. At this point, only Pennsylvania had not yet passed a state law (Centers for

Disease Control and Prevention, 2018), although Philadelphia passed one in 2014 (New Jersey

Global Advisors Smokefree Policy, 2015). Perhaps due to ENDS MLSA laws, ENDS use rates fell

in 2016 after having risen each year since 2011 (Wang et al., 2018).

       Racial/ethnic groups in rural areas could respond differently to ENDS MLSAs given

heterogeneity in both tobacco use rates and in prenatal care utilization. According to National

Youth Tobacco Survey data from 2011-2015, the past 30-day vaping rate for rural female

middle and high school students was 4.0% for white non-Hispanic teen females, 4.3% for black

non-Hispanic teen females, and 3.6% for Hispanic teen females. According to birth records for

2010, the prenatal smoking rate was substantially higher for rural white underage teens (21.1%)

than for rural black underage teens (3.1%) or for rural Hispanic underage teens (2.4%). Prenatal


                                                7
smoking rates were highest for teens with Medicaid (16.8%) compared to private insurance

(13.1%) or no insurance (7.8%). Thirteen percent of rural underage teens giving birth for the

first time smoked during pregnancy, and 18.6% smoked among those giving birth for the

second time or more.



Data

           We use administrative birth records with geocoded information provided by the

National Center for Health Statistics. The Standard Certificate of Live Birth was revised in 2003

and the revised form was slowly rolled out in different states over time.3 The old form asked

only about smoking at any time during pregnancy. The revised form asks about smoking prior to

pregnancy and in each trimester. The accuracy of cigarette use during pregnancy is significantly

improved in the revised form relative to the old form. For example, Howland et al. (2015) find

that with the old form, maternal smoking agreed with hospital records 84% of the time, but this

agreement improved to 94% with the revised form.

           The introduction of the revised birth record form resulted in statistically significant

increases in reported prenatal smoking in 21 out of 31 states, suggesting that the old form

underreported smoking compared to the revised (Curtin & Mathews, 2016). In addition to the

improved accuracy of the revised form, the collection of trimester-specific smoking information

permits us to exploit within-pregnancy variation in cigarette use in response to ENDS MLSAs in

a panel data analysis. Figure 1 shows the question capturing cigarette use information as it

    All states were using the revised birth records in 2015 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2014).

appears on the revised birth record form. 4 Unfortunately, no information about vaping is

currently collected for birth records.

         We use revised birth records data from 32 states (including D.C.) from 2010 to 2016.5

We exclude individuals residing in or giving birth in 16 states that had not adopted revised birth

records by 2010; however, in a sensitivity analysis we add back seven of these states that had

adopted by 2013. 6 Further, we exclude Georgia and Michigan because information about

cigarette use was missing for multiple years. Finally, we exclude Massachusetts because an

unusually large number of ENDS laws were enacted at the city/town levels (New Jersey Global

Advisors Smokefree Policy, 2015).

         We perform our analysis using teens giving birth before their 18th birthday, so that they

were younger than the ENDS MLSA throughout the full length of their pregnancy. We further

restrict our sample to those teens whose estimated conception date (16 days after pregnancy

week 0 or last menstrual period) was between 1/1/2010 and 1/1/2016.7 We exclude non-

singleton births and a small number of birth certificates with unknown gestational length.

         We match ENDS MLSAs to the start of each trimester for our panel data analysis of

prenatal smoking, or to the start of conception for our cross-sectional analysis of birth

outcomes. 8 We obtain implementation dates of ENDS MLSAs at the state-level from the CDC


4
  The question specifically asks about cigarette smoking and so is unlikely to be confused with ENDS vaping,
especially among teens familiar with these products and their vernacular.
5
  Six of these 32 states were still using unrevised birth records in 2009, and so starting our analysis earlier would
significantly reduce our sample. Further, the time period 2010-2016 nicely encompasses almost all of the variation
in ENDS MLSAs. The first state (New Hampshire) in our study enacted an ENDS MLSA law in July, 2010.
6
  These states are AK, AL, AR, AZ, CT, HI, LA, ME, MN, MS, NC, NJ, RI, VA, WI, and WV.
7
  This strategy avoids bias arising from our sample being more likely to contain premature births at the end of our
data, since only at the point of birth is a birth certificate generated.
8
  Using the month of birth information (provided in the birth records), we assume that the infant was born at the
mid-point of the month recorded in the birth record. We then use gestational length in weeks (also provided in the
birth records), to identify the estimated point of conception and the start of the three trimesters. The first

State System (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2018) and from the National

Conference of State Legislatures (National Conference of State Legislatures, 2016). We obtained

county-level MLSAs from a white paper (New Jersey Global Advisors Smokefree Policy, 2015).

Appendix Table 1 shows the states in our sample and the dates of their respective ENDS MLSAs.

It also shows all county-level ENDS MLSAs that we used in our analysis. Appendix Figure 1

shows maps of the states and counties adopting the ENDS MLSAs at different points in time.9

        Counties where the birth occurred are identified as urban/suburban or rural using the

2013 Urban-Rural Classification Scheme for Counties (Centers for Disease Control and

Prevention, 2013). This ordinal, six-level scheme codes counties as (1) large central metro, (2)

large fringe metro, (3) medium metro, (4) small metro, (5) micropolitan, and (6) noncore.

Counties coded level 1 were classified as urban, counties coded levels 2-4 were classified as

suburban, and counties coded levels 5 and 6 were classified as rural.

        We control for other tobacco control policies including cigarette tax rates and indoor

smoking and vaping restrictions in private workplace, bars, and restaurants. We match these

controls to the point of conception for our cross-sectional analysis, or to the start of the

trimester for our panel data analysis. We obtained state-level cigarette policy data (taxes and

indoor air laws) from the CDC State System (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,

2018). 10 For the ENDS indoor vaping restrictions, we obtained state, county, and municipality




trimester is defined as the point of ovulation that led to pregnancy. The second trimester is defined as week 14 of
pregnancy (14 weeks after last menstrual period). And the third trimester is defined as week 28 of pregnancy.

  Two states (MT and OR) passed ENDS MLSA’s on 1/1/2016. This policy variation is used in panel models, affecting
2nd and 3rd trimester smoking for women conceiving in late 2015.
10
   We do not control for ENDS taxes because DC was the only state out of our 32 state sample that adopted an
ENDS tax by the trimester start date for women conceiving on or before January 1, 2016, and we do not use DC in
our preferred sample of rural counties.

information from the American Non-Smokers Rights Foundation, which we used to calculate

the percent of the population covered by bans on vaping in private workplaces, bars, and

restaurants (Cooper & Pesko, 2017).

         Descriptive statistics are reported in Table 1 for all underage pregnant teens and in

Appendix Table 2 for only rural underage pregnant teens. The first columns show descriptive

statistics for pregnant teens for whom an ENDS MLSA was not in place at any point during the

pregnancy, the second columns show descriptive statistics for pregnant teens for whom an

ENDS MLSA came into place between 3 months prior to conception and birth, and the third

columns show descriptive statistics for pregnant teens from whom an ENDS MLSA was in place

before 3 months prior to conception. Smoking rates were lowest in each trimester of pregnancy

for mothers who were fully treated by ENDS MLSA laws, but since these records are more

recent on average, this decline could be due to general declines in prenatal smoking rates over

time. Table 1 shows that among teens who smoked in the three months prior to pregnancy,

55.1% of treated teens were still smoking in the third trimester of pregnancy compared to

54.5% of partially treated teens, and 51.5% of fully treated teens. These statistics suggest that

ENDS MLSAs decreased prenatal smoking cessation. Appendix Table 2 shows that in rural areas,

smoking rates were lower for partially treated and fully treated teens than for non-treated

teens.

         We also provide descriptive statistics for outcomes (birth weight, low birth weight, very

low birthweight, gestational length premature birth, very premature birth, APGAR 5 score,

small-for-gestational age, and weight gain during pregnancy), demographic variables

(race/ethnicity, age, health insurance, and order of birth) and tobacco control policies (cigarette


                                                 11
     taxes and cigarette/ENDS indoor air laws), all of which could be correlated with both adoption

     of ENDS MLSA laws and with prenatal smoking. Table 1 and Appendix Table 2 show that

     women who were partially or fully treated were more likely to be on Medicaid, less likely to be

     black, and less likely to have low birth weight and premature babies than mothers who were

     untreated. We control for differing maternal characteristics in our regressions by using either

     pregnancy fixed effects (for panel data models) or maternal characteristics (for cross-sectional

     models).



     Methods

                      In our primary analysis, we exploit the impact of ENDS MLSAs on smoking during

     pregnancy using a panel data analysis. The panel data regressions have the following

     specification:



(1) 𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝑎𝑎 + 𝛽𝛽1 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 + 𝛽𝛽2 𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 + 𝛽𝛽3 𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 + ɣ𝑖𝑖 + ɣ𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 +

     𝑒𝑒𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ,



     where icspt indexes period p (either the three months prior to pregnancy or in each trimester),

     for pregnant teen i living in county c of state s of year-month t in which the period began. The

     smoking dependent variable takes one of three forms: 1) any smoking during the period in

     question; 2) moderate or heavy smoking (average daily cigarettes smoked ≥ 5), and 3) heavy

     smoking (average daily cigarettes smoked ≥ 10). By comparing the effect of ENDS MLSA laws on




                                                                            12
different intensities of smoking we can ask whether there was heterogeneity in the effects of

the laws on different types of smokers.

         We control for pregnancy fixed effects (ɣ𝑖𝑖 ) in order to remove individual-level

heterogeneity and we control for trimester-by-year-by-month fixed effects (ɣ𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 ) in order to

remove heterogeneity unique to trimesters starting at different points in time. From the start

of the period p, we also control for time-varying tobacco control policies including cigarette

taxes, smoking indoor use laws in private workplaces, restaurants, and bars 11, and the percent

of the population covered by vaping indoor use laws for the same three locations. Our

coefficient of primary interest is β1 which shows how ENDS MLSAs that were enacted during a

given pregnancy caused changes in cigarette use beyond the normal declines expected as

pregnancy progresses. We expect this relationship to be positive if ENDS are substitutes for

traditional cigarette use, and negative if they are complements. We do not control for county

fixed effects because we only observe one location per pregnancy; therefore, pregnancy fixed

effects control for location.

         We also modify equation (1) to perform an event study (Autor, 2003) to ask whether our

results are impacted by time varying omitted variables bias. We replace the previous ENDS

MLSA indicator variable with a set of mutually exclusive policy leads and lags that divide the

time period into these categories: trimester started >30 months before the MLSA was passed,

21-30 months before, 12-21 months before, 3-12 months before (reference), 0-3 months

before (e.g. law was passed within this trimester), 0-9 months after, and >9 months after.




11
  We control for each tobacco type/venue separately using indicators for no restrictions, partial restrictions, or full
restrictions.

                                                          13
Outside of including these mutually exclusive policy leads and lags instead of the standard DD

variable, the resulting equation is identical to (1). In this event study specification, the policy

leads provide evidence about whether within-pregnancy smoking rates were changing among

pregnant teens prior to passage of ENDS MLSAs, which would suggest time-varying omitted

variables bias or anticipatory behaviors.

       We estimate separate models for pre-pregnancy smokers and pre-pregnancy non-

smokers. Given that women are highly motivated to quit smoking during pregnancy, we

hypothesize that ENDS MLSA laws will have no effect on smoking initiation among pre-

pregnancy non-smokers. Instead, we expect to find all of the effect of ENDS MLSAs

concentrated among teens who were smoking prior to their pregnancy. We hypothesize that

these teens may try to use ENDS as a smoking cessation product. Nicotine replacement therapy

is only available via a prescription and many healthcare providers are reluctant to prescribe it to

pregnant patients; therefore, in the absence of an ENDS MLSA law, the pregnant teen smoker

may be highly incentivized to legally buy an ENDS to try to use it for prenatal smoking cessation.

When that opportunity is eliminated by an ENDS MLSA law, the pregnant teen may be more

likely to continue to prenatally smoke. By focusing on the effect of ENDS MLSAs separately for

pre-pregnancy smokers and non-smokers, we hope to shed light on this possible mechanism.

       We also estimate separate models for groups defined by demographic characteristics

and urban/rural location, since these groups may be expected to have different access to

prenatal care and smoking cessation services. First, we estimate stratified models by

urban/suburban and then rural counties to investigate the crucial identifying assumption of

parallel trends in smoking for the treatment and control groups prior to the passage of ENDS


                                                  14
MLSAs. We find evidence of parallel pre-trends only for rural counties, suggesting that there

were unobserved factors affecting teens differentially in urban/suburban areas adopting ENDS

MLSAs.

         One possible explanation for the diverging trends for urban/suburban counties, is that

the composition of teen births was rapidly changing in the former but not for rural counties.

This hypothesis is explored in Appendix Tables 3 and 4. In Appendix Table 3, we find that ENDS

MLSAs were associated with more births to underage teens in urban and suburban counties,

but not in rural counties. In Appendix Table 4, we show that underage teen birth rates were

diverging between urban/suburban and rural counties leading up to passage of ENDS MLSA

laws. The two policy lead coefficients are jointly significant, p=0.083 for urban counties and

p=0.006 for suburban counties. Individual coefficients for suburban counties are also both

statistically significant. For rural counties, however, trends appear to be parallel based on the

small individual coefficients for the policy leads and the joint test of significance.

         Appendix Table 3 shows that ENDS MLSAs were associated with 5.0 extra underage teen

births per county-by-year/month in urban counties (13.5% of the mean p<0.05), 0.3 extra teen

births in suburban counties (6.1% of the mean, p<0.01), but only 0.02 extra teen births in rural

counties (1.2% of the mean, not statistically significant). These compositional differences may

bias the effect of ENDS MLSAs on prenatal smoking. Taken together, these estimates suggest

that changes on the composition of teens giving birth in urban/suburban counties make it

difficult to measure the impact of ENDS MLSA laws on prenatal smoking. However, we did not

detect evidence of compositional changes in rural counties, nor did we detect evidence of non-

parallel trends for rural counties; therefore, we focus on rural counties for the remaining


                                                  15
     analyses. 12 We also stratify rural counties by white non-Hispanics, black non-Hispanics,

     Hispanics, first births, and mothers on Medicaid given that these populations have different

     prenatal tobacco use rates and prenatal healthcare utilization.

                Finally, we also estimate the effects of ENDS MLSAs on birth outcomes in a cross-

     sectional DD specification. We cannot use a panel data analysis for birth outcomes since we

     have just one birth outcome per pregnancy (compared to four smoking observations per

     pregnancy). For this analysis, we estimate the following equation:



(2) 𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏ℎ 𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝑎𝑎 + 𝛽𝛽1 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 + 𝛽𝛽2 𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 + 𝛽𝛽3 𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑒𝑒𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 + 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖 +

     ɣ𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 + ɣ𝑡𝑡 + 𝑒𝑒𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ,



     In equation (2) individual fixed effects are replaced with a vector of individual characteristics

     including: mother's race, age dummies (≤14, 15, 16, 17), payment source (e.g. Medicaid, private

     insurance, self pay) 13, and the birth order of her current birth (1, 2, […] 7, ≥8). We continue to

     control for cigarette taxes as well as indoor air laws affecting cigarettes and ENDS use in

     restaurants, bars, and private workplaces (from point of gestation). We also control for month-

     year of gestation and county fixed effects. The birth outcomes that we model are continuous

     birthweight, low birthweight (<2,500 grams), very low birth weight (<1,500 grams), weeks of

     gestation, premature birth (<37 weeks), very premature birth (<32 weeks), small-for-gestational


     12
        A synthetic control group model could in theory also be used to establish parallel trends, but these models
     require significant pre-adoption data. Using data from before 2010 would cause us to lose a considerable number
     of states that were not using revised birth records before then. Therefore, we believe our approach of selecting a
     group of counties that does exhibit parallel trends is the strongest feasible methodology.
     13
        Payment method also helps control for the mother’s economic condition. Besides payment source, birth records
     do not provide any direct information on the teen’s employment status, income, or economic support.

                                                                             16
age (25th percentile weight for a given length of gestation), Apgar 5 score, and weight gain

during pregnancy.

           The coefficient of primary interest β1 from equation (2) represents an average of two

competing effects. β1 could suggest worse birth outcomes if ENDS MLSAs cause more pregnant

teens to smoke and if smoking is more dangerous than vaping to the developing fetus.

Alternatively, β1 could suggest better birth outcomes if ENDS MLSAs increase complete

abstinence from nicotine by reducing stand-alone vaping. Hence, the net effect of ENDS MLSAs

on birth outcomes is ambiguous and requires empirical investigation. ENDS indoor vaping

restrictions were found to have no effect on birth outcomes for adult pregnant women,

potentially because these effects cancelled each other out (Cooper & Pesko, 2017). The current

paper provides an opportunity to explore the effect of a different type of ENDS regulation on

birth outcomes, and extends the literature by looking at the effects on rural teens, a group who

are often neglected.

           All regressions are estimated using linear models. Standard errors are clustered at the

level of the county given that this is the lowest geographical level at which ENDS MLSAs were

adopted; however, for our difference-in-difference model results we also present p-values

clustering by health service areas (HSAs), which are defined by the National Center for Health

Statistics to be 808 groups of single counties or cluster of contiguous counties which are

relatively self-contained with respect to hospital care. 14

           This alternative clustering at the HSA level is intended to capture omitted factors due to

the available health care. Since it is possible that there might also be common factors at the

state level, (though we have tried to control for some of these by considering other policies, like

taxes, that occur at the state level), we have presented two additional analyses (Appendix

Tables 6 and 7) that use alternative clustering at the state level. In Appendix Table 6, we added

back 7 states that had revised their birth records by 2013 and performed the analysis from

2013-2016. In Appendix Table 7, we estimate models starting from 2010 but relax the

restriction used in our baseline models that states must have revised by 2010. This change

increases the number of clusters to 48. The coefficients are quite stable across these two

models, and with a larger number of clusters we find statistically significant estimates at

p<0.10, for rural smoking participation when using the sample from 2013-2016 and for rural

white smoking participation when using the sample from 2010-2016 and allowing late

entrants.15



Results

          The top of Table 2 shows results from equation (1) using smoking participation within a

given period (3 months before pregnancy or in a given trimester) as our outcome. Overall, Table

2 shows that the passage of ENDS MLSAs is associated with increases in within-pregnancy

smoking participation by a modest 0.2 pp for all pregnant teens (p<0.05, 3.2% of the mean).

This significant effect is driven by a 0.6 pp increase in smoking for rural pregnant teens (p<0.05,

4.8% of the mean). In the rural sample, white pregnant teens increased smoking by 4.4% of the



15
  The main limitation of using either of these alternative samples for our baseline analysis is that then we would
not be able to explore pre-trends using event study design, either because of insufficient pre-policy variation for
the sample from 2013-2016 or because of states entering the sample at different points in time when using the
2010-2016 sample. Therefore, we maintain the 2010-2016 sample that imposes the restriction that states must
have revised their birth records by 2010 as the baseline.

mean (p<0.10), black pregnant teens increased smoking by 11.1% of the mean (p>0.10),

pregnant teens on Medicaid increased smoking by 4.5% (p<0.05), and teens giving birth for the

first time increased smoking by 4.3% (p<0.10).

       The middle section of Table 2 shows that ENDS MLSAs increased moderate and heavy

smoking in rural areas by 0.5 pp (5.3%, p<0.10), which is similar to the 0.6 pp increase (4.8%)

found for any smoking. The bottom section suggests a 0.3 pp increase in heavy smoking

(p>0.10, 4.5% of the mean). The similarities in these percent reductions suggests that ENDS

MLSAs increased cigarette use among all type of smokers.

       Table 3 and Figure 2 shows disaggregated difference-in-difference event study results

for any smoking participation. These estimates ask whether within-pregnancy smoking patterns

were changing in the time period leading up to or after ENDS MLSA adoption. We also show the

same event study coefficients graphically in Figure 2 and in Appendix Figure 2 and 3. This

specification shows evidence of non-parallel trends for all teens and for urban/suburban

pregnant teens, since the coefficients on the three policy leads are jointly statistically significant

for all pregnant teens (p=0.020) and for urban/ suburban pregnant teens (p=0.016). The

direction of the coefficients suggests that traditional cigarette use was declining in the pre-

adoption period for the treatment group relative to the control group, suggesting that the

positive but small DD coefficients we observe in Table 2 are actually underestimated. As

discussed earlier, these non-parallel trends may be driven by changes in the composition of

who gives birth before and after ENDS MLSAs came into place.

       For rural pregnant teens, coefficients in the pre-adoption period are all individually and

jointly statistically insignificant. The coefficients are estimated to be zero in the two periods of


                                                 19
time leading up to ENDS MLSA adoption. This result provides evidence that the parallel trends

assumption is satisfied for rural pregnant teens, giving us confidence that the 0.6 pp increase in

within-pregnancy smoking we observed for rural pregnant teens in Table 2 is not biased by

uncontrolled time-varying heterogeneity.

           The coefficients in the post period suggest a particularly persistent effect for black

teens. For black teens, smoking participation increased by 1.3 pp (p<0.10) in the trimester in

which the ENDS MLSA came into effect (compared to 3-12 months before), by 1.5 pp (p>0.10)

in the trimester starting 0-9 months after the ENDS MLSA came into effect, and by 2.8 pp

(p<0.05) in trimesters >9 months after the ENDS MLSA came into effect. However, the period of

time >9 months after MLSA should be interpreted cautiously because late adopting counties do

not contribute variation to this coefficient. Rural white teens also experienced approximately a

1.0 pp increase in smoking participation in the periods 0-9 months after the ENDS MLSA came

into effect and >9 months after.

           In Appendix Table 6, we re-estimate the difference-in-difference model using the time

period starting in 2013 rather than 2010. This permits us to add in seven states that revised their

birth record form between 2010-2013 (see Appendix Table 1 for a list of these states), three of

which enacted MLSAs before 2013 and four of which enacted MLSAs during or after 2013,

providing 39 states in total. ENDS MLSAs may have a larger effect on smoking during pregnancy

in this period since ENDS were generally more popular in the later period, with their use peaking

in 2015 before declining in 2016 (Wang et al., 2018). 16 We do find a slightly higher but generally

comparable point estimate of 0.7 pp increase in smoking for rural underage pregnant women


16
     While outside the time period of this study, ENDS use did peak again in 2018 (Cullen et al., 2018).

when using the sample from 2013-2016 compared to a 0.6 pp increase when using the sample

from 2010-2016.

       In Appendix Table 7, we revert to starting the analysis in 2010 but do not impose the

restriction that states needed to revise their birth records by that point in time. This increases

our number of states to 48 (44 of which have rural counties). Three of the nine additional states

we added from the analysis in Appendix Table 6 adopted ENDS MLSAs after revising their birth

records. The sample sizes increased from 210,540 pregnancy-period observations in Table 2 to

273,184 pregnancy-period observations in Appendix Table 7, but the effects for rural women (0.6

pp) and rural, white women (0.8 pp) remain exactly the same. The estimates did change from 0.5

pp to -0.0 pp for rural black women, however, suggesting mixed evidence of the effect of ENDS

MLSAs for this population.

       Tables 4 and 5 stratify the baseline results (Table 2) by pregnant teens who smoked in

the three months prior to their pregnancy and those who did not. If ENDS MLSAs affect

prenatal smoking primarily by impacting smoking cessation rather than by affecting smoking

initiation, then ENDS MLSAs will have no effect on traditional cigarette use among teens who

were not already smoking prior to their pregnancies, but ENDS MLSAs could have large impacts

on teens who were smoking prior to their pregnancies by affecting their ability to quit.

       The estimates support this hypothesis. ENDS MLSAs had virtually no effect on teens

who were non-smokers prior to pregnancy and had sizable effects (although sometimes

imprecisely estimated) on rural smokers prior to pregnancy. For example, ENDS MLSAs




                                               21
increased smoking with a given trimester by 2.5 pp (p<0.10, 3.4% of the mean) among rural

pregnant teens who smoked in the three months prior to their pregnancy. 17

        Table 6 shows estimates of the effects of ENDS MLSAs on birth outcomes for all rural

teens. These estimates are from equation (2). ENDS MLSAs may improve birth outcomes by

reducing overall nicotine exposure from traditional cigarettes and ENDS combined, but they

could also harm birth outcomes by reducing smoking cessation and hence increasing exposure

to the other toxicants besides nicotine that are present in traditional cigarettes. Given the

conflicting direction in which ENDS MLSAs could impact birth outcomes, as well as the relatively

small 0.6 pp increase in prenatal smoking, we likely have limited power to detect statistically

significant effects. 18

        There is in fact little evidence of any significant effect on birth outcomes among all rural

teens. While very premature birth declined by 0.6 pp (p<0.05), the coefficient on gestational

length is positive, so there is no consistent evidence that ENDS MLSAs affected gestation. In

Appendix Table 8 we restrict the sample to just rural white teens, since they experienced the

largest increase in smoking. 19 None of the coefficients are statistically significant in this

subsample.



17
   We also estimated the same model for only rural pre-pregnancy “heavy” smokers (>=10 cigarettes daily). While
we have only 928 rural pre-pregnancy heavy smokers in our sample, the coefficients were larger here, suggesting
that ENDS MLSAs disproportionately reduced smoking reduction and cessation among the heaviest pre-pregnancy
smokers. ENDS MLSAs increased any smoking participation in a given trimester by 3.2 pp (p<0.10) for pre-
pregnancy heavy smokers, increased medium/heavy smoking participation by 3.5 pp (p<0.10) for pre-pregnancy
heavy smokers, and increased heavy smoking participation by 2.0 pp (p>0.10) for pre-pregnancy heavy smokers.
18
   For example, the Surgeon General suggests that smoking reduces birth weight by between 200-300 grams (U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services, 2014). In our case we observe a 0.6 pp increase in smoking from the
law then we can expect a 0.6 pp x 250 = 1.5 gram reduction in birth weight (ignoring any compensating benefit
from reducing vaping), which compared to a sample mean of 3,196 is far smaller than the size of the confidence
interval for the effect of ENDS MLSAs on birth weight.
19
   In 2010, 30.3% of national births to underage white teens were in rural areas.

is provided in Table 7 and Figure 3. Similar results for rural white only are provided in Appendix

Table 9 and Appendix Figure 4.



Discussion

       This paper suggests that increases in teen prenatal cigarette smoking may be an

unintended consequence of ENDS MLSAs among rural teens. Increases in prenatal smoking

were entirely accounted for by pre-pregnancy smokers, suggesting that the mechanism through

which ENDS MLSAs affected prenatal smoking was by reducing smoking cessation rather than

by causing new initiation of cigarette smoking during pregnancy. The results from this paper are

broadly consistent with, although of a smaller magnitude, than the results in Pesko and Cooper

(2017) which explored the effect of ENDS indoor vaping restrictions on adult prenatal smoking.

       Our best estimate of a 0.6 pp increase in smoking in a given trimester among rural teens

is slightly smaller than previous estimates for teens generally (not specifically rural, nor

pregnant) from cross-sectional difference-in-differences models. Three other studies found that

ENDS MLSAs increased teen smoking by approximately 0.8 to 1.0 pp (Dave et al., 2019;

Friedman, 2015; Pesko et al., 2016), while a fourth study used Monitoring the Future data to

find that ENDS MLSAs decreased high school senior smoking participation by 2.0 pp (Abouk &

Adams, 2017). One reason that our estimate may be smaller than those in the first three

studies is that our results are for a subset of women rather than for both men and women, and

women generally have lower tobacco use rates than men.




                                                 23
         One limitation of our study is that we are unable to look at the future health of the

mother and their infants. Teens who miss an opportunity to quit smoking during pregnancy

may be less likely to quit smoking later in life leading to greater health risks to both themselves

and to their infants. While 55% of women quit smoking during pregnancy, 40% of these

mothers have historically relapsed within 6 months of giving birth (Centers for Disease Control

and Prevention, 2015). If ENDS could help reduce both prenatal smoking and postnatal smoking

(by preventing relapse), then the reduction in postnatal smoking from ENDS MLSAs could be a

significant mechanism through which these laws affect population health. However, this is a

hypothesis that we are unable to explore using birth certificate data.

         We are also unable to look at future health of the infant. Higher postnatal smoking rates

could adversely impact infant health through higher secondhand smoke exposure. The Surgeon

General concluded that while ENDS aerosol is not harmless, it generally contains fewer

toxicants than combustible tobacco products (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services,

2016).

         A strength of our study is that we exploit the trimester-specific smoking information

provided in revised birth records to examine the within-pregnancy effects of ENDS MLSAs.

However, a second limitation of our study is that birth records have no information about

vaping, so we are unable to examine this behavior directly. With the increasing use of ENDS,

states should consider adding ENDS use information to the birth records. Additionally, states

may wish to consider adding questions on smoking cessation behavior, such as through the use

of nicotine replacement therapy.




                                                 24
       Our study suggests that there may be a high unmet demand among pregnant rural

teenage women for smoking cessation products, which is why we believe that some turn to

vaping. Pregnancy may provide a unique window when women are open to guidance about

resources and products available to help them to quit smoking. In the absence of such

guidance, pregnant women may be more likely to use ENDS. Tobacco cessation

pharmacotherapy interventions for pregnant women have received an “incomplete” grade

from the United States Preventive Services Task Force due to uncertain evidence about their

overall health benefits (U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, 2015). There may be substantial

value in encouraging pregnant women's use of tobacco cessation interventions to reduce

prenatal smoking, and in physicians providing counselling and assistance to pregnant women

who are trying to quit smoking.
