               The Poverty of Widows: Future Prospects




                              ABSTRACT



     I estimate the fraction of widows that will be in poverty by
projecting the economic status, as measured in 1979, of a cohort of
the elderly. The projections are based on an economic model of
consumption behavior. I define and estimate a consumption—based
measure of poverty status that, I believe, is more appropriate for
the elderly than the usual income—based measure.

    According to the projections, the fraction of widows in
poverty should not incerase substantially as the 1979 cohort ages.
However, the fraction in poverty depends critically on the
definition: the differences between the consumption— and income—
based measures are large. But even more important is the valuation
put on Medicare/Medicaid: for two reasonable valuations, the
fractions in poverty are very different.

 I.   Introduction


      Although the economic well-being of the elderly has improved

substantially over the past several decades, a high fraction of the
elderly, especially of widows, is still in poverty. One might hope
that as today's elderly population ages further this fraction will
decline because the young elderly come from cohorts with

substantially higher lifetime earnings than the cohorts of the old
elderly. The purpose of this paper is to study the likelihood this
will happen. The approach is to examine a number of the factors
that will influence the fraction in poverty, and to forecast how
the fraction will change in the future.

      One method to forecast the fraction of the elderly in poverty
would be to study trends in income, and apply the trends to the
incomes of each age group. This would amount to forecasting the
future economic status of today's young elderly from the economic
status of today's old elderly and from trends in income. But this
method is not likely to be reliable for a number of reasons.
First, each cohort has had different lifetime earnings and rates of
return on their savings: therefore, the current economic status of
today's old elderly is probably not a useful guide to the current
or future economic status of today's young elderly. Second, the
elderly have had substantial changes in Social Security and
Medicare/Medicaid whereas both of these programs will probably be
stable in the future. Third, changes in mortality rates will mean
that poverty rates of the young elderly will eventually be higher
                               Page 2


than a trend analysis would indicate. Finally, a trend analysis
can only answer a limited number of questions because it is not
based on an economic model: for example, it cannot say how the
poverty rate would change in response to a change in Social
Security because it does not model how the il'idividuals would

respond to such a change.
     In this paper I forecast the poverty rates of the elderly by
using an economic model of consumption. The parameters of the
model have been estimated from panel data. The model takes as
initial conditions the resources of retirement—aged couples and
individuals. Given those resources, the model predicts what
consumption will be in each future time period. Thus one can trace
out the future path of consumption, wealth and income of each
individual and couple. This method has a number of advantages. It
is based on observed behavior, and is founded on economic theory.
Because it forecasts the consumption of individuals, it provides
details on the distribution of consumption, income and wealth, not
just on the means. It can be used to study changes in poverty
rates in response to changes in the environment, Finally, it can
be used to define a consumption—based measure of poverty, that, I
believe, is more appropriate for the elderly than the usual income—
based measure.



II. Forecasting the Economic Status of the Elderly

     The future economic status of a cohort of the elderly depends
on initial economic resources, the future economic environment, the
                                Page 3


 choices the individuals make, and future random events. The

 problem is simplified considerably if one considers only people who
 have retired because their economic resources are known:

 forecasting the future economic status of workers is complicated
 because the resources of workers depend on future wage growth and
 labor force participation. Furthermore, many of the elderly have a

rather stable economic environment because most of their assets

 (housing, Social Security and Medicare/Medicaid) are indexed.
Indeed, the elderly apparently were better protected against the
fall in real income during the 1970s than the rest of the
population [Hurd and Shoven, 1983).
     In this paper I concentrate on forecasting how the economic
status of the elderly changes as a result of their consumption
decisions. I take as initial conditions the distribution of

resources, ages, and household structure in the 1979 Retirement
History Survey (RHS). Using a utility-based model of consumption
behavior that I have estimated over ten year of data from the RHS,

I forecast the consumption and wealth trajectories of each
household in the RNS. Each household will, with a probability that
is based on the mortality tables, produce households of different

composition in each future period. Thus the number of households
defined by composition and assets grows each time period but the

weight attached to each type shrinks. From the forecasts, a future
population of the elderly is generated. It is the elderly
population that would be found in a steady-state economy in which
each cohort reaches the age of the 1979 RHS   population   with the
                                 Page 4


distributions of assets and household composition of the 1979 RHS.

From this standing population I study the distribution of assets,
consumption and poverty status at each age. Of course, an
alternative statement is that the forecasts are of the 1979 RHS
                                              -
population at each future age.
     The method of this paper has the advantage that it
distinguishes how much poverty is due to initial conditions and how
much is due to life cycle behavior after retirement. It has the
further advantage that a consumption—based measure of economic
well—being comes naturally from the calculations. This is
especially important for the elderly because income, the usual
measure, is not a good measure of their economic position: life
cycle considerations indicate that at some age they will consume
part of their capital. Although wealth is probably a better
measure of economic position than income, it is not completely
satisfactory either because of the importance of Social Security
and other annuities: when they are exogenous it is not obvious how
to aggregate them with bequeathable wealth.
     The model that is used to forecast consumption and wealth is
based on utility maximization under uncertainty about the date of
death. The utility maximization problem can be solved for singles
but not for couples because the utility function of couples changes
depending on the future mortality realizations. Although the
consumption model is appropriate for studying the future economic
status of the 1979 widows in the RHS, by itself it cannot be used
to forecast the poverty status of widows because the couples will
                                Page 5


 generate new widows as they age, and in order to project the
 economic status of the new widows, their initial conditions must be

 known. My ad hoc solution is to assume that couple consume their
 bequeathable wealth at the average rate that was observed over
 retired couples in the ten years of the RHS.- This rate was 0.016
per year.

      Because the forecasts depend on the quality of the model and
the parameter estimates, I discuss in the Appendix the
specification and estimation of the economic model. More details

can be found in my paper "Mortality Risk and Bequests." Here I
briefly outline the ideas behind the consumption model.

     Suppose a retired individual wants to maximize lifetime
utility when the date of death is uncertain. Utility depends on

consumption each time period and on any bequests he might leave
should he die. Economic resources are initial bequeathable wealth,
and annuities, which include Social Security, Medicare/Medicaid,

and private pensions. It can be shown that the solution to this

utility maximization problem implies that desired consumption will
depend on the parameters of the utility function, mortality rates,

bequeathable wealth, the entire time path of annuities and the
strength of the bequest motive. I used the solution to the
utility-maximization problem along with data from the ten years of
the RHS to estimate the parameters of the utility function. Given
the parameters, the economic resources and the utility—based model,
I can forecast the future consumption and wealth paths of each
individual in the RHS.
                              Page 6




III. Forecasting Consumption and Wealth

     The consumption and wealth of each single person in the 1979
RHS can be projected given the estimated model and initial

conditions by solving equations (5) of the Appendix. The initial
conditions are real annuities, which include Social Security
benefits and Medicare/Medicaid, nominal annuities, which include

pensions, bequeathable wealth, and the path of mortality rates
which are defined by age, race and sex. There are two types of
solutions depending on which of the parameter estimates are used in
the solution. As explained in the Appendix, the different sets of
parameter estimates come from different estimation methods. The
first type of solution which I call the NLLS solution is
illustrated in figure 1. The second type which I call the NL2SLS
is shown in figure 2. The NLLS path of consumption quickly falls
so that bequeathable wealth is exhausted for most people at an
early age. The NL2SLS path of consumption is much flatter and
wealth lasts to a greater age. Regardless of which estimates are
used, the wealth and consumption paths of all the 1979 single

people will, when weighted by the probabilities of living, give the
expected distributions of wealth and consumption not only at each
year but also across years.

     Table 1 shows, for the 1979 RHS widows, the means and medians
of consumption, wealth and income every two years from 1979 through
                               Page 7

 1999.1 Part A, based on the NLLS estimates, has consumption and
 wealth paths like those of figure 1. The widows are poor to begin
with, and rapidly become poorer. By 1989 median bequeathable
wealth has fallen to zero, so that at least half of the surviving
widows will live from their annuity income only. By 1999 mean
bequeathable wealth is essentially zero; therefore, all
observations will have exhausted their bequeathable wealth.

     Regardless of what the definition of poverty is, it is obvious

that, according to these projections, these surviving widows will
be poor. It will be useful, however, to make an estimate of the
fraction in poverty in each year. The BLS defines poverty
according to observed income. For the elderly there are at least
two weaknesses to this definition. First, if the rate of inflation
is positive, using nominal income from capital implies real capital
decumulation because the interest rate that is used to calculate
the income is nominal. Thus, the welfare implications of nominal
income are obscured. Second, according to the life cycle
hypothesis income of the elderly is not a good welfare indicator
because some wealth should be consumed at advanced ages. I use two

measures to calculate the fraction below poverty. The first, an


     -i include housing wealth in these simulations because the
simulations should give a good idea of the economic status of the
elderly. A reasonable supposition is that housing wealth declines
over long periods at the same rate as other bequeathable wealth.
An alternative method would be exclude housing wealth from the
simulations, and to impute a consumption value to the stock. The
parameters used in the forecasts are those from the NLLS
estimation.
                               Page 8

income—based measure, is the sum of annuities and real income from
capital. I use a real rate of 0.03. The second is consumption.
For singles consumption is estimated from the utility model. For
couples, consumption is the sum of annuities, real income from
capital and the change in capital. Because o-f the ad hoc
assumption about the trajectory of the capital stock of couples,
the estimate of consumption for couples reduces to the sum of
annuities and 4.6% of capital. I take the poverty levels to be
those given by the BLS: $3479 for one person over the age of 65,
and $4388 for two persons over the age of 65, both figures in 1979
dollars.
     Any measure of the welfare of the elderly must address the
problem of placing a value on Medicare/Medicaid. The program
certainly is of some value: were there no such program, the
elderly would spend more of their own wealth on medical care.
Rather than speculate about the value, I present two sets of
consumption and income measures. The first follows Hurd and Shoven
(1983): it includes a value roughly equal to the average transfer

through the Medicare/Medicaid system to each eligible person. The
idea is that the transfer is the value of a fair medical insurance
policy which is given each year to those eligible. The second set
of results excludes any valuation for Medicare/Medicaid.
     According to the income—based measure of poverty that includes
Medicare/Medicaid, the fraction of 1979 RHS widows in poverty
begins at a high level and rises slowly as wealth is decumulated.
It eventually reaches 38%. Because mean wealth is zero, the
                                Page 9


 fraction in poverty will not change further: all the widows that
 are below the poverty line will remain in poverty and all above
 will remain out of poverty. The consumption—based measure shows

 the fraction in poverty starting at a modest level but eventually
 reaching the same point as the income—based level. This happens,
 of course, because when bequeathable wealth is exhausted,

consumption equals annuity income.
      If Medicare/Medicaid is excluded the results change

substantially: the fractions in poverty are much higher at the
beginning, and they reach very high levels. Again, however, there
are large differences in the early years between the consumption—
based and income based measures.

     Part B of table 1 gives projections based on the NL2SLS

parameter estimates. Typical consumption paths are shown in figure
2. The consumption paths are much flatter and more wealth is held
than the paths based on the NLLS parameter estimates. This means

that initially the consumption—based measure of poverty will show a
higher fraction in poverty, but at more advanced ages the fraction
in poverty will be smaller. The average fraction in poverty over
all age groups is about the same.

     The projections of the 1979 RHS widows do not give any idea of
the economic status of a steady—state population of widows because

the composition only changes by the mortality of the widows. In
that couples are substantially more wealthy than widows, the
mortality of husbands will add new widows that are more wealthy
than the original widows. Because I do not have a utility-based
                              Page 10

model of the consumption decisions of couples, I take their wealth
decuinulation to be 1.6% per year, which is the average of all
couples over the ten years of the RHS. Each time period each
couple will generate three other households: a widow, a widower,
and a couple, each with a probability that is calculated from the
mortality tables. The new widows and widowers have initial
conditions that are related to the wealth and annuities of the
couple from which they came. The situation is shown in figure 3.
For example, a couple in 1979 will generate four additional
households by 1984 each of which will have a different wealth level
because each is identified by the sex of the survivor and the date
of creation.

     I make some assumptions about changes in bequeathable wealth
and annuities if the husband dies. All nominal annuities are lost:
this is roughly confirmed in the RHS data; apparently most nominal
annuities are pensions without survivors benefits [Hurd and Wise,
1987]. Human capital is lost as it is almost exclusively due to
the husband's working. Social Security benefits become 0.67 of
their former level, which assumes the family's benefit is based on
the husband's earnings record. Medicare/Medicaid becomes half of
its former level. I give two sets of results each based on
different assumptions about begueathable wealth. In the first set
I assume that bequeathable wealth decreases by 32% when the husband
dies. This is the average figure over the ten years of the RHS

[Hurd and Wise, 1987]. In the second set bequeathable wealth does
not change at the husband's death.
                              Page 11


     Table 2 gives medians and means of consumption, income and

wealth of couples from 1979 through 1999. Because these results
are mostly used to generate initial conditions for the projections
of the singles, and because they are so heavily dependent on the
assumptions of the ad hoc model, I will only-discuss them briefly.

In the first panel, both consumption and income include an imputed
flow from Medicare/Medicaid; in the second panel the flow is
excluded. Even for the very oldest couples, consumption and income
including Medicare/Medicaid are substantial both at the mean and
median, and the fraction in poverty is small. Excluding
Medicare/Medicaid increases somewhat the fraction in poverty, but

the general impression is that couples are reasonably well off.
     As shown in table 3, the results for widows when the
composition is allowed to change due to the mortality of husbands
are very different from the projections of the 1979 RHS widows:

income, wealth and consumption are much higher especially among
older widows, and the fractions in poverty much lower. The reasons
are that in each time period the widows who are added at the

husband's death have much higher bequeathable wealth, even after
the reduction for the wealth destruction at the husband's death,
than the 1979 widows, and the new widows have substantially higher

levels of Social Security benefits, even after reduction, than the
1979 widows.

     Table 3, Part A, shows that in the first few years,

consumption that includes Medicare/Medicaid is somewhat lower than
couples, but income and wealth are substantially lower. This is,
                              Page 12


of course, a reflection of the much faster consumption of capital

by singles than by couples.2 In later years, consumption by widows
is only about half that of couples at the median. The fraction of
widows in poverty according to the consumption—based measure starts
at a rather low level and rises to 20% by 199-9. By then the median

age of the widows is 89, and, even though the mortality rate of the
widows is high, there are still a sizable number of widows because
almost all of the husbands have died. According to the income-
based measure of poverty, the fraction of widows in poverty

actually falls. This is caused by the high level of Social
Security added by the new widows.
     Even though the new widows have higher bequeathable wealth
than the original widows, the median wealth holdings become zero by
1993, so that at least half of the widows will live off of Social

Security and Medicare/Medicaid.
     In the standing population of widows the fraction in poverty
is 17.6% based on the consumption measure and 24.6% based on the
income measure. These fractions were found by taking a weighted
average of the fractions in poverty in each year.
     When Medicare/Medicaid is excluded from the income and

consumption measures, the results change substantially: both
income and consumption drop by about $1,000 as that is roughly the

per person transfer amount imputed to the Medicare/Medicaid system.


     2Couples should decurnulate wealth at a slower rate than
singles because the life expectancy of the household is greater.
                               Page 13


 The fractions in poverty rise sharply especially at older ages:
 both for the consumption-based and income—based measures, the

 fraction in poverty in 1999 almost doubles. In the standing

 population, the fraction in poverty increases to 30% by the
 consumption measure and to about 43% by the income measure.
 Apparently a substantial number of widows have income and
 consumption near the poverty line, so that a fairly small change
 causes a large number to fall below the poverty line. This is
 illustrated in table 5, which gives the consumption distributions
 in 1983. Because the value of Medicare/Medicaid is large relative

to the poverty line, many widows are shifted into poverty by
excluding Medicare/Medicaid. Both the thickness of the
distribution of widows near the poverty line and the shifting
indicate the rather artificial nature of the official

classification into poverty. In particular, if one want to attach
welfare significance to the poverty level, more research needs to
be done on the valuation of Medicare/Medicaid.

     Table 3, Part B, has the projections based on the NL2SLS

parameter estimates of the steady—state population of widows. As
measured by consumption the time path of the poverty rate is
changed substantially: there is much more poverty at earlier ages
and much less later. As measured by income there is less poverty
overall because more wealth is held. This points out again the
weakness of an income—based definition of poverty: the population
appears to be better off even though they have consumed less.

Although bequests at the death of the widow are not shown directly
                                Page 14


here, the results imply higher bequests simply because at each age
more wealth is held. That is, even among poor widows the NL2SLS
consumption paths imply that less wealth is consumed and more

bequeathed.
       Table 4 gives results similar to table 3 except I have assumed
that no bequeathable wealth is lost at the husband's death. In
that the differences between tables 3 and 4 are about the same for
each estimation method, I will not discuss separately parts A and
B. Of course, because bequeathable wealth is not lost at the
husband's death, consumption, income and wealth are higher. The
largest changes are at mean levels because of the skewed
distribution of bequeathable wealth. In fact there is very little
change in the poverty levels: those close to the poverty level
have very little bequeathable wealth; thus, it matters little
whether bequeathable decreases by 32% at the husband's death or
not.

       Because the projections generate a complete distribution of
couples and widows, a poverty rate over both groups is found by
taking a weighted average. The rates based on the results of
tables 2 and 3, Part A, are

                                        Poverty Rates
         Medicare/Medicaid    Income-based    Consumption—based
              Included              17%               12%
              Excluded              31%               22%


The table shows again the importance of Medicare/Medicaid. The
difference between the consumption—based and income-based measures
                                  Page 15

 are not as large, but it should be remembered that the consumption

 of wealth by couples is not based on a utility model.


 IV. Forecasting Consumption and Wealth in a Dynamic Economy

         In Section III, I traced out the consumption and wealth paths
 of the 1979 P.HS population under several different assumptions

 about the parameters that determine their consumption choices and
about the loss of wealth at the husband's death. In this section I
 forecast what the economic status of the elderly will be at the
turn of the century, and how it will be affected by changes in the
economy. As a standard of comparison, I first present a base case
in which the economy is static. Then I forecast successively how
the economic status will change when there is growth in

bequeathable wealth, growth in Social Security benefits, growth in
and change in the structure of job—related pensions, and change in

mortality rates. Because the calculations are so extensive I only
estimate the economic status of every fourth age group (71 year

olds, 75 year olds, 79 year olds and so forth), but taken together
they seem to give a good representation of the entire population
over the age of 70. In all the remaining forecasts I use the NLLS
parameter estimates because they fit the sample period data
slightly better than the NL2SLS parameter estimates. In consonance
with the actual data, I assume wealth loss of 32% at the husband's
death.

     Table 6 has the base-case forecasts of the consumption, income

and wealth of elderly couples in the year 2003. The first line is
                               Page 16

 the forecast for the 1979 RHS couples; the husbands were about 71
years old in 1979, the wives about 69 years old. Initially there
were 2418 couples; according to the 1979 mortality tables by 2003
there will be just 16 surviving couples. The mean age of the
husbands will be 94.1 years and of the wives 91.5. According to
the forecast, mean wealth of the 16 couples in 2003 will be $60,890
in 1979 dollars. Annual consumption and income, including an
imputation for the value of Medicare/Medicaid will be $11,638 and
$10519, respectively. The other entries in the first line are

consumption and income, excluding any value for Medicare/Medicaid,
and estimates of the fraction in poverty.

     The second line of table 6 has the forecasts of the economic
variables in 2003 of the couples who were about 70 years old in

1983. Their initial economic positions in 1983 are taken to be the
same as the 1979 PBS couples except that the inflation forecast is
based on 1983 inflations rates rather than 1979 rates. Thus, the
forecasts in lines 1 and 2 differ only because the 1979 and 1983
inflation rates differ, and because the forecasts are over 20 years
rather than 24. Of the initial 2418 couples, 79 will survive until
2003. The mean age of husband and wife will be 90.4 and 87.9 years

respectively.
     When the base year is 2003, the forecast begins and ends in
2003; thus, the entries in that line are the actual data of the
1979 RHS couples. The data represent the economic status of the
couples who will be about 70 years old in 2003.

     Taken together the lines give an estimate of the wealth,
consumption and income of couples in 2003 under the assumption that
                               Page 17


 in each base year, couples reach approximately 70 years of age with
 the distribution of assets that the 1979 RHS couples had. The last
 line gives average values over all the age groups. Average

 consumption and income levels are quite high. When

Medicare/Medicaid is included in consumption and income, the
 fraction of couples in poverty averaged over all the age groups is

small, 2% according to the consumption measure and 3% according to
the income measure. If Medicare/Medicaid is excluded, the fraction
in poverty rises to 7% and 9%. These fractions are about what
would be found in the official poverty statistics for elderly

couples: in 1983, 8.1% of families with heads over 65 were in
poverty. Of course, the official measure and the measures used
here are based on different assumptions, but apparently the return

to housing that is included here roughly offsets the lower rate of
return on wealth that is used here.     I would argue, however, that
at least from a theoretical point of view the measures proposed in
this paper are more appropriate. In any event, by these measures
the future economic status of elderly couples seems good even if

there is no upward trend in the initial economic position of the
cohorts as they reach retirement age.

     Table 7 has the projections for all singles, which include
widows, widowers and original singles. The table includes
compositional changes caused by the mortality of both husbands and
wives. To simplify the discussion, I concentrate here, and in the
results to follow, on the results that exclude Medicare/Medicaid.
Singles have much lower wealth than couples: averaged over all
                                 Page 18

ages their wealth is only 21% of the wealth of couples. Their
income is about half the income of couples because Social Security,
which is a very important component of their income, is much more

evenly distributed than wealth. Consumption by singles averages
70% of the consumption of couples. This is a consequence of the
much more rapid decumulation of wealth of singles. Mortality
differentials suggest this is reasonable: a couple will survive,
possibly not intact, for much longer than a single, so it should

reduce more slowly its wealth. Even though average consumption by
singles is quite high, a large fraction of singles is in poverty.
Apparently the distribution of consumption is highly skewed. The
results also point out again the important difference between an
income—based and a consumption—based measure of poverty: at the
youngest age the income—based definition has twice as many in
poverty as the consumption-based definition. According to the
income-based definition of poverty, the incidence of poverty is
much higher than the official statistics indicate: in 1983 the
official poverty rate for unrelated individuals over the age of 65
was 22% for men and 28% for women. The corresponding figure in
table 7 is 41%, the average poverty rate based on the income
measure of poverty.

     At older ages wealth becomes small, and, of course, average
consumption approaches average income. The fractions in poverty in
the oldest group are almost the same by either measure which
implies that a large fraction of the population of singles have no

remaining bequeathable wealth.
                               Page 19

      In the rest of the forecasts I change the initial conditions
of the successive cohorts to reflect economic changes or changes in

mortality. I first consider the growth in bequeathable wealth that

would accompany steady economic growth. According to Wolff and
Marley [1987], real average household wealthr excluding claims to
pensions and Social Security, grew by about 2% per year from 1949
to 1983. I take this to be the expected growth rate in initial

bequeathable wealth of the retirement-age elderly. In principle,
the economic status of the elderly in 2003 would be found as
follows. The consumption and wealth of 95 year olds in 2003 would
be forecast by the economic model from the initial conditions of
the 71 year—olds in the 1979 RHS population. To find the

consumption and wealth of 94 year—olds in 2003, I would increase
the bequeathable wealth of the 71 year-olds in the 1979 RHS
population by 2%, and forecast from 1980 to 2003 their consumption
and wealth. This would represent the consumption and wealth in
2003 of the cohort that reached 71 in 1980. Increasing again

initial bequeathable wealth by 2% and forecasting from 1981 to 2003
will yield the distributions of consumption and wealth of 93 year-
olds. Successively changing in this way the initial retirement-age
conditions would generate the consumption and wealth in 2003 of all
cohorts that will be 71 through 95 years old in 2003. Because of

the highly nonlinear response of consumption to changes in
bequeathable wealth, the resulting distributions of consumption and
wealth are not simple geometric projections of the original
forecasts.
                               Page 20


     To reduce the very extensive computations I increased the

initial bequeathable wealth of each couple by (l.02) every four
years, and began the forecasts at each of the years 1979, 1983,
1987 and so forth, as in table 6. The results, which represent the

economic status of couples in the year 2003, are given in table 8.
Because the increases began after 1979 the oldest cohort has
exactly the same economic variables as in the base case. Of
course, the greatest change is found in the youngest cohort:
average wealth is 59% higher than in the base case. Because most

couples are young, wealth changes averaged over all ages are also
large, about 46%. Mean consumption, excluding Medicare/Medicaid,
is 16% higher; mean income is 11% higher. The large differences
between the wealth increase and the consumption and income
increases reflect the important role annuities, especially Social
Security, have in consumption and income. The fractions in
poverty, which were already low in table 6, are reduced slightly.
     Table 9 has the forecasts for singles under growth in the

bequeathable wealth of both couples and singles. A comparison with
table 7 shows substantial growth in wealth: over all ages wealth

increases by 55%. Excluding Medicare/Medicaid, average consumption
is 19% higher; average income is 6% higher. Poverty levels are
not changed by much because most people near the poverty line have
little bequeathable wealth, so that proportional increases in
wealth have little effect. Furthermore, the older elderly are not
appreciably affected; yet, they both have high poverty rates and
comprise a sizable fraction of the singles. The conclusion from
                                Page 21


these simulations is simple geometric growth in bequeathable wealth
will not yield large improvements in the poverty rate of singles
over the next 30 years. One must hope that economic growth cause
more than a proportional change in bequeathable wealth at
                                              -
retirement.

     In   a growing economy one would expect increasing productivity
to cause increases in Social Security benefits: as real wages
increase, real Social Security taxes and real Primary Insurance
Amount (PIA) will increase. It is difficult to know what a
reasonable assumption is for increases in real PIA. In line with
the results of Wolff and Marley on household wealth, I assume a
growth rate of 2% per year, although due to the progressivity of
the benefit schedule and the cap on taxable earnings, this may be
an overestimate of the effect on PIA. The next two tables have
simulations that incorporate the 2% growth in PIA.
     With a growing PIA the youngest of the cohorts will have much
higher Social Security benefits than the oldest cohorts. Of
course, because the assumption is on PIA, once an individual's
Social Security benefits are fixed, he will have no future increase
in benefits. Results for couples are in table 10. Comparison with
table 6 shows much higher income and consumption on average, which
is a reflection of the importance of Social Security benefits in
the economic resources of the elderly. Social Security growth
reduces the fraction in poverty: very few remain in poverty except
amoung the oldest cohort, which under this experiment, had no
increase in benefits.
                                Page 22

       Table 11 has the corresponding results for singles. The
increases in income and consumption are substantial in the youngest
cohorts, and poverty falls by more than 50%. Averaged over all age
groups, the fraction of the population in poverty falls from 41% to
26% according to the income measure. Average wealth is almost
unchanged: the increase in benefits is roughly completely
consumed. This result has two sources: according to the model,
when annuities increase, the rate of consumption from bequeathable
wealth increases; and the effect of a bequest motive is small.

       In a growing economy one would expect job—related private
pensions to increase. In the next simulations each cohort reaches
retirement age with pensions that are 2% higher than the preceding
cohort. Once the pension of an individual has been fixed, it
remains constant in nominal terms as he ages. In addition the

assumption about the survivorship rights to private pensions has
been changed: when the husband dies the widow receives 2/3 of the
pension. To make the pension actuarially fair, the pension of the
couple is reduced to 89% of its value when there are no

survivorship rights.
       Table 12 has the results for couples. The changes are very
small: consumption and income increase by about 2%. One reason
for the small change would be that pensions are not a very
important source of income for the RHS population: the large
increase in the private pension system happened after most of the
RHS population had retired. Another reason is that the 2% per year
growth in pensions is partly offset by the actuarial reductions of
11%.
                               Page 23


      As table 13 shows, the changes in pensions cause very small
changes in the consumption and income of singles, an increase of
about 2%. Again this is a reflection of the fact that pensions are
not an important income component of the RHS   population.
Furthermore, average consumption and income only change when new
widows are added to the singles population, not when new widowers
are added; apparently the rate of addition is not great enough to
affect the averages by much. The fraction in poverty is not
changed: survivors near the poverty line typically caine from
families with almost no pensions. Thus, changing the survivorship
rights will have little effect on the poverty rate.

      Changes in mortality have a number of effects in this model:
the rate of transition from couples to singles changes; the

mortality rates of singles change; and the consumption paths of
singles change. To investigate these effects, I substituted for
the 1979 mortality table, an estimated mortality table for the year
2000. Table 14 has these new results for couples. Comparison with
table 6 shows that the mean age increases by about 0.6 years and
the number of households by about 12%. The effects on the oldest
households are larger: the fraction of the elderly population in
the three oldest catagories increases from 5.6% to 9.1%. Even
though more of the population lives longer, the fraction in poverty
increases only slightly, and the mean wealth is only marginally
lower.

  •
      Table 15 has the corresponding results for singles. The mean
age increases by 0.6 years; the number of households by 11%. The
                              Page 24


fraction of the single population in the three highest age groups
increases from 26% to 32%. Average wealth declines only slightly.
The fractions in poverty increase marginally: by 1% according to
the income-based measure and by about 2% according to the
consumption—based measure. The increase in life expectancy causes
little change in annual income: it drops by 1%. Consumption,
however, drops by almost 10%. The difference in these changes
points out, again, that income is probably not a good measure of
the economic well-being of the elderly. The large change in
consumption that results from using mortality tables that are just
21 year apart indicates the importance of accounting for the
reactions of individuals to mortality changes. This cannot be done
in forecasting methods that simply rely on trends: those methods
can only change the age and marital status distributions in

response to changes in mortality rates.


V.   Conclusions

     The widows in the 1979 RHS had little wealth and, according to

my projections, they quickly became even poorer. Thus, the future
prospects of the 1979 RHS widows are not bright. When the
population of widows was allowed to change as husbands died, the
extent of poverty was substantially less. The future prospects of
the population of widows that would be generated in steady-state by
the 1979 RHS sample of widows and couples are much better. A
critical unresolved issue, however, is the measurement of poverty.

I presented four measures, and they gave substantially different
                               Page 25


 fractions in poverty. Over the steady-state population of couples
 and widows, the measures range from a low of 12% to a high of 31%.
The welfare consequences are quite different at these extremes.
For widows, the variation is even greater. The poverty rates of
widows based on the results in table 3, Part-A, are


                               Poverty Rates of Widows
     Medicare/Medicaid   Income—based   Consumption-based
          Included             25%              18%
          Excluded             43%              30%


Thus, the variation is from 18% in poverty to 43% depending on the
definition. As between the income-based and consumption-based

measures, I certainly prefer the consumption-based measure: the
income—based measure gives no weight whatsoever to the stock of
wealth that is consumed. As between the measures that include and
exclude Medicare/Medicaid, the correct choice probably is, as
usual, neither, but something in between.
     In the second set of forecasts, the assumptions about economic
growth and mortality rates were varied to estimate the economic
status of the elderly population at the turn of the century. Even
without economic growth, elderly couples seem secure through the
end of the century: the young elderly couples have enough assets
and claims to Social Security that only a small fraction can expect
to be in poverty. The prospects of singles, most of whom are
widows, are not nearly so bright: on average they can expect to
have low wealth and a high incidence of poverty. This is
especially true of those who will be very old by the turn of the
                                Page 26

century: their economic resources are already fixed, and unless
there is an across-the--board increase in Social Security benefits,

little can happen to change them. If there is an increase in

productivity leading to higher Social Security benefits, the young
elderly will benefit considerably by the turn of the century.

Under such an assumption, poverty rates amoung that group can be
expected to be low.

     The projections produced four measures of economic well-being
with substantial differences among them. They are summarized in
the following table, which gives poverty rates over the 2003
population of elderly. These rates are calculated from the rates
found in tables 6 and 7.


                                 Poverty Rates of the
                              Elderly Population in 2003
     Medicare/Medicaid     Income—based   Consumption—based
          Included                17%             12%
          Excluded                31%             22%


The variation in poverty rates is from 12% in poverty to 31%
depending on the definition. Again, I would prefer the
consumption-based measure, and, again, the differences between the
measures that include and exclude Medicare/Medicaid are substantial
and point out the need for more research into a reasonable
valuation of Medicare/Medicaid.

is the probability that the individual is alive at t;   mt is the
instantaneous mortality rate. p is the subjective time rate of
discount; r is the real interest rate which is taken to be known
and fixed; V(.) is the utility from bequests. This formulation of
utility maximization with bequests is due to Yaari [1965]. The

resources available are bequeathable wealth, wt, and annuities,
including pensions, Social Security and Medicare/Medicaid.
Annuities are distinguished from bequeathable wealth in that they
cannot be borrowed against, and are not bequeathable. The
conditions on the utility maximization are that initial wealth, w0,
is given, and that

(2) wt = w0ert +   S t(   C )e(t)rds     0 for all t


A5 is the flow of annuities at time s. This formulation differs

from the usual interteinporal utility maximization problem in that
the annuity stream cannot be summarized by it-s expected present

value. It turns out, because many of the elderly have large
annuities relative to their bequeathable wealth that the corner

solutions are important. I parameterize the bequest function by
assuming that the marginal utility of bequests is constant. This
assumption may be defended in several ways. First, from a
practical point of view, without such an assumption the model
cannot be solved; the estimation requires a model solution.
Second, in other work I found that the strength of the bequest
motive did not seem to depend on the wealth level.4 Third,
variations in the level of wealth cause only small variations in
the level of the wealth of the heirs; therefore, the marginal
utility of wealth of the heirs will roughly be constant over
variations in wealth of the older generation, and one would expect
the marginal utility of bequests to be constant.

     The Pontryagin necessary conditions associated with this
problem are that

over an interval (t,t+h) in which wt > 0.                a   is   the constant
marginal utility of bequests.
        If p   > r,     these conditions generate consumption trajectories
that slope downward, and, unless wealth is very large, wealth
trajectories that also slope downward. A typical example is shown
in figure 1: the consumption path follows equation (4)                   until
bequeathable wealth is exhausted at T; then it follows (3). The
present value of the area under the consumption path and above the

annuity path equals initial bequeathable wealth. The solution is
implicitly defined by:

(5.1)       CT = AT

(5.2)       c       =
                        c]atet(r_P)    +

                                f0(A5—c5)e -s rdS

(5.4)      WT = 0

        If initial wealth is very large, wealth will never go to zero,
and the nature of the solution is different. Although these cases
are taken care of in the estimation, I will not discuss them here

because empirically they are not important.


Data


       The data are from the Longitudinal Retirement History Survey.
About 11,000 households whose heads were born in 1906-1911 were
                              Page 30

interviewed every two years from 1969 through 1979. Detailed
questions were asked about all assets (except a meaningful question
on life insurance), and the data were linked with official Social
Security records so that one can calculate exactly Social Security
benefits. There are some data on consumption, but they are not
complete, so I estimate the parameters of the model over wealth
data. Bequeathable wealth includes stocks and bonds, property,
businesses and savings accounts, all less debts. As suggested by
King and Dicks-Mireaux [1982], I exclude housing wealth because the
costs of adjusting housing consumption are substantial, so that
people may not follow their desired housing consumption path. As
long as the consumption of other goods follows its desired path,
the parameters may be estimated over bequeathable wealth excluding
housing wealth. Annuities include pensions, Social Security
benefits, an estimated income value from Medicare/Medicaid,

privately purchased annuities (which are very small), welfare
transfers, and transfers from relatives. See Hurd and Shoven
[1985] for a detailed description of the data.5
     The estimation method is to use equations (5) to solve for the
consumption path as a function of an initial choice of the
parameter values. This requires numerical integration and a search
for T. The solution will depend on initial wealth. Then, wealth

in the next survey, w2, is predicted from equation (2). That is,


     5me estimation is over all singles observed in any two-year
period. The real interest rate, r, is taken to be 0.03.
                                    Page 31

 the necessary conditions and the boundary conditions, equations
 (5), implicitly define

      w2 =   f(w01{A),e),

 in which w0 is initial wealth, (A) is the annuity stream, and a is
the parameter vector (      p   a)'. The parameter space is searched to
minimize a function of (w2 -       f).
     Although a is, in principle, identified through rionlinearities
in the functional form, the identification is very weak.
Therefore, I specify that a is zero if a household has no living
children.6 The interpretation of a is the increase in the marginal
utility of bequests across households according to whether they
have living children or not. The first set of parameter estimates
comes from solving

     mm (w2 — f(w0,(A),e))2
      a

The estimated parameter values, which I refer to later as the

nonlinear least squares (NLLS) estimates, are

                                    a
              .729     .0501  5.0x107
             (.004)    (.091) (1x104)
             Number of observations = 5452



     6Although the RHS does not have information about the ages of
the children, because of the ages of the RHS population the median
age. of the children would be about 30 in the first year of the
survey. Thus, almost all the children will have their own
households.
                                     Page 32



      An analysis of the residuals was consistent with the
hypothesis that wealth is observed with error.       Therefore, I
estimated the parameters by nonlinear two—stage least squares

 (NL2SLS),   in   which the parameter estimates cnie from solving


(15) Thin [w2—f(a)]'x(x'xy'x'[w2—f(e)J
       e

X is an nxlS matrix of observations on income from wealth; these
data are not derived from the wealth data but come from separate
questions in the RHS. Thus they should not be correlated with the
observation errors in w0.
     The results from the NL2SLS are


                     1
                   1.12     —0.011     6.0x107
                  (.074)    (.002)    (32xl07)
                  Number of observations = 5452

     The major difference between the two sets of results is in r—p,
which, if the mortality rate were zero, would control the slope of
the consumption trajectory. In the NLLS r-p is approximately
-0.02; even with a bequest motive, the consumption path will slope
downward. In the NL2SLS estimates r—p is about 0.04. Even without
a bequest motive, the consumption slope will have a positive slope
until the conditional mortality rate, mt/at, exceeds 0.04. The
NL2SLS consumption trajectories will be much flatter than the NLLS

trajectories.
                              Page 33


     Both sets of estimates produce an estimate of -y   that   is much
smaller that what has typically been assumed in the literature.

For example, Kotlikoff, Shoven and Spivak [1983, 1984] use a value
of 4 in their simulations. Hubbard [1984) uses values of 0.75, 2
and 4. Davies [1981] "best guess" for his simulations is 4. Large
values of -y mean that the slope of the consumption trajectory is

not sensitive to variations in mortality rates; my estimates imply
that the consumption paths of the elderly will have substantial
variation with mortality rates.

     The marginal utility of bequests, a, is estimated to be very
small, which is consistent with other estimates I have made in a
model that is almost free of functional form restrictions.7 The
small estimate of   is caused by the fact that in the data there is
no difference between the saving rates of households with children
and households without children.
