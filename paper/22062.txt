                                          ABSTRACT

What tariffs would countries impose if they did not have to fear any retaliation? What would
occur if there was a complete breakdown of trade policy cooperation? What would be the
outcome if countries engaged in fully efficient trade negotiations? And what would happen to
trade policy cooperation if the world trading system had a different institutional design? While
such questions feature prominently in the theoretical trade policy literature, they have proven
difficult to address empirically, because they refer to what-if scenarios for which direct empirical
counterparts are hard to find. In this chapter, I introduce research which suggests overcoming this
difficulty by applying quantitative models of commercial policy.

1    Introduction

At least since Johnsons (1953-54) pioneering analysis of optimal tari¤s and retaliation, what-

if questions regarding potential policy scenarios have dominated the theoretical trade policy

literature: What tari¤s would countries impose if they did not have to fear any retaliation?

What would occur if there was a complete breakdown of trade policy cooperation? What

would be the outcome if countries engaged in fully e¢cient trade negotiations? And what

would happen to trade policy cooperation if the world trading system had a di¤erent institu-

tional design?

    In this chapter, I introduce research which takes this theoretical literature to the data using

quantitative models of commercial policy. Quantitative models are a natural tool for empirical

work in this area because they are designed for counterfactual analyses. As a result, they can

shed light on the what-if scenarios emphasized in the theoretical literature without necessarily

requiring historical precedents. This is especially useful for key benchmark scenarios such as

fully escalated trade wars or fully e¢cient trade talks for which direct empirical counterparts

are hard to nd.

    My particular focus is on quantitative research which assumes that trade policy choices

are made by optimizing governments. While this is a standard assumption in the theoret-

ical literature, it has long been avoided in quantitative applications because of the unique

methodological challenges it brings about. As a result, little was known about the magni-

tudes of optimal tari¤s, the potential welfare costs of a breakdown of trade policy cooperation,

or the potential welfare gains which can be achieved in future trade negotiations. Instead,

quantitative analyses mainly focused on comparative statics exercises such as predicting the

e¤ects of particular trade agreements.

    While this is still very much an emerging literature, I believe a separate introduction is

valuable to have since the required tools go beyond what is commonly used in the quantitative

trade literature. Moreover, excellent accounts of the broader quantitative trade literature are

already easy to obtain. In particular, a thorough introduction to traditional Quantitative

General Equilibrium (CGE) models is provided in the Handbook of Computable General

Equilibrium Modeling edited by Dixon and Jorgenson (2013). Moreover, a comprehensive

review of the more recent quantitative gravity literature building on the work of Eaton and

Kortum (2002) is available from the Handbook of International Economics chapter by Costinot

and Rodriguez-Clare (2014).1

       My goal is to equip readers who are interested in this area with the knowledge required

to expand its frontier. Assuming no background in quantitative modeling, I provide an in-

depth discussion of the key tools, the key ndings, and the key limitations of the literature

so far. An integral part of this chapter is a programming toolkit which is available from the

accompanying website. It contains a set of fully documented MATLAB programs which can

be used to e¢ciently compute counterfactuals, optimal tari¤s, Nash tari¤s, and cooperative

tari¤s. While they are tailored to the workhorse model used in this chapter, they can be

easily modi ed to apply to other environments.

       I structure my explanations around my analysis in Ossa (2014) which is the most compre-

hensive one available to date. However, I go beyond it by elaborating more extensively on the

underlying methods, including the "exact hat algebra" technique of Dekle et al (2007), the

elasticity estimations of Feenstra (1994), Broda and Weinstein (2006), and Caliendo and Parro

(2015), and the mathematical programming with equilibrium constraints (MPEC) algorithm

of Su and Judd (2012). The central theme throughout this chapter is numerical optimization

which di¤erentiates it from the abovementioned contribution of Costinot and Rodriguez-Clare

(2014). As will become clear shortly, this is a critical theme for this literature as challenges

associated with it have forced earlier studies to con ne attention to low dimensional setups

with only a few countries and industries.

       To the best of my knowledge, there are only ve papers other than Ossa (2014) which

have seriously attempted to quantify trade policy equilibria featuring optimizing governments.

Hamilton and Whalley (1983) were the rst to attempt a serious calibration of optimal trade

policy. Employing simple CES speci cations on the demand and the supply side of the

economy, they explore optimal tari¤s with and without retaliation in a range of simple two

region, one import good models. They conclude that optimal tari¤s are far away from the

tari¤s observed in the data and that the margin for tari¤ retaliation in a worldwide tari¤ war

is potentially large.

    Markusen and Wigle (1989) explore Nash equilibrium tari¤s and their welfare e¤ects in a

much richer numerical general equilibrium framework featuring scale economies and capital

mobility. While their framework allows for eight regions and six industries, they only consider

a tari¤ war between the US and Canada further constraining the tari¤s to vary proportionately

across all industries. They nd that the Nash equilibrium tari¤s are much lower than the ones

computed by Hamilton and Whalley (1983) and conjecture that this is due to scale economies

and capital mobility.

    Perroni and Whalley (2000), Ossa (2011), and Ossa (2012) calculate optimal tari¤s with

and without retaliation in a quantitative Armington model, a quantitative Krugman (1980)

model with free entry, and a quantitative Krugman (1980) model without free entry, respec-

tively. They now allow for seven instead of two regions but still assume that each country

imposes a single tari¤ against all imports from a given trading partner. While Perroni and

Whalley (2000) are particularly interested in the potential e¤ect of regional trade agreements

on Nash tari¤s, Ossas (2011, 2012) calculations are part of a broader attempt to explore

optimal trade policy in "new trade" environments.2

    The quantitative approach discussed in this chapter is more closely related to the quantita-

tive gravity literature pioneered by Eaton and Kortum (2002) than the traditional Computable

General Equilibrium (CGE) literature. As argued by Costinot and Rodriguez-Clare (2014),

this newer literature distinguishes itself by having more appealing micro-theoretical founda-

tions, o¤ering a tighter connection between theory and data, and prioritizing transparency

over realism.

    While this is true, it is also important to recognize that the di¤erences between newer

and older quantitative trade models are often overemphasized. For example, Eaton and

Kortum (2002) indeed develop a full-edged Ricardian model which has more appealing micro-
    2
      Rudimentary quantitative analyses can already be found in the early formal trade policy literature. Johnson
(1953-54) numerically calculated demand elasticity combinations for which a country gains or loses in a tari¤
war. His analysis was subsequently extended by Gorman (1958) to a broader class of models, by Kuga (1973)
to many countries and industries, and by Kennan and Riezman (1990) to allow for customs unions. While
numerical calculations feature prominently in all of these papers, they were clearly meant to be numerical
illustrations rather than serious calibration exercises. For completeness, let me also mention that Baldwin and
Clarke (1987) calculate various equilibria of a simple two-country tari¤ game which is meant to capture some
of the salient features of the Tokyo Round and that Alvarez and Lucas (2007) provide a short discussion of
optimal tari¤s in small open economies.

theoretical foundations than the ad-hoc Armington (1969) model the CGE literature typically

relies on. Yet, we now know from the work of Arkolakis et al (2012) that these models are

actually isomorphic in terms of their quantitative predictions so that these micro-theoretical

di¤erences matter much less than it originally seemed.

   Also, some of the new techniques of connecting theory to data have close counterparts

in the earlier CGE literature. For example, the "exact hat algebra" approach of Dekle et al

(2007) closely resembles a standard method in the CGE literature of expressing equilibrium

conditions in "calibrated share form". In light of this, the main di¤erence between newer and

older quantitative trade models seems to be that important model parameters such as trade

elasticities are now usually estimated using the same model relationships that are then also

used for counterfactual analyses instead of just taken from existing studies in the literature.

   In that sense, the newer quantitative trade literature comes somewhat closer to full-edged

structural estimation than the earlier CGE literature did even though it is still best described

as "theory with numbers" in my view. This means that its quantitative ndings so far should

not be taken at face value but rather as o¤ering a sense of the magnitudes. Of course, this is

not only interesting in its own right but can also provide valuable insights into the plausibility

of the underlying theory. For example, we will see that the trade war equilibrium predicted

by the benchmark model of this chapter seems broadly consistent with the observed trade

war following the Great Depression which is an encouraging result.

   The remainder of this chapter is divided into three sections. The rst section introduces

the main methods, including the theoretical framework of Ossa (2014), the "exact hat alge-

bra" technique of Dekle et al (2007), the elasticity estimations of Feenstra (1994), Broda and

Weinstein (2006), and Caliendo and Parro (2014), ways to deal with aggregate trade imbal-

ances, and the MPEC algorithm of Su and Judd (2012). The second section illustrates these

methods in an application to 10 countries and 33 industries calculating optimal tari¤s, Nash

tari¤s, and e¢cient tari¤s. The last section considers a number of extensions which have been

analyzed in the literature and discusses ideas for future work.

2     Methods

2.1     Theory

In this section, I introduce the model of Ossa (2014) which I use as a workhorse model

throughout. As will become clear shortly, it nests many of the forces emphasized in the

theoretical literature, which makes it a natural starting point for quantitative trade policy

work. Having said this, none of the methods discussed in this chapter are speci c to this

model and could be applied readily to any of the other gravity models surveyed in Costinot

and Rodriguez-Clare (2015). I will further elaborate on this in the following and also point

to some speci c alternative models which seem particularly interesting to me.


2.1.1    Setup

There are N countries indexed mainly by i or j and S industries indexed mainly by s. House-

holds have access to a continuum of di¤erentiated varieties and make their consumption

decisions according to the following nested Cobb-Douglas-CES utility functions:

                                                                                          
                                   X         Z   Mis                                  s s 1 js
                            QS          N                              s 1
                     Cj =    s=1                        cijs (! is )    s    d! is                  (1)
                                        i=1   0


where cijs denotes consumption of an industry s variety from country i in country j, Mis is

the mass of industry s varieties produced in country i,  s > 1 is the elasticity of substitution

between industry s varieties, and js is the share of expenditure country j households spend on

industry s varieties. Households collect all labor income, pro ts, and tari¤ revenue generated

in the economy and there are a total of Li workers residing in country i.

    Each consumption variety is produced by a single monopolistic rm. Firms hire labor

only, produce output using constant returns to scale technologies, and incur iceberg shipping

costs. Their technologies are summarized by the following inverse production functions:

                                                  XN        ijs cijs
                                      lis =                                                          (2)
                                                    j=1       'is

where lis is the amount of labor hired by an industry s rm in country i, 'is is the productivity



                                                        6
of industry s rms in country i, and ijs > 1 is an iceberg trade barrier in the sense that

ijs units of an industry s variety have to be shipped out of country i for one unit to arrive

in country j. There are no          xed costs of production and the mass of             rms is exogenous

everywhere.

       Governments impose import tari¤s but do not have access to other policy instruments. I

denote the ad valorem tari¤ imposed by country j against industry s imports from country

i by tijs , where tijs  0 for all i 6= j and tijs = 0 for all i = j, and de ne the shorthand

 ijs  1 + tijs for future use. Government preferences are given by:

                                                 XS
                                          Gj =             js Wjs                                       (3)
                                                     s=1



where Wjs is the welfare of industry s in country j and js is a political economy weight. I

will elaborate on the details of this speci cation in the application section and for now only

consider the special case of welfare maximizing governments which arises if js = 1 for all j

and s which then implies Gj = Cj .3

       Notice that this model is a hybrid between a multi-sector Krugman (1980) model and a

multi-sector Armington (1969) model. Unlike a standard Krugman (1980) model, it abstracts

from xed costs of production and does not allow for free entry. Unlike a standard Armington

(1969) model, it features imperfect competition and products which are di¤erentiated at the

level of rms. These modi cations ensure that there are no corner solutions and that there

is more to trade policy than just terms-of-trade e¤ects. While this is useful in practice, it is

in no way critical for the applicability of the methods discussed in this chapter which can be

used for any gravity model as indicated before.4
   3
     As will become clear in the application section, industry welfare is simply de ned as nominal industry
income deated by the ideal aggregate price index which then sums to total real income or total welfare if
js = 1 for all j and s.
   4
     Readers familiar with the work of Arkolakis et al (2012) will know that these models anyway all have the
same predictions in the special case of one industry. However, as soon as there is more than one industry,
di¤erences between these models emerge in the sense that "new trade" production relocation or pro t shifting
e¤ects appear in addition to traditional terms-of-trade e¤ects in imperfectly competitive environments.

2.1.2    Equilibrium in levels

Utility maximization implies that rms in industry s of country i face demands:

                                                                    s

where pis is the ex-factory price set by industry s rms in country i, Pjs is the ideal price

index of industry s varieties in country j, and Ej is the total expenditure of consumers in

country j.

     Pro t maximization requires that rms charge a constant markup over marginal costs:

trade costs. This is simply because the considered trade ows are evaluated at ex-factory

prices which are net of tari¤s but gross of iceberg trade costs.

   Recall that all labor incomes, pro ts, and tari¤ revenues ultimately accrue to households

which can be captured by the budget constraint:

   Since a fraction     s    of revenues is distributed as pro ts, the remaining fraction 1                 s   is

distributed as labor income. As a result:

                                                n=1 s=1


This can also be interpreted as a labor market clearing condition since it reduces to Li =

  s=1 Mis lis after substituting equations (2), (4), (5), and (7).

   For given tari¤s, conditions (7) - (9) jointly determine the equilibrium of the model. For

future reference, it is useful to summarize this in De nition 1:

   Notice that the equilibrium for given tari¤s could be summarized in a very similar fashion

                                                          9
in other gravity models. For example, a multi-sector Armington (1969) model would feature

the same conditions with the exceptions that there would be no markups and pro ts so that the

respective terms would be dropped from the second, third, and fourth equation of De nition

1. Similar arguments can be made for other well-known frameworks including Eaton and

Kortum (2002), Krugman (1980) with free entry, and Melitz (2003) with Pareto distributed

productivity draws.


2.1.3     Equilibrium in changes

In principle, it would be possible to take the equilibrium as summarized in De nition 1 to the

data by calibrating the structural parameters fLi ; Mis ; 'is ; ijs g as well as the elasticities  s .

However, these structural parameters are hard to recover in practice which makes De nition

1 a challenging starting point for quantitative work. Notice that calibrating js would not

                                                                  m=1   t=1  mjt Xmjt

      A technique which has come to be known as "exact hat algebra" in the literature cir-

cumvents this identi cation problem in an elegant way. It is usually attributed to Dekle et al

(2007) but a version of it is also frequently applied in the traditional computable general equi-

librium literature where researchers refer to it as expressing equations in "calibrated share

form".5 I will illustrate this technique step-by-step in the following using the equilibrium

conditions from De nition 1.

      The basic idea is to perform a quantitative comparative statics exercise taking some ob-

served equilibrium of the world economy as a starting point. In the application, I will later

focus on a case with 10 regions and 33 industries in the year 2007 but any equilibrium for

which su¢cient data is available will do. The comparative statics exercise can, in principle,

be conducted with respect to any exogenous variable but I will focus on changes in tari¤s and

international side payments and assume that all other exogenous variables from De nition 1

remain unchanged.

Notice that all parameters that enter multiplicatively simply cancel because they take on the

same values before and after the change. This eliminates much of the original complication

because it is then no longer necessary to estimate them.

   A slightly extended version of this approach needs to be taken when transforming the other

equations because they also include additive terms. The basic idea is to express these terms

as a weighted sum of proportional changes, where the weights have some factual empirical

counterpart. For example, if the factual and counterfactual equations were x = y + z and

                                                              ^ = xy y^ + xz z^ and transform the
x0 = y 0 + z 0 , one would divide one by the other generating x
            y         z
weights     x   and   x   until they can be measured somehow.

   This basic idea can be applied directly to the budget constraint from De nition 1. De ning

The last step follows from substituting the gravity equation into the above de nition of                                                            ijs ,

as should be straightforward to verify. Intuitively, this says that price index changes are

expenditure share weighted averages of changes in prices, which in turn are driven by changes

in wages and tari¤s in this environment.

   Just like equations (6) - (9) can be used to solve for the equilibrium in levels, equations

(10) - (13) can be used to solve for the equilibrium in changes, which is useful to summarize

in De nition 2:

       While the equilibrium formulation in De nition 2 therefore circumvents the need to ex-

plicitly estimate fLi ; Mis ; 'is ; ijs g, it also ensures that the counterfactual e¤ects of changes

in tari¤s and international transfers can be computed from a reference point which perfectly

matches industry-level trade ows and tari¤s. Essentially, it imposes a restriction on the set

of unknown parameters fLi ; Mis ; 'is ; ijs g such that the predicted Xijs perfectly match the
                                                    
observed Xijs for given  ijs and  s . Recall that    ijs ; ijs ; ijs ;  ijs can all be expressed as

simple functions of Xijs ,  ijs , and  s .

       Notice that this procedure does not deliver any estimates of fLi ; Mis ; 'is ; ijs g simply

because there are too many degrees of freedom. For example, the iceberg trade costs alone

could be adjusted to perfectly match any pattern of industry-level trade. Of course, this also

means that many di¤erent gravity models could be perfectly matched to the same trade data

using "exact hat algebra" techniques. As a result, there is a real issue of how to discriminate

between di¤erent gravity models, which I discuss more extensively below.6

       As should now almost go without saying, the equilibrium for given tari¤ changes could

be summarized in very similar ways in other gravity models. For example, removing the
          
term 1 1s from the de nition of  ijs is all it takes to instead implement a multi-sector

Armington (1969) model since the markups cancel from the third and fourth equations of

De nition 1 as a result of applying the "exact hat algebra" technique. Of course, small

di¤erences in the equations can cause large di¤erences in the outcomes so that this does not

mean that those di¤erences have to be economically irrelevant.


2.1.4      First-order conditions

The "exact hat algebra" approach is not only a useful tool to calculate counterfactual tari¤

changes but can also be used to go one step further and characterize which of those tari¤

changes is chosen by optimizing governments. I now illustrate this point using optimal tari¤s

as an example but the analysis can be readily extended to Nash tari¤s and cooperative tari¤s.

The idea is to express optimal tari¤s as functions of endogenous elasticities and then use the

structure of the model to solve for them. A special case of this is Gros (1987) well-known
   6
   Costinot and Rodriguez-Clare (2015) discuss in more detail for which trade models this "exact hat algebra"
approach works.

version of the classic optimal tari¤ formula that a countrys optimal tari¤ equals the inverse

of its trading partners export supply elasticity.

       As mentioned above, I abstract from political economy considerations for now and simply

assume that tari¤s are set by welfare maximizing governments. As a result, country l chooses

its tari¤s against its trading partners k 6= l in all industries t,  klt , to maximize its real income

       Optimal tari¤s can therefore be calculated as the solution to a system of linear and non-

linear equations. While I explain below that this approach is not the most e¢cient to actually

calculate optimal tari¤s, I suspect that it could prove useful to study the properties of optimal

tari¤s, Nash tari¤s, and cooperative tari¤s theoretically. For example, it might be possible to

formally establish conditions for existence and uniqueness in the spirit of Allen and Arkolakis

(2014) by leveraging existing knowledge about the properties of systems of equations with

these particular functional forms.

       Moreover, this formulation might help shed light on the qualitative and quantitative de-

terminants of optimal trade policy. An encouraging start is that it can be reduced to Gros

(1987) well-known version of the classic optimal tari¤ formula in the special case N = 2,
                                                          1

mula because             0 (     1) can be shown to correspond to country 2s export supply elasticity.
                         22

It depends on the trade elasticity                            1 and the own trade share            0 ,   where the apostrophe

indicates that it is evaluated at the optimal tari¤.


2.2        Calibration

2.2.1       Elasticity estimation

I now discuss two complementary approaches that are widely used to estimate the elasticities

 s . I begin with the traditional approach due to Feenstra (1994) which requires panel data
   8
    A detailed derivation of this is available from me upon request. It is straightforward but tedious so I will
not reproduce it here.


                                                                          16
on values and quantities of trade ows. I then turn to the alternative approach suggested by

Caliendo and Parro (2015) which can be implemented in principle using cross-sectional data

on tari¤s and values of trade ows alone. While I illustrate these approaches in the context

a model in which the  s correspond to substitution elasticities, the methods really focus on

estimating trade elasticities, that is the partial elasticities of trade ows with respect to trade

costs. As is well-known, trade elasticities are associated with di¤erent structural parameters

in di¤erent gravity models which should be kept in mind when exploring variations of the

workhorse model emphasized here.


Feenstra (1994)         The approach of Feenstra (1994) is based on an earlier insight of Leamer

(1981) which I now briey summarize: Suppose you have time-series data on prices and

quantities and ask which supply and demand elasticities maximize the likelihood of this data

given that the supply and demand curves have constant elasticity forms. While it is impossible

to uniquely identify these elasticities for standard endogeneity reasons, Leamer (1981) shows

that one can still narrow them down to combinations described by a hyperbolic curve whose

precise shape depends on the variances and covariances of the supply and demand shocks

generating the data.

   Feenstras (1994) basic idea is to exploit cross-country variation in the variances and

covariances of these supply and demand shocks to obtain unique estimates of the supply and

demand elasticities. Loosely speaking, a di¤erent Leamer hyperbola can be constructed for

each country and the estimation approach simply determines which elasticity combination

is the best      t for all. The key identifying assumptions are that the supply and demand

elasticities are constant and do not vary across countries and that the supply and demand

shocks are all drawn independently.

   This idea is surprisingly easy to implement using a panel of import values and quantities.

The rst step is to use the import data to construct a panel of unit values pist and expenditure

shares   ijst   for a particular importer j and a particular industry s in which there is variation

across exporters i and time t. The de nitions of pist and       ijst   are the same as the ones used

before with the exception that the subscript t is now added to indicate the time dimension

which was absent before. Feenstra (1994) shows that a consistent estimate of  s can then


                                                  17
be obtained by applying the following simple procedure assuming that the above identifying

assumptions hold:9

         an arbitrary reference country, and use ordinary least-squares to estimate the following

         linear regression:10

                                                                    1 ~s           ~2s

                                                                                                           1
       Notice that this procedure cannot be applied if 0:25 < 4 + ~2s =~1s                                     because then the

elasticity formulas would have imaginary values as results. However, Broda and Weinstein

(2006) suggest a grid search approach for this case with which one can still recover estimates

of s and  s . The idea is to simply nd the values of s and  s which minimize the residual

sum of squares of regression (15) subject to the constraints that 0  s < 1 and  s > 1. It
                                                                                                                           s
makes use of the theoretical restrictions derived in Feenstra (1994) that 1s =                                      ( s 1)2 (1 s )
                  2s 1
and 2s =     ( s 1)(1 s ) .
   9
      This is based on the explanations in Feenstra (2010), in which the Feenstra (1994) procedure is particularly
clearly explained.
   10
      To obtain e¢cient estimates of the elasticities, this regression needs to be run a second time using weighted
least squares, where the weights are computed from the inverse of the standard deviation of the residuals from
the unweighted regression. This is done in the STATA code I use to estimate the elasticities for this chapter
which follows the STATA code from Feenstra (2010).


                                                              18
    As is the case with any estimation procedure, the Feenstra (1994) method is not without

aws. One major drawback is that the assumption of independent supply and demand shocks

is likely to be violated in practice leading to inconsistent estimates. For example, one might

think that productivity and spending simultaneously fall in recessions in which case both the

supply and the demand curves shift in. Another issue is that Feenstras (1994) assumption

of constant export supply elasticities does not apply in standard gravity models such as the

one discussed in this chapter. Strictly speaking, the Feenstra (1994) method is therefore not

correctly speci ed to estimate demand elasticities in such settings but it is frequently applied

to them anyway.

    Despite these caveats, the Feenstra (1994) method can deliver plausible estimates of  s .

In particular, Table 1 reports elasticity estimates calculated by applying the STATA code

provided in Feenstra (2010) to Comtrade data for the years 1994-2008.11 In anticipation of

the below application section, they are provided for the 33 industries with which I work later

on. My only departure from the standard procedure is that I pool the data over a number

of major importers.12 This is consistent with my earlier assumption that  s does not vary

across countries and allows me to use a larger dataset leading to more precise estimates. As

can be seen, homogeneous goods such as wheat are estimated to have the highest elasticties.

Also, the mean elasticity is found to be 3.44 which is within the range of estimates from the

literature.

    While the Feenstra (1994) method is mostly applied to estimate import demand elasticities,

Broda et al (2008) also make use of the associated export supply elasticities in an interesting
   11
      The Comtrade data is originally at the SITC-Rev2 4-digit level and I convert it, rst, to the SITC-Rev3
4-digit level using a concordance from the Center for International Data at UC Davis and, second, to the GTAP
sector level using a concordance which I manually constructed with the help of various concordances available
from the GTAP website. This involved combining the original GTAP sectors "raw milk" and "dairy products"
into a new GTAP sector "raw and processed dairy", the original GTAP sectors "paddy rice" and "processed
rice" into a new GTAP sector "raw and processed rice", and the original GTAP sectors "raw and processed
sugar" and "sugar cane, sugar beet" into a new GTAP sector "sugar". This is exactly the same procedure I
follow in Ossa (2014).
   12
      In particular, I pool over the importers with which I work later on, namely Canada, China, India, Japan,
Korea, Russia, and the US as well as the EU-25 countries Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark,
Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta,
The Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sweden, Spain, and the United Kingdom and the
Mercosur countries Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay. Soderbery (2015) has recently suggested an
interesting extension to the Feenstra (1994) method which deals with a small sample bias found to be present
in the original methodology. While I have not yet applied this methodology myself, I know that my elasticity
estimates look much less plausible if I do not pool across importers which I suspect is exactly due to the fact
that the sample size used for each elasticity estimation is then much reduced.

trade policy application. Focusing on a number of non-WTO member countries, they show

that tari¤s are increasing in the export supply elasticities faced by importing countries just

as the classic optimal tari¤ formula predicts. The focus on non-WTO member countries is

necessary because the export supply elasticities themselves depend on tari¤s under all but the

most restrictive assumptions. As a result, one has to assume that factual tari¤s are equal to

optimal tari¤s for the exercise to make sense, which is more plausible for non-WTO member

countries.


Caliendo and Parro (2015)           Caliendo and Parro (2015) suggest an alternative method

which identi es  s from the e¤ect tari¤ changes have on trade ows. It exploits the particular

structure of gravity equations and can be applied directly to equation (7). In particular,

consider industry s trade ows from country i to country j, from country j to country k, and

from country k to country i and multiply them together as Xijs Xjks Xkis . Now divide this

by the same term just with trade ows of the reverse direction and substitute the gravity

equation (7) to obtain:

                                                                 s                       1   s

   Notice that all terms which are speci c to a particular origin or destination have been

cancelled by taking this ratio so that only pair-speci c tari¤s and iceberg trade costs remain.

The next step is to assume that iceberg trade costs can be decomposed into an origin-speci c,

a destination-speci c, and a pair-speci c component, where the pair-speci c component has a

deterministic and a stochastic part: ijs = #ijs #is #js "ijs . Under the plausible restriction that

the pair-speci c component is symmetric in the sense that #ijs = #jis , the above equation

       Just like the Feenstra (1994) method, the Caliendo and Parro (2015) approach is based on
                                                          ijs  jks  kis
a strong identifying assumption. In particular,           jis  kjs  iks   has to be independent of  ijks (or

its equivalent in changes) for regression (20) to yield consistent estimates. This is violated, for

example, if pair-speci c tari¤ and non-tari¤ barriers are correlated which is likely to be the

case. An additional problem is that all identi cation comes from discriminatory tari¤ barriers

because all MFN tari¤ barriers cancel out. While this does not invalidate the method in any

manner, it is still likely to limit its power in many applications because it eliminates much of

the variation the tari¤ data contain.13

       While Caliendo and Parro (2015) have shown that their methodology can be successfully

applied using trade and tari¤ data from the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA),

I was unable to obtain meaningful estimates using a cross-section of trade and tari¤ data

from the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) for the year 2007. This is the data I use

in the below application section and it features the tari¤s and trade ows of 10 regions in

33 agricultural and manufacturing industries. Less than half of the estimates were signi cant

and some even had negative signs. Presumably, this is because the included regions comprise

mainly WTO member countries so that there is not enough variation in discriminatory tari¤

barriers.


Discussion       In many ways, the elasticity estimation is the Achilles heel of quantitative

trade policy analyses. Not only is it plagued by serious identi cation problems, but also do

most results critically depend on the elasticity estimates. This will become clear in the below
  13
    A subtle point that is developed more fully in Costinot and Rodriguez-Clare (2014) is that it matters
whether tari¤s are assumed to be imposed before markups or after markups (thereby acting as cost shifters
or demand shifters) in gravity models featuring monopolistic competition and selection e¤ects such as Melitz
(2003). This implies that care must be taken when interpreting the elasticity of trade ows with respect to
tari¤s obtained from Caliendo and Parro (2015) type estimations in such environments. See also Felbermayr
et al (2013) and Felbermayr et al (2015).




                                                    21
application section where the elasticity estimates are shown to be important drivers of optimal

tari¤s, Nash tari¤s, and cooperative tari¤s as well as their associated welfare e¤ects. Unfortu-

nately, it seems di¢cult to overcome the identi cation problem since convincing instruments

are hard to come by for many countries and industries. The natural alternative is to present

all results for a range of elasticity estimates and then interpret them with the level of caution

they need.

       Moreover, the elasticity estimation is often the only time when the model is seriously

confronted with the data because all gravity models can be trivially made to match bilateral

trade ows in levels by choosing appropriate iceberg trade costs. The analysis of Caliendo and

Parro (2015) represents a commendable exception to this rule because the authors actually

try to match the trade growth following NAFTA given the tari¤ cuts NAFTA implied. In

my view, much more work is needed along these lines because di¤erent gravity models have

di¤erent predictions even though they can all match the levels perfectly ne. For example,

multi-sector Krugman (1980) models feature home-market e¤ects whereas multi-sector Eaton

and Kortum (2002) models dont and the quantitative literature so far has little to say about

which one works best.

       A more general concern in the same spirit is that most gravity models so far impose very

strong assumptions on the nature of demand elasticities. In particular, demand elasticities

are usually assumed not to vary across countries which amounts to saying that preferences

are the same everywhere. Also, demand elasticities are assumed to be constant which seems

more plausible as a local approximation than as a global property holding along the entire

demand curve. While the rst concern seems to apply to all quantitative trade analyses, the

second one could be particularly important for optimal tari¤ calculations such as the ones

performed here. As will become clear in the below application section, the estimated optimal

tari¤s are rather high in constant elasticity models so that the extrapolation is taken quite

far.14
  14
    While the methods of Feenstra (1994) and Caliendo and Parro (2014) are commonly used to estimate
trade elasticities, they are by no means the only approaches o¤ered in the literature. For example, Eaton and
Kortum (2002) develop an alternative procedure based on price data which has recently been extended by
Simonovska and Waugh (2014).

2.2.2      Trade de cits

Static models like the one used in this chapter really have no compelling way of rationalizing

aggregate trade de cits. As a result, they are usually accounted for in an ad hoc manner

by introducing international transfers such as the ones labelled                   i   above.15 E¤ectively, the

assumption is that countries running trade surpluses nance the trade de cits of the other

ones. The mechanics of this can be seen by combining the budget constraint (8) with the
                     P       PS
requirement that Ei = N m=1    s=1  mis Xmis by de nition. Recalling the shorthand  ijs =

1 + tijs from above, this yields

                                                 X S
                                                 N X              N X
                                                                  X S
                                         i   =             Xins             Xmis                            (21)
                                                 n=1 s=1          m=1 s=1


       A common assumption is now to leave the trade de cits unchanged when performing

counterfactuals by imposing          0       =        for all i. However, this assumption is problematic for
                                     i            i

two reasons. First, it implies extreme general equilibrium adjustments for high tari¤s as the

model then tries to reconcile falling trade volumes with constant aggregate trade de cits and

cannot hold at all in the limit as tari¤s approach in nity. Second, it requires a decision in

which units the aggregate trade de cits are to be measured which often seems to be made

unconsciously in the literature by choosing a particular numeraire. To see this, notice that

the budget constraint (8) implies that real income includes a term                      i
                                                                                       Pi   so that it matters in

what units      i   is held xed.

       In Ossa (2014), I suggest one possible solution to this problem which is to simply eliminate

all aggregate trade de cits before performing any trade policy counterfactuals. In particular,

the idea is to set      0   = 0 for all i and use the equations summarized in De nition 2 above to
                        i
                                                           0
calculate a counterfactual matrix of bilateral trade ows Xijs which is free of trade de cits.

This is essentially a replication of the exercise performed by Dekle et al (2007) which popu-

larized the "exact hat algebra" approach introduced above. Notice that the abovementioned

measurement problem does not arise in this particular application because all transfers are

set equal to zero anyway.
  15
     Instead of modeling i as an exogenous transfer of country i, one could also model it as the endogenous
portion of country is income accruing to foreign shareholders who own part of country is economy. This idea
is developed more fully by Caliendo et al (2014) in an economic geography environment.


                                                             23
   Table 2 summarizes the e¤ects of this procedure using the 10 region, 33 industry, GTAP

data used in the below application section. The rst column lists the aggregate trade de cits in

the raw data calculated as aggregate exports minus aggregate imports as a share of aggregate

export plus aggregate imports. The second and third columns summarize the percentage

changes in the values of exports and imports the model predicts as a result of setting    0   =0
                                                                                          i

for all i. As one would expect, aggregate trade imbalances are large in the raw data so that

exports and imports have to change substantially to eliminate them.

   While I work with this purged dataset in the below application section, it seems clear to

me that a better solution to the aggregate trade de cit problem needs to be found. The ideal,

of course, would be to set up a dynamic model which can rationalize aggregate trade de cits

by appealing to intertemporal trade. Such a model would also allow for the possibility to

study how trade policy and aggregate trade imbalances interact. So far, the literature largely

treats aggregate trade imbalances as orthogonal to trade policy and investigating this further

seems like a great opportunity for future work.


2.2.3   Optimization

While solving for optimal tari¤s, Nash tari¤s, or cooperative tari¤s is not a hard problem in

principle, making it feasible in practice has been the main challenge faced by this literature.

To see this, consider the problem of calculating optimal tari¤s in a model with 10 regions

and 33 industries such as the one considered in the below application section. Since each

country can choose a di¤erent tari¤ against each trading partner, solving for one countrys

optimal tari¤s already involves solving an optimization problem with 9*33=297 arguments.

This becomes even more complex when cooperative tari¤s are considered because countries

then have to jointly set 10*9*33=2,970 tari¤s e¢ciently.

   In light of this, it is important to carefully choose the numerical approach. In my expe-

rience, three strategies have proven particularly e¤ective. First, formulating the problem in

such a way that the number of variables which have to be solved for numerically is minimized.

Second, using an algorithm in the mathematical programming with equilibrium constraints

(MPEC) tradition such as the one recently suggested by Su and Judd (2012). And third, pro-

viding the solver with analytical rst-derivatives of the objective functions and the constraints


                                              24
so that they do not have to be repeatedly approximated numerically.

    While the second and third point require a more extensive elaboration, the rst point is

much more easily explained. As will become clear shortly, calculating optimal tari¤s, Nash

tari¤s, and cooperative tari¤s is best done using the equations summarized in De nition 2.

In this context, minimizing the number of numerically solved variables just means writing
                                                                  n        o

                                                                         ^i . While this is

already made explicit in the statement of De nition 2, the problem could have been formulated

alternatively as one which includes P^is or X
                                            ^ ijs in the list of unknowns which would have

drastically increased the number of numerically solved variables.


Optimal tari¤s To understand the idea behind the MPEC approach, it is useful to begin

by considering a more naive way of formulating the optimal tari¤ problem using the equations

summarized in De nition 2:

   This formulation would be implemented in MATLAB following a two-stage approach.

First, one would de ne a function which computes welfare changes as a function of tari¤

changes by solving a system of nonlinear equations, for example using "fsolve". Second, one

would apply an optimization routine to this function calculating the tari¤ changes which

maximize the welfare change for the country in question, for example "fminunc". While this

would work ne in applications with few countries and industries, it would quickly become

ine¢cient for larger scale problems simply because the "fsolve" algorithm would solve the

function with high accuracy for each iteration of the "fminunc" routine.

   The MPEC approach circumvents this problem by treating the equilibrium conditions as

constraints. It has recently received much attention in the context of structural estimation

following the work of Su and Judd (2012). Using their logic, it is useful to restate Problem 1

as follows:

    This formulation can be implemented in MATLAB using a constrained optimization solver

such as "fmincon". In the MATLAB programs posted on the website accompanying this

chapter, I actually follow Su and Judds (2012) recommendation to use the KNITRO version

of MATLABs "fmincon" for improved speed and accuracy. While Problem 1 and Problem

2 are formally identical, Problem 2 can be solved much more quickly numerically. This is

simply because most solvers do not enforce constraints to be satis ed until the nal iteration

which eliminates much of the abovementioned redundant accuracy.

    Most solvers allow the user to manually supply the rst-derivatives of the objective func-

tion and the constraints improving speed and accuracy. While this is a relatively tedious

endeavour, it is well worth the e¤ort in my experience because it improves the algorithms

performance in large-scale problems signi cantly. The derivative of the objective function

from Problem 2 is simply a 3N + (N                  1)S-by-1 vector with a   1 as its lth element and zeros

everywhere else. Denoting the constraints from Problem 2 by the functions Fi (:), Gi (:), and

refers to the value of    ijs   at the counterfactual tari¤s with a similar logic applying to similar

expressions above. All expressions are simply partial derivatives and should be relatively easy

to derive. Of course, it is easy to make mistakes when implementing this in practice especially

since all derivatives also have to be stacked in exactly the right way. However, most solvers

can check user-supplied derivatives numerically so that those mistake are usually relatively

easy to nd.

   Figures 1a and 1b display the results of testing the above procedure for calculating optimal

tari¤s in a simple two-country one-industry example using MATLAB programs which are

available on the website accompanying this chapter. The example uses the same data I use

in the below application section but aggregates it to two countries and one industry with

the two countries being Canada and the US. As will become clear later, countries set tari¤s

purely for terms-of-trade motives in the one industry special case of this model so that the

classic optimal tari¤ argument applies. In particular, the terms-of-trade gain outweighs the

distortion loss for small enough tari¤s so that the optimal tari¤ is positive.

   Figure 1a plots the welfare e¤ects of unilateral changes in the US tari¤ against Canada

using the equations summarized in De nition 2. It also shows the optimal US tari¤ calcu-

lated using the above MPEC procedure as a grey vertical line. As can be seen, the welfare

maximizing US tari¤ indeed coincides with the shown optimal US tari¤ so that the applied

optimization procedure seems to work. Figure 1b repeats this for the optimal Canadian tari¤

yielding the same basic results. Besides providing simple veri cation checks, Figures 1a and


                                                     30
1b also reveal interesting economic points which I discuss in more detail later on. In particu-

lar, notice that the US optimal tari¤ is larger than the Canadian optimal tari¤ and that the

welfare e¤ects on Canada are always larger than the welfare e¤ects on the US.


Nash tari¤s       Given an e¢cient algorithm to calculate optimal tari¤s, Nash tari¤s can be

computed relatively straightforwardly. Recall that Nash tari¤s are optimal tari¤s with retal-

iation, that is the best-response tari¤s one would expect to prevail in a full-blown tari¤ war.

Perroni and Whalley (2000) already report that iteration over optimal tari¤s typically yields

fast convergence to a seemingly unique result. The procedure is to simply impose optimal

tari¤s given factual tari¤s and then reoptimize repeatedly until the best-response equilibrium

is found. Figure 2 illustrates why this works in the simple Canada-US example by plotting

the best-response functions of both countries. As can be seen, the best response functions

are relatively at and have a unique intersection which explains why an iterative algorithm

quickly converges.

   While it is obvious that there is a unique Nash equilibrium in Figure 2, this of course

does not necessarily have to extend to cases with many countries and industries. However, I

have been unable to nd multiple Nash equilibria even in more complicated applications when

exploring the implications of choosing di¤erent starting points. A trivial exception to this is

autarky which is a Nash equilibrium in all tari¤ games simply because any countrys unilateral

trade liberalization would not trigger any trade in general equilibrium if all other countries

keep their tari¤s at in nity. Trying to formally prove the conjecture that there is a unique

interior Nash equilibrium would be an interesting objective for future work. One possible

approach would be to explore the formal properties of the rst-order conditions summarized

in De nition 3.


Cooperative tari¤s Calculating cooperative tari¤s is far more challenging than calculating

optimal tari¤s and Nash tari¤s because all countries tari¤s have to be chosen at the same time.

It is also best done by using an MPEC algorithm and supplying analytical rst-derivatives.

As I discuss more extensively in the below application section, cooperative tari¤s are not just

zero for three reasons. First, there is an entire e¢ciency frontier even in perfectly competitive



                                               31
models of which free trade is only one point. Second, governments might use cooperative tari¤s

as a second-best policy to correct existing distortions in imperfectly competitive environments.

And third, political economy pressures might imply that free trade is not e¢cient from the

point of view of governments even though it might be e¢cient from the point of view of the

population as a whole.

    Cooperative tari¤s can be calculated by applying a bargaining protocol in the spirit of

symmetric Nash bargaining assuming that countries equally split all e¢ciency gains. This can

be implemented by extending the MPEC formulation of the optimal tari¤ problem summarized

in Problem 2 above. In particular, allowing the optimization to be over all tari¤ changes and

not just the tari¤ changes of country l, assuming that the objective is to maximize the welfare

change of country 1 and not country l, and imposing a fourth set of constraints ensuring

that all countries welfare changes are the same, the bargaining problem can be formulated

as follows:17

      As will become clear shortly in the discussion surrounding Figure 3, there is no unique e¢cient tari¤ vector
but instead an entire e¢ciency frontier. While the suggested algorithm identi es the point on the e¢ciency
frontier which ensures that all countries welfare changes are the same, one could alternatively try to identify
the point on the e¢ciency frontier which maximizes the sum of all countries welfares as is often done in the
theoretical
      P Ciliterature.    In practice, this would involve maximizing the sum of all countries welfares in changes,
i.e.            C^ , which would require data on P Ci .

Problem 3 also build on the derivatives associated with Problem 2. The derivative of the

objective function from Problem 3 is now a 3N + N (N                                              1)S-by-1 vector with a                            1 as its rst

    Figure 3 illustrates the cooperative tari¤s using the simple US-Canada example from above

and compares them to the Nash tari¤s calculated previously. Again, the MATLAB programs

generating this gure are available on the website accompanying this chapter and provide more

details on exactly how this gure is drawn. While cooperative tari¤s are calculated using the

MPEC approach summarized in Problem 3, I have allowed for asymmetric bargaining weights

just for this example to be able to trace out a whole segment of the e¢ciency frontier. Readers

familiar with the theoretical trade policy literature will recognize Figure 3 as a quantitative

example of a familiar illustration of cooperative and noncooperative tari¤s which can be found,

for example, in Bagwell and Staiger (2002).

    The curve labelled E is simply the e¢ciency frontier tracing out combinations of Pareto

e¢cient tari¤s obtained by solving a version of Problem 3 with varying bargaining weights.

As can be seen, free trade is on the e¢ciency frontier in the one sector special case of our

model which I discuss in more detail later on. The other curves are iso-welfare loci of the US

and Canada which are solid and dashed, respectively. I have drawn one small pair passing

through free trade and another larger pair passing through the Nash equilibrium tari¤s which

I have labelled N. As one would expect, the smaller ones are tangent to one another at zero

tari¤s whereas the larger ones intersect perpendicularly at Nash tari¤s.



3      Application

I now put the above tools to work in a more serious application, calculating the optimal tari¤s,

Nash tari¤s, and cooperative tari¤s for the 10 largest trading blocks of the world. This is

essentially an extension of my analysis in Ossa (2014) from 7 to 10 regions and is supposed

to highlight some of the main results which have been obtained so far. In the interest of

minimizing replication, I limit my discussion to some key points in this section and refer the

reader to Ossa (2014) for a more comprehensive analysis.

3.1    Data

Obtaining the necessary data on trade ows and tari¤s is not as easy as one might think. The

main complication regarding the trade data is to obtain the diagonal elements of the trade

matrix capturing within-country ows especially at the industry level. The main di¢culty

regarding the tari¤ data is to get accurate ad valorem equivalents of speci c tari¤s which

are hard to compute because converting per-unit tari¤s into per-value equivalents requires

price data. In my experience, a particularly convenient source is the Global Trade Analysis

Project (GTAP) database which is available from the Department of Agricultural Economics

at Purdue University. While commonly used for a quantitative general equilibrium model

called the GTAP model, the database can also be downloaded for alternative uses which is

what I did for my application here.

   In particular, I work with a 10 region and 33 industry aggregation of the GTAP 8 database

for the year 2007. I include the worlds 9 largest trading blocks and a residual Rest of

the World as well as all available agricultural and manufacturing industries. The GTAP

8 database is itself based on a number of data sources which are carefully cleaned by a

large team of researchers to ensure global consistency. Speci cally, the international trade

data is mainly drawn from the UNs Comtrade database, its domestic trade data is mainly

constructed from national input-output accounts, and the tari¤ data is mainly taken from

the International Trade Centres Market Access Map database. The database is documented

in Narayanan et al (2012) which can be accessed directly from the GTAP website under

https://www.gtap.agecon.purdue.edu.18

   While the most recent editions of the GTAP data have to be purchased, earlier versions

are available free of charge. To use the data outside of the GTAP model, one has to follow

a number of steps. First, one has to aggregate the data as needed using a GTAP-supplied

software called "GTAPAgg" which saves the aggregated data as ".har" les. Second, these

".har" les have to be converted into ".csv" les using a GEMPACK program called "har2csv"
  18
     While the GTAP data is particularly useful in my experience, there are a num-
ber of other excellent data sources such as CEPII databases which can be accessed under
http://www.cepii.fr/cepii/en/bdd_modele/bdd.asp and the World Input Output Database which can
be accessed under http://www.wiod.org/new_site/home.htm. Many researchers also make use of the World
Banks Word Integrated Trade Solution available under http://wits.worldbank.org/ and the NBER-UN data
available under http://cid.econ.ucdavis.edu/data/undata/undata.html.

which can be executed with a simple batch le. These ".csv" les can then be imported into

MATLAB and used normally. The original GTAP data spans all sectors of the economy. I

simply drop all industries which do not belong to the agricultural or manufacturing sector and

further aggregate a few agricultural sectors to match the Comtrade data used in the elasticity

estimation above.


3.2        Welfare e¤ects

Before considering optimal tari¤s, Nash tari¤s, and e¢cient tari¤s, it is useful to illustrate

the welfare e¤ects of tari¤ changes in this environment. This can be done most clearly by

totally di¤erentiating the budget constraint and the price index from De nition 1. Assuming

d   = 0 for simplicity and recalling that industry revenues are split between industry labor
     i
                             P
income and industry pro ts, N  n=1 Xins = wi Lis +  is , this yields:

bundle. Here, the terms-of-trade e¤ect can also be interpreted as a relative wage e¤ect because

a countrys export bundle only becomes more expensive relative to its import bundle if its

wage goes up relative to the wages of its trading partners. Notice that this close link between

relative prices and relative wages implies that tari¤s always change the terms-of-trade in all

industries at the same time. It would be interesting to explore setups in which this would

no longer be true for example by allowing for variable markups, changing marginal costs,

multiple mobile factors of production, or input-ouput linkages.

    The second term of this decomposition is a "new trade" pro t shifting e¤ect. It captures

that a country bene ts if its pro ts increase on aggregate because of a reallocation of resources

                                                                             P
that industry pro ts equal a share 1s of industry revenues,  is = 1s N        j=1 Mis pis  ijs cijs ,

technology (2), and the identity Lis = Mis lis . It can be shown that the pro t shifting e¤ect is

equal to zero if  s =  for all s which makes sense since there is no variation in pro tability

across industries if markups are the same everywhere.

    To illustrate this, the upper panel of Table 3 shows the general equilibrium adjustments

following a unilateral increase in the tari¤s protecting the US chemicals or apparel industry

by 50 percentage points. As can be seen, this intervention increases the US wage relative to

other countries and allows the US to expand its protected industry at the expense of its other

industries. Intuitively, a unilateral increase in protection makes imports more expensive for

domestic consumers so that they switch expenditure towards the protected domestic industry.

This then allows the protected US industry to expand which bids up wages and forces the

other industries in the US to contract. These general equilibrium e¤ects are computed using

the equilibrium conditions in changes summarized in De nition 2.

    The lower panel of Table 3 then turns to the associated welfare e¤ects. As can be seen,

the US bene ts from the unilateral intervention in the chemicals industry but loses from the

unilateral intervention in the apparel industry. While the terms-of-trade e¤ects are positive in

both cases as a result of the increase in the US relative wage, the pro t shifting e¤ect is positive

if the US protects the chemicals industry but negative if the US protect the apparel industry.

The explanation for this is simply that the chemicals industry is a relatively high pro tability


                                                   37
industry because its products have a relatively low elasticity of substitution whereas the

apparel industry is a relatively low pro tability industry because its products have a relatively

low elasticity of substitution, as can be seen from the elasticity estimates in Table 1.

    Notice that the pro t shifting e¤ect disappears from decomposition (31) in the special
                                                        1                    d i   dpi

model is actually isomorphic to an Armington (1969) model (and indeed many other gravity

models) which is just an example of the point made by Arkolakis et al (2012). However,

di¤erent versions of decomposition (31) apply in di¤erent multi-sector gravity models because

the strict isomorphism then breaks down. For example, it can be shown that only the terms-of-

trade e¤ect remains in a multi-sector Armington (1969) model. Also, it can be shown that the

3.3    Optimal tari¤s

Figure 4 illustrates the optimal tari¤s of all countries calculated using the methods introduced

above. Recall that optimal tari¤s are de ned as welfare-maximizing tari¤s without retaliation

so that this gure contains 10 separate policy experiments. In particular, each panel focuses on

one country and shows its optimal tari¤s for all trading partners and all industries assuming

that all other countries continue to impose their factual tari¤s. Each dot represents the

optimal tari¤ in one industry against one trading partner and industries are ranked along the

horizontal axis in increasing order of their elasticities. I was able to calculate these optimal

tari¤s in around 15 minutes using a high-end desktop which suggests that the analysis could

be easily extended beyond 10 regions and 33 industries.

    As one would expect from the above examples, the optimal tari¤s are positive for all

countries, industries, and trading partners and tend to be lower in higher elasticity industries.

By imposing positive tari¤s, countries improve their relative wages generating positive terms-

of-trade e¤ects. By tilting tari¤s towards low elasticity industries, they further shift resources
  20
     In this case, countries would still bene t from a reallocation of resources towards low  s industries but now
because this decreases the aggregate price index. In particular, consumers prefer local varieties to imported
varieties because they are delivered without trade costs. Moreover, this preference is more pronounced for
more di¤erentiated varieties so that consumers would rather have low  s varieties produced nearby.




                                                        38
towards more pro table industries generating positive pro t shifting e¤ects. While optimal

tari¤s tend to be lower in higher elasticity industries, the gure also makes clear that this is

not always the case. This simply reects the fact that optimal tari¤s also depend on other

factors such as the industrys trade exposure as the simple two-country one-industry optimal

tari¤ formula discussed earlier already made clear.

   Table 4a turns to the welfare e¤ects of these optimal tari¤s always listing the e¤ects on

the tari¤ imposing country as well as the averages of the e¤ects on all other countries. As can

be seen, real income increases by an average 2.4 percent for the tari¤ imposing country and

decreases by an average -0.6 percent elsewhere. Countries can bene t at the expense of other

countries because the terms-of-trade and pro t shifting e¤ects have a beggar-thy-neighbor

character. As can be seen, wages go up in the tari¤ imposing country relative to all other

countries and pro ts go up in the tari¤ imposing country at the other countries expense.

Table 4a also lists the median optimal tari¤s which reveal that the optimal tari¤s tend to be

higher for economically larger countries as one would expect.

   Table 4b illustrates that the optimal tari¤s as well as their welfare e¤ects are strongly

decreasing in the average elasticity. In particular, I take the original elasticity estimates from

Table 1 and scale them proportionately to have a mean of 3.5, 5.0, or 6.5. I then redo all

calculations required to construct Table 4a for these scaled values and report the last row

of Table 4a in Table 4b. As can be seen, the average optimal tari¤s more than halves when

using elasticity estimates with mean 6.5 instead of mean 3.5 which simply reects the fact

that countries then have less monopoly power to exploit in world markets. Recall that the

elasticity estimates average to 3.44 in the original calculations which is why the last row of

Table 4a di¤ers slightly from the rst row of Table 4b.

   In Ossa (2014), I also explore the case in which governments are politically motivated so

that the welfare weights in the government preferences (3) deviate from 1. Wjs is then de ned

as the welfare of industry s in country j which is just the nominal income accruing to the

associated workers and rms deated by the ideal aggregate price index. The welfare weights
                                P
js are normalized to satisfy S1 Ss=1 js = 1 so that one dollar of income accruing to industry

s in country j matters js as much to the government as one dollar of income accruing to an

industry which receives average political support. This is meant to capture political economy


                                               39
motives such as the ones emphasized by Grossman and Helpman (1994) in a reduced form

way.

   I show that the political economy weights can be calibrated such that the distribution

of optimal tari¤s matches the distribution of noncooperative tari¤s from the data. These

noncooperative tari¤s include tari¤s such as the so-called column-two tari¤s of the US which

are applied to countries with which the US does not have normal trade relations. With the

exception of China, the predicted optimal tari¤s are substantially higher than the measured

noncooperative tari¤s given the baseline elasticity estimates. However, the levels can also

be brought in line much more closely if the higher elasticities from the sensitivity checks are

used. The bottom line is that the average optimal tari¤s and their average welfare e¤ects are

quite similar with and without political economy pressures. This is because political economy

pressures are more about the intranational rather than the international redistribution of

rents.

   While the calibrated political economy weights appear highly plausible with the most

favored sectors being wearing apparel, dairy, textiles, beverages and tobacco products, and

wheat, they could also just capture other determinants of trade policy that the underlying

model fails to account for. In order to investigate this possibility further, it would be in-

teresting to relate the calibrated political economy weights to observables such as campaign

contributions which the earlier empirical literature has emphasized (see, for example, Gawande

and Krishna (2003) for an excellent overview).


3.4      Trade wars

Figure 5 illustrates the Nash tari¤s of all countries using the same template as Figure 4. Recall

that Nash tari¤s capture the best-response tari¤s that would prevail in a full-blown tari¤ war

so that Figure 5 now summarizes a single policy experiment. As can be seen from comparing

Figure 4 and Figure 5, the Nash tari¤s are very similar to the optimal tari¤s suggesting

that the best response functions are again relatively at just like in the simple US-Canada

example discussed earlier. Using the optimal tari¤s as a starting point, the iterative algorithm

calculating Nash tari¤s discussed above converges in around 20 minutes on my desktop so that

the analysis could again easily be extended beyond 10 regions and 33 industries.

                                               40
   Table 5a summarizes the welfare e¤ects of moving from factual tari¤s to Nash tari¤s. The

real-world analog to this is a breakdown of trade policy cooperation escalating in a full-blown

tari¤ war. As can be seen, all countries lose from the tari¤ war with the average welfare

loss equalling -3.5 percent. The losses are most severe for Canada which is explained by

the fact that Canada is the most open economy in the sample followed by the Rest of the

World, Korea, and Russia who also lose a lot. The losses are least severe for Japan which is

due to Japans ine¢cient factual trade policy. In particular, Japan imposes extreme tari¤s

on agricultural products such as a 237 percent tari¤ on rice so that a move to Nash tari¤s

actually reduces its self-inicted distortions signi cantly.

   Table 5b again reports sensitivity checks for proportionately scaled versions of the elastici-

ties. Just like optimal tari¤s, Nash tari¤s and their welfare e¤ects are also strongly decreasing

in the elasticities, as one would expect from the similarity between the two. I consider mean

elasticities between 3.5 and 6.5 because this corresponds to the range of aggregate trade elas-

ticities suggested by Simonovska and Waugh (2014). This range also captures what most

empirical trade economists would regard as reasonable today so that the average Nash tari¤s

consistent with the model are somewhere between 25 percent and 57 percent. This is broadly

consistent with the tari¤s imposed during the trade war following the Great Depression which

are typically reported to average around 50 percent.


3.5   Trade talks

Figures 6a, 6b, and 6c illustrate the outcomes of e¢cient trade negotiations starting at Nash

tari¤s, factual tari¤s, and free trade, respectively. They are computed by implementing a

bargaining protocol in the spirit of symmetric Nash bargaining just as discussed above. In

particular, I rst simulate the equilibria given Nash tari¤s, factual tari¤s, and free trade and

then solve for the tari¤ change which maximizes country 1s welfare subject to the condition

that all countries gain the same. This is supposed to simulate the outcome of perfect trade

negotiations, that is the best-case scenario of what can be achieved under the WTO. Calcu-

lating these cooperative tari¤s is very demanding computationally and takes approximately

one full day per case on my desktop computer.

   As can be seen from these       gures, cooperative tari¤s have very similar cross-industry

                                               41
distributions across all three cases but vary with respect to the average levels with which

they apply. The cross-industry distributions reect countries attempts to correct a distortion

originating from the fact that prices are too high in low elasticity industries. The cross-

country distribution reects countries attempt to make implicit side payments ensuring that

the bargaining protocol is satis ed and all countries gain the same. For that reason, the

tari¤ levels vary across the three cases because the three di¤erent benchmarks require three

di¤erent sets of side payments for all e¢ciency gains to be equally spread.

   For example, we have seen above that Canada loses most as a result of the tari¤ war

which is why all countries impose high tari¤s against Canada in the case of trade negotiations

starting at Nash tari¤s summarized in Figure 6a. Essentially, Canadas terms-of-trade have

to be su¢ciently bad in equilibrium to ensure that Canada does not gain more than anyone

else. Similarly, Japan faces the highest tari¤s following the trade negotiations starting at

factual tari¤s summarized in Figure 6b because Japan would otherwise gain too much from

dismantling its ine¢cient factual tari¤ regime. Of course, this would look di¤erent if one

explicitly allowed for side payments, which might be more realistic since import subsidies are

rarely seen.

   Table 6a lists the welfare bene ts associated with these trade negotiations. As can be seen,

moving from Nash tari¤s to cooperative tari¤s improves each countrys welfare by 3.5 percent

so that this number can be seen as the maximum possible value of the WTO. In contrast,

moving from factual tari¤s to e¢cient tari¤s only improves welfare by 0.4 percent suggesting

that almost 90 percent of all possible welfare gains have already been realized in past trade

negotiations. The nding that trade negotiations starting at free trade would only increase

welfare by 0.1 percent con rms that tari¤s are a poor instrument to address distortions. This

should have been expected from the targeting principle which implies that distortions are best

addressed with the appropriate direct policy instruments.

   In Ossa (2014), I also explore the implications of the most-favored nation (MFN) clause

of the WTO which generally prohibits countries from applying discriminatory tari¤s against

other countries. I start by recalculating optimal tari¤s and Nash tari¤s under the restric-

tion of MFN to see if this clause by itself has any bite. I nd that the welfare results are

almost identical to the unrestricted case which also makes sense given the small amount of


                                              42
discrimination shown in Figures 4 and 5. I then consider if trade liberalizations of a group of

insider countries a¤ect nonparticipating outsider countries if the insider countries extend their

concessions to the outsider countries in an MFN fashion. I nd that these MFN tari¤s cuts

would actually overcompensate the outsiders for the trade diversion they experience which

quali es earlier results from Bagwell and Staiger (2005).


3.6   Discussion

If one is willing to take the model as a maintained hypothesis, the above results can be

viewed as providing answers to questions of immediate policy relevance. For example, they

illustrate what would happen if there was a complete breakdown of trade policy cooperation

and quantify how much there is to gain from future tari¤ negotiations. If one instead takes a

more cautious approach, they can be interpreted as a plausibility check on some of the leading

models of trade policy making. For example, they show that the Nash tari¤s are of the same

order of magnitude as the tari¤s observed during the trade war following the Great Depression

and highlight that there is enough to gain from trade policy cooperation to plausibly justify

the ordeal of real-world trade negotiations organized by the WTO.

   While I believe that the model captures many important forces, I lean towards taking a

cautious interpretation for now, simply because much more can be done to explore the models

validity. One obvious task seems to be to assess how sensitive the results are to alternative

assumptions about the economic environment. For example, it would be interesting to explore

what happens if one introduces intermediate goods and nontraded goods into the analysis

which clearly feature prominently in the real world. Also, it would be fascinating to carefully

confront the quantitative predictions of the model with the trade war following the Great

Depression to see if the highlighted forces are consistent with what has been observed.

   With that in mind, it is still insightful to elaborate on what the numbers suggest so

far. In particular, if one combines the welfare e¤ects from Tables 5a and 6a with data on

manufacturing and agricultural value added from 2007, it is straightforward to calculate that

a complete breakdown of trade policy cooperation would cost the world approximately $300

billion per year while further tari¤ negotiations could bring about gains of approximately $40

billion per year. So, to the extent that one credits the WTO for preventing the outbreak

                                               43
of trade wars and blames the WTO for failing to promote further trade talks, one has to

conclude that the WTOs track record is quite impressive so far.21



4         Extensions

In this section, I discuss a number of promising directions in which this literature could be

taken in future work. Overall, the trade policy literature so far is long on theory and short on

quanti cation so that there is an abundance of opportunities for interesting research. I orga-

nize my discussion into three main categories, namely alternative models, other trade policy

applications, and applications in other elds. As will become clear shortly, the applications

in other elds I envision also have a trade policy character but answer questions which are

normally associated with other literatures.


4.1        Alternative models

Perhaps the most obvious direction for future work in this area is to analyze optimal tari¤s,

Nash tari¤s, and cooperative tari¤s in a range of alternative gravity models applying the

techniques introduced above. The Handbook of International Economics chapter of Costinot

and Rodriguez-Clare (2015) is a great resource for researchers interested in this area because

it provides a comprehensive overview of how the many di¤erent gravity models relate. In fact,

their chapter already includes a short section on the e¤ects of tari¤s in various gravity models

which can serve as an excellent starting point.

         An important contribution of such analyses would be to assess the robustness of the

results provided so far. As mentioned earlier, introducing intermediate goods should be a high

priority in my opinion given how central they are to international trade. In the process of

writing this chapter, I have actually experimented with this already but ultimately concluded

that it requires a more thorough treatment than I can o¤er here. One complication is that

intermediate goods introduce a factor market distortion into the Ossa (2014) model giving

rise to a new margin for optimal tari¤s to manipulate. In particular, rms then buy labor

so that relative intermediate goods prices are too high. While this could turn out to be an

interesting mechanism, it might make more sense to rst characterize optimal tari¤s with

intermediate goods in a perfectly competitive model such as Caliendo and Parros (2015)

extension of Eaton and Kortum (2002).

   Another interesting extension would be to relax the exclusive focus on tari¤s and allow for

alternative policy instruments. In my assessment, it would be particularly useful to disentangle

the questions of optimal allocation and implementation by following the primal approach of

the public nance literature. An interesting example of this is the recent analysis by Costinot

et al (2015) who solve for optimal trade policy in a Ricardian trade model. They rst assume

that governments can directly control the resource allocation as social planners and then ask

how their preferred allocations can be implemented with a particular set of policy instruments.

While their paper is predominantly theoretical, they also provide some quanti cations which

would be interesting to expand upon.


4.2   Other trade policy applications

While a quanti cation of optimal tari¤s, Nash tari¤s, and cooperative tari¤s is probably a

natural rst application of the above techniques, they could really be used to connect most

branches of the theoretical trade policy literature to the data. As an illustration, let me

focus on the part of the theoretical literature which emphasizes the world trading systems

institutional design. In a nutshell, WTO members are supposed to concentrate all protective

measures into tari¤s, apply these tari¤s on a nondiscriminatory basis, and change these tari¤s

in a reciprocal fashion. Inuenced by Bagwell and Staiger (1999), an extensive literature

has studied the implications of these and other WTO principles and their exceptions for the

e¢ciency of trade negotiations.

   Consider rst the principle of nondiscrimination which has the important exception that

WTO members are allowed to enter into preferential trade agreements under some conditions.

This exception is controversial in the theoretical literature for three main reasons. First, there

is a concern that joining preferential trade agreements causes trade diversion which can even

make the parties to the preferential trade agreement worse o¤ (Viner, 1950). Second, there is

a discussion whether preferential trade agreements encourage or discourage further liberaliza-

                                               45
tions and are therefore building blocks or stumbling blocks on the way to free trade (Bhagwati,

1991). And third, there is an argument that MFN tari¤s protect outsiders to reciprocal trade

liberalizations from any externalities and work in conjunction with the principle of reciprocity

to guide countries to the e¢ciency frontier (Bagwell and Staiger, 1999).

   A quantitative analysis could shed some new light on this debate. First of all, the equilib-

rium conditions in changes summarized in De nition 2 could be used to quantify the extent

of trade diversion real-world trade agreements bring about. My conjecture is that these ef-

fects are negligible when focusing on tari¤ changes alone but that they might become more

important when changes in non-tari¤ barriers are also taken into account. Nowadays, many

preferential trade agreements also reduce non-tari¤ barriers as part of some deep integration

process and measuring such reductions convincingly would be the key challenge to overcome.

   Moreover, a modi ed version of the optimization procedure summarized in Problem 2 could

be used to assess which preferential trade agreements countries would optimally sign. Besides

speaking to the building blocks versus stumbling blocks debate, this could readdress the

inuential question asked by Baier and Bergstrand (2004) whether the observed proliferation

of preferential trade agreements is consistent with welfare maximization. In this context,

it could also be explored how members of preferential trade agreements would optimally

adjust their external tari¤s thereby assessing the abovementioned Bagwell and Staiger (1999)

argument.

   Consider now the principle of reciprocity which is only a norm during phases of trade

liberalization but binds more strictly when retaliatory actions are concerned. In particular,

WTO member countries are authorized to withdraw substantially equivalent concessions if

one of their trading partners reneges on previously made tari¤ commitments. In practice, this

institutionalized threat of retaliation tends to prevent trading partners from reneging in the

 rst place and can thus be interpreted as an explicit tit-for-tat rule aimed at ensuring that

trade agreements are self-enforcing.

   A quantitative analysis could help determine how much bite this interpretation has. In

particular, the welfare e¤ects associated with optimal tari¤s summarized in Table 4a quantify

the value of unilateral deviations from the status quo. Also, the welfare e¤ects associated

with Nash tari¤s summarized in Table 4b quantify the costs of a breakdown of trade policy


                                              46
cooperation which a unilateral deviation would likely entail. Given a discount factor, one

could now calculate the most cooperative tari¤s which can be sustained in a repeated game

in the spirit of Bagwell and Staiger (1990). In doing so, one could also distinguish between

bilateral and multilateral enforcement mechanisms along the lines of Maggi (1999).

   Moreover, it would be interesting to quantify how important it is for the success of trade

negotiations that the principle of reciprocity applies multilaterally instead of bilaterally. As is

discussed more extensively in Bagwell et al (2015) as well as Chapter 8 of this Handbook, one

of the key innovations of the General Agreement on Tari¤s and Trade (GATT) relative to the

earlier US Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act was to relax the bilateral reciprocity constraint

and replace it with a multilateral one. The basic idea is that it is easier to nd an overall

balance of concessions if it does not have to apply individually for each country pair.


4.3   Applications in other elds

While these examples should su¢ce to illustrate that there are many interesting opportunities

for quantitative work within the traditional trade policy literature, it is also easy to think of

closely related applications in other elds. For example, I use similar tools in Ossa (2015)

to study subsidy competition among US states in a quantitative economic geography model.

US states spend substantial resources to subsidize the relocation of rms from other states. I

show that this is consistent with welfare maximization because rm relocations allow states

to bene t at the expense of other states. I also show that observed subsidies are much closer

to cooperative than to noncooperative levels but that the potential costs of an escalation of

subsidy competition are large.

   It would be interesting to extend this analysis beyond the domestic US economy and

analyze subsidies o¤ered to attract foreign rms. This could then be tied in again with the

traditional trade policy literature because WTO rules also limit the foreign direct investment

(FDI) policies governments can apply. For example, the Trade Related Investment Measures

(TRIMS) agreement limits the local content requirements which can be imposed on foreign-

owned rms. Also, FDI ows are increasingly subject to bilateral investment treaties which

would be fascinating to analyze.

   Another promising area is climate policy. For example, Nordhaus (forthcoming) argued in

                                                47
his 2015 Presidential Address to the American Economic Association that small tari¤ penalties

could be a powerful tool to entice countries to join climate clubs which impose stricter policies

 ghting climate change. His argument is based on the so-called Coalition Dynamic Integrated

Model of Climate and the Economy (C-DICE) which is a quantitative model developed by

Nordhaus and his team. It uses the results from Ossa (2014) to construct a reduced-form

trade bene t function which is needed to quantify the e¤ectiveness of tari¤ penalties.

Notes: The entries in the upper panel are the wage change of the US normalized such that the average wage change across all
countries equals zero, the change in the quantity of output in the US chemicals or apparel industry, and the average change in the
quantity of output in all other US industries. The entries in the lower panel list the associated welfare effects decomposed into
terms-of-trade and profit shifting effects according to the formula in the main text. The terms-of-trade and profit shifting effects do
not add up to the overall welfare effects because they are computed using a linear approximation.
