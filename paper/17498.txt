This paper discusses the role that trade can potentially play in both negotiating and operating a post

envisioned at Bretton Woods, climate now added to the global policy bargaining set also offers the
prospect of potentially stronger trade disciplines (and even beyond WTO disciplines being negotiated).
Trade policy can as well be an instrument for the implementation of a global climate regime, since
trade provides a mechanism for achieving an internalization outcome for the global externality that
climate change represents, and that provides a potentially more efficient outcome and also helps meet
distributional objectives. In short, trade added to the emerging post 2012 climate regime can both expand
the bargaining set for both (effectively linked) negotiations, and additionally provide an instrument
for the implementation of an agreed outcome.

1. INTRODUCTION

     This paper discusses the role that trade can potentially play in both negotiating and

operating a post Kyoto/post 2012 global climate policy regime. What such a regime may

be will hinge on the outcome of the UNFCCC negotiations initiated in Bali in 2007 and

to be concluded in Durban later this year. If little materializes in Durban, the

commitments made in Copenhagen in 2009 under the Copenhagen Accord will largely

define the regime for the immediate period going forward from 2012, with no formal role

for trade policy. However, trade policy linked to climate policy commitments lurks in the

background.

     Here I argue that as an addition to the bargaining set for a global climate negotiation,

trade in principle widens the range of jointly beneficial potential outcomes and can in this

sense be a potential facilitator of an agreed global climate regime. But the reverse is also

true, that in a linked climate-trade-finance global policy coordination structure that goes

well beyond what was envisioned at Bretton Woods, climate now added to the global

policy bargaining set also offers the prospect of potentially stronger trade disciplines (and

even beyond WTO disciplines being negotiated). Furthermore, trade policy can as well be

an instrument for the implementation of a global climate regime, since trade provides a

mechanism for achieving an internalization outcome for the global externality that

climate change represents, and that provides a potentially more efficient outcome and

also helps meet distributional objectives. In short, trade added to the emerging post 2012

climate regime can both expand the bargaining set for both (effectively linked)

negotiations, and additionally provide an instrument for the implementation of an agreed

outcome. Whether this added linkage can be successfully exploited in the seemingly short




                                                                                           2
time remaining for the UNFCCC post 2012 negotiation (as in the WTO Uruguay Round

which expanded the trade bargaining set by adding intellectual property and services) is

unclear. But, currently there is pessimism as to whether any significant outcome from

Durban can emerge, even before trade policy is added to the negotiation.

     I then go on to suggest that it may also be useful to acknowledge what trade cannot

do for a global climate policy outcome. First, trade offers nothing that will help resolve

the property rights issue of who has rights to do what, and who should be compensated

by whom and by how much for actions that follow aiming to internalize the global

externality that climate change represents. But at the same time property rights remain the

critical (if not the central) issue for the developing countries in a global climate

negotiation since they both assert historical responsibility for emissions of individual

countries (and especially developed countries) and hence in emissions reduction, and also

seek preferential treatment under the Common but Differential Responsibilities (CBDR)

doctrine enshrined in the 1994 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate

Change (UNFCCC). In the classical development of externality literature, Pigou (1932)

argued for the use of internalizing Pigouvian taxes. Later, Coase (1960) argued that once

rights to do what are assigned (by courts) bargaining will achieve internalization, and if

achieved in this way, Pigouvian taxes will only worsen outcomes. Relative to this

discussion, climate stands as a trans border global externality over which courts have no

jurisdiction to award rights, and hence power and political process determine implicit

property right outcomes. Trade cannot help directly in this process of internalization, but

will potentially play a role in the exercise of transnational power via threatened or actual

trade measures if proposals for cooperation made towards others are not met.




                                                                                          3
     Trade, in my view, also cannot assist to any significant degree in providing the

compensation (in cash or in kind) that will be needed for full developing country

participation in global emissions reduction arrangements. The size of compensation

needed for developing countries, implicitly discussed in Copenhagen, would seem to be

too large to be met by an accommodation in trade policies in developed countries towards

developing country exports.

     I also note that as an instrument for achieving internalization of the global

externality that climate implies trade policy remains only a second best instrument. The

first best internalization mechanism is full global carbon pricing (achievable with an

equivalent carbon tax). Trade policy comes into the picture if such a mechanism is

unachievable due to nonparticipation by a subset of countries, and/or differentiated

commitment levels by countries in terms of implied joint global emissions reduction

under global projection of national commitments. Trade policy will inevitably distort

production and consumption of goods both internally and will do so globally, but these

costs may be justified by the benefits of the higher emissions reduction achieved in their

absence.

     I finally note that the unilateral commitments that have been made by both

developed and developing countries, both in the run up to Copenhagen and since I

suggest that as far as a commitment period out to 2020 (or even 2030) is concerned, these

are such that the additional commitments needed to achieve an outcome jointly

acceptable to all countries and consistent with IPCC (or some such as proposed G20)

temperature change targets may be modest. If this is the case, the extra work that trade

would need to contribute to a globally agreeable outcome could be less than some




                                                                                        4
suppose. Put differently, trade can perhaps be considered in terms of what is needed to

add to the multilateral negotiating process to take it over a threshold starting from

sizeable unilateral commitments, rather than from a de novo zero commitment situation.2

         In what follows, I first discuss the UNFCCC process thus far and the potential roles

that have been proposed or have potentially emerged for trade. Next I evaluate trade’s

potential role as both a facilitator of global bargaining and an instrument of execution for

a post Kyoto regime. I then discuss trade’s role in property rights, transfers, and

potentially achieving efficiency improvements. I then offer some additional concluding

remarks, including on unilateral commitments.

         The Stern report labeled climate change as the largest externality yet encountered

by either global or national economic policymakers. The change to the post Bretton

Woods global policy coordination structure that coordinated globally internalizing

country climate policies implies is equally large. The challenges that these new linkages

imply between climate and trade and finance are, in my view, only just beginning to be

understood and my aim here is primarily to help delineate them rather than in any way

resolve them. They are an inevitable part of our 21st century global economy.



2. HOW ARE TRADE AND CLIMATE POLICIES LINKED?


a. Institutional Evolution of Linkage

         Trade and climate change mitigation policies both form part of the policy coverage

of global economic policy coordination that now links national economies globally. In

1944 at Bretton Woods when the post war architecture of global policy coordination was

2
    The contribution of unilateral commitments is also commented on in Stern and Taylor (2010).


                                                                                                  5
discussed and later agreed to in the form of the World Bank/IMF/GATT-WTO triad

which has shaped the post war economy ever since, national economies were conceived

of as only linked through trade and finance (including aid flows). The objectives of

global policy coordination were to achieve sustained global growth, prevent any return to

a major global depression (as in the 1930s), and to facilitate the growth and development

of developing countries (and with it alleviate global poverty). In this structure, physical

interactions between national economies in the form of external effects related to

environmental issues did not enter.

     But in the last 40 or 50 years, environmental issues have emerged and grown in

prominence globally to the point that the original Bretton Woods architecture and

environmental issues are now inextricably linked, even if the formal structure of the

Bretton Woods institutions does not explicitly accommodate this linkage. From its

beginning as a localized set of concerns involving such issues as pesticides and impacts

on bird populations as in Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring (1960), to more global issues

involving thinning of the ozone layer in the 1980s environmental issues progressively

moved from a local to a global stage. Later in the 1990s, and following the then GATT

dispute settlement case involving Mexican and other tuna catches and incidental dolphin

kills, the interactions between trade policy and environment policies became a

preoccupation in the WTO (after its 1994 emergence from its GATT origins). The 1990s

also saw the first Earth Summit in Rio in 1992, the emergence of climate mitigation as a

central global environmental issue, and the 1994 agreement on the United Nations

Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Climate change thus

increasingly assumed a central position as a quantitatively dominant global




                                                                                         6
environmental issue in a global policy coordination structure that formally excluded

environmental issues, but one into which de facto environmental issues were proliferating

as dominant political concerns.

     This is what I take as the starting point for my discussion of trade and climate

policy linkage. They both impact on areas of joint economic activity involving nation

states and both define areas of mutual gain and potential loss both globally for the world

economy, and also individually for nation states. But the sequencing involved in the

evolution of this now de facto linked regime established sub-regime precedence. Trade

and finance came first, and their rule structure in global interaction was agreed in the

early post war years and in isolation from environmental issues. This created the

precedent that trade and finance rules were a commitment which was taken as given and

hence would constrain subsequent global environmental agreements. In 1947 the world

had a GATT with GATT articles, which was to evolve into the WTO. The world is still

waiting for a World Environmental Organization.



b. Elements of Linkage

     What then are the major elements of de facto linkage between trade and climate

mitigation policies within this implicitly linked global policy structure? I will focus on

three broad forms of linkage and then elaborate on each.

     Firstly is the direct linkage that mutually agreed actions in one area directly affect

economic activity in the other. This can be, for instance, that climate mitigation

agreements raise the price of emitting carbon and hence energy costs, and as a result

directly affect trade flows by changing relative product prices and country incomes. Or it




                                                                                         7
can be that new trade barriers affecting, say, transfers of technology make the

achievement of climate mitigation goals more difficult to achieve.

     Second comes linkage in global policy bargaining. China, for example, may be

more willing to undertake climate mitigation policies if, at the same time, there is

agreement on trade arrangements which gives China more security over market access

(say, through more restricted use of antidumping actions against China). Or, financial

transfers between wealthier and poorer countries may induce poorer country participation

in global climate change mitigation negotiations.

     Third comes linkage in the implementation of agreements in the two subareas.

Climate mitigation agreements, for instance, may cover only a subset of countries, and if

so concerns arise among participants over leakage (increases in emissions in non

participant countries) and possible noncompetitive effects acting against domestic

companies in participant countries. Border tax adjustments (tariffs based on carbon

content applied to imports from non participant countries and export rebates for exports

to them) then arise as trade based instruments supporting the implementation of a

subglobal climate agreement.



c. Direct Interactions Between Trade and Climate

     Direct interactions between trade and climate mitigation policies arise in a number

of dimensions. One is the effect on trade flows from carbon mitigation policies based on

the full carbon pricing required to meet a target emission reduction globally of a given

percentage as the internalization vehicle in participating countries. Under full carbon

pricing, energy input costs rise and these flow through into the prices of internationally




                                                                                        8
traded goods and services. Price rises will be largest for the most energy intensive

commodities. These prices increases will tend to reduce the exports of participant

countries in a subglobal climate mitigation agreement and also change the composition of

trade. Importantly, one of the major substitution effects that will occur will be

substitution out of traded manufactured goods into non traded services. Piggott and

Whalley (1992) used a multi country general equilibrium trade model in which energy

entered as a substitutable input along with capital and labor in production in all major

world trading areas. Calibrating their model to 1986 data and introducing carbon pricing

required to reduce emissions by 80 per cent of 1990 levels in their model implied a

reduction in the level of world trade of 50 per cent. Some countries who were previously

exporters of energy intensive manufactures became importers under this carbon pricing.

Importantly, this large trade impact from climate mitigation is something which if it were

to occur the framework of WTO would offer no remedy through WTO disciplines and the

resulting change in trade flows is in no way incompatible with WTO rules and something

over which the WTO cannot directly intervene. This size of impact also implies a reversal

of trade growth from possible eventual global climate policy perhaps of a similar order of

magnitude to the stimulus to world trade attributed to trade liberalization through

WTO/GATT disciplines since 1947. These impacts occur most dramatically under full

carbon pricing for a major emissions reduction. Under cap and trade carbon limitation

arrangements cost effects on average are much reduced, although at the margin they still

apply.3


3
    Bohringer et al. (1998) present a general equilibrium model capturing the different impacts in the EU of

different arrangements for emissions limitation policies. Distributional impacts vary substantially.



                                                                                                               9
         Another area of direct linkage occurs with the trade and other adaptations needed to

ensure full execution of climate mitigation policies. Thus, for effective mitigation of

carbon emissions in lower income countries transfer of technologies would make the

process more efficient and effective. Trade barriers which remain in place against

technology products (or now contemplated as under the recent section 301 Clean

Technology investigation in the US4) make this process more difficult. Equally, there is

concern that intellectual property arrangements in lower income countries can operate to

impede the import of greener technology and related carbon emission mitigation actions

that countries could commit to.5




d. Bargaining Interactions

         A second broad area of climate-trade interactions occurs through the impacts on

global policy bargaining which involves both trade and climate mitigation policies when

they are jointly undertaken. For now these are separate policy bargaining areas under the

WTO (for trade) and UNFCCC (for climate) in which linkage does not formally enter.6

Implicitly there are several areas of such linkage and in the years ahead the pressures will

likely be for this linkage to grow and to be explicitly incorporated in institutional

arrangements. This could be some decades off for a post-post Kyoto negotiation, but the

    Except under WTO negotiations on environmental goods and services which were mandated at Doha.




                                                                                                     10
pressures for such formal linkage seem likely to grow. Broadly speaking, most

economists would agree that broadening bargaining to allow for more cross over

possibilities in the bargaining set expands the range of bargaining and hence is a good

thing. An enlarged bargaining set offers more gains from bargaining (also see the

discussion in Abrego et al (2001)).

     One clear area of cross over between the two elements of bargaining would seem

likely to occur for countries for whom trade access for exports is a major preoccupation,

and for whom stronger disciplines in trade might make it easier for them to accept

climate commitments which harm their own economic performance. One such case is

China for whom export growth in recent years since the 2008 Financial Crisis runs at

nearly 30 per cent/year and for whom continued export growth is central to maintaining

high GDP growth. China, by some counts, is subject to around 25 per cent of all global

antidumping measures and WTO disciplines offer little or effectively no relief. Moving

trade disciplines beyond current WTO arrangements could thus be a Chinese interest

which would require new disciplines beyond those currently in the WTO. China also

faces trade actions in safeguards (Chinese tires) and unilateral trade remedy (US Section

301/Clean Technology) which they would wish to restrain. China may be more willing to

contemplate firmer and more substantial climate mitigation commitments if firmer

disciplines were to apply over trade measures against her.

     At the same time, however, linkage in bargaining across areas may be a negative in

allowing for the explicit use of penalties or threats of measures in one area to achieve

country negotiating objectives in the other. Excluding formal linkage could help partially

block these; and thus may help poorer countries. Such a situation potentially arises with




                                                                                       11
border tax adjustments and their potential use as a threat against countries choosing not to

fully participate in global climate mitigation negotiations. Here, linkage in bargaining

could make some countries worse off, and raise the potential global costs of non

achievement of climate negotiating objectives if threats were actually implemented.



e. Linkage in Implementation

     A final broad area of climate-trade linkage arises through linkage in implementation

of agreements. Border tax adjustments are seen by OECD countries as necessary to

achieve what they see as efficient and fair outcomes from a sub-global agreement that

only a subset of countries might sign onto (see Hauser et al. (2008), and Lockwood and

Whalley (2010)). Concerns centre on leakage (elevated emissions by nonparticipants) and

competitiveness effects against domestic firms. The inherent inefficiencies arising from

trade diversion effects involving products produced in participant countries, where

companies bear the costs of emission reducing measures, and non participant countries it

can be argued are partially counteracted by the use of border adjustments. Whether such

border adjustments will achieve their intended effects is discussed by Lockwood and

Whalley (2010), and was an earlier issue with border adjustments accompanying the

VAT in Europe in the 1960s.

     Another example of this linkage involves financial transfers. Under the 1994

UNFCCC, developing countries were granted a special status in climate negotiations

under an agreed rubric referred to as “Common but Differentiated Responsibilities”

(CBDR). This implied that developing countries would accept responsibility for climate

mitigation along with developed countries, but that their responsibility was to be different.




                                                                                         12
This was later interpreted that developing countries should be recipients of compensation

both for climate related damage to help then adapt to climate change, and for foregone

growth and development as a result of taking on climate related commitments. In the

UNFCCC negotiations which followed both in Kyoto in 1997 and in Copenhagen in 2009,

the size of the adaptation fund to accompany climate commitments became a major issue

in negotiation, implicitly reflecting financial transfers to developing countries through

linkage of finance to climate arrangements.




3. TRADE IN INTERNATIONAL CLIMATE NEGOTIATIONS THUS FAR


       Despite all the discussion of how trade can potentially play a role in global

climate change mitigation negotiations, thus far there is a relative absence of trade

considerations in the formal proceedings of UNFCCC negotiations on climate policy.

Rather, trade lurks both on the fringes and in the future as an element to be factored in,

rather than thus far as a central element at the heart of negotiation on concrete

commitments.

       The current UNFCCC climate change negotiations effectively began globally

with the Rio Earth Summit of 1992, where the United Nations Framework Convention on

Climate Change (UNFCCC) was drafted and opened for signing. Following this summit,

the UNFCCC was ratified in 1994 and emerged as the founding global constitutional

arrangement to focus subsequent negotiation on climate change mitigation. In this

Convention, all signatories jointly committed themselves to discuss climate change and

also meet periodically to develop global measures directed to containment and adaptation



                                                                                       13
to damage from climate change. Unlike the 1947 GATT which laid out 35 Articles

specifying limitations on how member countries could use trade policies, the UNFCCC

contained little by way of specifics, either on rules or on process for future negotiation

and how to deal with climate change. The one tangible commitment (other than to

commit to discuss the issue) was a joint commitment by all members to the principle of

Common But Differentiated Responsibilities (CBDR). Under this it was agreed that

developing countries along with developed countries accepted joint responsibility for the

human component of climate change, but that responsibilities for alleviating damage

would in some way be differentiated between developed and developing countries. The

interpretation of this commitment was left for future clarification, a matter which still lies

at the heart of negotiation today. Trade as a central issue thus did not arise with the

creation of the UNFCCC. Trade is only mentioned once in the original 1994 UNFCCC

text as also, in the most recent Cancun documents, as an area that should not be

‘arbitrarily or unjustifiably discriminated against or restricted’ by climate policy. The

uses of trade policy as supporting instruments for a climate regime, or linked trade and

climate bargaining do not arise and are not mentioned.

       After 1994 the mandate to continue discussions on climate change among UN

members (signatories to the Convention) provided the institutional momentum for a

series of sequential meetings labeled “committee of parties” or COPs. At each COP,

discussion of climate related matters occurred around an agreed agenda, with agreement

also reached on both the timing and location of the next COP. COPs thus began their

advance; but ‘trade and climate change’ did not feature as an issue.




                                                                                           14
           Under this COP process, the first significant advance occurred in COP3 in 1997,

which was to conclude the negotiation of the Kyoto Protocol; the first substantive

agreement on climate change policies7. Under this agreement, the world was divided into

two groups: Annex 1 countries (effectively developed countries plus Russia) who agreed

to take on commitments on emission reduction out to 2012 (relative to a 1990 base); and

non-Annex 1 countries (developing countries) who took on no commitments. The form

and depth of commitment varied by Annex 1 country. A range of accompanying

measures were also agreed to which focused on flexibility in the implementation of

commitments.

           More concretely these allowed for the trading of emissions reduction

commitments both among Annex 1 countries in the form of Joint Implementation (JI) and

between Annex 1 and non-Annex 1 countries in the form of the Clean Development

Mechanism (CDM). As such, trade appears in the Kyoto Protocol, but not in reference to

international trade in goods and services, and rather in relation to trading of emissions

reduction commitments.

           The Kyoto Protocol effectively became the first round of global climate policy

negotiations in an ongoing sequential process guided by the COPs, much as negotiating

Rounds in the GATT (and then the WTO) characterized an ongoing negotiating process

from 1947 up to the present Doha Round. Relative to GATT/ WTO, however, the Kyoto

Protocol is widely regarded as weak discipline since penalties are almost absent and

determinations of (non-)compliance are virtually lacking. For example, current


7
    The Kyoto Protocol was subsequently opened to signing 16 March 1998 and, after Russia signed, entered

into force 16 February 2005.



                                                                                                      15
expectations are that a number of Annex 1 countries could well be in significant violation

of their Kyoto Protocol commitments by 2012, when the Protocol is scheduled to

conclude, but the penalties against them would seem meagre and would also take

considerable time to define and implement.

          After Kyoto, the position of the US became a major topic of discussion since

successive US administrations did not take the Protocol to the US Congress for

ratification, and so US commitments entered into Kyoto by the Executive Branch had no

legal foundation in US law. But as earlier, international trade in goods and services did

not enter into subsequent COP discussions.

          A departure in this pattern arose with COP13 in Bali in December 20078. This

COP meeting had as its objective to lay the foundation for a negotiation on the global

climate policy regime to follow on after Kyoto in 2012. In two weeks of negotiation in

Bali a "Bali Road Map" was agreed as the framework to guide a global negotiation to

follow. This was a negotiation to conclude in Copenhagen in December 2009, and was to

focus on four so-called "pillars" of negotiation. One was to be 'mitigation' (or emissions

reduction commitments), another was to be 'adaptation' to climate change (a fund to

finance adjustment, largely by developing countries), another was to be 'innovation' (a

fund to finance new technologies to combat emissions), and a final one was labeled 'trade

and finance'. The latter was to allow negotiations to also focus on the financing of climate

change mitigation, following a calculation produced by the International Energy Agency

(IEA) that $45 trillion of resources would be needed to facilitate climate change

                                                                                         16
mitigation out to 20509 (with that amount increasing by $500 billion with each year of

inaction). There was also reference to the need for trade policy to support climate change

mitigation by reducing or eliminating trade barriers which impeded needed transfers of

technology. But no other form of trade-climate linkage either appeared in the Bali

documents or entered the negotiations that preceded these, with no mention of border tax

adjustments.

           Between Bali in 2007 and the 2009 Copenhagen meeting relatively little was

decided on to advance to the specifics needed to implement the Bali Road Map, and the

associated COP meetings also did not touch directly on trade. But international trade

considerations different from those foreseen as part of the Bali Roadmap instead began to

enter discussions outside the formalities of the UNFCCC process, and seemingly in a

major way. Discussion began to center on trade policy as a mechanism that could be used

to achieve implementation by sub-groups of countries of emissions reduction through the

use of border tax adjustments based on the carbon content of goods crossing international

borders. These would be against either non-participant countries in negotiations, or

countries which participated less than fully.

           What was envisaged was a series of tariffs on imports and rebates on exports

reflecting the higher costs of production for domestic producers in countries undertaking

emissions reductions relative to producers in countries where emissions reductions were

not to occur. The objective was to deal with two interrelated issues, so-called 'leakage'

(nonparticipant countries increasing emissions when participant countries reduced theirs)

and anti-competitiveness effects against domestic producers in participant countries.

    IEA (2008)



                                                                                        17
          Formal discussion of such measures accelerated in 2007 in Europe and in 2008 in

the US. This was to lead to draft legislation in the EU being advanced to the Commission

in 2009 and in the US the incorporation of border tax adjustments into the House version

of the Waxman Markey bill in 2009. This latter legislation involves border adjustments

working via emissions allowances to be purchased by importers on a basis comparable to

those bought by domestic producers per unit of production, and to be refunded as

allowances to exporters reflecting the amount purchased per unit of production by

domestic producers. EU legislation in contrast to the US system is instead based on

measured carbon content of production in exporting countries.

          This discussion of border tax adjustments inevitably provoked strong negative

reaction from developing country exporters who voiced fears of a global economy

becoming decarbonized and protectionist at one and the same time. Their characterization

was of border tax adjustments being used as a threat, formally outside of the UNFCCC

negotiation, but implicitly entering as a potential penalty for nonparticipation. Their view

was that this implied that their participation or nonparticipation was to be accompanied

by both financial transfer as carrots (the adaption fund as part of the UNFCCC

negotiations) and trade policy as a stick (border tax adjustments formally outside the

UNFCCC process). Debate on these measures continued throughout Copenhagen until

today.

          The meeting in Copenhagen in December 2009 at COP1510 was convened in high

hopes of a conclusion to negotiations on a substantive post-2012/ post-Kyoto regime but

floundered in some disarray before its conclusion. In the first week there were multi-

bracketed ill-defined draft texts which in the second week, with high level political

                                                                                         18
involvement, were put on one side. It then reached a conclusion in the form of the

Copenhagen Accord driven by a late US-China bilateral negotiation subsequently

extended to the so-called BASIC countries (Brazil, ASEAN, South Africa, India, China).

The Copenhagen Accord reflects an outcome in which countries first pledge to honor

unilateral commitments on emissions reduction entered into before Copenhagen. They

then agreed to a yet to be defined mutual verification procedure (which respects national

sovereignty with no entity to enforce or make site visits), and commit to 'work towards' a

new Climate Fund to assist developing countries of $100 billion/year by 2020.11 Trade

policy as such did not appear in the Copenhagen Accord.

           In some ways this is a minimalist outcome. But a more positive interpretation of

Copenhagen is that it did represent a consensus outcome and it also established a

framework for subsequent negotiations to finalize a post-2012 arrangement. Also, the

size of unilateral commitments entered into prior to Copenhagen in some people's minds

are close to the order that a multilateral negotiation might have anyway achieved for 2020

implementation, and so unilateral commitments may anyway have achieved much of the

intended outcome.

           Following Copenhagen have come subsequent UNFCCC meetings in Tianjin in

the summer of 2010 and Cancun in December of the same year. The outcome from

Cancun has been portrayed as positive relative to Copenhagen in that both developed and

developing countries commit to make reductions in emissions post-2012, and advances

occurred on the verification component of Copenhagen and in specific areas such as




11
     See UNFCCC (2009b), article 5 (verification), 8, 9 and 10 (Climate Fund)



                                                                                        19
deforestation.12 But details of what joint commitments might be are few. The specifics of

what a post-2012 regime may look like are however left for the 2012 Durban UNFCCC

meeting, and trade continues to play no significant direct role in negotiations, while

continuing to lurk in the background as a major issue. With time seemingly running out,

and seemingly little engagement between developed and developing countries on the

deep but substantive issues of historical responsibility and the interpretation of CBDR,

current expectations for a Durban outcome remain minimal. This situation is complicated

by likely non-compliance with Kyoto commitments by some developed countries

(especially Canada), and also the seeming lack of political commitment to major

emissions limitation in the US.




4. WHAT ROLE CAN TRADE POTENTIALLY PLAY IN HELPING ADVANCE THE

UNFCCC PROCESS?



          Given both the linkage between trade and climate change mitigation policies

listed above and the, thus far, limited formal role that trade has played in UNFCCC

negotiations, it seems worthwhile asking what role can trade potentially play in helping

advance the UNFCCC process both to conclusion in Durban and beyond in subsequent

negotiation rounds. In this discussion I will mainly focus on international trade in goods

and services and their linkage to global climate mitigation arrangements more so than

trade in emissions permits under JI and CDM. In passing, I will also note that issues of


12
     UNFCCC (2010)



                                                                                       20
trade rules for trade in goods (such as MFN and national treatment) that apply to trade in

goods under GATT/ WTO equally arise for trade in emissions permits, and as yet have

been little discussed. Non discriminatory trading in emissions permits would seemingly

yield gains from removal of cross-country distortions, much as for trade in goods.

       As I noted above, at the time of writing substantial pessimism surrounds the

prospects for a positive outcome from Durban, and the issues and differences seem

sufficiently major that seemingly trade policy can contribute only small opportunities for

conclusive bargaining in Durban. Indeed, the perceived risk by developing countries of

border tax adjustments emerging parallel to a UNFCCC agreement and outside the legal

framework of such an agreement could even be an impediment to a conclusion in Durban.

Developing countries would want to discipline the use of such measures beyond what

may be possible in the WTO.

       A contribution, however, that trade policy can make in advancing UNFCCC

negotiations on a post-2012 global climate policy regime is in expanding the bargaining

set to allow crossovers to non-climate issues. In also introducing a trade based penalty

structure into the negotiation to support participation through trigger strategies (see

Rubinstein (1979)) trade policy can potentially help, but could also hinder. The idea is

that trade policy and climate change can be formally linked so that improvements in

security of access for trade in goods relative to what is currently in place in the




                                                                                       21
GATT/WTO structure can be achieved, then countries who see trade benefits resulting

could be more forthcoming with climate commitments so as to speed agreement.13

           Nowhere is this more so the case than with China, but it also applies to other high

(or higher) growth economies such as India and Brazil. China’s high growth in the last

few decades has been fueled by rapid export growth (nearly 30 per cent/ year 2004-2007)

and FDI inflows which, in part, seek to take advantage of lower costs of exportation from

China. China’s high export growth rates have, despite China’s WTO membership,

resulted in large numbers of anti-dumping actions (and increasingly so from other

developing countries such as India, Brazil and Turkey). China by some counts now faces

around 25 per cent of anti-dumping actions globally. China has also been the object of

selective safeguard actions on clothing (admittedly consistent with China’s WTO

accession terms), as well as a recent US Section 301 initiation involving clean technology

products.

           China’s export access receives some degree of protection from existing WTO

disciplines, but it is incomplete. Enforcement in WTO involves lengthy process, and only

weak bilateral penalties. Coverage of WTO disciplines is thus incomplete from a Chinese

standpoint in terms of guaranteeing export access. China would benefit from strengthened

trade rules beyond those in the WTO as part of a broad climate deal; but institutionally

how such an outcome can be delivered is the issue. Similar arguments could be made for




13
     As Jim de Melo points out in his introductory remarks to the conference papers, there is also a role for

trade policy in supporting a credible time path for carbon emissions (and pricing) where there is dynamic

inconsistency.



                                                                                                           22
India and Brazil, but in these cases export growth rates have been lower and the

contribution of international engagement in the country growth process is arguably less.

            Contingent trade policy measures can also provide a penalty system to apply by

participants in a global regime against potential non-participants in the form of border

adjustments, even if their efficacy can be questioned. Carrots may apply through financial

transfers, while sticks can be brought to bear through such trade measures.14 The outcome

of such measures is however unclear from the viewpoint of performance of the global

economy. If higher participation levels result, this can be globally good. If they do not,

the result can be heightened distortion of trade and impaired global economic

performance.

            Substantial debate has focused on both the efficiency and fairness of using these

measures in this way, as well as their potential WTO compatibility. WTO compatibility

will remain as an issue to be resolved though WTO dispute settlement process. No GATT

panel ruling resulted from the EU adoption of the Value Added Tax (VAT) in the 1970s,

with similar border tax adjustment measures, which differed in being across to board

rather than differentiated by product, and also selective by source/ importing country.

This time around there would thus almost certainly be the added feature of country

discrimination at the border in trade involving participant and nonparticipant countries.

Reference to WTO panel process would likely follow swiftly were such measures to be

used, and the non-discrimination test would likely fail, although they would likely be


14
     The conference paper by Scott Barrett argues that the most important role for trade policy in climate

policy is achieve full participation in global arrangements given the difficulty of using credible sanctions

policies.



                                                                                                               23
defended as necessary measures under GATT article 20 (b), representing a threat to

human health.15

          The fairness of these measures is equally contentious. Developing countries argue

that such measures would slow their growth and development, and this outcome would be

unfair because they are poor. Developed countries argue that they are a necessary

accompaniment to a sub global climate regime to prevent leakage and improve efficiency.

But seen against the theoretical literature on externalities there would seem to be no clear

position on fairness, only an indication that their use would reflect an assertion of

political power by those imposing them.

          Pigou (1932) in his initial statement of the externality problem called for

correction through externality correcting Pigovian taxes. But later, Ronald Coase (1960)

argued that all externality situations involve issues of property rights, but that who had

the right to do what is inevitably arbitrary and issues of fairness do not arise. Put

differently, should polluters be allowed to produce and they should be compensated for

foregone profit from externality correcting measures, or do consumers have rights to

clean air and water and they should be compensated for environmental damage? Coase

argued that for localized externalities, property rights would be allocated through court

process, but once allocated bargaining between the parties would achieve internalization.

In such cases, Pigovian taxes would make things worse. However, for climate change the

externality is transborder and there is no global court structure to determine who has the

rights to do what. The outcome thus reflects the assertion of power, and power not

                                                                                         24
fairness (which will, of course, be argued for) will determine who is affected and in

which way.

       The efficiency of climate related trade actions is also debated since trade

measures are very much second-best in this situation. Full internalization of the global

externality from climate change involves full carbon pricing. Only in the absence of full

internalization measures will trade measures come into play, and being second-best one

can always construct cases in which efficiency impairments result. Most economists'

intuition, however, is that this will be an unlikely outcome, but the positive net effects of

trade measures in such situations have to be demonstrated for each case.

       Trade policy can also play a role in providing the vehicle for both economic

adjustment to the resulting climate policy measures through impacts on trade and

investment flows, and as a facilitator for the adjustments needed to ensure climate

mitigation (such as trade in technology needed for technology transfer). For now trade’s

formal role in UNFCCC negotiations remains limited, but in the background its shadow

lurks in the future in potentially major ways. And as the global economy moves beyond

2012 and if climate change is further elevated as an issue due to growing physical

damage, then more explicit incorporation of trade into climate policy debate seems likely

to follow.



5. THE POTENTIAL IMPACTS OF BORDER TAX ADJUSTMENTS


       What the potential impacts might be of border tax adjustments (BTAs) to

accompany a global climate regime is something which has been debated in recent

literature. BTAs are seen (especially by developed countries) as mechanisms to both



                                                                                          25
prevent leakage of emissions reductions by participant countries in a new global regime

through increased emissions by non-participant countries, and also as a way of addressing

concerns over anti-competitive effects against domestic producers in participant countries.

BTAs are effectively a series of tariffs on imports and rebates on exports based on the

carbon content of goods traded and the applicable carbon price in the importing country.

They can, in principle, be applied directly at the border based on measured carbon

content or involve a required purchase by importers of domestic emissions allowances

equivalent to what domestic producers would face. The former is effectively the EU

scheme; the latter is the US scheme. Also, carbon content can be based on that in the

exporting country (as in the EU proposals) or the carbon content in importing countries

(the US scheme). As carbon content per dollar of GDP differs between China and the US

by around four times, this is a very significant issue with BTAs.

       Lockwood and Whalley (2010) discuss carbon based BTAs from the vantage

point of the earlier debates on border adjustments in the EU at the time of the

introduction of the VAT as a common harmonization instrument. In the late 1950s as part

of the phased implementation of the Treaty of Rome it was agreed that a tax union among

the original six EU members should follow the initial customs union. Indirect taxes were

agreed to be the first element in tax harmonization and the VAT was agreed to be the

harmonization instrument. Debate ensued on whether to use a destination basis under

which imports were taxed and exports left countries tax free, or an origin basis which

taxed exports and left imports tax free. An EU committee was established and the

destination basis was chosen.




                                                                                       26
       The initial reaction of US business was hostile on the grounds EU exports would

leave the EU tax free, while US exports to the EU would have to cross a tax barrier.

Pressure thus mounted for a GATT negotiation on BTAs as part of the emerging Tokyo

Round. This pressure was defused, however, by a series of academic papers (discussed in

Lockwood and Whalley) which pointed out that in the broadly based tax case the

difference between an origin and destination basis is effectively that between a

production and consumption tax and in the broadly based tax case there should be no real

effects in moving between them. Exchange rates would adjust in the flexible exchange

rate case, or price levels or wage rates across countries would adjust in the fixed

exchange rate case. These arguments carried the day. There was no GATT negotiation on

border adjustments, nor has there been any dispute settlement case in either GATT or

WTO since.

       Lockwood and Whalley note the similarities of issues in the original VAT debate

and now with carbon motivated BTAs. They note the product specificity in BTA rates

involved for both imports and exports in the carbon case, and to argue that in appealing to

earlier literature one would likely need to distinguish between variance and levels of

BTA rates in assessing their impacts. The level component would have no real effects,

appealing to earlier literature, while the variance in tax rates would. They also highlight

the country discrimination in carbon motivated BTAs compared to the VAT case. This

would seem to make a WTO dispute case focus on the potential Article 1 (MFN)

violation, a case likely to be defended on Article 20 (general exceptions) grounds.

       Other recent work has focused on the use of numerical simulation general

equilibrium models to assess the potential impacts of BTAs. Mattoo et al (2011) use a




                                                                                        27
World Bank based model known as the Environmental Impact and Sustainability Applied

General Equilibrium Model (ENVISAGE). This is a recursive dynamic multisector

multiregional model with the carbon emission and climate module. The model has no

capability of providing welfare analysis and so the impacts on trade flows are the main

focus. Their results suggest that BTAs by OECD countries would address

competitiveness and leakage effects, and outputs and exports of energy-intensive

manufactures by developing countries are expected to decline. They highlight the key

issue of whether BTAs apply to carbon content in exporting or importing countries.

Under the latter they show significant effects against China's manufacturing exports

which can fall by a fifth. All lower and middle income country exports decline by 8 per

cent. BTAs on carbon content in importing countries have much less impact.

       Dong and Whalley (2009) in a related study use a multicountry general

equilibrium model covering the EU, the US, China, and a residual rest of the world. In

this model, countries produce commodities of varying emissions intensities using

substitutable fossil fuel-based oil and non-oil inputs. Unlike in conventional general

equilibrium trade models in which there is a fixed endowment of factor inputs for each

country, here there is a supply a function for energy exporting countries with increasing

extraction costs. Since emissions are directly related to energy use in production,

emissions levels are endogenously determined and can change with policy change. They

calibrate their model to 2006 data.

       The results show generally small effects for BTAs, but as with Mattoo et al,

results depend on assumptions (particularly the level of carbon pricing). They focus on

BTAs based on carbon content of production in exporting countries. They also emphasize




                                                                                      28
how carbon pricing maps through into small differences in trade barriers for produced

goods. They are able to analyze welfare effects and find they are also small.

       Taken as a set these papers and literature would seem to emphasize that the

impacts of BTAs will depend it intrinsically on the levels of carbon pricing (and

emissions reduction) involved, as well as how BTAs are administered. For developing

countries compared to the direct effects implied by such issues as historical responsibility

for emissions reduction and the interpretation of Common but Differentiated

Responsibility, BTAs may prove to be a less serious issue.



6. CONCLUDING REMARKS

       Globally, the elevation of concern over potentially accelerated climate change has

injected a new element into the nexus of global economic policy coordination that since

the 1940s has been overseen by the triad of the World Bank, the IMF, and the

WTO/GATT. The global economy up to the 1940s saw a global structure in which

country economies were thought to be linked only by trade and finance, not physically.

Climate changes this view of the economic world, which was anyway in flux from the

1990s after WTO debates on broader trade and environment linkage (which now relative

to climate seems quantitatively smaller). How the world responds to this challenge is

really at the heart both of UNFCCC negotiation on a post-Kyoto climate regime, and

their potential second round completion in Durban in 2012.

       The argument I make here is that we should view climate more as an addition to

the pre-existing global economic policy nexus of trade, investment, and finance, rather

than as a separate stand-alone policy negotiation. Institutionally where this will lead us




                                                                                         29
may be one of the keys to global economic architecture for the 21st century. We have no

World Environment or World Climate Organization. There is, for now, no serious

discussion of how we might link the WTO and IMF to emerging climate institutions. And,

communication between the WTO and UNFCCC secretariats is limited, but now growing

from limited beginnings. We need to advance institutionally if we are to both bring

climate into global center stage in economic policy and achieve significant mitigation,

and this is the challenge. Here I have tried to spell out the dimensions of trade-climate

linkage, and how these might grow over time. The institutional challenges this poses and

resolving them in a timeframe which does not mirror international negotiations of the

past (as in WTO negotiating rounds) is the further element needed.
