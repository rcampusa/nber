                                          ABSTRACT

To understand the impacts of support programs on global emissions, this paper considers the
impacts of domestic subsidies, price distortions at the border, and investments in emission-
reducing technologies on global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from agriculture. In a step
towards a full evaluation of the impacts, it uses a counterfactual global model scenario showing
how much emissions from agricultural production would change if agricultural support were
abolished worldwide. The analysis indicates that, without subsidies paid directly to farmers,
output of some emission-intensive activities and agricultural emissions would be smaller.
Without agricultural trade protection, however, emissions would be higher. This is partly because
protection reduces global demand more than it increases global agricultural supply, and partly
because some countries that currently tax agriculture have high emission intensities. Policies that
directly reduce emission intensities yield much larger reductions in emissions than those that
reduce emission intensities by increasing overall productivity because overall productivity growth
creates a rebound effect by reducing product prices and expanding output. A key challenge is
designing policy reforms that effectively reduce emissions without jeopardizing other key goals
such as improving nutrition and reducing poverty. This analysis is an important building block
towards a full understanding the impacts of reforms to agricultural support on mitigation of
greenhouse gas emissions and adaptation to climate change. That full analysis is being
undertaken in current work incorporating land use changes and examining the impacts of specific
reforms on mitigation, resilience and economic outcomes.

Modeling the Impacts of Agricultural Support Policies on Emissions from
Agriculture

Agricultural production is strongly affected by climate change but is, at the same time, a major
contributor to climate change--with agriculture and land use accounting for around a quarter of
total global emissions of greenhouse gases (Tubiello 2019). World agriculture is also strongly
affected by support policies that affect the composition and location of output and the approaches
used for production. One key question is what impact these interventions have on greenhouse gas
(GHG) emissions from agriculture by providing incentives to lower or higher emission-intensive
crops or livestock production. A related question is how these support measures might be
reformed so they could not only support farm incomes and productivity growth, but also provide
incentives for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
       The farm sector in the 51 countries included in the OECD's annual policy monitoring
program received an average of US$440 billion per year in the form of market price support and
direct subsidies between 2016 and 2018, equal to about 15 percent of gross farm receipts (OECD
2019). These countries also spent US$105 billion per year on what OECD terms General
Services Support, that is policies designed to create enabling conditions for agriculture, such as
agricultural innovation systems, sanitary and phytosanitary standards and rural infrastructure.
The US$440 billion in market price support includes direct subsidies that are "coupled" to output
and create incentives for producers to expand output (US$176 bn); and "decoupled" subsidies
that seek to avoid altering production incentives (US$64 bn).
       Recent work by Mamun, Martin and Tokgoz (2019) has examined these types of
agricultural support and their relationship to GHG emissions from agriculture. This study
highlighted a few key facts:
·   the extreme concentration of agricultural emissions by commodity - with beef, dairy and rice
    accounting for over 80 percent of agricultural GHG emissions;
·   a substantial fraction of emissions comes from land use and land use change;
·   the production of these emission-intensive goods is often heavily supported using market-
    price-support (MPS) measures, thereby creating strong incentives to increase output but
    reduce consumption of agricultural commodities in the protecting country.
           Further analysis is needed, however, to be confident about the implications of reforming
agricultural support measures for overall GHG emissions. Some of the key factors that need to be
considered include: (i) the average rate of support to agriculture, (ii) differences between types
of support, (iii) differences in rates of support across commodities, and (iv) impacts of support
on the production methods and processes.
           The average rate of support to agriculture matters because high rates of support are likely
to attract resources into agriculture, increase output and, at constant technology, to increase
emissions from agricultural activity. The resulting increase in agricultural output is likely small,
because total agricultural production can only be increased by raising total agricultural land use
or substituting other inputs for land. Increases in agricultural land use, in turn, are likely to
induce very large one-off increases in emissions as land is cleared for use in agriculture,
particularly if land is cleared by burning forests.
           The type of support matters because of its influence on overall incentives to both
producers and consumers. Some distortions to agricultural incentives, such as coupled subsidies
paid by governments to producers, provide incentives to producers without providing any
incentives for consumers to reduce consumption. Other types of support, such as market-price
support (MPS) in the form of tariff or non-tariff barriers, provide incentives for producers to
increase output, while encouraging consumers in protected markets to reduce consumption of the
protected good. This suggests that MPS, while more trade-distorting than coupled subsidies, may
have a smaller impact on global agricultural output and emissions. Provision of MPS may even
reduce global agricultural output and emissions. Consider, for example, protection provided in
countries with low agricultural production. The import protection will raise consumer prices in
that region and, hence, lower consumption and global output. Decoupled support aims to provide
support to farmers without creating incentives to change output levels and--to the extent that it
is truly decoupled--can be ignored for our purposes.
           Differences in rates of support across commodities may have important impacts on
overall emissions given large differences in the emission intensity1 of commodities. As noted by
Mamun, Martin and Tokgoz (2019), individual agricultural commodities are likely to be more
responsive to differentials in agricultural support rates than is overall agricultural output to the
average rate of agricultural support. This is because increasing total agricultural output requires

    Defined as the quantity of GHG emitted per unit of output.
                                                           2
either changing the amount of agricultural land, or intensifying production on existing land
through increased input use, such as fertilizer and labor. Of course, the output mix can be
changed by switching to other crops or livestock production on existing land. Mamun, Martin
and Tokgoz (2019) concluded that, on average, the existing structure of agricultural support
provides little incentive to farmers to switch from high to low emission-intensive commodities.
       Differences in agricultural support across countries also matter for global outcomes.
Mamun, Martin and Tokgoz (2019) show that the emission intensities of production for the same
commodities differ substantially between rich and poor countries and, also, within those groups
Historically, support to farmers has been higher in high-income countries than in poor, creating
incentives to expand production in lower-emission countries. However, in recent years, MPS
rates in high-income countries have declined, while they have increased in developing countries
(Laborde and Mamun 2019). The key point for this study is that support in countries with high
emission intensities increases global output in those countries and, other things being equal,
increases global emissions per unit of global output.
       Support intended to influence production practices and processes, such as subsidies on
fertilizers, pesticides or improved seeds, also matter. In practice, these mostly aim to stimulate
agricultural production which may induce more emissions unless improved practices are more
resource efficient. Higher input use, such as in the case of fertilizer, may be an additional source
of GHG emissions, though improved, climate-resilient seeds may prove more environment-
friendly. Some support programs, like the reformed Common Agricultural Policy of the EU,
condition access to support to compliance with environment-friendly production and land
conservation practices.
       OECD's General Services Support Estimate (GSSE), includes measures, such as
agricultural research, development, and training, that aim to raise agricultural productivity.
While these measures are not part of the widely reported Producer Support Estimate (PSE), they
can be critical to productivity growth and, hence, to incomes of farmers and food prices for
consumers. Productivity gains tend to reduce the emission intensities of agricultural products, for
instance, through changes in production processes that also reduce emission intensities (see, for
example, Mernit 2018), or through more efficient use of intermediate inputs.
       This paper is designed to complement existing studies on the measurement of GHG
emissions from agriculture and the implications of reform. One key set of studies (see, for

                                                  3
example, Tubiello 2019) assesses the extent of emissions from agriculture. A second group of
studies (see, for example, Jensen et al. 2019, Fellman et al. 2019, and OECD 2019) examines the
implications of potential policies such as carbon and consumption taxes for reducing GHG
emissions from global agriculture. A third group of studies focusses reform of agricultural
support policies in the European Union, using the CAPRI model (see, for example, Himics et al.
2018). A fourth group of studies (e.g., Henderson and Lankoski 2019) examines the potential
implications of policy reform in OECD countries and/or in specific agricultural sub-sectors
(Gerber et al. 2013). A fifth group of studies examines options for creating a more sustainable food
system (eg, Searchinger et al 2019).
       This study is a first stage of analysis of the impacts of reforming agricultural subsidies for
adaptation to and mitigation of climate change, holding agricultural land use constant. In it, we
use as wide a coverage as possible of agricultural policy measures and emission sources and
focus primarily on the implications of current agricultural support policies for emission
outcomes. In doing so, we undertake a careful quantitative analysis of the impacts of incentives
on agricultural outputs and emissions using IFPRI's global computable general equilibrium
model, MIRAGRODEP. This model-based analysis provides an opportunity to consider all the
influences outlined above--impacts on overall output, differences in incentives across countries,
differences in incentives across commodities, and differences in the technology used for
production. It also allows us to examine the extent and potential implications of environmental
conditionalities incorporated in producer support measures. We take into account not just the
total emissions per unit of output, but also the source of those emissions--whether they are, for
instance, from enteric fermentation by ruminants or from fertilizer use. The analysis also
provides a framework for assessing the potential impact of innovations that reduce the emission-
intensity of production, such as by reducing emissions of GHGs from enteric fermentation in
ruminants (Boadi et al. 2004; Haque 2018).
       The next section of this paper explains the process by which we developed the database
of emissions that allowed us to track emissions by source and product. The third section details
the approach we used to represent the distortions to agricultural incentives examined in the
study. The fourth section discusses the simulations used to assess the impacts of changes in
agricultural incentives on global emissions. The fifth section considers the links between changes



                                                  4
in productivity and global emissions. The sixth section discusses the approach to policy given
policy makers' multiple goals and the instruments considered in this paper.



The Emissions Database

Our focus in this paper is on agricultural emissions. It is important first to put these emissions in
the broader context of emissions from all sources, such as energy, industry, land use and
transport. To ensure comparability of the data, we draw on the FAOSTAT (2019) data, for which
the most recent comparable on agriculture and non-agriculture are for 2010.

A key feature of the Figure 1 is the importance of agriculture and land use change in total
emissions, with over 20 percent of all GHG emissions. At 21 percent of the total, it is small
relative to energy and industry, but much larger than the emissions associated with transport and
residential/commercial use, that receive enormous attention in popular discussions. While it was
discussed in the original UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UN 1992), it was
seriously under-represented in subsequent commitments, partly because of poor and inconsistent
data on the extent of the problem. With the ready availability of estimates through FAOSTAT

                                                               5
(see Tubiello 2019), the basic information needed to analyze the problem and approaches to its
resolution is now available. Emissions from agriculture and land use change are much more
comprehensively included in the Paris Agreement than in earlier accords (Vermeulen 2016).
Because the modeling framework we use for this paper covers only ongoing emissions from
agriculture, we focus only on the agriculture component of emissions.
             An important distinction between agriculture and other sources of emissions is the much
greater relative importance of the relatively short-lived methane (CH4), with a lifespan of around
12 years in the atmosphere, and nitrous oxide (N2O), with a lifespan of 120 years, emissions from
agriculture (Houghton et al. 1996). As shown in Table 1, these two gases account for almost all
the emissions from agriculture, while the emissions from most other sectors are dominated by
carbon dioxide (CO2). The Global Warming Potential (GWP) conversion factors used in the
database are the IPCC measures (Houghton et al. 1996, p22) that compare the GWP of each gas
after 100 years. These sum the impacts of a unit emission over that period, substantially reducing
the impact of methane relative to CO2 because it has its impact only over around 12 years (Harvey
1993). These measures are appropriate for estimating impacts on climate change over the next 100
years. However, the impact of CH4 emissions will be larger in shorter periods, where more of the
impact of the CH4 remains, and greater over periods longer than 100 years because the atmospheric
CH4 level would remain constant with constant annual emissions, while the CO2 concentration
would keep rising2.

    Where timing issues are important, Edwards and Trancik (2014) propose alternative approaches.

For the present analysis, a database is required that links decisions on agricultural outputs and
inputs with their associated emissions. For this, we build on the FAOSTAT global database
(Tubiello 2019; FAO 2019) that links GHG emissions to output of commodities and the
production processes used in countries. Holding emissions per unit of output and input constant
allows us to develop a fixed-coefficient model of emissions. Our modeling framework also
provides the option for us to vary the relationship between outputs and inputs in response to
changes in prices or technological changes in input-output relationships.
        We make two important improvements to the FAOSTAT database: (i) adding additional
categories of emissions, and (ii) allocating emissions by commodity across sources of emissions.
The two most important categories of emissions to be added are energy use in agriculture and
emissions from pesticide use. We also move emissions from burning of savannah grasslands to
the land use category, rather than the agricultural emissions category, as much of this burning is
unrelated to agricultural production.
        Table 2 shows the importance of incorporating different sources of emissions into our
analysis. A striking feature of the table is the importance of enteric fermentation in both rich and
poor countries. This is primarily from ruminant animals such as cattle and sheep and contributes
close to 34 percent of total emissions. Another striking feature is the importance of livestock
manure, which contributes 22.5 percent of total emissions. Direct energy use by the sector
accounts for 13 percent of total energy use and 16 percent in OECD members. Volatilization of
synthetic fertilizers is another important contributor, accounting for 14 percent of total emissions
in the OECD member countries and 10 percent in non-OECD members. Rice cultivation
accounted for almost 10 percent of total emissions, being much more important in developing
countries than in the OECD. Crop residues were the next most important source, accounting for
roughly almost five percent of emissions, considering both burning and decomposition of
residues, making them similar in importance to emissions resulting from direct energy use by the
agricultural sector.

The FAOSTAT database also provides data on emissions by commodity, as presented in Table 3.
Production of ruminant meat is by far the most important source of emissions, accounting for 48
percent of total emissions. Milk production is the second most important source, with close to 17
percent of the total. This is broadly consistent with the importance of enteric fermentation and
manure in Table 1. Rice is the third most important source of global emissions. This importance
of this category is very different between OECD and non-OECD countries, with its share of
emissions six times higher in Non-OECD countries than in the OECD.

A key influence on the outcome of policy reforms is the relative emission intensity of production
in different regions, measured by the kg of CO2 -equivalent produced per kg of the product. If
support is reduced in an area where the emission intensity is particularly high and replaced by
production from another region where the emission intensity is low, this change is likely to
contribute to a reduction in total emissions. The emission intensities for key products and regions
are presented in Table 4.

A key feature of Table 4 is the enormous differences in emission intensities across regions and
commodities. The emission intensity for bovine meat is by far the largest for any food. And it
varies from 12.1 in the United States to 108.3 in India. There is clearly a link between income
levels and intensity, with the intensity for beef being more than twice as high in the non-OECD
group than in the OECD. However, there are clearly also important idiosyncratic influences on
emission intensities--they are, for instance, slightly lower in the EU and the United States than
for the OECD as a group. As another example, both Australia and Brazil have emission
intensities that are slightly higher than for the OECD and non-OECD averages. The emission
intensities for milk look deceptively low but would range from 3.3 to 9.7 if expressed in milk
powder equivalent using the standard conversion factor of 7.6 (FAO 2017, p123). The dispersion
of intensities is much less than in the case of beef, for which it is quite substantial. Intensities are
generally lower in higher-income countries.
        A difficulty with the characterization of emissions provided in Tables 2 and 3 is that it
does not clarify the source of emissions in the production of each commodity. If, for instance, we

                                                   9
want to examine the impacts of a fertilizer subsidy, these data--or models based on them--do
not allow us to investigate the impacts. Nor do they allow us to investigate the impacts of
changes in production technologies that apply to one production activity rather than others--such
as use of feed additives designed to reduce GHG emissions--suitable for daily-handled dairy
cows but not beef cattle fed on extensive pastures. To deal with this problem, we developed a
database of emissions by type and by commodity. We aimed to produce a database of emissions
for production, based on FAOSTAT, with the key assumptions used in the carbon footprint of
agriculture. The idea is to reverse engineer aggregated emission data to identify individual
coefficients that properly traces the drivers of emissions: scale, location, composition and
technological choice. In doing so, we followed a bottom-up approach for computing emissions at
different stages and carried out quality control at different stages by checking if the numbers add
up to the aggregated numbers at the total agriculture level in the FAOSTAT database.
           Thus, GHG by source are calculated in three steps, that is, we recalculate first the
emission coefficients (EC) for N2O and CH4 for each emission source; then we recompute
emissions of N2O and CH4 for each activity and finally, we recompute the CO2-equivalent from
N2O and CH4 emissions.3 The emission sources used follow FAOSTAT and include: burning
crop residues and savanna; emissions from crop residues; manure management, manure applied
to cropland manure left on pasture; rice cultivation; cultivation of organic soils; enteric
fermentation, energy and synthetic fertilizers. Emissions from energy consumption in agriculture
are taken from the FAOSTAT for the year 2012, the latest available year for this series.
           The FAOSTAT emission database further provides implied emission factors for various
activities by emission source, such as area harvested in rice cultivation and the nitrogen content
of manure. The database in some cases provides the base activity data, such as areas of organic
soil cultivation; and the number of head of livestock for enteric fermentation and manure
management. In other cases, such as biomass burned (dry matter) when burning crop residues,
only computed activity data are provided, rather than the underlying data. In such cases, we
import base activity data from the FAOSTAT crop and livestock production database. For
synthetic nitrogen fertilizer, the activity data (i.e., agriculture use in nutrients) is missing and thus
we used the FAO emission numbers instead of recomputing them. For the final version of the



3
    We use 310 as the default value for computing the CO2 equivalent of N2O and 21 as the CO2 equivalent of CH4.

database created for the present analysis, we keep the base activity data (we call them index data)
to get average emission value per index type (land, animals, output, fertilizer and energy).
           In the case of enteric fermentation and manure management (during storage and
treatment, in application to soils and left on pasture) we disaggregated the livestock numbers for
buffaloes, camels, goats and sheep in line with the value of their products­ meat, milk and wool
(sheep). The resulting livestock numbers were then linked to emissions using data from the
FAOSTAT emissions database. In the final step we produced emissions data by country,
emission source and sector. The broad structure of the emission shares is presented in Table 5.

Agricultural Incentives

Farmers' decisions on production levels and methods of production are influenced by three broad
policy interventions:
    (i)       Coupled and decoupled subsidies,
    (ii)      Import measures, and
    (iii)     Export measures


In this section of the study, we discuss the approaches that we used to measure the extent of
these interventions. We first consider coupled subsidies, that is payments by government that
                                                          11
change the net returns farmers receive for their current outputs or pay for their inputs and, hence,
create incentives for farmers to change their output levels. We deal with these first, partly
because they are expected to have a more adverse impact on emissions from agriculture than
import or export measures that contribute to the overall level of measured market price support
(MPS). This is because, in contrast with market price support measures such as tariffs, they do
not provide incentives for consumers in protecting countries to reduce their consumption of
potentially polluting agricultural commodities4. There is also a political-economy reason for
focus on these subsidies. As they must be financed by governments, they are likely to receive
more scrutiny from Ministries of Finance than measures such as tariffs that change producer
returns indirectly by raising domestic prices relative to world prices. The export taxes used in
some developing countries have a similar feature, with Ministries of Finance often providing
support, rather than opposition, for these measures.


Coupled Subsidies


Data on coupled subsidies paid by government for producers are presented in Table 6. The
purpose of this table is to disaggregate total subsidies into those that influence output (coupled
subsidies) and those that do not (decoupled subsidies). Another purpose is to provide estimates
of the share of coupled subsidies that are subject to environmental conditionality. A third is to
identify those subsidies that support the use of fertilizer. The final column, for GSSE, is
provided to allow comparison between subsidies paid directly to farmers and payments made to
strengthen the enabling environment for agriculture (see OECD 2018a).




4
  Our emphasis on these commodities differs from studies such as Mayrand et al (2003) in which coupled subsidies
are classified as most-distorting. While we agree with this assessment for trade impacts, we do not for environmental
impacts. Whether trade barriers will raise or lower emissions is an empirical question. If protection is applied mainly
to countries with little comparative advantage, where production at world prices is far below consumption, the
reduction in demand may exceed the reduction in supply. Whether this is the case also depends on the elasticities of
supply and demand.

Source: OECD (2018a). Note: Narrow environmental conditionality is based on OECD flags for environmental conditions on
input use. Broader conditionality measures include conditions such as cross-compliance requirements in the EU. Coupled
subsidies include payments based on outputs, payments based on inputs and payments based on activity levels such as area or
livestock numbers. Decoupled subsidies are measures intended to avoid creating incentives to change output, specifically
categories E (production not required); F (Payments based on non-commodity criteria) and G (miscellaneous payments) of the
OECD (2016, p23). GSSE measures are payments designed to influence the environment for agriculture without payments
directly to farmers. For consistency, we use the OECD measure that fertilizer subsidies are zero in China, although some other
sources identify these subsidies to fertilizer-producing enterprises as being a subsidy to farmers (Huang, Gulati and Gregory
2017).



The first column of the table shows the value of subsidies provided subject to environmental
conditions on input use, as designated by the OECD. This was only US$19.4 billion of total
subsidies of US$163 billion. Using a broader measure of environmental conditionality that
                                                              13
includes broader requirements such as cross-compliance conditions in the EU and the USA
results in US$110 billion of support subject to some form of conditionality, over 80 percent of
which was in the US and the EU. This suggests that the coverage of conditionality is substantial,
only the effectiveness of this conditionality remains a source of uncertainty.
        This broader measure of conditionality was created by expert reviews5 of the extent of
environmental conditionality in policies and countries covered by the OECD's Monitoring and
Outlook Studies (2018a). It includes all measures where the OECD "cookbook" providing
descriptions of policies, or the analyst's familiarity with the country's policies, indicated that
support under that policy is subject to environmental conditionality. The results in the table make
clear that most of this support is provided by the EU, with the United States as the second-most
important provider of this type of support. As we considered quite general conditionality
schemes such as the EU's "cross-compliance" conditions (OECD 2018b), the resulting US$148
billion in support subject to environmental conditions is much larger than the $19 billion
indicated by OECD as being subject to input conditionality for environmental purposes.
        Fertilizer subsidies amount to around US$13 billion per year in the table with 85 percent
of the subsidies included in the countries covered by the OECD accounted for by India and most
of the remainder by Indonesia. Expanding the sample to countries not covered by the OECD
would likely increase the importance of this measure, although it seems unlikely that it would
become greatly more important as a share of overall agricultural support.
        The total amount of coupled subsidies in Column 4 of Table 6 is heavily influenced by
support to farmers in China and India, because a large amount of this type of support has been
transferred to decoupled form in the US and the EU (see Mamun, Martin, and Tokgoz 2019).
There is some controversy about the extent to which subsidies provided to Chinese agriculture
are, in fact, coupled with output at the producer level as many were originally introduced in ways
that appeared to be lump sum in nature (Huang et al. 2011). In India, as we will see, positive
support from coupled subsidies operates in an environment where output prices have been
depressed by border policies.
        The final column of Table 6 shows that governments also spent substantial amounts on
support designed to improve the enabling environment for agriculture, such as investments in

agricultural research and development and rural infrastructure. Many of these investments, and
particularly investments in agricultural research and development, appear to have high rates of
return (Alston et al. 2009, Zhang and Fan 2004, Fan, Cho and Rue 2018, Laborde et al. 2019),
probably because governments under-invest in these activities. By contrast, much of the benefit
to society of coupled subsidies is lost through costly increases in production. While the measures
reported under GSSE clearly influence output levels and emission levels, they largely do so by
overcoming market failures, such as under-investment by private agents in research and
development and/or provision of infrastructure. While their impact on output is generally very
substantial, their impact on producer returns and on emissions is ambiguous, depending on
factors such as the impact on output prices and output levels.


Import Measures


While the goal of the Uruguay Round of WTO negotiations was to convert all agricultural trade
measures affecting imports into tariffs (Hathaway and Ingco 1995), many different--and
frequently non-transparent--agricultural trade measures remain, including the Tariff Rate Quotas
introduced during those negotiations. This greatly complicates the challenge of estimating
agricultural protection. Furthermore, successive rounds of preferential trade negotiations have
resulted in very substantial differences between the tariffs levied on different suppliers
(Guimbard et al. 2012).
        Unfortunately, a key result of this is that standard tariff measures provide little guidance
on the rate of protection to agriculture or to individual agricultural commodities. Another
challenge for measuring agricultural protection is the presence of trade measures on exports. Of
these, export taxes or export restrictions designed to lower domestic prices are the most common,
although export subsidies designed to raise domestic prices have been widely used in agriculture
in the past.
        The primary approach that economists have followed to deal with these problems is to
estimate the average rate of protection or taxation by comparing the domestic price of a good
with the price of a comparable traded good, with both prices adjusted for any transportation or
marketing costs between the points at which they are observed (OECD 2016). While this
approach is suitable for measuring the average rate of protection for agriculture, it does not allow


                                                 15
us to account for the presence of trade flows subject to protection rates that differ from the
average--such as those within free trade areas or customs unions. To deal with this problem, we
have combined data from the OECD database on agricultural support measures with data on
preferential tariff rates obtained from the GTAP v10 database (see Aguiar et al (2016) for the
broad structure of this database).
         For consistency with the approach used in modeling trade flows in IFPRI's global
computable general equilibrium model, MIRAGRODEP, applied in this study, we use the OECD
measures of agricultural trade distortions to indicate the protection rate applying on non-
preferential trade flows, and then scale down protection on preferential trade flows (Hoekman,
Martin and Braga 2009) in line with the tariffs on those flows6. This results in a database on
protection that captures these two key dimensions of global agricultural protection. Data from
this database for import protection in broad groups of countries and for select individual
countries are given in Table 7.

 More specifically, we use the ratio of the power of the tariff on import of the good from country i, (1+t i), to the
power of the tariff from country j.

The pattern of import protection observed in Table 7 has potentially important implications for
emissions. Of the commodities with the largest emission intensities--beef, milk and rice--milk
and rice have particularly high average rates of protection. Average protection rates are
                                                             17
substantially lower on beef, at around 18 percent, but this rate of protection is vastly higher than
for lightly protected, low-emission, commodities such as vegetables and fruit, and wheat. On
average, protection rates for all the high-emission commodities are much higher in rich countries
than in developing countries. Rates of protection for these commodities vary considerably
between countries, with rates over 100 percent for rice in traditional high-protection countries
such as Japan and the Republic of Korea, but also in developing countries such as Colombia and
the Philippines. Rates of protection to beef are high in traditional high-protection economies such
as the EU28, Japan and Korea, but also in Indonesia, Russia and Vietnam.


Export Measures


In many countries, protection or taxation is observed for exported commodities. This implies the
existence of export taxes when domestic prices are artificially depressed and export subsidies
when domestic prices are increased by the intervention. In these cases, we used the price gap
estimated by the OECD (2018a) to create a measure of the implicit export tax or subsidy
applying to those trade flows. Results for these trade flows are given in Table 8.

The export tax/subsidy measures presented in Table 8 are, on average, substantially lower than
the import measures in Table 7. However, they are nontrivial for several commodities and
countries. On average, they are largest for India and for Ukraine, countries where policy appears
to have reduced food prices to consumers at the expense of farm returns. India's policies appear
to have imposed implicit export taxes on a wide range of commodities--including dairy, beef,
oilseeds, vegetables and fruit, rice and wheat. By commodity, export taxes are largest for rice,
with sizeable implicit export taxes in two major exporters--India and Kazakhstan. They are also
sizeable for oilseeds in many countries, sometimes because of a desire to subsidize oilseed
crushing at the expense of oilseed producers.

Coupled Subsidies vs Market Price Support


The two components of all the support that influences output decisions are coupled subsidies and
market price support. Coupled subsidies generally tend to increase output without lowering
demand in the affected countries, while market price support increases demand in protecting
regions but, at the same time, reduces demand for agricultural products by raising prices to
consumers. A rough indicator of the magnitude of each of these supports is provided by dividing
the value of producer support provided by the value of output at world prices.

A surprising feature of Table 9 is the relatively small gap between the average rate of support
provided by coupled subsidies of 5.1 percent and the average support provided by market price
support (MPS) of 7.9 percent. This is partly because MPS includes both positive support from
tariffs and negative support from direct or implicit export taxes. While the combination of
positive and negative support contributes to higher economic costs from MPS measures than
from subsidies (Anderson, Martin and Valenzuela 2006), it results in a lower average rate of
support from border measures than would otherwise be the case.
       An interesting feature of the table is the high rates of the protection in some cases, with
countries like Iceland, Norway and Switzerland, having much higher than average rates of both
coupled subsidies and border support. A second interesting feature is the combination of positive
protection from coupled subsidies and negative protection from border measures in countries like
India, Kazakhstan, Ukraine and Vietnam. These countries typically are net exporters--or
potential net exporters--of certain key commodities and apparently choose to use export barriers
to lower the cost of food to domestic consumers.



Analyzing the Impacts of Agricultural Support

To assess the impacts of current agricultural support, we examine the implications of moving
from current support levels to a hypothetical situation in the absence of any global intervention.
For this analysis, we use IFPRI's MIRAGRODEP model (Laborde, Robichaud and Tokgoz
2013), which is an extension of the widely used MIRAGE model of the global economy
(Decreux and Valin 2007). The underlying database used for the analysis is Prerelease 3 of the
GTAP v10 database for 2014. The data on agricultural support were adjusted in line with the
measures discussed in Section 3 for agricultural border measures and subsidies that influence
output or input decisions (coupled subsidies). The model was augmented with a post-solution
model based on the estimates discussed in Section 2 linking GHG emissions to output and inputs
of agricultural activities determined in the model. The combined model was then used to assess
the impacts of policy reform on emissions of CO2, CH4 and N2O, and these results combined to
generate a total CO2 equivalent.
       The macroeconomic assumptions used for the analysis were designed to be relatively
"neutral" to avoid situations where macroeconomic adjustments such as real exchange rate
                                                21
changes outweigh the impacts of interest, and to allow us to focus on the impacts of agricultural
support policies on emissions. These assumptions were:
       (i)     Static version of the model
       (ii)    Public purchases held constant and a variable consumption tax used to hold the
               deficit to GDP ratio constant,
       (iii)   Land use held constant to focus on emissions from agriculture
       (iv)     A constant level of employment.


Our approach of holding land use constant is consistent with the study by Henderson and
Lankoski (2019) for the OECD and allows us to focus on changes in agricultural emissions,
without needing to address the impacts of land use change, which are very context specific. In
this paper, we begin by considering the impact of removing coupled subsidies, and then turn to
border measures.


Implications of Coupled Subsidies


To understand the impacts of current subsidies, we consider in Table 10 the percentage changes
in key farm outputs from removal of coupled subsidies. Removal of these subsidies causes a
reduction in overall farm output of close to one percent, with a reduction of 1.7 percent in
developed countries and a much smaller reduction in developing countries. The smaller
reduction in developing country output reflects the much smaller use of subsidies in poorer
developing countries (Anderson, Martin and Valenzuela 2006), and perhaps also the limited
coverage of developing country assistance in the OECD database on which we relied in
preparing this study.

The implications of removing coupled subsidies for overall emissions are given in Table 11. This
table shows a reduction of 34 million tons of CO2 equivalent, or around -0.6 percent, resulting

                                                    23
from removal of these subsidies. Interesting, the largest single component of this reduction arises
from cuts in the use of synthetic fertilizer, with reductions in emissions from enteric fermentation
the second largest component. The economies that reduce their emissions the most tend to be
countries like China, the EU and Mexico that currently provide substantial subsidies to
agriculture. By contrast, countries providing relatively low subsidies, like Australia, see an
increase in emissions as they attempt to take advantage of higher world prices resulting from
removal of subsidies elsewhere and increase their output.

Removing Border Distortions


Our first experiment in this section considers elimination of all agricultural border measures,
both import and export. We first consider the impact on agricultural output levels by commodity,
and then the impact on overall greenhouse gas emissions expressed in CO2 equivalents. We then
turn to the impacts on agricultural emissions. Table 12 presents the effects on output for
agriculture overall and for key emission-intensive commodities.

Clearly output levels are likely to decline in initially protected regions and increase in regions
that were originally lightly protected, not protected, or subject to taxation. If emission intensities


                                                               27
were the same in all regions, the only thing that would matter for global GHG emissions is the
impact of reform on global output. However, we know that emission intensities for agricultural
products are frequently, but not always, much lower in the rich countries than in poor countries
(Mamun, Martin and Tokgoz 2019), so we also need to examine changes in output by country.
       A key result in Table 12 is that global farm output declines by 0.1 percent with removal
of all agricultural trade distortions. This result is consistent with protection expanding
agricultural output slightly, by pulling additional non-land resources into the sector, while
resources are moved out of the sector in non-distorting countries because of lower world prices.
The effect is much smaller than for coupled subsidies, despite the greater magnitude of market
price support. This might, at first, seem surprising but reflects the fact that protection reduces
consumption in the imposing countries, as well as increasing output in those regions. The effect
on global output is an empirical question, with the answer depending heavily on the importance
of the protecting countries as consumers relative to their importance as producers. As noted in
the introduction, if countries imposing protection were almost completely dependent on imports
for their consumption, the effect on world output would be much the same as with a consumption
tax in those regions. Given that most of the high protection is in net importing countries, it is
perhaps not surprising that the impact of removing border measures is close to zero.
       Another potentially important change in output patterns is reductions in output of most of
the emission-intensive goods in the relatively low-emission-intensity high-income countries,
while output expands in developing countries. A broadly similar pattern is seen for beef, rice and
pork/poultry. Milk is slightly different, with a modest overall expansion in developed countries
outweighing a small average decline in output in developing countries. The combination of the
expansion in overall farm output with the larger expansion of beef and milk production look
likely to be important influences on overall GHG emissions.
       Looking at the country-level changes, the results for overall farm output follow an
expected pattern, with reductions in farm output in highly protected economies such as Japan and
Korea and increases in lightly protected economies such as Australia, Brazil, New Zealand and
the Ukraine. For the individual emission-intensive commodities, there are important changes,
such as a 32 percent increase in production of beef (including buffalo meat) in India and large
increases in output of key products in both Australia and New Zealand. By contrast, output of all
these products falls in Japan and Korea as expected. There are also considerable variations in

                                                 28
outcomes by product within countries, with Canada seeing a modest increase in beef production,
a large increase in pork and poultry production and a decline of almost 50 percent in dairy
production.
In terms of overall national income and overall farm income, the changes from elimination of all
agricultural border measures reflect the overall impact of distortions on individual sectors, as
seen in Table 13. For the world overall, both national income and farmer income increase. Real
national income rises in all regions with reductions in inefficiency outweighing terms of trade
deteriorations in importing countries. Producers in the most protected economies, such as Japan,
Korea and the EFTA countries, suffer quite strong losses of farm income, while competitive
exporters such as Australia, Brazil, Canada, New Zealand and the United States experience
sizeable gains in real farm incomes. For most other countries, the changes in national farm
income are relatively small, suggesting that--where they arose--the biggest political challenges
would likely involve balancing between gainers and losers, such as dairy farmers and other
producers in Canada.

measures such as tariffs, export taxes, import subsidies, and nontariff measures that change the price of domestic goods relative
to world prices.



           The impacts of abolishing border measures on emissions are given in detail in Table 14.
The table shows an overall increase in global GHG emissions of 128 million tons of CO2
                                                                30
equivalent, or 2.1 percent, with a 1.9 percent increase in developed countries and a 2.2 percent
increase in developing countries. This increase in emissions is despite the decline in global
output seen in Table 10 and indicates that simple abolition of current border measures would
increase emissions by changing the composition and location of output in ways that lead to
increased emissions.

The table shows that around 90 percent of the increase in emissions came from two sources of
livestock-related emissions--Enteric Fermentation and Manure. These increases in emissions are
heavily concentrated in Australia, Brazil, India, the United States and other Latin America,
where output of livestock products is expected to increase. The increases in emissions from these
two categories in Brazil and India reflect the increases in beef (including buffalo) output reported
in Table 12. These increases are so large that they explain almost all the increase from
developing countries, and almost all the global increase in emissions. These increases in beef
output have two quite different sources. The increase from Brazil reflects the limited protection
provided to livestock products in Brazil and the expansion of this sector in response to greater
market opportunities created by the abolition of import barriers. The increase from India reflects
the abolition of export barriers reported in Table 6. Emission reductions are projected for China,
the EU, Russia and Turkey, where reductions in livestock production are predicted.


Abolition of Border Measures and Coupled Subsidies


The effects of abolition of both border measures and coupled subsidies on output of key
agricultural commodities are shown in Table 15. The broad pattern is close to the sum of the two
components, with modest declines in overall output, and substantial reallocations of production
from currently-protected countries to those that are unprotected, or even taxed, rather than one of
uniform shifts between developed and developing countries. Thus, output of beef increases
substantially in Australia, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, India, New Zealand and Ukraine while
falling sharply in Europe and Japan.

Results for the impact on emissions of the abolition of border measures and coupled subsidies
are presented in Table 16. These results reveal that the effects of abolishing market access
barriers and coupled subsidies are somewhat different from the sum of their separate effects. The
result of these two reforms is an increase in emissions of 102 million tons of CO2 equivalent or
1.7 percent of the base level. Much of the increase is associated with the increases in output of
bovine meat in Brazil and India.

As was the case with the removal of market access distortions, the largest influence on the
outcome is an increase in emissions from enteric fermentation and from livestock manure. The
biggest contribution comes again from increased emissions in Brazil and India, along with
smaller increases in countries such as Australia, New Zealand and the United States. The result is
ameliorated to a modest degree by reductions in emissions from synthetic fertilizers and rice
production, primarily in developing countries.
       The finding that overall abolition of subsidies and border protection increases emissions
is somewhat surprising and potentially controversial. In general, there is no strong reason to
expect that measures introduced primarily for political-economy reasons unrelated to climate
change mitigation would have either a positive or negative impact on GHG emissions. One
might expect that abolition of such measures might--by increasing overall economic
efficiency--reduce emissions to the extent that it leads to the adoption of lower-cost, and
generally more efficient, approaches to production.
       However, as noted in Mamun, Martin and Tokgoz (2019), agricultural protection tends to
be higher in developed countries, where emission intensities tend to be lower than in developing
countries. Abolition of protection, by unwinding the tendency to relocate production in the high-
income countries, may well result in an increase in emissions of the type observed in our model
results. While the results are much more specific than this, with sharp differences in emission
intensities within both the rich and the poor country group, this difference is probably a major
contributing factor to the findings from our model-based analysis.
       Our results are also influenced by our decision to fix land use in agriculture in all
countries so that we could focus on the impacts of reform on agricultural emissions without,
because of time constraints, being able to address the issue of land use change. While solving the
problem of dealing with land use increases in developing countries, it reduces the ability of our
modelling to consider reductions in land use in the countries that currently provide the highest
rates of support to agriculture. Taking land use changes into account is an important priority for
further work in this area. This will be particularly important both for assessing the full impacts of
subsidy reform on emissions, and for assessing the impacts of productivity changes that can raise
agricultural yields and lead to sustainable intensification of agriculture that allow for sizeable
reductions in the agricultural land use footprint.

Removing All Farm Support and Maintaining Farm Incomes by Transfers/Taxes


Two simulations were performed for this assessment of the implications of removing farm
support and compensating those who lost from this change. The first replicated the results for full
liberalization presented in the previous section, with lump sum subsidies or taxes used to
maintain farm incomes at their initial level. The second involves the use of output subsidies or
taxes set in such a way as to maintain farm incomes. The first simulation produced results very
similar to those presented in Tables 14 and 15. In fact, these results were so similar that it makes
no sense to present them again. Although the simulation using uniform taxes/transfers to
maintain farm incomes at their initial levels is quite hypothetical, it produced results that are
quite informative about channels of effect.
       The impacts of this reform on outputs of key commodities are shown in Table 17. This
experiment involves uniform subsidies to maintain farm incomes in countries where rates of
protection were initially high, and uniform taxes in countries where protection was initially low.
Relative to Table 15, where existing support is removed without compensation to those
producers who lose, or taxation of the gainers, it results in higher farm output overall and in
developed countries, but generally lower output in developing countries. In lightly protected
countries such as Australia and Brazil, it results in much smaller rises in farm output than under
the overall liberalization scenario, where higher world prices shift production to these countries.
Economies like Canada and Japan, with wide variations in agricultural support rates, see sharp
declines in output from highly supported activities such as dairy production.

        The changes in emissions associated with this reform are presented in Table 18. The
increase in emissions resulting from the abolition of all support is cut in half from the levels
reported in Table 16, despite the overall increase in global farm output. As is evident in Table 18,
the major source of this change is reductions from the earlier increases in emissions from Enteric

in output and emissions from beef under the full liberalization scenario.

Productivity Improvements


A striking feature of the emission intensity data provided through FAOSTAT is that the average
emission intensity of livestock products is generally much lower in OECD countries than in Non-
OECD countries (Mamun, Martin and Tokgoz 2019; Tubiello 2012). This suggests that higher
productivity tends to lower the emission intensity of agriculture. One potentially important
approach to reducing emissions from agriculture is through investments designed to increase
productivity and reduce greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture. Investments in agricultural
R&D that raise agricultural productivity also have the key advantage of being a powerful
instrument for poverty reduction (Ivanic and Martin 2018).
       Clearly, there are many ways in which agricultural emissions per unit of output might be
reduced. If, for instance, emissions were linked to the amount of land used, and output per unit of
land increased, then emissions per unit of output would decline. Alternatively, an efficiency
improvement that reduced the amount of inputs such as feed needed per unit of output would
result in a decline in emissions per unit of output where emissions are linked to the feed input.
       Gerber et al (2013, pp 48-50) provide a range of alternatives for lowering emissions from
livestock, involving a range of strategies such as using feed additives, manipulating rumen
behavior, reducing storage time for manure, selecting genetically improved animals and
increasing livestock fertility rates. Some of these options (such as increasing fertility) both
reduce emissions and increase productivity, while others (such as feed additives designed purely
to reduce emissions (e.g., Mernit 2018)) may have little or no impact on productivity. Some
options, such as improving calving rates for beef cows and the time required to reach slaughter
weight can have large impacts on productivity because of the substantial feed requirements for
maintenance in beef cattle.
       A similar range of strategies can be envisaged for crop production. For rice, Neue (1993)
identifies a range of strategies for reducing emission intensities. Millar et al (2014) identify a
similar range of strategies for reducing N2O emissions from other cereal crops, using approaches
such as selecting the right application rate, using the right fertilizer formulation, and optimizing
the timing and placement of fertilizers.
       Considerable care needs to be taken in specifying the nature of productivity change when
examining its impact on GHG emissions. If emissions are linked to input-use--which is likely
for important emission categories such as enteric fermentation in cattle--then widely-used
                                                  41
approaches to specifying productivity growth such as purely factor-augmenting technical change
will not capture such reductions in input intensity. What is needed to capture this is a form of
productivity gain that saves on both factors and intermediate inputs. Productivity changes of this
broad type are well known in the literature (OECD 2001). While such productivity changes need
special weights when index approaches are being used to measure implications for national
productivity, this problem does not arise when model-based approaches are being used.
       As it would be impossible to analyze all possible forms of productivity change that might
apply, we consider two relevant polar cases:
       (i)     Productivity change that saves all factors and intermediate inputs, and
       (ii)    Productivity change that reduces emissions without substantially increasing
               productivity.
       The first type of productivity change will reduce emission intensities roughly in
proportion to the increase in productivity. Its effect on overall emissions is, however, likely to be
influenced by the so-called rebound effect, where the reduction in the cost of the good resulting
from the productivity increase raises demand for the good and hence reduces the benefit in terms
of emission reduction. Freire-Gonzalez and Puig-Ventosa (2015) examine the importance of this
phenomenon and advocate combining productivity change and energy taxes to minimize it. The
second type of policy preserves the gains from reductions in emission intensity but faces the risk
that it will not be sufficiently attractive to producers for it to be widely adopted. The two cases
can perhaps be most usefully thought of as limiting cases that bound a wide range of
intermediate possibilities.
       For this section, we considered (i) a productivity change that reduced emissions by 30
percent without reducing intermediate or factor input demands, and (ii) a productivity change
(MFP) that reduced both the factor and intermediate input demands for all agricultural sectors by
30 percent. The 30 percent was chosen for illustrative purposes because it is widely regarded as
being in the order of magnitude of gains feasible in important areas such as reducing generation
of greenhouse gases by enteric fermentation (Mernit 2018). The results for percentage reductions
in protection from these simulations are presented in Table 19.

The results in the first column of Table 19 reflect the pure emission reductions, not associated
with any other increase in productivity. For the set of countries covered by the OECD analysis
and, for comparability, by our productivity simulations, the reduction in emissions from
agriculture is 28.8 percent, very close to the 30 percent reduction in the emission intensity of
each activity. The small discrepancy reflects the presence of some emissions that are linked to
the use of peat land, without being linked to agricultural output. The reduction in emissions for
Developed Countries is almost as large as for the OECD sample, at 27.7 percent, reflecting
(slightly) incomplete coverage of developed countries by the OECD. Globally, emissions are
reduced by 19.5 percent, rather than 30 percent, primarily because of the incomplete coverage of
world agriculture by the OECD sample.

        The second column refers to the case where emission intensities of each activity are also
reduced by 30 percent, but these reductions are accompanied by savings of factors and
intermediate inputs. In this situation, there are two determinants of emission outcomes--the
reduction in emissions associated directly with the reduction in the emission intensity of each
activity, and the increase in output associated with the famous "rebound" or Jevons effect
associated with the increase in productivity. This effect seemed surprisingly large given the
relatively low elasticities of demand for agricultural products in the model, so we investigated
the changes in output by sector associated with it. The associated changes in output are given in
Table 20. The large changes in output occurred despite large falls in world prices of agricultural
products (22.5 percent on average across all farm products) that were needed to offset the large
increase in the effective price of agricultural products associated with the increase in productivity
(see Martin and Alston 1997).

The OECD sample column is easiest to interpret because our productivity simulation affects all
the countries included in it. The overall increase in farm output is strikingly large given the 30
percent cost reduction and the relatively low elasticities of demand for most agricultural
products. One cause of this large increase in output is the increase in the efficiency of grain
production, which--in addition to the increase in productivity within the livestock sector--
increases the supply of livestock products. Another cause is the double impact of productivity
change on output--a 30 percent increase in productivity increases output for unchanged inputs
by 30 percent and increases the incentive to use additional inputs in this activity (Martin and
Alston 1997). At the same time, however, the increase in the efficiency of feed use in the
livestock sector reduces the demand for feed from maize and similar commodities, which end up
expanding less than other crop and livestock activities. This result illustrates the complexity of
productivity increases of this type--that save both inputs and factors--because of their
compounding effect along value chains.

        Another striking feature of the table is the very large increases in output of agricultural
fibers. This reflects the competition between agricultural fibers such as cotton and synthetic
fibers in the production of textiles. There are also important, but relatively smaller, differences in
output effects between crops and livestock. Livestock output rises somewhat more, partly
because the elasticity of demand for livestock products is larger, and partly because of the
increase in the productivity of the feed-producing sector. Despite the larger increase in output
                                                        44
from the relatively emission-intensive livestock sector, agricultural emissions fall by 9.6 percent
because of the large savings in emissions within these sectors.
       The very large reductions in emissions associated with pure emission-reducing
innovations (see Table 15) relative to those associated with productivity-enhancing innovations
that only incidentally reduce emissions have important policy implications. While raising
productivity in ways that reduces input use can lower emissions, it is clear from this analysis that
the rebound effect of this type of productivity increase is quite large. This suggests that research
that focusses primarily on emission reduction could be quite important in achieving overall
reductions in emissions. This result may change to some degree once the analysis can be
extended to include changes in land use change. If land-saving technology enables reductions in
the global agricultural footprint, it may be able to harvest gains from carbon sequestration that
are in addition to those included here--although the extent of these gains will depend on the
types of land that leave agricultural use.



Conclusions

The analysis presented in this paper examines the implications of current levels of support to
farmers on global agricultural emissions. To assess this impact, we examined the impact of
eliminating the current measures. In this initial assessment, we focused only on emissions from
agricultural production, and constrained land use to remain constant. We built on the OECD
(2018a) measures of agricultural incentives, and developed a new model relating emissions to
agricultural outcomes that accounts for the specificity of emissions by production sector and by
source of emissions.
       Our analysis leads to the conclusion that subsidies coupled to production result in
increases in global agricultural output and emissions. Eliminating these measures resulted in a
decline in global farm output volume of 0.9 percent, with slightly smaller declines in the output
of some of the most emission-intensive commodities, such as beef (-0.7 percent) and dairy
products (-0.6 percent). The decline in the CO2 equivalent of global emissions from agriculture
was 0.6 percent, partly because of the smaller declines in output of the most emission-intensive
products and partly because the relocation of production in some cases resulted in increases in
the emission intensity of production.

                                                 45
       When coupled subsidies and border measures are eliminated, we see a decline in global
farm output, largely in the developed countries. Despite this decline in output, global emissions
rose because of the movement from relatively low-emission-intensity countries to somewhat
higher emission intensity countries such as Brazil. However, the increase in emissions is smaller
than when only border measures are abolished, because of the elimination of the stimulus to
output of emission-intensive activities from coupled subsidies.
       We also investigated the effects of investments that increase agricultural productivity or
reduce emissions from agricultural production. A key feature of the productivity-increasing
simulations is that they involve saving of intermediate inputs as well as factors, since pure factor-
augmenting technological change would not generally reduce emission intensities. The
productivity-increasing technological changes were compared with experiments in which the
emission-intensities of products were reduced by the same 30 percent without increases in
productivity. The pure reductions in emission intensities generated much greater reductions in
emissions from agriculture that were roughly three times as large as those from the productivity-
increasing simulations because the productivity increases generated a substantial rebound effect
with especially large increases in output in livestock sectors.
       This work has many limitations and its results need to be interpreted with considerable
caution. Given the time constraint under which this report was prepared, we were forced to rely
almost entirely on the measures of agricultural support provided by the OECD. While these
measures cover a very large share of global output, they omit some important agricultural
producers such as Argentina and many developing countries whose collective output is
considerable. Extending the coverage of these measures is an important priority for future
research. Another important priority for the future is to comprehensively consider the impacts of
reforming agricultural incentives on land use change and particularly the substantial emissions
associated with deforestation. Finally, our tentative conclusion that simply reducing current
agricultural distortions has a relatively limited impact on emissions--and may even increase
them--points to a need to investigate the use of the multiple instruments needed to achieve
policy makers' multiple goals.
