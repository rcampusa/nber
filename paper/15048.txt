                                              ABSTRACT

We study the effect of globalization on the volatility of wages and worker welfare in a model in which
risk is allocated through long-run employment relationships (the 'invisible handshake'). Globalization
can take two forms: International integration of commodity markets (i.e., free trade) and international
integration of factor markets (i.e., offshoring). In a two-country, two-good, two-factor model we show
that free trade and offshoring have opposite effects on rich-country workers. Free trade hurts rich-country
workers, while reducing the volatility of their wages; by contrast, offshoring benefits them, while raising
the volatility of their wages. We thus formalize, but also sharply circumscribe, a common critique
of globalization.

1. Introduction

   A key feature of globalization in recent years, paralleling increases in trade flows, has

been the striking increase in international labor-market integration. This is manifested both

in foreign direct investment, which allows a firm access to labor in several countries at once,1

and also in international offshoring2 of business services.3

       A parallel phenomenon has been the rise in income volatility for rich-country workers.

This was documented in Gottschalk, Moffitt, Katz and Dickens (1994) with much recent

evidence in Shin and Solon (2008) and Krishna and Senses (2008). Recent journalistic

accounts of rising economic insecurity among US workers with evidence from individual

case studies, survey data, and labor-market data are found in Gosselin (2004) and Hacker

(2004). By some measures, volatility of individual earnings in the United States has doubled

since the 1970’s. It should be underlined that this is not due merely to higher turnover or

restructuring of the economy, as workers in one sector lose jobs and workers in other sectors

gain them; Gottschalk et. al. (1994) show that a sharp rise in volatility can be observed

even among workers who do not change jobs. A key theme in many accounts of current

labor market trends is the claim that the nature of jobs has changed in such a way that jobs

are less secure, and the loyalty felt by employers to workers is weaker, than in previous eras,
   1
       In the US case, employment both by inward and outward multinational operations has increased

markedly over the past generation. From 1977 to 2001, employment by majority-owned US affiliates of

foreign companies grew by 4.7 million, and employment by foreign affiliates of US firms grew by 2.8 million

(Mataloni (2004, pp. 53-54)). During this period employment by nonbank foreign affiliates grew from 1.7

percent to 5.6 percent of US employment (Zeile (2003, p.45)).
   2
     To clarify, in this paper ‘offshoring’ refers to the hiring of workers in one country by an employer in a

different country, a practice sometimes called ‘outsourcing’ in the popular press.
    3
      Amiti and Wei (2006), for example, note that offshoring of business services by US manufacturers grew

by 6.3 percent per annum in the 1990’s.




                                                      1
with globalization and offshoring often cited as a causal influence.4,5

       We ask in this paper if it is possible that these phenomena may indeed be related, that

is, if greater international integration may lead to greater volatility of wages by weakening

employment relationships.

       We explore this in the context of a simple model of risk-bearing in employment rela-

tionships in which complete contracts are unavailable for informational reasons. In this

environment, the only way for an employer to share risk with a worker is to develop a long-

run relationship in which the firm promises to smooth out (partially or completely) shocks

to wages, and the worker in turn promises a long-run commitment to the firm. Such implicit

contracts, often called the ‘invisible handshake,’ are enforceable only through the threat

that if one reneges, he or she will lose the benefit of the trust on which the relationship was

founded, and will need to suffer the whims of the market and search for a new worker (or

employer, as the case may be). Integration of one’s country’s labor market with another

can make it easier or harder to search for a worker, thus respectively reducing or increasing

the potential for risk-sharing relationships, and thus increasing or reducing the volatility of

wages as the case may be.
   4
       For example, sociologist Richard Sennett has described “the ‘casualization’ of the labor force” he has

observed in interviews with workers over a thirty-year period (Sennett (2006, p. 48), accompanied by a

decline in trust and loyalty in worker-employer relations (pp. 63-72). Journalistic accounts echoing these

observations are common; see, for example, Uchitelle (2006, chapter 2) for a history of the rise and fall of

long-run implicit contracts between employers and workers in the US labor market. Uchitelle argues that

trade pressures of the 1970’s were a major influence in their demise. See also Meyerson (2006), Levine (2006),

Uchitelle (2005), and Holstein (2005) for similar views.
  5
    These themes loom large in popular opinion, as well. For example, in a recent poll by Greenberg Quinlan

Rosner Research (2004), 63% of respondents were ‘very concerned’ or ‘extremely concerned’ about ‘global

economic competition and the outsourcing of American jobs’ (p.6). Further, 46% called it the most important

or second most important issue concerning them (p.5). The respondents were only slightly more worried

about the Iraq war.



                                                       2
   Here we will comment briefly on related work and then on the distinctive features of our

approach.

   Related work. The literature on international offshoring has followed several strands.

Feenstra and Hanson (1996) analyze the allocation of tasks within a complex production

process between a skill-abundant home country and a skill-poor foreign country. They show

that movement of capital to the foreign country leads to a rise in the number of tasks

allocated to foreign workers (‘offshoring’), while at the same time increasing the relative

demand for skilled labor in both countries, a hypothesis borne out by the data. Later analyses

of equilibrium international offshoring, such as Grossman and Helpman (2005), have been

built on incomplete-contracting models; Spencer (2005) provides a survey. Grossman and

Rossi-Hansberg (2006) show how offshoring tasks can confer a productivity benefit that can

boost domestic wages, and Antràs, Garicano and Rossi-Hansberg (2006) employ a matching

model with heterogeneous workers to examine the effects of offshoring on income distribution

within both countries. Mitra and Ranjan (2007) look at the implications for unemployment,

showing that general equilibrium effects of offshoring can be paradoxical and quite beneficial

for domestic workers.

   None of these approaches addresses issues of risk, and so none can shed light on the rising

volatility of workers’ incomes – particularly within a job, as seen in the data. In contrast,

we are able to do so by drawing on the economics of implicit contracts in the labor market.

The importance of such contracts has been well documented empirically; see Beaudry and

DiNardo (1991) and McDonald and Worswick (1999) for pioneering work, and Malcomson

(1999, section 3) for a survey. Matusz (1985, 1986) explores implicit labor contracts in trade

models, but with a different focus from this paper. His papers feature enforceable contracts

and risk-averse workers with indivisible labor supply, resulting in rigid wages with positive

rates of equilibrium unemployment.

   This paper is related to an earlier one by McLaren and Newman (2004), which studied

                                              3
the effect of globalization on risk-sharing in an abstract economy with symmetric agents.

Here, by contrast, the asymmetry between workers and employers is the focus, as well as

the distribution of income between workers and employers. In addition, that paper, unlike

the current paper, confined attention to stationary risk-sharing relationships, which are in

general sub-optimal. Moreover, the two-good setup of the present paper allows us to analyze

the effects of free trade, which was not possible with the earlier paper. See Kocherlakota

(1996) for an extensive analysis of optimal history-dependant risk-sharing relationships. The

argument is also related to the literature initiated by Ramey and Watson (2001), showing

how improvements in search technology can have perverse effects on incentives.

      This exercise is also close in spirit to Thomas and Worrall (1988).6 They analyze self-

enforcing labor contracts between a risk-neutral employer and a risk-averse employee in the

presence of an exogenous and randomly fluctuating labor spot market. The employer offers

wage smoothing to the employee, implying wages above the spot wage in slumps; in return

the worker accepts a wage below the spot market in booms. Both sides know that if either

reneges on this agreement, both will be forced to use the spot market from then on. The

presence of the spot market generally puts a binding constraint on the amount of insurance

the employer can provide. By contrast, in this paper, the real wage in the spot-market

sector is determined endogenously by general-equilibrium considerations and in particular

is affected by globalization. Further, the value of entering the search pool (which is also

the spot-market sector) is endogenous, since it depends on how easy it is to find a match

and also on how well cooperation works with the new partner once a match has been found.

Thus, this is a general equilibrium exercise, while the Thomas and Worrall model is partial

equilibrium in character. The aim is to ask how an increase in international openness would
  6
      Our approach to finding the optimal contract with a risk-averse worker follows that paper. It should

be pointed out that this project adds moral hazard, raising issues studied, for example, in MacLeod and

Malcomson (1989).



                                                     4
affect wage-smoothing within the firm.

       This effect of globalization on wage volatility has been explored in various forms. For

example, Rodrik (1997, chapter 2), in the course of a wide-ranging review of the risk effects

of globalization, pointed out that globalization can change labor demand elasticities in such

a way that the variance of spot wages is increased, an observation that has generated sub-

stantial subsequent work.7 This approach assumes away risk-sharing institutions implicitly.

By contrast, we focus on how risk-sharing mechanisms, such as implicit labor contracts,

which are endogenously imperfect, can themselves be affected by globalization.

       An approach much more closely related to ours is Bertrand (2004). In her model, firms hit

with stiff import competition have an increased risk of bankruptcy; a firm whose probability

of bankruptcy is high has effectively a higher discount rate, and thus a diminished ability

to promise wage-smoothing credibly. This leads to higher wage volatility within a given

employment relationship. The effect is shown to have strong empirical support in US data.

       Our approach. Our model is highly stylized, which is a necessity in order to treat optimal

implicit contracts in an open-economy general equilibrium model. Once the logic of this

stylized model is understood, it is not difficult to see what would happen in a more realistic

and complicated extension. In our model, workers are risk-averse, while the employers are

risk-neutral. There are two sectors, a ‘careers sector’ in which production is risky and requires

unobservable effort by a worker and by an employer, and a ‘spot market sector’ with risk-free

Ricardian technology. An employer in the ‘careers sector’ would like to commit credibly to a

constant wage, in effect selling insurance at the same time as it purchases labor, but without

enforceable contracts it can do so only by reputational means, and so is constrained by its

incentive-compatibility constraints.

       Workers seeking a career-sector job and employers seeking an employee search until they
   7
       Traca (2005) offers an elegant general-equilibrium formalization along these lines, and Scheve and Slaugh-

ter (2004) summarize some of the empirical work that has followed.



                                                         5
have a match. Because of the need to elicit effort, wage compensation in the ‘careers sector’

is ‘back-loaded’ in equilibrium; a worker puts in effort today in order to earn compensation

that will be due to her tomorrow. This is the same principle analyzed by Lazear (1979) in

his analysis of mandatory retirement: When non-contractible effort must be elicited from

a worker, it is generally optimal to promise workers wages that increase over time, so that

fear of losing high future wages deters shirking. This implies that senior workers receive

quasi-rents from their employer. In Lazear’s analysis, this motivates the use of mandatory

retirement. Shleifer and Summers (1988) show that the same principle can motivate hostile

takeovers, if an acquiring firm is not bound by the commitments made by the incumbent

employer to pay the promised high wages to the senior workers. In our paper, we show that

this same principle can motivate increased variance of wages as a result of offshoring.

       Because of this back-loading of wages, in the ‘careers sector,’ new workers are always

cheaper than incumbent ones. This is the source of the firm’s problem: During adverse

shocks, when the firm’s profitability is low, if it has promised to pay the same high wage as

in good states, it will be tempted to renege, dumping the current worker and picking up a

new, cheaper one instead. If it is easy to find a new worker quickly, workers will therefore

know not to trust an employer’s promise of wage insurance, and, expecting a low wage in

bad times, they will demand a high wage in good times. Thus, if it is easy to find a new

worker, an employer that makes only credible promises will promise a low wage in bad states

and a high wage in good states, implying a high variance of wages in equilibrium.

       There are two countries, which differ only in their ratios of workers to employers. Glob-

alization can take two forms: Free trade, or integration of goods markets, and offshoring,

or integration of labor markets.8 From the point of view of the labor-scarce economy, free
   8
       Obviously, international offshoring can be modelled in many different ways. One approach is to assume

a complex production process, requiring many tasks, some of which can be performed abroad, as in Feenstra

and Hanson (1996) or Grossman and Rossi-Hansberg (2006). Changes in the environment can then raise the



                                                      6
trade pushes down the price of labor-intensive ‘spot-market-sector’ output, which makes

labor cheaper and also loosens employers’ incentive-compatibility constraints, lowering the

variance of wages. On the other hand, offshoring, by making it easier for a firm in a labor-

scarce economy to hire workers, reduces the amount of wage insurance that can be credibly

promised, raising the variance of wages in the careers sector. At the same time offshoring

creates efficiencies in matching workers to employers that spill over, in general equilibrium,

to benefit workers as consumers, raising real incomes for workers worldwide.9 Thus, free

trade reduces the volatility of rich-country wages, but makes rich-country workers worse off;

offshoring raises the volatility of rich-country wages, but makes rich-country workers better

off. We thus formalize, but also sharply circumscribe, a common critique of globalization:

Offshoring can indeed weaken the invisible handshake, raising the volatility of rich-country

wages, but general equilibrium effects raise expected wages by more than enough to compen-

sate.

    The model can shed light on a number of empirical findings. First, as mentioned above,

Bertrand (2004) showed that US workers whose sector of employment saw a rise in import

penetration tended to see a rise in wage volatility compared to other sectors, which she

interpreted as a response to an increased probability of bankruptcy. In our paper, we show

that exactly the same effects can be obtained in a model without bankruptcy (and of course
fraction of tasks done abroad. These can be thought of as models of partially-integrated labor markets; a rise

in the degree of integration leads to more offshoring. In this paper, we simplify the treatment of offshoring

by assuming that labor markets across borders are either completely segmented or completely integrated;

offshoring is a move from the former to the latter. This simplification allows us to focus on the richness of

the implicit contracts. It is clear that one could model offshoring with partially integrated labor markets so

as to capture the same sort of effects, at the cost of greater complexity.
   9
     There is strong empirical support for effects of this sort. Amiti and Wei (2006) show that US manu-

facturing sectors that were in a better position during the 1990’s to take advantage of international service

offshoring showed sharply better productivity gains than other sectors. This would, of course, be likely to

lead to declines in the prices of output for those sectors as required by the story outlined here.


                                                      7
we analyze the effects of both offshoring and trade in general equilibrium).10 This is also

broadly consistent with more recent findings by Krishna and Senses (2008), although the

match is not as close because that paper shows that the permanent component of income

volatility is higher for workers in industries with larger increases in import penetration (and

the data are not limited to workers who do not change jobs). Second, we can (subject to

parameter values) rationalize a rise in economy-wide average wage volatility as a result of

globalization, as documented by Gottschalk, et. al. (1994), Gosselin (2004) and Hacker

(2004). Third, Scheve and Slaughter (2004) have shown that British workers in sectors with

more multinational activity are significantly more prone to doubt their economic security

than those in other sectors – even if the multinational activity takes the form of inward

foreign direct investment. Thus, it appears that labor market integration raises workers’

perceptions of risk in a way that has nothing to do with the possibility of losing one’s job to

a foreign worker. Scheve and Slaughter suggest that the presence of multinationals raises the

elasticity of labor demand, thus raising the variance of wages for given variance of shocks;

however, as noted above, this ‘elasticity’ interpretation assumes away the possibility of risk-

sharing institutions between workers and employers, which themselves can be affected by

globalization. In this paper, such institutions, namely the ‘invisible handshake,’ are the

focus, and we show that the endogenous response of those institutions to globalization can

themselves offer an explanation of the Scheve and Slaughter findings.

       We present the formal model in the next section. In the following sections we characterize
  10
       Bertrand (2004) shows a positive correlation between a sector’s import penetration and wage volatility

in that sector (measured as sensitivity of a worker’s wage to current labor-market conditions). Strictly

speaking, our model has only one sector with implicit contracts, the ‘careers sector,’ and it is an export

sector (hence has negative import penetration). However, it is easy to see that if we had multiple careers

sectors, with a role for the invisible handshake in each one, but the US had a comparative advantage in

some but not others, then clearly wage volatility in those sectors with a comparative disadvantage would be

increased by opening up trade and vice versa. This would be exactly as in Bertrand’s empirical findings.


                                                       8
optimal wage contracts, derive the conditions under which those contracts will exhibit volatile

wages, and study the comparative statics of wage volatility. Then, in the final section, we

show how the general equilibrium is changed by free trade and offshoring.



2. The Model

   We analyze the questions at hand with a two-good, two-country, two-factor general equi-

librium model. In this section, we will describe the key features of the closed-economy version

in detail; we will treat the two-country version later.

(i) Production.

   Consider first a closed-economy model with two types of agent, ‘workers,’ of which there

are a measure L, and ‘employers,’ of which there are a measure E. There are two sectors. A

risk-free sector, Y , uses only workers, each of whom produces one unit of output per period

employed in the sector. This is what was called the ‘spot-market sector’ in the introduction.

A second sector, X, which will serve as a numeraire sector, employs both employers and

workers. This is what was called the ‘careers sector’ in the introduction. In order for

production to occur in this sector, one worker must team up with one employer. We will call

a given such partnership a ‘firm.’ In each period, X production requires that a worker and

employer must both put in one unit of non-contractible effort. Workers suffer a disutility

from effort equal to k > 0, while employers suffer no such disutility. (Adding a disutility

for employers would add to the notation without substantively changing results.) Within a

given firm, denote the effort put in by agent i by ei ∈ {0, 1}, where i = W indicates the

worker and i = E denotes the employer. The output generated in that period is then equal

to R = x eW eE , where  is an idiosyncratic iid random variable that takes the value  = G

or B with respective probabilities π , where πG + πB = 1 and xG > xB > 0. The variable 

indicates whether the current period is one with a good state or a bad state for the firm’s


                                               9
profitability. Of course, since X is the numeraire, output and revenue are equal. The average

revenue is denoted by x ≡ πG xG + πB xB .

       Production in the Y sector is straightforward. Each worker in that sector produces one

unit of output per period, receiving an income of ω y . Since this is a constant-returns-to-scale

sector with only one factor, we must have ω y = py > 0, where py is the price of Y -sector

output.

(ii) Search.

       Workers seeking an X-sector employer and X-sector employers seeking a worker search

until they have a match. Search follows a specification of a type used extensively by Pissarides

(2000). If a measure n of workers and a measure m of employers search in a given period,

then Φ(n, m) matches occur, where Φ is a concave function increasing in all arguments and

homogeneous of degree 1, with Φ(n, m) ≤ min(n, m) and Φnm = Φmn > 0 ∀ n, m. It is

convenient to denote by QE the steady-state probability that a vacancy will be filled in any
                                                  Φ(n,m)
given period, or in other words, QE =               m
                                                         ,   where n and m are set at their steady-state
                                            Φ(n,m)
values. Similarly, denote by QW =             n
                                                     the steady-state probability that a searching worker

will find an X-sector job in any given period. Search has no direct cost, but for those who

are currently in X-sector firms it does have an opportunity cost: If an agent is searching for

a new partner, then she is unable to put in effort for production with her existing partner.

On the other hand, for workers in the Y sector, there is no opportunity cost to search.11

       Note that since a worker can produce Y without an employer, and can search simultane-

ously, any worker not currently in an X-sector firm produces Y .

       There is also a possibility in each period that a worker and employer who have been

together producing X output in the past will be exogenously separated from each other.
  11
       Thus, the X-sector jobs are more challenging jobs that require a worker’s full attention, while Y -sector

jobs are more casual, and permit a worker to earn an income while searching for something else. Adding an

opportunity cost to search in the Y sector would add complexity without adding anything of real importance.



                                                        10
This probability is given by a constant (1 − ρ) ∈ (0, 1).

(iii) Preferences.

       There is no storage, saving or borrowing, so an agent’s income in a given period is equal

to that agent’s consumption in that period.

       Employers. All employers have the same linear homogeneous quasi-concave per-period

utility function, U (cX , cY ), defined over consumption cX and cY of goods X and Y , respec-
                                                                       I
tively. This yields indirect utility function v(I, px , py ) =      Γ(px ,py )
                                                                               ,   where I denotes income;

px and py denote the prices of the two goods respectively; and Γ is a linear homogenous

function that generates the consumer price index derived from the utility function U . (In

other words, Γ(px , py ) is the minimum expenditure required to obtain unit utility with prices

px and py .) Recalling that X is our numeraire sector, we have px ≡ 1, and it is convenient

to write the consumer price index as P (py ) ≡ Γ(1, py ). Note that by Shephard’s Lemma, the

elasticity of P (py ) with respect to py is equal to good Y ’s share in consumption.

       Workers. All workers have the same per-period utility function µ(U (cX , cY )) over con-

sumption of goods X and Y . The function µ is a strictly increasing and strictly concave

von-Neumann-Morgenstern utility function. Thus, using the notation developed just above,

if in a given period a worker receives a wage ω and faces a consumer price index of P = P (py ),

then the worker’s utility for that period is given by µ( Pω ).

       In other words, workers are risk-averse and employers are risk-neutral, but both will

exhibit the same demand behavior for a given income.

(iv) Goods market clearing.

       In each period, the total amount of each good produced must equal the amount consumed.

Since given the relative price py both workers and employers will consume X and Y in the
                                                                           U2 (1,r)
same proportions, this amounts to the condition that py =                  U1 (1,r)
                                                                                    ,   where the subscripts

denote partial derivatives, and r denotes the ratio of Y production to X production.12 In

       Obviously, in the closed-economy version of the model r will refer to the ratio of domestic Y and X


                                                     11
other words, the relative price must be equal to the marginal rate of substitution between

the two goods determined by the production ratio. We assume that U2 (1, r) → ∞ as r → 0,

and U1 (1, r) → ∞ as r → ∞, which (given that U is quasi-concave and hence the marginal

rate of substitution is strictly decreasing in r) implies a unique, market-clearing value of

py ∈ (0, ∞) for any r ∈ (0, ∞). Further, py is strictly decreasing in r.

(v) Sequence of events.

    The sequence of events within each period is as follows. (i) Any existing matched employer

and worker in the X sector learn whether or not they will be exogenously separated this

period. (ii) The profitability state  for each X-sector firm is realized. Within a given

employment relationship, this is immediately common knowledge. The value of  is not

available to any agent outside of the firm, however. (iii) The wage, if any, is paid (a claim

on the firm’s output at the end of the period). (iv) The employer and worker simultaneously

choose their effort levels ei . At the same time, the search mechanism operates. Within

an X-sector firm, if ei = 0, then agent i can participate in search. At the same time, all

Y -sector workers search. (v) Each X-sector firm’s revenue, R, is realized, and profits and

consumption are realized.13 (vi) For those agents who have found a new potential partner in

this period’s search, new partnerships with a new self-enforcing agreement are formed. This

is achieved by a take-it-or-leave-it offer made by the employer to the worker.
production, while in the open-economy version the world output ratio will be the relevant variable.
  13
     Strictly speaking, there is the possibility, off of the equilibrium path, that the firm’s output will be zero

because one or the other party has shirked, raising the question of how the wage claim issued in sub-period

(iii) can be redeemed. This issue could be eliminated by assuming that, rather than zero output, the employer

is able to produce some positive output, say, xmin > 0, even without a worker. The wages can be paid out of

that output at the end of the period. The interpretation of xG and xB is, then, the additional output that

is produced in cooperation with a non-shirking worker. This would require carrying this additional piece of

notation throughout the analysis and would increase the total amount of good X produced, but would not

change any of our qualitative results.




                                                       12
   We will focus on steady-state equilibria. In such an equilibrium, the expected lifetime

discounted profit of an employer with vacancy is denoted V ES and the expected lifetime

discounted utility of a searching worker is denoted V W S , where the ‘S’ indicates the state

of searching. Similarly, we can denote by V ER and V W R the lifetime payoffs to employers

and workers respectively evaluated at the beginning of a cooperative X-sector relationship.

Naturally, we must have V W R ≥ V W S in equilibrium, or no worker will accept an X-sector

job. The values V ij are endogenous, as they are affected by the endogenous probability of

finding a match in any given period and by the endogenous value of entering a relationship

once a match has been found. However, any employer will take them as given when designing

the wage agreement. We can write:
                       y
       V W S = µ( ωP ) + QW ρβV W R + QW (1 − ρ)βV W S + (1 − QW )βV W S , and
                                                                                          (1)
           ES      E       ER      E            ES          E       ES
       V        = Q ρβV         + Q (1 − ρ)βV        + (1 − Q )βV        .

The Y -sector worker’s payoff from search is the current Y -sector wage plus the continuation

values if the worker finds X-sector work and is not immediately separated, finds X-sector

work and is immediately separated, or fails to find X-sector work. The payoff from search for

an X-sector employer with vacancy is given by the continuation value if the employer finds

a worker who is not immediately separated, finds a worker who is immediately separated,

or fails to find a worker. If an X-sector worker, or an X-sector employer who already has a

worker, chooses to search, the payoff will be the same as in (1), except for a straightforward

change in the first-period payoff.

   Given those values, a self-enforcing agreement between a worker and an employer is

simply a sub-game perfect equilibrium of the game that they play together. We assume that

the employer has all of the bargaining power, so the agreement chosen is simply the one that

gives the employer the highest expected discounted profit, subject to incentive constraints

(we discuss briefly the consequences of relaxing this assumption in footnote 24, Section 6).

Without loss of generality, we will assume that the ‘grim punishment’ is used, meaning here

                                                     13
that if either agent defects from the agreement at any time, the relationship is severed and

both agents must search for new partners. Thus, the payoff following a deviation would be

V ES for an employer and V W S for a worker.

   To sum up, risk-neutral employers search for risk-averse workers, and when they find each

other, the employer offers the worker the profit-maximizing self-enforcing wage contract,

which then remains in force until one party reneges or the two are exogenously separated.

This pattern provides a steady flow of workers and employers into the search pool, where

they receive endogenous payoffs V W S and V ES . These values then act as parameters that

constrain the optimal wage contract.

   The analysis will proceed as follows. We will characterize optimal labor contracts in the

X sector. It turns out that optimal contracts are very much affected by the values of py and

QE . We will show how they change as we vary py and QE exogenously, and then we will show

how py and QE are determined endogenously, to complete the general equilibrium analysis.

We then will examine how these two values change with international integration of: (i)

goods markets, and then (ii) labor markets, to see how the behavior of wages is affected by

globalization.

   We first turn to the form of optimal contracts.



3. The form of optimal contracts in the X sector

   In general, optimal incentive-constrained agreements in problems of this sort can be quite

complex because the specified actions depend on the whole history of shocks and not only

the current one. (See Thomas and Worrall (1988) and Kocherlakota (1996).) In analyzing

the equilibrium, it is useful to note that in our model the employment contracts offered by

employers always take one of two very simple forms, which we will call ‘wage smoothing’ and

‘wage volatility.’ Derivation of this property is the purpose of this section.


                                               14
   The equilibrium can be characterized as the solution to a recursive optimization problem.

Denote by Ω(W ) the highest possible expected present discounted profit the employer can

receive in a subgame-perfect equilibrium, conditional on the worker receiving an expected

present discounted payoff of at least W . Arguments parallel to those in Thomas and Worrall

(1988) can be used to show that Ω is defined on an interval [Wmin , Wmax ] and is decreasing,

strictly concave, and differentiable, where Wmin and Wmax are respectively the lowest and

highest worker payoffs consistent with a subgame-perfect equilibrium of the game played by

an employer-worker pair. This function must satisfy the following functional equation:
                                h                                    i

   The right-hand side of (2) is the maximization problem solved by the employer. She

must choose a current-period wage ω for each state , and a continuation utility W
                                                                                  f for the

worker for subsequent periods following that state. Constraint (3) is the employer’s incentive

compatibility constraint: If this is not satisfied in state , then the employer will in that state

prefer to renege on the promised wage, understanding that this will cause the worker to lose

faith in the relationship and sending both parties into the search pool. Constraint (4) is the

worker’s incentive compatibility constraint. The left-hand side is the worker’s payoff from



                                                15
putting in effort in the current period, collecting the wage, and continuing the relationship.14

The right-hand side is the payoff from shirking and searching, in which case the worker’s

payoff is the same as it would be if she were in the Y sector except that in the current

period her income is ω instead of ω y . If this constraint is not satisfied, the worker will prefer

to shirk by searching instead of working.15 Constraint (5) is the target-utility constraint.

In the first period of an employment relationship, the employer must promise at least as

much of a payoff to the worker as remaining in the search pool would provide. Thus, in

that case, denoting the target utility at the beginning of the relationship by W0 , we have

W = W0 = V W S (and so V ER = Ω(V W S )). Thereafter, the employer will in general be

bound by promises of payoffs she had made to the worker in the past. Finally, (6) and (7)

are natural bounds on the choice variables.

       Constraint (4) can be replaced by the more convenient form:
                                                                   y

  14
       Note that we are assuming that a worker cannot receive a Y -sector wage while searching if that worker

is shirking on an X-sector job. This makes sense if, for example, effort is not observable and third-party

verifiable but physical presence on the job site is, and a worker can search while physically at the X-sector

job site but cannot produce Y -sector output while there. Thus, an X-sector employer would be able to sue

to recover the wage just paid if the worker was absent, working another job, instead of on site at the location

of the X firm.
  15
     Throughout, we will assume that it is optimal to induce the worker to exert effort in each state as long

as the employment relationship continues. This is clearly the case in a substantial portion of the parameter

space, and so we are implicitly restricting attention to that portion. We will comment in footnote 20, Section

6 on the parameter restrictions implicit in this assumption.

                                                       f = Wmin at the optimum. It is easy

to verify that W
               f = Wmax is never an optimal choice, and so we will ignore that case.)

The following lemma is proven in the appendix:

Lemma 1. Wmin = V W S .

Proof. See appendix.

       In other words, it is feasible for the employer to push the worker’s payoff down to the

opportunity payoff at the beginning of the employment relationship. Since it is in the interest

of the employer to do so, Lemma 1 makes clear that workers joining X-sector employment

receive the same payoff that they would receive in the Y sector, or in other words, V W R =

V W S .16 From (1), this immediately tells us:17

         V        =         ,                                                                            (10)
                    1−β
  16
       Formally, note that if the target-utility constraint (5) does not bind in the first period, so that the

worker’s utility exceeds V W S , then λ = 0, and (8) cannot bind with any positive wage. Therefore, the

first-period wage will be equal to zero in both states. Then, by Lemma 1, if (5) does not bind, then the

lower bound of (6) will not bind either, and so (9) will hold with equality; with λ = 0, this implies υ > 0,

which in turn implies that W    f ∗ in both states. Substituting this with the zero first-period wages into
                           f = W

the left-hand side of (5) shows that the worker’s payoff will be below V W S , a contradiction.
  17
     Of course, this implies that, in equilibrium, Y -sector workers are indifferent between searching and not

searching, so if a small search cost were imposed, there would be no search (this is a version of the Diamond

search paradox). However, this feature would disappear if any avenue were opened up to allow workers to

capture some portion of X-sector rents. For example, for simplicity, we have assumed that employers have

                                                       17
and (4)0 can be rewritten as:
                                       y

      W > W , where W ≡

Further, since W

henceforth. As a result, (9) will always hold with equality.

    To sum up, in each period the employer maximizes (2), subject to (3), (4)00 , (5), and (7).

In the first period of the relationship, the worker’s target utility W = W0 is given by V W S ,

but in the second period it is determined by the values of W
                                                           f chosen in the first period and

by the first-period state, and similarly in later periods it is determined by choices made at

earlier dates. We impose an assumption:


Assumption 1. In the first period of an employment relationship, the employer’s incentive-

compatibility constraint (3) does not bind in either state.


    We will discuss sufficient conditions for this later (in footnote 20 of Section 6). We can

now prove that under Assumption 1, the equilibrium always takes the same simple form: A

one-period ‘apprenticeship’ in which the Y -sector wage ω y is paid, followed by a time- and

history-invariant but perhaps state-dependent wage. The key idea is that it is never optimal

to promise more future utility than is required to satisfy the worker’s incentive constraint

(4)00 , so after the first period of the relationship, the worker’s target utility is always equal
   f ∗ . This means that after the first period, the optimal wage settings by the firm are
to W

stationary. We can now establish a detailed proof through the following two propositions.
all of the bargaining power, but this could be relaxed. In addition, we have assumed that k is common

knowledge, but it would be reasonable to assume that different workers have different values of k, and while

employers know the distribution of this parameter, they do not know any given worker’s value of it. Either of

these modifications would very substantially increase the complexity of the model, but would give X workers

some portion of the rents and thus avoid the Diamond paradox.

to W


Proof. Suppose, first, that the worker’s incentive compatibility constraint does not bind

in state  in the first period. Then υ = 0, and since ψ = 0 because of Assumption 1, (9)

becomes:


      Ω0 (W
          f ) + λ = 0.


(Recall that as seen in the proof of Lemma 1, (9) holds with equality). Since by the envelope

theorem, Ω0 (W0 ) = −λ, this and the concavity of Ω imply that W
                                                               f ≤ W0 = V W S . But

              f ∗ , this implies that the worker’s incentive compatibility constraint (4)00 will
since V W S < W

be violated, a contradiction. Therefore, the worker’s incentive compatibility constraint must

bind in each state, ensuring that W    f ∗ . Given that W
                                  f = W                     f ∗ and W0 = V W S , the target
                                                        f = W

utility constraint (5) is exactly satisfied by setting the wage in each state in the first period

equal to ω y . Therefore, ω y is the minimum first period wage required to make the worker

willing to accept the job. The condition (8), with ψ = 0, then ensures that it is indeed

optimal to pay the same wage in both states. Q.E.D.


   Now we can use the fact that the worker’s target utility for the second period of the
                                               f ∗ to characterize the equilibrium from that
relationship (denoted as W in (2)) is equal to W

point forward.


Proposition 2. Under the conditions stated for Proposition 1, there is a pair of values

ω∗ for  = G, B such that in the second period and all subsequent periods of an X-sector

employment relationship regardless of history (provided neither partner has shirked), the

   (iii) The employer’s incentive compatibility constraint (3) always binds, and xG − ωG =

Proof. See appendix.

   As a result, we need concern ourselves with only two types of possible equilibrium wage
                                   ∗
contracts: The type that features ωG = ωB∗ after the first period, which we will call wage-
                                         ∗
smoothing agreements; and the type with ωG > ωB∗ after the first period, which we will call

fluctuating-wage agreements.

   To sum up, if the employer’s incentive constraint does not bind, the worker goes through

an ‘apprenticeship period’ at the beginning of the relationship, followed by a constant wage.

If the employer’s constraint ever binds, then it binds only (and always) in the bad state,

resulting in a fluctuating-wage equilibrium. Otherwise, the wage is constant after the ap-

prenticeship. Now, the natural question is under which conditions the employer’s bad-state

incentive constraint will bind. We address this next.



4. Conditions for wage-smoothing equilibria

   In the case of a wage-smoothing agreement, the wage paid can be computed by substi-

tuting (4)00 and (10) into (5) with equality (setting the target utility W equal to W
                                                                                    f ∗ ). This

determines the equilibrium wage as the unique solution to:
           ω∗       ωy    k
      µ(      ) = µ( ) +    .                                                              (11)
           P        P    ρβ

                                              20
We will henceforth call this the ‘efficiency wage,’ and denote it by ω ∗ . This is clearly the

lowest wage that, if credibly promised to be paid at all dates in the future conditional on no

shirking, will induce the worker to apply effort.

   Here, we show that for given parameters if it is sufficiently difficult for an employer to

find a new worker or if Y -sector output is sufficiently cheap, the equilibrium involves wage

smoothing. Otherwise, it involves a fluctuating wage.

   First, note that the wage-smoothing agreement is preferred by the employer whenever it is

feasible (because with risk-averse workers, wage smoothing delivers the required incentives to

workers with a lower expected wage). Therefore, if we assume a wage-smoothing equilibrium
                                       f ∗ ) that it implies, we can check if in the bad
and then compute the values V ES and Ω(W

state employer’s incentive constraint (3) is satisfied. If it is, wage-smoothing will occur, and

otherwise, it will not.

   We can now find V ES as follows:
                                     
                     f ∗ ) + ω ∗ − ω y + QE (1 − ρ)βV ES + (1 − QE )βV ES .
      V ES = QE ρβ Ω(W                                                                     (12)

Note in addition that:

        f∗ ) =   x − ω ∗ + (1 − ρ)βV ES
      Ω(W                               .                                                  (13)
                         1 − ρβ

If we substitute (13) into (12) and rearrange, we get:

               QE ρβ [x − ρβω ∗ − (1 − ρβ)ω y ]
      V ES =                                    .                                          (14)
                 (1 − β) [1 − (1 − QE ) ρβ]

It is easy to verify that this is increasing in QE and decreasing in ω y = py .

   Now, the employer’s incentive constraint in the bad state is:

      xB − ω ∗ + ρβΩ(W
                     f ∗ ) + (1 − ρ)βV ES > V ES .


Using (13), this becomes:

      xB − ω ∗ + ρβ(x − xB ) > (1 − β)V ES , or

                                                21
      xB − ω ∗ + ρβπG (xG − xB ) > (1 − β)V ES .                                          (15)

This condition allows us to identify the conditions under which wage smoothing will occur:

Proposition 3. For given py , there is a value QE     y                          E   E     y
                                                V V (p ) ∈ [0, 1], such that if Q < QV V (p )

a wage-smoothing equilibrium can be sustained, while if QE > QE     y
                                                              V V (p ) it cannot. Further,

QE     y                    y
 V V (p ) is decreasing in p .


Proof. The value QE     y                          y                     E
                  V V (p ) can be defined for any p as the solution for Q to:


      xB − ω ∗ + ρβπG (xG − xB ) = (1 − β)V ES .

Taking total derivatives with respect to QE     y       y                  y   y
                                          V V (p ) and p , using (11) and ω = p to obtain

the derivative of ω ∗ with respect to py , gives the result. Q.E.D.

   The function QE     y                                                   E     y
                 V V (p ) is shown by the VV curve in Figure 1. Values of Q and p above

and to the right of this curve are points imply that equilibrium X-sector wages must be

volatile.

   At this point it may be useful to review how the pieces fit together. Workers in the X

sector are promised higher future wages in order to motivate current effort. Thus, in a wage-

smoothing equilibrium, the worker is paid the opportunity wage ω y during the ‘apprenticeship’

of the first period, and then the higher efficiency wage ω ∗ thereafter. For this reason, an

incumbent worker is always more expensive than a new one, although they have the same

productivity. Employers in the X sector thus are always to some degree tempted to shirk

on their commitment to their incumbent workers and search instead for a new one; this

temptation is strongest in bad states when the worker’s productivity is low. If this temptation

is strong enough, the wage-smoothing equilibrium is untenable, because workers will know that

X-sector employers will not honor their promises. This happens when it is easy to find a

new worker, or when QE is high. That is why points to the right of the VV curve imply

equilibrium with wage volatility.

                                              22
   We turn to those fluctuating-wage equilibria next.



5. Fluctuating wage equilibria

   In a fluctuating-wage equilibrium, the two state-dependant wages are determined by the

worker’s binding incentive-compatibility constraint and the employer’s binding bad-state

incentive constraint. This first of these conditions can be simplified by substituting (4)00 and
                                                                   f ∗ ) to obtain:
(10) into (5) with equality (setting the target utility W equal to W

              ω∗       ωy    k
      E µ(       ) = µ( ) +    .                                                          (16)
              P         P    ρβ

In other words, (16) states that the expected utility promised to an X-sector worker in any

period after the first must be enough to compensate that worker next period, in expected

value, for the current disutility of effort. Equation (16) is represented in Figure 2 by the

downward-sloping curve WW. The figure measures the bad-state wage ωB on the vertical

axis and the good-state wage ωG on the horizontal axis. This curve is strictly convex due to

the worker’s risk aversion.

   The second of these conditions can be derived from the employer’s binding bad-state

incentive constraint:

      xB − ωB∗ + ρβΩ(W
                     f ∗ ) + (1 − ρ)βV ES = V ES .                                         (17)

                                      f ∗ ) analogous to (14) and (13) and substituting
Developing expressions for V ES and Ω(W

them into (17) yields the equation:

               −ρβπG ωG + QE ρβω y + xB + (1 − QE )ρβπG (xG − xB )
      ωB =                                                         ,                       (18)
                               1 − ρβ(πG − QE )

which is depicted in Figure 2 as the straight downward-sloping line EE.

   The intersection of WW with the 45◦ -line is the efficiency wage, ω ∗ , and any movement

along the WW curve toward that point represents an increase in the employer’s profits,

                                              23
because it implies a lower expected wage. The downward-sloping line EE is the employer’s

incentive-compatibility constraint in the bad state. Any equilibrium pair of wages must lie

on or above WW and on or below EE. The employer will choose the wage combination that

minimizes expected wages, subject to the two constraints, and this amounts to choosing ω ∗

if it is on or below EE, and choosing the intersection of EE and WW closest to the 45◦ -line

otherwise.

       We are focusing here on the fluctuating-wage case, so by assumption, the constant-wage

outcome is not sustainable. Therefore, we know that the intersection of EE with the 45◦ -line

occurs below the intersection of WW with the 45◦ -line. Further, since we have shown (in

Proposition 2) that in equilibrium the good-state wage is never below the bad-state wage, the

two curves must intersect below the 45◦ -line. Given the concavity of WW and the linearity

of EE, there will clearly be two such intersections,18 but the one that will be chosen by the

firm is the one closest to the 45◦ -line, as shown, because it will offer the lowest expected wage

consistent with the constraints. This means that at the point of intersection that determines

ωB and ωG , EE is flatter than WW. As a result, it is clear that anything that shifts the EE

line down without shifting WW will raise ωG and lower ωB . In addition, it is useful to note

that, since the WW curve is a worker indifference curve, holding k constant, anything that

shifts down the WW line (whether or not it shifts the EE line) lowers worker welfare.

       It can easily be verified by differentiating (18) that a rise in QE will shift the EE down.

Clearly, it has no effect on WW. Therefore, we have the following:


Proposition 4. If the equilibrium has fluctuating wages, an increase in QE holding ω y = py
  18
       Of course, if the two curves do not intersect at all, no cooperation is possible. It will be shown that

this occurs in a portion of the parameter space to the right of curve BB in Figure 1. It is also possible that

the two curves are tangent, which occurs only on the curve BB, and thus in a zero-measure portion of the

parameter space. We focus our attention on the portions of the parameter space where EE and WW have

a non-vanishing region of intersection, as shown.



                                                       24
constant will raise ωG and lower ωB , in the process raising average X-sector wages, but

having no effect on worker welfare.


   A rise in QE increases the volatility of X-sector wages, by making it easier to find

a replacement worker and thus sharpening the temptation to renege on promises to an

incumbent worker in a bad profitability state. Thus, an improvement in the ease with which

an employer can find a new worker has a negative indirect effect on profits in the form of

higher expected wages, in addition to the positive direct effect.

   At the same time, a rise in py will shift both curves upward. The WW curve shifts up

because the worker’s opportunity cost has risen. The EE curve shifts up because, for given

ωG and ωB , the rise in the workers’ opportunity cost lowers the degree to which new workers

are cheaper than incumbents (recall that a new worker is paid her opportunity wage ω y in

the first period of employment). The net effect on wages can be signed as follows.


Proposition 5. If the equilibrium has fluctuating wages, an increase in py will raise ωG and

lower ωB , in the process raising average X-sector wages and X-sector worker utility.


Proof. See appendix.


   A rise in py increases the volatility of X-sector wages, by increasing the opportunity cost

of X-sector workers, which lowers the joint surplus available to a worker and employer in

the X sector and also lowers the share of the surplus that can be captured by the employer.

This sharpens the employer’s incentive-compatibility constraints. Note the striking force of

the sharpened incentive constraint: Even though the worker’s opportunity wage increases,

the wage paid by an X employer in the bad state falls. This is because the employer’s

temptation to cheat is strongest in the bad state, and that temptation is increased by the

rise in the worker’s opportunity cost.

   These results can be summarized in Figure 1 by observing that any movement up and

                                              25
to the right from a point above the locus VV must result in an increase in wage volatility.

Further, any movement upward will raise the welfare of workers in both sectors, while any

horizontal movement will leave worker welfare unchanged.
                                                                  ∗
   Note that if QE and py are close to the VV curve in Figure 1, ωG is close to ωB∗ , so
      ∗
xG − ωG > xB − ωB∗ . Further, from Proposition 4, as we increase QE holding py constant, ωG
                                                                                          ∗


rises and ωB∗ falls, so that either we reach the limit QE = 1 with the inequality xG − ωG
                                                                                        ∗
                                                                                          >

xB − ωB∗ still true, or there exists a value QE    y                  ∗         ∗
                                              BB (p ) such that xG − ωG = xB − ωB at that

                      ∗
value of QE and xG − ωG < xB − ωB∗ for higher values. The function QE    y
                                                                    BB (p ) is represented

in Figure 1 by the curve BB. Clearly, the employer’s incentive-compatibility constraint will

bind in both states if and only if the QE and py combination lies on the curve BB. Further,

by Propositions 4 and 5, BB must be downward-sloping.

   We can now use the process of elimination to characterize equilibrium at each point

in Figure 1. By Proposition 3, any point below VV implies wage smoothing. Any point

between VV and BB implies wage volatility, with the employer’s constraint binding in the

bad state but not in the good state. Any point on BB implies wage volatility with the

employer’s constraint binding in both states. Any point to the right of BB implies that

equilibrium with X-sector production requires the employer’s constraint to bind in the good

state but not in the bad state, which by Proposition 2 is impossible. Therefore, under our

assumptions it is not possible to have an equilibrium with X production under all states for

points to the right of BB.

   Of course, in general equilibrium QE and py are both endogenous. We turn to this in

the next section, which allows us to analyze the full equilibrium and how it changes with

globalization.




                                            26
6. General equilibrium, and the Effects of Globalization

   Suppose that we now have two countries. Call the first the ‘US’ and the second ‘India.’

The US has E employers and L workers, while India has E ∗ employers and L∗ workers.

Assume that

      E  E∗
        > ∗,
      L  L

so that workers are relatively abundant in India.

   There are three possible states to concern us: Autarky, in which there is no integration

of goods or factor markets; free trade, in which goods markets but not factor markets are

integrated; and full integration, in which both goods and factor markets are integrated.

We will call the movement from the second to the third of these states ‘offshoring,’ since it

simply means that now employers in one country are free to hire workers from another. Thus,

globalization conceptually has two distinct components, and we will see that the effects of

trade per se on wage volatility are very different from the effects of offshoring.

   First, we will consider the steady state under autarky, which here means simply that

American employers can match only with American workers; Indian employers can match

only with Indian workers; and in each country, the quantities of each good produced must

be equal to the quantities consumed.

   We need to derive the equilibrium value of QE . Recall that the total number of employers

searching for a worker in any one period is denoted m, the total number of workers search-

ing for a new X-sector employer is denoted n, and in any period Φ(n, m) matches occur.
                                                                             Φ(n,m)        n
Therefore, the fraction of searching employers who find workers is QE =        m
                                                                                      = Φ( m , 1),
                                  n
hence an increasing function of   m
                                    .   The steady-state level of searching employers therefore

must satisfy the following equation:
              n                                  n
     m = 1 − Φ( , 1) m + (1 − ρ)(E − m) + (1 − ρ)Φ( , 1)m.
               m                                   m

                                                27
The first term on the right-hand side represents vacancies for which no worker was found; the

second represents firms currently with workers who are exogenously separated from them;

and the last term represents firms that find a worker to fill a vacancy but are immediately

exogenously separated from them.

   This can be simplified to:

                 ρ   n
      m=E−         Φ( , 1)m.                                                                     (19)
                1−ρ m

Similarly,

                ρ   n
      n=L−        Φ( , 1)m.                                                                      (20)
               1−ρ m

   This can be used to show the following.

                                     E                                 n
Proposition 6. For any value of      L
                                       ,   the steady-state value of   m
                                                                           and hence QE is uniquely

determined. We can thus write QE ( EL ). Further, QE ( EL ) is strictly decreasing.


Proof. See appendix.


   Thus, holding other parameters constant, when workers are more scarce, it is more diffi-

cult for an employer to find one to match with.

   Next, we need to determine py . For this, given the identical and homothetic demands

held by consumers in both countries, it will be sufficient to determine relative supplies of the

two goods:


Proposition 7. Under autarky, the steady-state supply of X output is an increasing and

linear homogeneous function of E and L, while the steady-state supply of Y output is

decreasing in E, increasing in L, and linear homogeneous in E and L. Therefore, the
                                                                       E
relative supply of Y -sector output, r, is a decreasing function of    L

       Propositions 6 and 7 can be illustrated with the help of Figure 3, which is the same as

Figure 1 except for the addition of the downward-sloping curve MM. This curve gives the
                                                                                          E
combinations of QE and py obtained in an autarkic economy by varying                      L
                                                                                              over the positive

real line.19 The MM curve is, then, the locus of market-clearing values that complete the
                                                                                                 E
general equilibrium in the autarkic case. The fact that QE is decreasing in                      L
                                                                                                     while py is

increasing guarantees that MM must indeed be downward-sloping. In other words, from the

top left-hand of the MM curve to the bottom right-hand end, we move from labor-scarce
                             E
economies (with high         L
                               ),   where the labor-intensive good is expensive and it is difficult to

find a worker, to labor-abundant ones.20

       Note that as goods X and Y become very close substitutes, MM becomes arbitrarily flat,
  19                                          E
       More precisely, for a given value of   L   for an autarkic economy, we can find the steady-state value of

QE (as in Proposition 6) and the steady-state value of the ratio of Y to X supplied, hence the equilibrium

relative price py (as in Proposition 7). Tracing out the QE and py values so generated produces the MM

curve as we vary E
                 L.
  20
     We can now also clarify the conditions under which (i) it is optimal to elicit effort in all states, and (ii)

Assumption 1 holds. (i) In the region of the parameter space where the firm’s incentive constraints do not

bind, the optimal contracts we analyze are the same as would be chosen under full commitment. Therefore,

for points on or to the left of the VV curve, if it is optimal to elicit production under all states with full

commitment, it is also optimal without commitment, as in our model. A sufficient condition for this is that

ρβω ∗ < xB . (ii) It is easy to verify that the wage-smoothing condition (15) is a strictly stronger condition

than Assumption 1, since the strictly higher worker target utility in the second and later periods of the

relationship, compared with the first period, make it more likely that the employer’s incentive constraints

will bind. Therefore, for the whole length of the MM curve to the left of VV and for at least a segment of

positive length to the right of VV, Assumption 1 will be satisfied. If it is also true that at the intersection

of MM and VV, ρβω ∗ < xB holds, then there is a segment of MM including its intersection with VV plus

some distance on both sides in which Assumption 1 and the assumption that it is always optimal to elicit

effort are both satisfied. We assume this condition, and focus our attention on that segment.



                                                          29
while as they approach the case of perfect complementarity it becomes arbitrarily steep.21

Therefore, the MM curve could be either flatter or steeper than the VV curve. It has been

drawn flatter in this case for concreteness.

       Now, we have all of the tools required to analyze the effects of globalization. First, we

consider the effects of free trade, and then the effects of offshoring.


6.A. Free Trade

    Free trade establishes a unified world market for goods X and Y , without allowing for

movements of labor across borders. Given Proposition 7, if autarkic supplies of the two goods

in the two countries are denoted X i and Y i respectively for country i, then the relative supply
                                      Y US                                        Y IN
of Y will be equal to rU S ≡          XUS
                                             for the US under autarky; rIN ≡      X IN
                                                                                          > rU S for India under
                             Y U S +Y IN
autarky; and rF T ≡          X U S +X IN
                                           > rU S under free trade (note that free trade does not change

the quantities produced in either country).22 As a result, the free-trade value of py will be
                                                                                 ωy             py
lower than the autarkic US value. This will lower the real wage                 P (py )
                                                                                          =   P (py )
                                                                                                        for US workers

in the Y sector, and since US workers are indifferent between working in the two sectors,

this also means that the steady-state welfare of US X-sector workers will fall. At the same

time, by Proposition 5, we know that the variance of wages will fall. To sum up, we have

the following:


Proposition 8. Free trade lowers the steady-state welfare of all US workers and raises the
  21
       If the elasticity of substitution implied by the utility function U between X and Y is high, then a given
          E
rise in   L   and consequent drop in r will require only a small change in the relative price py to restore market

clearing. Conversely, a low elasticity of substitution will require a large movement in relative price.
   22
      As a result, we have gains from trade only through exchange, and not through specialization. We could

allow for output effects by, for example allowing for workers to choose their search intensity. In this case, a

rise in the relative price of X-sector output would increase search intensity, raising the steady-state fraction

of workers with X-sector jobs and thereby the output of X. However, this is somewhat beside the point for

the issues we are dealing with.


                                                         30
welfare of all workers in India. It also (weakly) lowers the variance of US wages and raises

the variance of wages in India.23


       If the US economy is initially at point A in Figure 3, then from the point of view of

US workers this change is represented by the move from point A to point B. (Note that the

only reason for the qualifier ‘weakly’ in the proposition is the possibility that one or both

countries may be in the wage smoothing regime both with and without trade.)

       Note that this result is exactly in line with the empirical findings of Bertrand (2004).

Those results are not about the effects of trade on economy-wide average wage volatility, but

rather inter-industry comparisons of wage volatility across time. Bertrand finds a positive

cross-industry correlation between increases in an industry’s import penetration ratio and

weakening of its invisible handshake. In our model, the X industry’s import penetration

falls with the opening of trade (it goes from zero to a negative value, since the X industry

is a net exporter), and in that industry the invisible handshake is strengthened, in line with

the Bertrand finding. Obviously, we could extend the model to have several career sectors,

some of them import-competing, and similar logic would continue to hold.
  23
       We have assumed throughout that US and Indian workers have the same productivity for simplicity.

Therefore, as a referee has pointed out, given the risk premium, average wages are higher in India under

free trade than in the United States. More realistically, we could allow for US workers to be much more

productive than Indian ones, in which case the wage that each Indian worker receives will be lower than

its US counterpart even with the higher risk premium. Of course, this would complicate everything in the

model, without changing the results of interest such as this proposition. Since the effects of different labor

productivities on international income distribution are well understood, we have stayed away from this in

the actual modelling.




                                                     31
6.B. Offshoring

   Now, suppose that in addition to free trade we allow offshoring to occur. In that case we

have arrived at full integration; the two economies will combine to form one large one with

E + E ∗ employers and L + L∗ workers.

       Since full integration essentially creates an autarkic economy with E + E ∗ employers

and L + L∗ workers, comparing full integration with autarky is straightforward. The ratio
E+E ∗                                  E         E∗
L+L∗
          necessarily falls between    L
                                           and   L∗
                                                    ,   so, again by Proposition 7, the free-trade value

of py will be lower than the autarkic US value and above the autarkic Indian value. Thus,

it is immediate that full integration has qualitatively the same effect on worker welfare in

both countries, compared to autarky, as does free trade; US workers are worse-off under full

integration than under autarky, while Indian workers are better-off. However, what is not

straightforward is the marginal effect of offshoring on worker welfare, in other words, the

difference in worker welfare between free trade and full integration. It can be shown that

this effect is positive, for workers in both countries.24


Proposition 9. The world relative supply of good Y , r, is lower under full integration than

under free trade. Therefore, the relative price, py , is higher, and the welfare of workers in

both countries is higher, under full integration than under free trade.


Proof. See appendix.
  24
       To simplify the analysis, we have assigned all bargaining power to the employer. It is interesting to

speculate how this result would change if the workers also had some bargaining power, which would add

enormous complexity to the model. One point is clear, however: We have shown that the worker’s threat

point is improved by allowing offshoring, because by raising the relative price of good Y , it raises the value of

the worker’s outside option (producing Y ). Thus, the worker’s bargaining position relative to the employer

is strengthened by offshoring. This surprising result, running counter to the intuitive expectation of many

observers, is a reminder of the importance of working through the general equilibrium ramifications of the

change.


                                                         32
       This change is represented by the move from point B to point C in Figure 3. The

point (which is quite similar to a finding in Mitra and Ranjan (2007)) is that offshoring

allows for efficiencies in the matching of X-sector employers in the labor-scarce US market

with workers in the worker-rich Indian market, thus allowing for the world X industry to

increase its employment and output.25 More workers worldwide producing X also means

fewer workers worldwide producing Y , so the world relative supply of Y falls, making Y

relatively more expensive. This benefits workers producing Y , raising the opportunity cost

of X-sector workers, and raising workers’ equilibrium utility in both countries.

       Further, from Proposition 6 it is clear that QE rises in the US. From Propositions 4 and

5, the rise in py and in QE together imply an increase in the volatility of US X-sector wages.

Thus, offshoring does indeed increase the variance of US workers’ earnings, even though we

have just seen from the previous proposition that their welfare also rises. This implies that

in response to offshoring expected X-sector wages in the US go up by more than enough to

compensate for the additional risk.26

       Finally, a comment on the overall effects of globalization, the movement from point A

to C in Figure 3. Note that the effects of free trade and offshoring on wage volatility run

in opposite directions, and the net effect of globalization on wage volatility is therefore

not obvious. That it is truly ambiguous can be seen from the figure. If the elasticity of
  25
       To see this more clearly, consider the following two extreme cases. In the first one assume that employer-
                                                  E       E∗
labor ratio is the same in both countries, e.g.   L   =   L∗ .   Then, when we integrate the labor markets, the world

total production of X and Y does not change after integration since the integrated economy’s employer-labor

ratio does not change. In the second extreme case, assume that US economy consists of only employers and

Indian economy consists of only workers. Once we integrate the labor markets, world X production goes

from zero to some positive amount. The case we consider in this model is in between these two cases such

that X production increases unlike the first case but the amount of the increase in X is not as much as the

second case.
  26
     The effect of offshoring on the volatility of wages in India is ambiguous, as QE and py move in opposite

directions. However, it definitely raises Indian workers’ utility.


                                                            33
substitution between X and Y consumption is very high, the MM curve will be flatter

than the VV curve as shown, while if the elasticity is very low, it will be steeper. In the

former case, it is possible that globalization takes the US from a point on MM in the wage-

smoothing regime (in other words, to the left of VV ), to a point on MM in the fluctuating-

wage regime. In the latter case, the opposite is possible. More generally, the elasticity of

substitution between X and Y in consumption will govern whether price effects or QE effects

will dominate. This provides our final result.

Proposition 10. If the elasticity of substitution between X and Y consumption is suffi-

ciently small, globalization on balance lowers the volatility of US wages. If it is sufficiently

large, it raises the volatility of US wages.



7. Conclusion

   In this paper, we have joined some insights from labor economics with tools from contract

theory and international trade theory to examine the impact of globalization on implicit

contracts. We have shown that globalization can indeed affect the nature of long-term

employment relationships, and in particular the volatility of workers’ incomes within those

relationships. By extension, these effects can influence the degree of income inequality among

workers with identical characteristics, an important matter empirically that conventional

trade models cannot address.

   However, it is important to note that different types of globalization have quite different

effects. We have focused on two kinds of globalization: Free trade (or integration of goods

markets) and international offshoring (or integration of labor markets). In our model, we find

that free trade strengthens implicit contracts for rich-country workers, lowering the volatility

of workers’ incomes, but lowering their welfare due to relative-price effects. On the other

hand, international offshoring weakens implicit contracts for rich-country workers, raising

                                               34
the volatility of workers’ incomes, but raising their welfare due to relative-price effects, as

the improved productivity of the offshoring sector leads to a lower price for its output.

   More generally, globalization affects implicit contracts through two channels. Relative-

price changes will tend to strengthen implicit contracts and lower wage volatility in sectors

whose relative price rises, and have the opposite effect in sectors whose relative price falls.

Thus, trade liberalization will tend to raise wage volatility in import-competing sectors and

lower it in export sectors. At the same time, in any industry if it becomes easier for an

employer to find a new worker (because the employer can now hire foreign workers as well

as local ones), implicit contracts will be weakened, and if it becomes harder (because the

employer must now compete with foreign employers), implicit contracts will be strengthened.

Thus, holding relative prices fixed, offshoring will tend to raise wage volatility in the sectors

that exhibit positive net offshoring and lower it in sectors that exhibit negative net offshoring

(with foreign employers on balance hiring more domestic workers than vice versa, a case often

called ‘insourcing’). Further, offshoring itself can give rise to relative-price effects due to

improved productivity in the offshoring sector, and to the extent that this raises the relative

price for labor-intensive industries, it can in general equilibrium provide an indirect welfare

benefit to workers in all countries.

   Thus, we simultaneously formalize and sharply limit one argument on the dangers of

globalization.


                                          Appendix

Proof of Lemma 1. First, observe that since a worker will never accept employment with

payoff below V W S , we must have Wmin ≥ V W S . We will show that Wmin = V W S by showing

through contradiction that it is not possible to have Wmin > V W S . First, however, it will
                                     f ∗ , which will allow us to ignore the constraint
be useful to demonstrate that Wmin ≤ W

Wmin ≤ W
       f and treat (9) as an equality.

                                               35
                                 f ∗ . In this case, the worker’s incentive constraint (4)0 can
      Suppose, then, that Wmin > W

never bind, and so υ = 0 for  = G, B. Consider the first-period decision. Then if the

lower-bound constraint in (6) does not bind for state , then the first-order condition (9)

holds with equality, so from (9), we have −λ = Ω0 (W0 ) ≤ Ω0 (W
                                                              f ) < 0, so W0 ≥ W
                                                                                f > Wmin .

But this would be a suboptimal choice by the employer, as the employer could choose a

first-period wage and future worker payoffs to give the worker a current payoff W0 equal to

Wmin ; this would realize a higher profit, and would also satisfy the first-period target utility

constraint (5) since Wmin ≥ V W S . Therefore, we conclude that the lower-bound constraint

in (6) must bind in the first-period decision for both states, and so W
                                                                      f = Wmin for  = G, B.

Now, suppose that the target utility constraint (5) binds in the first period, recalling that the

first-period target utility level W is equal to V W S . This immediately yields a contradiction,

as it implies that a worker payoff of V W S can be realized in equilibrium, which contradicts
                                      f ∗ (since W
the maintained assumption that Wmin > W          f ∗ > V W S ). Therefore, the target utility

constraint does not bind in the first period, and so λ = 0. But then the first-order condition

(8) for the wage cannot be satisfied for any positive value of the wage, implying a wage of

zero in the first period in both states. This implies a first-period payoff for the worker equal

to:

         µ(0) − k + ρβWmin + (1 − ρ)βV W S

         ≤ µ(0) − k + βWmin

         < Wmin .

The first inequality follows since Wmin > V W S and the second inequality follows since Wmin
                        µ(0)
cannot be less than     1−β
                               (which is the utility from permanent zero consumption; in no case

could the worker receive lower utility than that).

      But this is a contradiction, since by definition it is not possible to give a worker a payoff
                                   f ∗ . As a result, the constraint Wmin ≤ W
less than Wmin . Therefore, Wmin ≤ W                                        f is redundant,

and can be removed without changing the solution. Consequently, we can treat (9) as an

                                                  36
equality.

   Now, suppose that Wmin > V W S . Then if the target utility constraint (5) binds in the

first period, recalling that the first-period target utility level W is equal to V W S , then we

have a contradiction as before, so suppose that the target utility constraint does not bind in

the first period. Then λ = 0, so the first-order condition (8) for the wage cannot be satisfied

for any positive value of the wage, implying a wage of zero in the first period in both states.

Note that with λ = 0, the first-order condition (9) cannot be satisfied with equality unless

υ > 0, so that the workers’ incentive constraint binds, and so W    f ∗ . (We already
                                                                f = W

know that the lower-bound constraint in (6) is redundant, because we have shown above
            f ∗ .) This implies a first-period payoff for the worker equal to:
that Wmin ≤ W
                     f ∗ + (1 − ρ)βV W S
       µ(0) − k + ρβ W
                                  y
       = µ(0) + V W S − µ( ωP )

       < Wmin .
Of course, again, this is a contradiction, by the definition of Wmin . We conclude that Wmin ≤
       f ∗ . Since we already know that Wmin ≥ V W S , we conclude that Wmin = V W S .
V WS < W

Q.E.D.

Proof of Proposition 2. Consider the second-period problem. Under conditions of Propo-
                                                                        f ∗ . We claim that
sition 1, we know that the target continuation payoff for the worker is W

the choice of next-period continuation payoff W                   f ∗ for  = G, B. If υ > 0,
                                              f will be equal to W

then complementary slackness implies that W    f ∗ . Therefore, suppose that υ = 0. This
                                          f = W

implies that (9) becomes:
                         π
      Ω0 (W
          f ) = −λ           .
                      π + ψ
Since, by the envelope theorem, −λ = Ω0 (W ), and as we recall for the second-period problem
                                f ∗ , this becomes:
the worker’s target utility W = W
                               π

On the other hand, if ψ > 0, (21) then implies that 0 > Ω0 (W

W    f ∗ . However, this violates (4)00 . Therefore, all possibilities either imply that W
f < W                                                                                        f∗

or lead to a contradiction, and the claim is proven.

   Since W    f ∗ , the optimization problem in the third period of the relationship is
         f = W

identical to that of the second period. By induction, the target utility for the worker in
                                                                 f ∗ , and so the wage chosen for
every period after the first, regardless of history, is equal to W

each state in every period after the first, regardless of history, is the same.

   Now, to establish the three possible outcomes, we consider each possible case in turn.

Consider the optimization problem (2) at any date after the first period of relationship.

First, suppose that the employer’s constraint does not bind in either state. In this case,

ψ = 0 for  = G, B. Condition (8) now becomes:

                  µ0 ( ωP )
      −π + λπ              ≤ 0.                                                                             (22)
                     P

If this holds with strict inequality for some , then ω = 0. This clearly cannot be true for

both values of , because that would imply a permanent zero wage, and it would not be
                                                                f ∗ , the expression for V W S ,
possible to satisfy (5). (To see this, formally, substitute W = W

and ωG = ωB = 0 into (5), and note that the constraint is violated.) Therefore, for at most

one state, say 0 , can the inequality in (22) be strict. Denote by 00 the state with equality
                                            ω00
                µ0 (0)       1       µ0 (          )
in (22). Then    P
                         <   λ
                                 =          P
                                             P
                                                       . However, given that ω00 is non-negative and µ is strictly

concave, this is impossible. We conclude that (22) must hold with equality in both states,

and therefore ωG = ωB .

   Next, suppose that we have ψG > 0 and ψB = 0, so that the employer’s constraint binds

only in the good state. We will show that this leads to a contradiction. Recall from the

previous proposition that W    f ∗ for both states, and note that, by assumption, (3) is
                          f = W

satisfied by equality for  = G. Since xB < xG , we now see that (3) must be violated for

                                                                  38
 = B if ωG ≤ ωB . Therefore, ωG > ωB ≥ 0. This implies that (8) holds with equality in the

good state. Applying (8), then, we have:

       µ0 ( ωPG )                           µ0 ( ωPB )
                                   
                    1          ψG        1
                  =         1+          > >            ,
          P         λ          πG        λ     P

which contradicts the requirement that ωG > ωB . This shows that it is not possible for the

employer’s constraint to bind in the good state.

   Now suppose that we have ψG = 0 and ψB > 0, so that the employer’s constraint binds

only in the bad state. We now wish to prove that in this case ωG > ωB . Suppose to the

contrary that ωG ≤ ωB . Since we already know that we cannot have a zero wage in both

states, this implies that ωB > 0, so that (8) holds with equality in the bad state. Then, from

(8):

       µ0 ( ωPB )                           µ0 ( ωPG )
                                   
                    1          ψG        1
                  =         1+          > >            ,
          P         λ          πG        λ     P

which implies that ωG > ωB . Therefore, we have a contradiction, and we conclude that

ωG > ωB .

   Finally, suppose that the employer’s constraint binds in both states. Given that W    f∗
                                                                                    f = W

in both states, equality in both states for (3) requires that short-term profits x − ω∗ are

equal in the two states.

   We have thus eliminated all possibilities aside from those listed in the statement of the

proposition. Q.E.D.


Proof of Proposition 5. Recall that the WW curve is given by:

Recalling that P (py ) is the minimum expenditure required to obtain one unit of utility, given
                                                                            py P 0

of good Y in consumer expenditure. This allows us to rewrite the total derivative as:

Proof of Proposition 6. The number of employers paired with a worker is equal to E − m,

and the number of workers paired with an employer is equal to L − n. These must always

be equal, so:

        E − L = m − n.

      Suppose that E > L. Dividing both sides by L and using (20), we find:

        E                 m−n
          =        ρ     n               + 1, or
        L         1−ρ

          =        ρ     n          n   + 1.                                                                  (25)
        L         1−ρ

                                                            n
The right-hand side of (25) exceeds unity iff               m
                                                                 < 1. Since we are assuming that E > L, the
                                                                                   n
right-hand side of (25) clearly needs to be greater than unity, so                 m
                                                                                         must be less than unity.

Therefore, at an equilibrium, the right-hand side of (25) is strictly decreasing in                    m
                                                                                                         ,   so the
                              n                                                      E                           n
equilibrium level of          m
                                  is uniquely determined for a given value of        L
                                                                                           and ρ. Furthermore,   m
                                               E
is a locally decreasing function of            L
                                                   for given values of the other parameters.

      Now, if E < L, a parallel argument can be developed by dividing through by n instead

of m and later by E instead of L. Q.E.D.

        E − mt = ρ[E − mt−1 + Φ(nt−1 , mt−1 )].                                                               (26)

                                                            41
   The number of employers producing output is equal to E −mt = L−nt . Denote aggregate

X-sector output in period t by xt . Since the average output of a functioning firm is equal to
                                                                      xt
x, the number of employers producing output must also equal           x
                                                                         .   Therefore, we can rewrite

(26) as follows:

      xt    hx
               t−1
                                    i
         =ρ        + Φ(nt−1 , mt−1 ) .                                                            (27)
      x        x

In steady state, (27) becomes:

      xss   Φ(n, m)   Φ(L − xxss , E −               xss
                                                      x
                                                         )
          =         =                                        .
       x     1−ρ            1−ρ

Then, we have:

            x          x
      Φ(       L − 1,     E − 1) = 1 − ρ.                                                         (28)
           xss        xss

Thus, xss (E, L) is increasing in E and L and linear homogenous in E, L. Now note that

Y -sector output can be written as:

                   xt
      yt = L −        ,                                                                           (29)
                   x

where yt is the output in the Y sector in period t. In steady state, this can be rewritten as

follows:

                    xss
      yss = L −         .
                     x

Thus, from the properties just derived for xss , we see that yss (E, L) is increasing in L and

decreasing in E and linear homogenous in E, L.
                            yss                      E
   As a result, r ≡         xss
                                  is decreasing in   L
                                                       .   Q.E.D.


Proof of Proposition 9. Recall from Proposition 7 that the steady-state values of X and

Y output within one country can be written as functions xss (E, L) and yss (E, L) of E and



                                                                 42
L. We can thus speak of the isoquants of these functions. For example, the slope of the xss
                              ∂xss
isoquant is given by − ∂x∂Ess . Taking derivatives of (28), we see that:
                               ∂L


        ∂xss
         ∂E
                   ΦE ( xxss L − 1, xxss E − 1)
               =                                  .
        ∂xss
         ∂L
                   ΦL ( xxss L − 1, xxss E − 1)

Notice that:

        xss (E, L)        E
                   = xss ( , 1).
             L            L
         x                          E
Thus,   xss
            L   decreasing in       L
                                      .   Similarly,

        xss (E, L)          L
                   = xss (1, ).
             E              E
          x                               E
Hence,   xss
             E     is increasing in       L
                                            .

   Therefore, the absolute value of the slope of the isoquant is smaller in a more labor-

scarce economy. This is illustrated in Figure 4, which depicts a box whose height is the

world supply of workers and whose length is the world supply of employers. In the figure,

the US endowment of workers and employers is measured upward and rightward respectively

from the lower left-hand origin, and India’s endowments are similarly measured down and

to the left from the upper right-hand origin. The allocation of the two factors between

the two countries is given by the point a; the xss isoquant for the US going through that

point is marked UU ; and the xss isoquant for India going through that point is marked

II. The finding that the absolute slope of the isoquant for a given country is decreasing in
                     E
that country’s       L
                         ratio implies that these isoquants are strictly convex, and in addition, at

every possible allocation point below the main diagonal OU S OIN , UU is flatter than the

corresponding Indian isoquant at that point.

   Now under free trade without integration of factor markets, consider the change in Y

output if we transfer workers from India to the US, at the same time reallocating employers

from the US to India so that steady-state X output in the US is unchanged. This can be

                                                       43
represented as a movement left along UU from point a. Suppose that we stop the process
           E                                                                              E
when the   L
               ratio in the two countries is the same (and therefore equal to the world   L
                                                                                              ratio).

In other words, we stop at point b. Since the US steady-state X isoquant is flatter than the

Indian one at every point along this process, the movement from a to b results in an increase

in X output in India, and therefore in the world. Given (29), this implies a reduction in

worldwide Y output, and hence a reduction in r. Finally note that, under free trade, a

reallocation of workers and employers across countries that results in the same factor ratio

in each country – as for example in point b or any other point on the main diagonal – will

replicate the outcome of integration of the labor markets. Q.E.D.
