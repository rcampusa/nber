     This paper investigates the long- and short-run neutrality of open-

market monetary policy in a world of fixed exchange rates and imperfect

substitutability between bonds denominated in different currencies.

Using an illustrative portfolio-balance model, it shows that when the

public discounts the future tax liabilities associated with the national

debt and the central bank   supports   the exchange rate by trading non-

interest—bearing foreign assets, open-market policy has a short-run effect,

but no long—run effect, on the domestic price level and interest rate.

When the foreign-exchange intervention assets earn interest that is

rebated to and capitalized by the public, open-market policy loses even its

short-run efficacy--the capital-account offset to monetary policy is

complete.

1.    Introduction

        This paper exauhines the efficacy of open—market monetary policy in

a world of fixed exchange rates and imperfect substitutability between

bonds denominated in different currencies. While portfolio balance

models postulating limited international asset substitutability have

received considerable attention in the literature,' it is not generally

recognized that their predictions about both the short- and long-run

effects of central—bank operations in domestic debt rest on a crucial

pair of assumptions. These concern the degree to which the public

capiLali   zes the   stream of tax liabilities associated   with the qoVernThntT
OebL,    and Lhe   degree to which it capitalizes the stream of interest eirn—

incJs associated     with   the central bank's foreign exchanqe reserves.

        To demonstrate the importance of these assumptions, we arque,

using a standard open—economy model, that the following two propositions

are valid even in a setting of imperfect asset substitutability:            (i) When

the   domestic public fully anticipates and discounts the future tax lia-

bilities connected with the government debt and the central bank supports

the exchange rate through operations in non—interest—bearing foreign assets,

open—market operations have a short—run effect on the domestic price level,

interest rate, and current account, but no long—run effect. The cumulative

current—account imbalance gives a long—run change in tangible or marketable

Girton and 1-lenderson (1976), and Kouri and Porter (1974) emphasize the
short-run efficacy of open-market policy when home and foreign bonds are
imperfect substitutes, while those of Henderson (1977) snci Obstfeld (1980)

wealth just equal to the change in the capitalized value of future tax lia-

bilities to the government, so that total wealth, inclusive of non-marketable

liabilities, returns asymptotically to its initial level.    (ii) When, in ad-

dition, the central bank's foreign—exchange intervention assets earn interest

that is distributed to and capitalized by the domestic public, open-market

policy has no effect even in the short run. An open-market purchase of dom-

estic bonds, say, is offset completely and instntaneously by a transfer of

foreign bonds from the central bank to the public, just as it would be

in the world of perfect capital mobility studied by Mundell (1963).

     The argument that government bonds need not represent net wealth

goes back, of course, to Ricardo, and has been formalized recently by

Earro (1974). Mundell (1960) has emphasized that the macroeconomic effects

of open-market operations depend on the public's ability to capitalize or

internalize the concomitant change in the government's future revenue

requirements. This paper extends these considerations to the open economy,

illustrating their relevance for the capital-account offset to monetary policy

ard stressing the important role of central-bank wealth.

     The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents a brief

description of the basic illustrative model. Section 3      discusses the

effects of an open—market purchase of domestic debt when government bonds

are not net wealth and the      central bank's medium of intervention

earns no interest. Section 4 shows how monetary policy can lose its

short-run potency when the central bank intervenes with interestearfling

foreign assets. Section 5 presents some concluding remarks.

2. An illustrative model

      We illustrate the importance of capitalization effects in the open

economy with an aggregative, dynamic, fixed—exchange—rate model.3 The

real output of the economy, y, is constant, and domestically-produced goods

are imperfect substitutes in consumption for goods produced abroad. The money

price of foreign output is a fixed parameter from the standpoint of the

home country, and is taken to equal 1. All goods are perishable, but

domestic residents may hold wealth in the form of three financial assets.

The first two are domestic— and foreign—currency bonds, which are imperfect

substitutes in portfolios and need not offer the same rate of return in
                4
equilibrium.        The third is domestic money, consisting entirely of central-

bank liabilities backed by domestic government bonds and foreign assets.

To simplify our discussion of the consolidated budget constraint of the

government and monetary authority, we assume that the government does not

pay interest on domestic securities in the central-bank portfolio. The

central bank's foreign assets may earn interest, however.

      The model is described by the following equations:



      L(r,r*,Py/W)W = M,                         L1,L2 <   0, L > 0,             (1)

      B(r,r*,Py/W)W     =   B*,                  B1,B3 < 0, B2 > 0,              (2)

      H(r,r*,Py/W)W     +   F(r) =   D,          H11F' > 0,   H,H3 < 0,          (3)

      c(P)E( d, r —         i) + X(P) = y,       c',X',E2 < 0,   1>       > 0,   (5)

     Both types of bond carry a fixed nominal face value.

        Equations (1) and (2) stipulate that the domestic public willingly

holds the stocks of money and domestically-owned foreign assets, while

equation (3) is the equilibrium condition for the home bond market. 5Equation

(4) asserts that central-bank liabilities equal central-bank assets, and

describes the division of the asset side of the bank's balance sheet between

domestic credit and foreign reserves. Equation (5) ensures that the domestic

goods market clears; we assume that demand for domestic output is positively

related to home disposable income and negatively related to the home real

interest rate and price level. 6The service account, decribed by (7), en-

compasses both private and official interest earnings, and equation (8) links

the rate of increase of domestic marketable wealth to the current-account

surplus, on the assumption that there is no government borrowing and rio

investment. Finally, (9) gives the consolidated public-sector budget constraint

when there is no government spending. Since the government does not borrow, taxes

must be levied to finance any interest payments on the public debt not covered

by interest earnings on foreign—exchange reserves. Using (3) and (9) ,       disposable

income yd may be written as the sum of output and the real service account,



        yd = y   +    a(r,P,W).



  It is worth noting that the functions B, H, and F are net demand functions,
and may assume negative values. Thus, B < 0 means domestic residents are net
borrowers in foreign currency.
 6The expenditure function could be made more general by allowing wealth to
influence spending, and by altering the definition of disposable income to include
expected realcapital losses on wealth due to price-level inflation. Neither
extension would affect the paper's conclusions.

 their descendants must pay to the government.

 until section 4 that y =     0,   so that the central bank must intervene in the

 foreign exchange market with reserves that bear no interest.

      When anticipated tax liabilities to the government are capitalized

 at market value, total nominal wealth, which inc1ues the value of non--

 marketable assets and liabilities, can be expressed as tangible wealth, W,

 minus the value of the stock of government debt in private portfolios; D.

 Residents flOW   allocate   their net wealth W-D among the three assets, taking
                                        8




  into consideration their domestic—currency indebtedness to the government.

 Equation (3) describing bond-market equilibrium becomes



       H(r,r*,Py/(W_D),D/(W_D))(W_D) + F(r) =                                    (12)



 which differs from (3) in that the share of total wealth allocated to

 holdings of marketable domestic bonds depends on the ratio of capitalized

 future tax liabilities to total wealth.

       When government bonds are not net wealth, the experiment of a

  "helicopter drop" of government bonds to the public can have no effect

on the price level or the domestic bond rate, r, for total wealth, W —

and the public's net position in domestic currency are unaffected.8 From

(12), this implies that H must have the form




         f(r,r*,Py/(W_D)) + D/(W-D).



  ui(r,r*,Py/(W_D)) (W-D) can be interpreted as the domestic public's desired

  net claims denominated in domestic currency vis—-vis both foreigners and

  the domestic government.

         Using the definition of f,    the   condition that the domestic bond

  and it is evident that the unique interest rate r satisfying (13) can be

  written in the form p(P,W-D) .   Noting    that domestic demand for foreig:

bonds (equation (2)) is now written as B(r,r*,Py/(W_D))(W_D),9 we may

proceed as before to derive differential equations in P and W, this

 time of the form



       P/P = rr(P,W-D),                                                  (14)

       W/P = w(P,W-D).                                                   (15)




 The dynamic system can again be portrayed by figure 1. The important dif-

 ference now is that the system's endogenous variables are r, P, and W-D

 rather than r, P, and W. This means that in the long run, any change in D

must be offset exactly by an equal change in W, with the nominal interest

rate and domestic price level returning to their original levels.

     The adjustment process following an open—market purchase of domestic

government debt is depicted in figure 2. The monetary expansion leaves

tangible wealth W intact, for the decline, D, in bonds held by the public

is financed by an equivalent issue of central—bank money. However, the

government's discounted future revenue requirements also decline by D,

and thus total wealth——tangible plus intangible--increases. Looking at

(14) and (15), we see that the change in D shifts both schedules horizontally

by the amount LD, as shown in figure 2. Thus, the open—market purchase

has no long—run effect on total domestic wealth (inclusive of capital-

ized future taxes), the price level, or the interest rate. A long-run

decline in tangible wealth just offsets the fall in the public's anticipated,

discounted tax liabilities.

     This eventual decline in tangible wealth is a consequence of the

current—account deficit oäcasioned by the open-market purchase. In fig. 2,

   This also follows from the "helicopter" experiment. When government bonds
are not net wealth, an increase in D has no effect on the public's demand
for foreign bonds, for it involves no change in total wealth or portfolio
composition.
                                   10




the economy, on impact1 jumps vertically to the stable arm of th system
associated with the lower level of D. The nominal and real interest rates

fall, inducing an increase in spending, a rise in the home price level, and

a current-account deficit. The fall in the bond rate and rise in the price

level are necessary because the increase in total wealth associated with

the cut in future taxes would otherwise result in excess demand for domestic

debt. An outflow of capital--and so, a fall in central-bank reserves-—

accompanies the monetary expansion, but does not offset it completely in the

short run. It is important to note that because reserves earn no interest,

the transfer of foreign assets from the central bank to the public entails

a net increase in the stream of foreign—currency interest earnings reach-

ing domestic residents.
       Over time, however, the initial capital outflow is reversed, and the

 domestic-goods price, the interest rate, and total wealth return to their

 original levels. Since the money stock must do the same, the long-run offset

 to monetary policy is complete, and provides the mechanism through which the

 required fall in tangible wealth is accommodated. The initial increase in

 the central bank's domestic assets is eventually matched by a decline in its

 foreign assets. Part of this decline occurs at the moment the central bank

 intervenes to support the currency when the interest rate first falls.    The

 balance of the reserve loss occurs during the adjustment to long—run equi-

 librium, for the capital inflow accompanying the current-account defict is

 not sufficient to finance it.

       To summarize, when government bonds are not net wealth and the central

 bank intervenes in the foreign exchange market with non-interest-bearing

 assets, expansionary monetary policy has a short-run effect on the economy.

 This short—run effect involves a current deficit that returns the economy to

 a stationary position characterized by an unaltered interest rate and price

 level but a lower level of tangible wealth. The decline in tangible wealth
                                      11




jus,t equals the decline in discounted future tax    liabilities.   Private holdings

of money and foreign assets are unchanged in the long run.

4. The role of interest—bearing reserve assets

       The previous section's finding that open-market policy can affect the

short—run equilibrium of the economy when government bonds are not net wealth

depends on the assumption that the monetary authority's intervention medium

earns no interest. We now argue that when the central bank intervenes with

foreign bonds earning interest at the market rate r*, this short-run effect

of monetary policy disappears if the public capitalizes the stream of central-

bank foreign—exchange earnings at market value.

       To show this, we write total wealth, inclusive of the discounted

 value of future tax payments to the government and payments in foreign

 currency from the central bank, as W - D + yR, where yR, again, is the

 stock of interest—bearing foreign exchange reserves. yR of course equals

 the present value of the stream of central-bank interest payments, dis-

 counted at rate r*. As before, we assume that residents allocate their

 total wealth W - D + yR among the three available assets, taking into account

 the capitalized value of anticipated central-bank foreign-exchange payments,

 which are regarded as perfectly substitutable for interest earnings on

 privately-held foreign bonds.
                                                         10
       With this modification, equation (2) takes the form



       B(r,r*,Py/(W_D+IR) ,yR/(W-D+yR)) (W—D+yR) =   B*.                       (16)




 A conceptual experiment similar to the one performed in the previous

 section allows us to derive the form of B(....). Suppose that the central



 13

                                       12




bank confiscates a portion of the stock of privately-owned foreign

bonds, adding these to its own interest-bearing reserves and continuing

to distribute all earnings to the public.          If the public capitalizes the

                                            disbursements, the confiscation
monetary authority's foreign exchange

leaves both total (capitalized) wealth and the net foreign asset position

of the public unchanged. Thus, B simply falls by (yR)/(W -
                                                           D +              yR),

implying that



      B(r,r*,Py/(W_D+YR),IR/(W+YR)) =        B(r,r*,PY/(W_DR))      -    R/(W-D+iR).



As a consequence, (16) assumes the form



                                                                                   (17)
       B(r,r*,Py/(W_D+'(R)) (W—D+R) = B* + yR,



                                               can be interpreted as the public's
showing that B(r,r*,PY/(W_DYR)) (W-D+yR)

total demand for claims on future payments denominated in foreign currency.

Under the present assumptionS, (13) becomes



       (r,r*,Py/(W_D+yR)) (W-D+yR) +    F(r)   =   0,                              (18)




 which yields the reduced-form interest rate r
                                                        = p(P,W-D+YR).    The conceptual

 experiment of a central bank confiscation of foreign assets again shows that

 no   term of form yR/(W -   D   + yR) can be an argument of H(...).

       We can now consider the effect of an open-market purchase of domestic

 debt when the central bank supports the exchange rate through operations
                                            discounted wealth rises momentarily thanks

to   the fall in future tax   liabilities   to the government. This leads to

an incipient excess demand for foreign exchange and domestic debt, and, by

(18), to downward pressure on the domestic bond rate. The excess demand

for foreign exchange can be accommodated with no change in the exchange

rate only through official intervention. As in section 3, the central

bank's interest—earning reserves decline and the money supply shrinks as

capital flows abroad.

       However, the reserve loss is now matched by an equal fall in interest

payments from the central bank to the public and a corresponding decline in

total capitalized wealth. Because the increase in the public's foreign

bond holdings can be no greater than the reserve loss of the central bank,

the aggregate stream of foreign currency payments to the public cannot in-

crease. This is the crucial point for our analysis, for it implies that

residents can never succeed in extending their net foreign—exchange position

by trading newly—created money for central-bank reserves.

       What happens? As (17) and (18) show, asset—market equilibrium will be

re—established only after the fall in interest-bearing reserves just equals

the fall in D, so that domestic wealth, inclusive of capitalized transfer

payments, is at its initial level. This leaves the domestic bond rate, and

so the national stock of foreign-currency bonds (B* + yR), unaltered. The

end result of the open-market purchase is a transfer of foreign bonds from

the monetary authority to the public that exactly offsets the initial in-

crease in the money supply. It must be emphasized that the central bank

is forced to buy back instantaneously all the money it has created in spite

of the fact that it has no formal obligation to peg the home interest rate.

        We see that when the central bank intervenes with interest-bearing

foreign securities and all income streams are capitalized by the public,

5. Conclusion

      This paper has studied the conduct of open-market policy in a world

in which individualsfullY capitalize or internalize all income streams.

We have found that even when assets denominated in different currencies

are imperfect substitutes in portfolios, open-market monetary policy

has no long—run effect and possibly no short—run effect when the central

bank holds the exchange rate fixed. Under these circumstances, the

neutrality propositions of the portfolio-balance model of international

asset markets are much stronger than those of the "capital-flow function"

model it has supplanted.

      The results have implications for a world of managed floating as

well as for a world of rigidly fixed rates. An extension of our arguments

shows how sterilized intervention in the foreign exchange market will be

a self—defeating policy when intervention assets bear interest. A steri-

lized purchase of foreign exchange, for example, entails a transfer of

interest—earning foreign assets from the public to the central bank, a

rise in domestic holdings of government debt, and an equal increase in the

present value of future taxes-—an operation that leaves the asset markets

unperturbed because all central—bank interest earnings are returned to,

and capitalized by, the public. Only when the public fails to capitalize

the relevant income streams, or when the government taxes its citizens by

holding the intervention medium in barren form, is it possible to attain

independent exchange—rate and money—stock targets in the short run through

domestic debt management.
