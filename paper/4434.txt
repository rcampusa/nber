       This paper develops an algorithm for analyzing discrete events, such as labor market

transitions, when some of these transitions are spurious because of measurement errors. Our

algorithm extends the standard multinomial logit model, although our basic approach couid be

used with other stochastic models as well. We apply this algorithm to study the effect of

unemployment insurance (UI) on transitions from unemployment to employment and out of the

labor force. Our results suggest that UI lengthens unemployment spells by reducing both

transition rates, and show that correcting for measurement error strengthens the apparent effect

of UI on spell durations.

        Many studies have focused on the determinants of an unemployed individual's

probability of finding a job, attempting to measure the effects of individual
characteristics, receipt of government transfers, unemployment benefits, job search

activity, and reservation wages on this transition probability. Others have sought to

determine the average duration of unemployment spells, relying upon estimated

probabilities of movement between the categories of unemployment, employment, and

not-in-the-labor force. Atkinson and Micklewright (1991) provide a recent survey of

this substantial literature. Very few of these studies, however, have allowed for the

possibility of response error in an individual's reported status.

      Response errors are a problem in all research utilizing sample surveys.

Significant rates of response error have substantial implications for research on labor

market dynamics, since they result in spurious transitions between labor market

states.1 Estimates of an individual's probability of leaving unemployment, computed

from survey data, will overstate the probability that the individual either finds a job or

leaves the labor force. Proper estimation of an individual's transition probability

requires explicit modelling of the response variation problem. In this paper, we

investigate the importance of reporting errors for studies of labor market transitions.

We develop a model of labor force transitions that allows for spurious transitions, and

apply this model to studying the effect of unemployment insurance on the duration

of unemployment.

      We begin by examining the problem of response variation. In the first section,



    1See Poterba and Summers (1984, 1986), Duncan and Hill (1985). and Sound
j (1990) for related discussions of measurement error in labor market data.
                                            2
we describe the incidence of errors in the "employment status" questions in the

Current Population Survey. Misclassification between the states "unemployed" and

"not in the labor force" (NILF} appears to be a particularly substantial problem. The

second section develops a probabilistic model for the labor market transitions of

unemployed individuals, generalizing the multinomial logit model to allow for the

possibility of misclassification. Our model assumes that the individual's true labor

market status is observed at some point. Response errors therefore occur in only one

of the two surveys that are used to compute transition probabilities. The probability

that an individual who is known to be unemployed in the first survey is observed to

move from unemployment to employment is the sum of the probability that he actually

hnds a job, and is correctly classified as unemployed, and the probability that he either

remains unemployed or leaves the labor force but is misclassified as unemployed.

      We estimate our model using data from matched CPS records for May and June

1976 along with information from the May 1976 Job Search Supplement to the

Current Population Survey. We present our empirical results in Section Three. We

focus on the effects of unemployment benefit receipt, and an individual's reservation

wage, on his probability of finding employment. Unemployment insurance is shown

to have a substantial effect in depressing re-employment probabilities and increasing

the duration of unemployment spells.       If UI replaces fifty percent of a worker's
previous after tax earnings, the expected duration of his unemployment spell increases

by one arid one-half months, from 11 weeks to 17 weeks. There is also a significant

reporting effect, Receipt of unemployment benefits requires that an individual remain
                                           3
in the labor force looking for work; this causes a substantial reduction in the labor

force exit rate amongst individuals receiving U.l. While finding substantive effects for

transfer programs, we find very small effects of reservation wages on re-employment

probabilities. This may cast some doubt on the relevance of search-theoretic

explanations of unemployment. There is a brief concluding section that interprets our

findings and suggests directions for future work.



1. Employment Status Misreoortjnp in the CPS

       Reporting errors are a substantial problem in the Current Population Survey.

The incidence of errors due to response and coding mistakes is well documented by

the Census Bureau's Reinterview Surveys.2 These surveys involve reinterviewing a

subsample of the households included in the CPS and conducting new interviews.

These secondary interviews typically occur about a week after the original survey.

Respondents are asked, however, to describe their activities in the preceding week.

In some cases, the "nonreconciled" component of the Reinterview Survey, there is no

attempt to determine which, if either, of the two responses is correct. 1-lowever, for

the "Reconciled" subgroup of the Reinterview Survey, typically about one third of the

reinterviewed households, the second interviewer compares the results on the first

survey with the reinterview answers. Then, before leaving the household, he




   2See Graham (1979), Woltman and Schreiner (1979), Census Bureau Technical
Report No. 19 (1969), Poterba and Summers (1984, 1986), and Biemer and
Forsman (1992).
                                          4
attempts to decide which, if either, of any conflicting responses is correct.3 The

Reinterview responses for those in the reconciled subsample, therefore, are the

"truth's as determined by the second interviewer.

       The reconciled Reinterview Surveys permit analysis of employment status

coding errors. Table 1, Error Matrix A shows the fraction of individuals in each

employment category on the Reconciliation subgroup by their category on the first

survey. While most of the employed CPS respondents are correctly classified, a

substantial fraction of the unemployed individuals are reported in other categories.

Ten percent of the truly unemployed were classified as not in the labor force (NILF)

on the first survey. A further 3.6 percent were recorded as employed. The accuracy

of responses by those truly out of the labor force was also quite high, with 99.2

percent correctly classified.

      The finding that many unemployed individuals are misclassified is important for

studies of unemployment dynamics,         If nearly fifteen percent of unemployed
individuals are incorrectly classified in a given month, then many of the transitions

between labor force states may be spurious. In the extreme case, if individuals were

never misclassified in two consecutive months and there were no true transitions, the

expected duration of measured unemployment spells would be 26.7 weeks.4 But in


   3This fails to detect those individuals who report consistent, but incorrect,
responses in both months. Bound and Krueger (19911 present evidence of positive
persistence of measurement errors in CPS earnings data.
    4The true mean spell duration for unemployed workers in this scenario is
infinite. The calculation of expected measured spell length proceeds by finding the
expected value of the geometric random variable X, the time at which the first
non-U response occurs. The probability of this event is .15 in each month, and the
                                           5
 fact, workers who were unemployed would never find jobs or 'eave the labor force.

 All labor market flows would be caused by classification errors.

       Error Matrix A describes the measurement error problem in the Current

Population Survey as a whole. It does not reflect the errors associated with

individuals who are unemployed in a particular month and then experience transitions.

A substantial body of evidence suggests that many individuals, when monitored for

three consecutive months in the CPS, report themselves as experiencing
unemployment-labor force withdrawal-unemployment.5 The U-N-U transitors also

tend to report long spell durations at their third interview, suggesting that they

perceive themselves as having experienced an ongoing spell of unemployment. While

the reinterview survey reveals that only one quarter of one percent of NILF-reported

individuals are actually unemployed, this is because many individuals are genuinely not

in the labor force and are rather unlikely to be experiencing an unemployment spell.6



expected number of months until one transition is observed is 1/.15 = 6.66, or
26.7 weeks.
    6See Clark and Summers (1979) and Poterba and Summers (1984) for
discussion of the U-N-U transitions.
     6Flinn and Heckman (1983) argue that the states of unemployment and NILF
 are well-defined and distinct. They draw evidence from the clear differences in the
 models explaining the probability of unemployed and NILF individuals becoming
 employed. However, this evidence is not relevant to understanding whether a
 large fraction of those who are unemployed drift in and out of the "NILF" category
 with little or no change in behavior. There are a large number of individuals,
 classified as NILF, who are not casual entrants to the labor force. Many persons
 are disabled, retired, or otherwise unfit or unable to work. They are conceptually
 distinct from the unemployed, who are searching for work. A small fraction of all
 NILF respondents, but a substantial fraction of NLF respondents who were
 unemployed in the preceding month, are searching for work and ready to accept a
job. These are the miscategorized workers on whom we focus.
                                             6
However, conditional upon having been unemployed the month before, the
measurement error rates for the NILF category may be large.

       Error Matrix B presents our conjecture of plausible measurement error rates

conditional upon unemployment in the previous quarter. We double the probabilities

of mis-response for individuals who are unemployed, and we introduce substantial

error probabilities for those reported as NILF. In our estimation of transition

probabilities, we tried both error matrices A and B to determine the effect of large

error rates on our estimated coefficients.

      Aggregate reinterview data provides very little information about whether

measurement error probabilities differ across individuals. One subdivision of the

reinterview survey that          available allowed us to calculate separate error

probabilities for men and women. These are shown in Table 2. There is some

evidence of differences in error rates. Women appear more likely to be categorized

as NILF when they are unemployed, and employed women are also more likely than

employed men to list themselves as out of the labor force. More men than women

who are out of the labor force report themselves as unemployed or employed. In our

empirical work, we use the aggregate error rate matrix of Table 1.

      Our discovery of substantial error rates in the CPS raises several important

issues for empirical investigations based on survey data. First, some allowance should

be made for the prospect of response errors. This is especially true in studies which

involve discrete choices, or which rely on survey questions which ask respondents to

describe their activities at some previous time. The problem of response error may
                                           7
become acute when studies are focused on the difference in discrete variables

reported in two surveys. Second, some allowance for spurious transitions must also

be made in applying duration models to panel data on unemployment, as for example

in Lancaster (1979), Flinn and Heckman (1982), and many subsequent studies. When

some of the hazarded events occur because of response errors, the resulting hazard

function parameter estimates will be inconsistent. In the next section we present a

stochastic model of labor market transitions that explicitly treats the problem of

response variation.



2. A Multinomial Lopit Model with Classification Errors

      The misclassification problem is difficult to treat in most panel data sources.

Observed transitions between consecutive interview dates may arise from four

sources. First, the individual may have reported correctly in both surveys and actually

experienced a transition. Second, there will be spurious transitions by individuals who

were misclassified on the first survey and correctly classified on the second.
Symmetrically, the third type of transition is by individuals who were correctly

classified on the first survey but misreported on the second. Finally, some observed

transitions may be due to individuals who were misclassified on Qth surveys, but

were misclassified in different ways on the two surveys. This myriad of possibilities

makes the likelihood function for the observed outcomes rather complicated.

      Estimation of a two-survey transition probability model is substantially easier

if an individual's true status is known with certainty for one of the two surveys. If
                                             8

 the respondent's first survey status is certain, then all of the observed transitions are

 either true transitions or the result of survey response error in the second period. We

 obtained a data set in which all of the individuals are known to have been unemployed

 in the first survey month, but whose subsequent labor market experience might have

 been recorded incorrectly.

       To construct the likelihood function for the observed labor market transitions

of a group of unemployed individuals, we make two assumptions. First, we assume

that the probability of actual land possibly unobserved) transitions to employment or

out of the labor force are described by a multinomial logit model. For each individual,

the probability of each type of transition depends upon a vector of individual
characteristics X.

                                                                     1+e        +e
and


(2) UN = Prob (Unemployed in May, NILF in June Ix)

                                                                         e1
         I
                                                                   1 + e'°' + e'

Second, the probability of reporting errors depends upon an individual's true labor

market state but is otherwise independent of his characteristics. These error
probabilities are denoted

13)                  q1 = Prob (Recorded State is    True State is i).

There are nine misclassification probabilities in the three state model. However, only

six are independent since the probabilities satisfy an adding up condition:
                                              9

(4)                               1—       q I = E, U, N.

The q terms are the probabilities of correct reporting when the individual is in state



      The likelihood function for observed outcomes involves combinations of the true

transition probabilities and measurement error rates. For example, the probability that

an individual with characteristics X, is observed transiting from unemployment to

employment is

                        UEIX, =           +          +


The notation 5 refers to the probability of observing a transition, while P is the

probability of an actual transition. The first term in (5) is the probability that the

individual actually becomes employed and is correctly classified in the second survey.

The next term measures the probability that the individual remained unemployed in the

second month but was misclassified as having become employed. The final term is

the probability that there was a transition out of the labor force which was actually

recorded as a transition to employment. Thus, it involves both a transition and a

reporting error. The relationship between actual and observed transition probabilities

can be written compactly in matrix form


                          Puu          quu q qNu         Puu

      Using the logit assumption, the probabilities of observed transitions may be

This expression, and its analogues for the other observed probabilities, forms the basis

of our likelihood function.

       The data sample is ordered so that individuals 1                       N1 are observed as

unemployed in the second month, N1 + 1                N2 are classified as employed, and N2

+1        N are out of the labor force. The likelihood function is therefore

By substituting the expressions corresponding to (7) for both                 and UN into (81, we

The log likelihood function is therefore

        A natural generalization of this model would allow for the response error rates

to depend upon individual characteristics. In this case,                 would be substituted for

   in the above expressions. In principle, parameters linking characteristics to error

rates could be estimated.

        In the constant error rate model, we consider the error rates [qJ as parameters.

We do not estimate them simultaneously with (p1, fl2). but rather use the estimates

of the error probabilities provided by the Reinterview Survey and proceed as though

these are the true values of (q]. Then, we maximize the conditional likelihood

function of (p,fl2}. This procedure enables us to sample the sensitivity of the

estimated (,p2 with respect to changes in the measurement error rates.1



3. Data and Estimation

       Our estimation of the transition probability model is based on a May 1976 study

of the job search methods used by unemployed workers. A total of 4,668 persons



   1The procedure ignores the sampling variability of the estimated error
probabilities in computing the standard errors of . This may affect inference
about the true transition model parameters.
                                          12
 in the May 1976 CPS were classified as unemployed and asked to fill out a special

supplementary questionnaire concerning previous work experience and earnings,

current jobseeking methods, and employment aspirations.9 In many households, the

form was left to be filled in later or was mailed to the unemployed person after a

telephone interview. The nonresponse rate was 31 percent and resulted in a total

sample of 3,238 completed questionnaires.9

      We assumed that all of the Job Search Questionnaire respondents were in fact

unemployed, so that there were no reporting errors in the May data. Two arguments

support this view.     First, the surveyed individuals had all been recorded as

unemployed in the May 1976 Current Population Survey. In addition, however, those

who felt the questionnaire did not apply to them because they had already found a job

or had stopped searching were allowed to return the survey unanswered. The

remaining individuals, who persevered and answered a six page survey about their job

seeking activities, seem very likely to be truly unemployed.

      To analyze labor market transitions we combined information from the Job

Search questionnaire with subsequent CPS interview data that documented labor

market experience. Of the 3,238 Job Search Questionnaire respondents, 1,304

appeared on the CPS match tape which contained the regular CPS questionnaire for

both May and June. This reduced our sample size considerably. In addition, some


   8See Rosenfeld (1977) for a description of the survey and a copy of the
questionnaire.
    9This data set was used by Feldstein and Poterba (1984) in their investigation
of reservation wages and unemployment insurance, and by Baron and Mellow
(1981) in their transitions study.
                                          13
individuals who answered the Job Search Survey did not provide information about

their reservation wage or their previous wage. After excluding all individuals with

missing data, our final sample contained 908 unemployed men and women.'°

      Two variables are particularly important in our modelling of the transition

probability out of unemployment. The first is the ratio of an individual's reservation

wage to his wage at last job.11 Our measure of the reservation wage was based on

the following pair of questions: (1) "What kind of work were you looking for (in the

period April 18 through May 15)?" and (2) "What is the lowest wage or salary you

would accept (before deductions) for this type of work?" Individuals who indicated

that they were looking for more than one kind of work were asked to specify their

reservation wage for the type of job that they preferred. We computed the ratio of

this reservation wage to the wage that the individual described as "the usual earnings

   before deductions" on the "last job at which you worked for two consecutive

weeks or more."12



     10Since one of our explanatory variables is the ratio of the individual's
reservation wage to his or her previous wage, we have eliminated from the sample
all those individuals who are classified as new entrants (who have no previous
wage) or reentrants (whose previous wage may refer to a much earlier period).
   "A comprehensive survey of the principles of search theory may be found in
Lippman and McCall (1976).
    12lndividuals may indicate their usual earnings as a rate per hour, per week, per
month or per year. As long as the unit is the same for the reservation wage and
the previous wage, the specific choice of unit is irrelevant. When the units are not
the same, we convert by assuming 40 hours per week and 4.3 weeks per month.
In addition, we define the after tax earnings of the individual as (1-r)Earnings,
where r = .25 for everyone in the sample. This has the effect of understating the
UI replacement ratio for high income individuals, and overstating it for low income
(and tax rate) individuals.
                                          14
       Our second major variable is the unemployment benefit replacement rate.

Respondents were asked whether they had received any unemployment insurance

benefits during their current spell of unemployment; if they had, they were asked

what their weekly benefit was. We use the ratio of this reported U.l. benefit to

previous earnings as our measure of the replacement rate.'3

       Since data are not available on the amount of supplementary unemployment

benefits, welfare, and other forms of nonwage income received by the unemployed,

it is not possible to measure their specific effects on transition probabilities.

Information is available, however, on whether or not the individual received welfare

payments. We included a binary variable, which takes the value of 1 if welfare is

received and zero otherwise, in the equations, and regard its coefficient as a weak

indication of whether welfare income affects the probability of leaving unemployment.

      Several other variables are also included in the logit specification. Indicator

variables for the cause of unemployment, whether the individual was a lob loser or a

job leaver, and for central city residence are also among the explanatory variables.

SMSACEN, the central city variable, is included to capture the lower search costs and

higher probability of finding re-employment attendant with city residence. We also

include demographic variables, such as race, marital status, and age-sex subcategory



    13Our unemployment insurance variable refers to the amount of U.I. benefits
actually received during the unemployment spell and not to the benefits to which
the individual was entitled under the law. An individual may not receive U.I.
benefits because (1) he is not eligible for benefits (having exhausted benefits or
had insufficient previous work experience) or because (2) he has not yet applied for
benefits or because (3) he has applied but has not yet received benefits because of
administrative delays in the payment of U.I.
                                          15

indicators, in all of our models.

      Table 3 shows estimates of the basic multinomial transition model for the full

sample. There are estimates of both unemployment transition and labor force

withdrawal probabilities. Corresponding to each transition, three equations are

reported. The first, or "No Error" model, assumes no measurement errors. This is the

standard multinomial logit model for our problem. The second model, with "Error

Probabilities A," uses reinterview survey error probability estimates from Table 1.

Finally, we estimated several models using error probabilities from panel B in Table 1.

      The results show both that the receipt of unemployment benefits has an

important effect on transition probabilities and that correction for measurement errors

can have substantial effects on the estimated coefficients. The U.I. variable has the

predicted negative sign in the employment transition model, and it has an even larger,

negative effect on the probability of leaving the labor force. This is presumably due

to the "reporting effect", the requirement of on-going search as a precondition for UI

receipt. The UI coefficient In the UE equation rises by twenty-five percent between

the no-error and the error rate B models. The coefficient in the P equation changes

from -1.44 to -2.08, a move of forty-five percent.

      The welfare variable takes its predicted sign in each equation, though it is

statistically significant in only about one-half of the estimated equations. The
coefficient also changes substantially when we estimate the model allowing for

measurement error.

      The demographic variables also have their predicted signs: married women are
                                           16

less likely to find jobs, and more likely to leave the labor force, than are married men.

Job losers and job leavers both have lower probabilities of becoming reemployed than

do other groups.

       Finally, the reservation wage variable is a disappointment. While we would

have predicted that a higher reservation wage-to-last-wage ratio would be linked to

fewer acceptable job offers and therefore to longer expected spell durations, this is

not supported by the data. The coefficients in the employment transition equation are

always positive, although they are statistically insignificant. One argument often

made in defense of search models is that they do not apply to individuals on

temporary layoff, and therefore may appear inconsistent with the data findings. To

test this view, we deleted the 76 temporary-layoff individuals in our sample and re-

estimated the model. The results, which are reported in an earlier draft of this paper,

are very similar to those for the full sample.

      A more significant change in the specification is reflected in the models of Table

4. We included both the number of weeks reported to have elapsed in the current

unemployment spell, and the number of hours per week which the individual reported

spending each week on job search, in the transition equations. Both variables have

substantial, and significant, effects in explaining the exit probabilities from
unemployment. The coefficient on the duration variable is negative, indicating that

the longer the spell of unemployment has lasted, the lower is the probability of re-
                                            17

employment.14 The search intensity variables also behave as predicted, and higher

search effort results in a higher job-finding probability.

       The foregoing results display the substantial importance of accounting for

classification errors in analyzing labor market transitions. Many of the estimated

coefficients change by more than thirty percent when the model is estimated using

the error probabilities estimated from the Reinterview Survey. When estimated with

higher error probabilities, the findings show even more substantial changes.15

      The inclusion of the duration and intensity variables reduces the U.I. coefficient

in the employment transition equation by about sixty percent. This may indicate that

one of the ways UI affects the probability of finding a job is by changing search

intensity. Alternatively, UI receipt might just be capturing the fact that most UI

recipients have relatively short spells, since eligibility usually expires at either 26 or

39 weeks. Inclusion of duration has almost no effect on the UI coefficient in the labor

force withdrawal equations.



4. Interoretation and Conclusions

      The estimated logit models may be used to determine the changes in



    14From this information it is not possible to distinguish the hypotheses of
heterogeneity (there are some workers who are very unlikely to become
reemployed in any period, and who therefore experience long spells of
unemployment) from that of state-dependence (being in the midst of a long
unemployment spell actually reduces the probability of becoming re-employed).
   151n some cases the coefficients seem to change by large, and implausible
amounts. However, these parameter estimates are usually accompanied by large
standard errors.

transition probabilities caused by unemployment insurance. In the usual case, say


(11)                                            e
                                    PUE       x   -x
                                           1+e1÷e

the    derivative of a probability with respect to one of the X is

                                       = —11p[ UEUN1.
In the more general case in which there are errors in classification, and we wish to

know how the probability of observinci a particular outcome will change, the
calculation proceeds as follows:


              UE       -(l-qu-qE1Je
                   =
                                1 +e      +0

                   +       _X1P1p8 ) (q(1 —qu—qE)e                       _X2)
                       (1+0 +e l2)                  (1 i-e _XII+e _X2)

                   =
                               [1
The derivatives of probabilities of observing given outcomes are important if we wish

to evaluate the change in the measured unemployment rate as a result of a policy

reform.

         The derivatives of probabilities with respect to changes in the level of U.l.
benefits are shown in Table 5. The calculation proceeds for a "typical" individual,

defined as someone with the sample average transition probabilities of UE = .233 and
                                             19

UN = ,048.° A change of .50 in the unemployment insurance replacement ratio,

from 0 to .50, results in a -.10 change in the unemployed worker's probability of

becoming employed in a given period and a -.054 change in NE•17 The expected

spell duration if there were no unemployment benefits, 1f(uE +           would be 2.78

months. The introduction of UI which provides benefits equal to fifty percent of the

worker's post tax wage increases the expected duration to 4.32 months. The

sensitivity of the duration results is substantially greater in the case of the "errors

adjusted" transition probabilities.

      Note the important differences between the expected spell durations computed

using the unadjusted transition probabilities and those adjusted for measurement error.

The expected duration is nearly a month longer when computed using transition

probabilities that are not contaminated by spurious transitions due to reporting error.



    16The true transition probabilities for the "sample average" individual are
calculated by solving the system of linear equations in (6).

                    UE =          = .257 =

                    -       561 = .619 =

for RUE. P. and RUN, using the Reinterview [q] and the knowledge that 234 of the
908 people in our sample became employed and 110 left the labor force. This
yields UE = .233,        = .719, and UN = .048.

"Error Specification B" in Table 3.

This finding sheds important light on the "dynamics of unemployment" controversy,

since it shows that using unadjusted transition probabilities leads to estimated spell

durations which are biased downward by a substantial amount.

       This paper has confronted the problem of response errors in the Current

Population Survey and developed a procedure for analyzing survey data under

particular circumstances: when one of the observations in a panel is measured

without error. A natural avenue for extension is to allow both (or all) observations in

a panel to be subject to measurement error. Fuller (1987) discusses a number of

models for analyzing data that is measured with error; some of these models could be

applied to labor market data. Krueger and Summers (1988) describe methods for

treating measurement error in indicator variable data. The current approach might also

be integrated with the various procedures that have recently been developed for

analyzing life and duration data. Our analysis also suggests ways to assess the

robustness of empirical findings to the possibility of measurement error in the labor

market data.
