                   RETROSPECTIVE CAPITAL GAINS TAXATION


                                 ABSTRACT



    This paper presents a new approach to the taxation of capital gains that

eliminates the deferral advantage present under current realization-based

systems, along with the lock-in effect and tax arbitrage possibilities

associated with thia deferral advantage.    The new approach also taxea capital

gains only upon realization but, by effectively charging interest on past

gains when realization finally occurs, eliminates the incentive to defer such

realization.   Unlike a similar scheme suggested previously by Vickrey, the

present one does not require knowledge of the potentially unobservable pattern

of gains over time.   It thus is applicable to a very broad range of capital

assets.

I.     Introduction

                                                                         tax
       Virtually every country that taxes income imposes a capital gains
                                               on accrual.               Though countries
only upon the realization of gains rather than

vary with respect to indexing for inflation and the relative tax rates on
                                                         tax system sets
capital gains and ordinary income, the realization-based
                                                          and is associated
capital gains taxation apart from other forms of taxation

with a variety of economic distortions.

        The moat frequently discussed problem arising from taxing capital gains

upon realization is the "lock-in" effect, the desire to hold appreciated
assets in order to defer taxes on gains already accrued.               This effect leads

investors to accept a lower rate of return before-tax than they would for new

investments without such accrued gains, resulting in a distorted allocation of

capital and inefficient portfolio selection.

        As an illustration of the lock-in        effect,   consider a simple two-period

                                                                     must
example in which an investor, having accrued a first-period gain, g,

decide whether to realize the gain and reinvest at the safe rate of return, i,

or hold the asset for an additional, safe rate of return r.               Assuming all

capital income is taxed at the same rate,            t, then the investor's terminal

wealth under the first strategy is




 (1)             —    (l+g(l-t))(l+i(l-t))   —   (l+g)(l+i)   -
                                                                  t[g(l+i(l-t))+(l+g)i)

 In second-period units, total taxes equal those paid in the first period,

 accumulated at the net-of-tax interest rate, plus those due in the second

 period.

         If the investor chooses to hold rather than sell, the terminal wealth

 is:
                                                2

(2)              —   (1+g)(l+r)-t[(l+g)(l-i-r)-1]   —   (l+g)(l-i-i)   -
                                                                           t[g+(1-t-g)r]
           WH


so that the tax on the first-period gain is deferred, without interest, to the

second period.       This makes the investor willing to hold even for a range of

returns r C i.       The larger is g, the larger the deferral advantage and hence

the lower r must be to induce the investor to sell.

      A convenient way to express this deferral advantage is in terms of the

effective tax rates on alternative investments.             Compared to the rate t

imposed if the investor realizes and reinvests, the additional taxes, per unit

of additional gain (l+g)r, are (comparing           (1) and (2))       t{l-            C t.

It is through this lower effective tax rate that an investor can achieve at

least his alternative after-tax return i(l-t) despite receiving a before-tax

return r C i.

      Closely related to the lock-in effect is the general problem of tax

avoidance facilitated by the voluntary nature of realization.                    Because losses

as well as gains have their tax burdens deferred until realization, investors

have the incentive to realize bases immediately, to maximize the associated

tax reductions.       Aggressive application of the simple rule of holding winners

and realizing losers potentially permits individuals to generate tax

reductions without incurring major transaction costs (Constantinidea 1983,

Stiglitz 1983).       This arbitrage possibility has led to a second major

distortion arising from the present system of capital gains taxation.                      To

prevent inveatora from generating capital losses to offset ordinary income,

tax systems typically limit the allowable annual deduction for auth losses.

In the U.S., thim limit is presently 3000 dollars. While perhaps representing

an effective response to the problem of tax arbitrage, this loss-offset

limitation also distorts the choice of investment away from the risky assets
                                           3

more likely to produce losses (e.g. Stiglitz 1969).

        Given such problems, there is grest appeal to the prospect of switching

to a tax on accrued capital gains.     Taxing gains on accrual would make the

actual realization of gains irrelevant to individual tax liabilities, thereby

eliminating both the lock-in effect and the ability to engage in tax arbitrage

through selective realizations.     It would also obviate the need for limiting

loss-offsets and the associated discouragement of risky investments.     Though

                                                                    attention
proposals to adopt accrual taxation have received serious scholarly

(e.g.    Shakow 1986), there seems little chance that such a system will be

adoptad on a broad scale.1     Beyond the criticism that accrual taxation would

increase annual taxpayer compliance costs, parhaps the most significant

                                          are hard to value except when they
arguments against it are that some assets

are sold and that liquidity constraints could force the premature sale of

indivisible assets simply to pay the accruing taxes.     These two problems would

often apply at the same time, as with the case of closely held family

businesses, for example.

        A potential solution to the problems of both realization and accrual

taxation is a realization-based tax that offsets the deferral advantage of

holding gains by imposing a higher tax rate on gains held for longer periods

of time. The effect is to simulate a system under which capital gains taxes

are computed on an accrual basis but collected, with interest, only upon

realization.     From a comparison of (1) and (2), it is clear that charging tax-

deductible interest on the taxes accruing on unrealized gains would eliminate

the deferral advantage.     Such an spproach was originally conceived of by

Vickrey (1939).      By construction, it would eliminate the lock-in effect and

the tax arbitrage possibilities generated by selective realization, because of

 its equivalence to an accrual tax.    At the same time, it would also remedy the
                                         4

liquidity problem of accrual taxation by collecting the tax only when sales

actually occurred.

    Unfortunately, this "cuisulative averaging" approach is plagued by the

second problem of accrual taxation mentioned above, that of valuation.      For

assets that are hard for the government to value except when sold, it will be

unclear upon sale what the time pattern of accrual of the realized gain was.

This will make it impossible to compute retrospectively the tax liability

equal in present value to an annual tax on the asset's accrued gains (Green

and Sheshinski 1978).    For example, if an asset has increased in value over a

ten year period, the tax rate on the realized gain needed to simulate accrual

taxation would by the ordinary tax rate if the gain occurred entirely in the

tenth year, but this tax rate compounded by one plus the relevant interest

rate to the ninth power if the entire gain occurred during the first year of

ownership.   Simply to assume, for tax purposes, that s realized gain accrued

smoothly at a constant annual rate would not solve the problem.   Assets

achieving above-noraal rates of return initially would still be subject to a

lock-in effect, because an investor anticipating only normal returns from the

asset in the future would be able to spread the accrual pattern

retrospectively imputed for this gain over several years by holding on to the

asset.   Likewise, an asset that had declined in value would offer its owner

the incentive to sell.   Thus, basic arbitrage transactions involving the

holding of winners and the sale of losers would still be attractive, though

perhaps less so than under a pure realization-based tax.

     Glesrly, many capital assets such as common shares of large companies

could be marked to market each year to avoid the valuation problem.   But so

effective method of dealing with hard-to-value assets would still be necessary

to make a switch to accrual taxation or accrual-equivalent realization
                                          S

taxation practical.    Thia paper preaents auch a method.   The new apptoach does

not require any information on the past pattern of accrued gains, and yet

eliminates the lock-in effect and the benefits of deferral-based tax

arbitrage.     In place of the private information on the accrued gains of

individual aasets, the scheme uses public information, the market interest

rate, combined with the assumption of optimal portfolio choice by investors.

It doea not impose the same effective tax rate on accrued gains,    g
                                                     the same tax rate,
regardless of their time pattern, but it does impose

       after   adjusting for risk.

       This new approach to capital gains taxation can accommodate any asset

                                              and its information requirements
currently subject to capital gains treatment,

are small.     Indeed, it does not require knowledge of the asset's purchase

price, only its year of purchase.

       In the next section, we formalize the criterion that a capital gains tax
must satisfy in order not to distort the holding period decision or allow

deferral-based arbitrage.     To provide the basic intuition about the new scheme

                                                                    in Section
developed here and how it works, we introduce and analyze it first,

III,   for a special class of assets (such as precious metals) that generate no

cash flows or tax liabilities until they are sold.     Section IV presents the

solution for the general class of assets, and Section V offers some concluding

remarks.



II.    Holding-Period Neutrality

       The present system of taxation upon realization distorts behavior because

the rate at which it taxes the income arising from an asset depends on the

size of the asset's previous unrealized gains.     This induces both the lock-in

effect and deferral-related tax arbitrage.
                                           6

     Suppose the risk-free interest rate is i,2 and the investor's tax rate on

all forms of income, including realized capital gains,      is   t.       Then, as shown

above, an investor holding an appreciated asset will require a before-tax

teturn (adjusted for risk) lass than   i       from that asset to achieve his

after-tax opportunity cost of   i(l-t), because the tax rate          t    applied to new

gains is offset by the continued deferral, without interest, of taxes payable

on the gains already generated but not yet realized.        This is the

lock-in-effect.   It encourages the holding of assets likely to generate a

significant portion of their returns in the form of capital gains, because

their income faces a tax rate below    t   if they are held for longer than one

year, but it also imposes a tax-induced transaction cost on selling assets

that increases over time and reflects no underlying social cost.

     The problem of tax arbitrage relates to the lower effective tax rate

generated by deferral rather than the distorted realization decision.             Since

assets turned over immediately face an effective tax rate t, investors can

acquire two aasats with offsetting risk characteristics and generate negative

tax payments in present value by realizing positions that have declined in

value aooner, and more frequently, than positions that have increased in

value.   To the extent that such offsetting positions can be maintained, the

investor bears no risk, but there is a social coat nonetheless because social

transaction coats are being incurred simply to transfer revenue from other

taxpayers to the investor in question.

     It is clear that neither of these distortions of the realization-based

capital gaina tax system would be present under an accrual tax.             The latter

would tax income at the same rate regardlesa of unrealized appreciation or

holding period.   The result would be a required rate of return independent of

these other characteristics.    It is this result that we refer to ss
                                                  7



"holding-period neutrality.'



      Definition: A realization-baaed tax ayatem ia holding-period
      neutral if it leads each inveator in an aaaet to require a
      before-tax return having a certainty-equivalent value that ia not &
      function of the length of holding period or the asaet'a past
      pettern of returns.



We will confirm later that a tax system satisfying this criterion does,

indeed, makes the realization decision irrelevant.



III. Retrospective Taxation


      Suppose an investor holds an ssset that generates no cash flows or tax

liabilities until it is sold and is taxed only upon sale.         We wish to design a

tax at realization that satisfies the criterion of holding-period neutrality,

as just defined.

      One formulation that would satisfy this objective is the Vickrey (1939,

1947) cumulative averaging approach.          With the problem formulated in

continuous time, if T5 is the total tax payment required of an asset held for

s years (with T0 —     0),   a Vickrey-type tax system would satisfy:




(3)                          5
                                 —   i(l-t)T5 +      A
                                                  tgSS



where g5 is the actual, ex jost, rate of return on the asset at time (after

purchase) s and    A   is the asset's value at date s.      It is clear from (3) that

such a tax system would be equivalent to actually taxing asset income on

accrual but letting the tax liability accumulate at the investor's opportunity

cost until the asset is sold.

      As already indicated, though, the tsx system described in         (3) cannot be
imposed retrospectively without knowledge of the time pattern of gains g5.

However, this expression is not a necessary condition for a

holding-period-neutral tax.      The fact that individual decisions are

influenced by ex   an distributions       of returns rather than cx        returns

allows us to pursue a weaker condition.

      Suppose that, at any date s, the investor knows the current value of his

asset but not its current rate of return.           Let V(') be the valuation operator

at each date that converts that date's distribution of uncertain returns into

their certainty equivalents, from the investor's perspective.          Then, intuition

suggests that a holding-period-neutral tax system must satisfy, at each

instant s, the following condition:



                                 —              +
(4)                      V(t5)       i(l-t)T5       tiA5

where, again, i is the risk-free interest rate (assumed to be constant only

for the sake of exposition).         Expression (4) says that the investor faces an

increase in the realization tax liability associated with the asset equal to

the interest on the unpaid liability plus the ordinary tax on the asset based

on a rate of return equal to the risk-free rate.

      The motivation for (4) is that, by definition, the certainty-equivalent

return on risky assets should equal the risk-free rate if investors'

                                                                     We can formalize
portfolios are balanced and taxes do not distort behavior.

the relstionship of expression (4) to the achievement of

holding-period-neutrality.



Prooosition 1:     Condition (4) is necessary and sufficient for the achievement

       of holding period neutrality for the class of assets considered in this

       section.
                                                        9

      :    At any date   s, the net-of-tax value             of an asset to the investor is the

          value of the asset A5 less the accumulated tax liability T5.                   To

          continue to hold the asset for another instant, the investor requires a

          certainty-equivalent rate of return equal to the after-tax interest

          rate i(l-t). Thus, in portfolio equilibrium:3


                         V(A5    -
                                     'is)   — (A5   -
                                                        T5)i(l-t)

Combined with equation (4), (5) implies that                   V(A5) —     iA5,   regardless of A5 or

s.   Hence, (4) implies holding-period neutrality.                     Combined with the requirement

fot holding-period neutrality that                          — iA5,   (5)   implies (4)QEo
                                                  V(A5)

      Since the certainty-equivalent value of the before-tax asset return g

will equal i when an accrual-equivalent tax is imposed, it is clear that the

Vickrey-type tax system described in (3) satisfies (4), and hence is

holding-period neutral.         However, the converse need not be true:                the class of

tax systems defined by (4) may be larger.                   The challenge is to find some other

tax scheme also satisfying (4) that has weaker informational requirements.

Fortunately, such a tax system exists.



Proposition 2:      Suppose the realization tax liability at date s is



                          T5 — (1           e_t5)A5
                                       -




Then the tax system satisfies (4) for all s and hence is holding-period

neutral.

(7)                             —   i(l -t)T5 + ciA5 +                    (1 -    et5)csAs


Since, by construction, V(c) — 0, application of V(')                                                to both sides of (7)


yields (4)•QED

       Clearly, the evolution of the tax liability I5 described by (7) differs

from that of the Vickrey-type system based on                                         g pg returns described         by

(3).     Since the gain g —                      i+     c, (7) differs from (3) in taxing the excess

return     c   at rate              (1   -
                                                 et5)          rather than t.               This is a tax rate that

starts at 0 and approaches 1 as a                                -'   .   But    the tax rate on the excess return

has no effect on the investor's welfare, because by construction the excess

return has zero value to him (e.g. Gordon 1985,                                            Sandmo l985).

       A simple example is useful in demonstrating how this tax system works to

eliminate the lock-in effect.                              Suppose an investor purchased an asset at some

past date      0.   At date l' he chooses between realizing at price p1 and

is just                          so the investor        is indifferent,                  The two
             p1eit(525].),
cases differ only in the                        treatment of the asset's risk premium.

       Proposition 2 offers a very simple system of capital gains taxation.

Computation of the tax burden when an asset is sold requires knowledge of the

risk-free interest rate, the investor's marginal tax rate, the holding period

of the asset and the final sales price.                      (Nothing in the proof depends on

either i or t being constant, so variations over time in rates of interest and

marginal taxation present no difficulty.)                     The initial purchase price, the

pattern of accrued gains and the asset's stochastic properties are irrelevant

to the calculation.           The tax itself is expressed as a time-dependent fraction

of the asset's value at sale, with this fraction going from 0 at s — 0                             to   I

as

       To interpret the tax formula                (6), consider again the Vickrey type tax


system described in (3).           For a terminal asset value of               A,    a holding period

of a and a rate of capital gain always equal to the risk-free rate (implying

an initial coat of Ae15), that system would impose a realization tax

liability of

                                                     12

Thus, the tax schedule (6) treats investors as                   they had arrived at their

current position by investing at risk-free rate.                 Since in terms of certainty-

                                                                     in the
equivalents, this is precisely what they did, the tax system "works"

same way that a Vickrey-type system would.7

       It is natural to ask whether there could be other tax systems achieving

holding-period neutrality based on the same information.                 Proposition 3 shows

that this tax system is unique.



Proposition 3:            The tax system described in (6) is the only one based on the

information set (t,i,s,A) that satisfies the condition for holding-period

neutrality, (4).



Proof:    Consider a         tax rule based on the admissible information set:




(9)          T        —   F(t,i,s,A)

Differentiating (9) with respect to              s   yields:

                                                with (4) and (9) to eliminate
Applying V(') to (10), and combining the result

V(t) and T, we obtain the partial differential equation:

                                  jFA —    F+



Since the division of assets              is arbitrary, it must   be the case that F is

homogeneous of degree one with respect
                                       to                 A.   That is, dividing an asset into
                                               13

two pieces and realizing each half separately can have no effect on the

capital gains tax liability.          Thus, there must exist some function F1(•) such

that:

(12)          F(i,t,s,A) —     F1(i,t,s).A

                                                             into (11), we
Substituting the expression for F5 and FA obtained from (12)

obtain the ordinary differential equation:

              i(l-t)



which, combined with the initial condition F1(i,t,O)—O, yields the unique

solution      F1(i,t,s) —   (le1t5)     and hence    T    —   F(i,t,s,A)   —   F1(i,t,s)A     —

        One may extend the tax system given in (6) to accommodate the more

general situation in which marginal tax rates vary across
                                                          assets.                  Suppose it

is desired that income from the risk-free asset and the capital asset be taxed

                                                                                   That is,

 Once again, the investor is charged the relevant after-tax interest rate
                                             14

i(l-t') on the outstanding tax liahility and taxed on the certainty-equivalent

accruals of income at the capital aaset's tax rate       t.   The significance of

this result is that it shows that holding-period-neutral retrospective

taxation is perfectly compatible with the favorable tax treatment of capital

assets.   The tax benefit need not be provided via e distortionary deferral

advantage.

     If investors face different tax rates and, indeed, even if they receive

different relative after-tax returns on different assets, the analysis applies

to each investor individually, as long as he is in portfolio equilibrium, with

    after-tax risk-adjusted return equal to his opportunity coat.        That is,

(6') and (7') always imply that the investor      will require a certainty-

equivalent before-tax return of    i(4..), even if the ratio       (l-t')/(l-t)

varies across the population.     By construction, the risk premium     c   equals

the total return g less the required, risk-adjusted before-tax return i(_.._),

so differences in         imply   different risk premia on the same asset for

different investors.   But this is precisely what gives rise to portfolio

sorting and clientele formation, with investors holding diversified portfolios

but gravitating toward those assets in which they obtain a relatively

favorable trade-off between risk and return (Auerbach and King 1983).         In

equilibrium, each investor will require the available risk premium to hold

each risky asset, assuming there is an interior solution to the portfolio

choice problem.9

     Thus, for the class of assets considered in this section, a simple

realization-based tax system exists that is holding-period neutral, has

limited informational requirements, and can be applied under a tax system with

marginal tax rates that vary over time, assets and investors.        We next show

how the tax system described by    (6) can   be generalized for the class of assets
                                                15


broader than those yielding returns only upon sale.              The tax formula becomes

more complicated than that described in (6)            but follows the same approach.




IV,     The General Tsx System

        Most assets presently subject to capital gains taxes generate cash flows

and are subject to tax charges before disposition of the assets themselves.

In the case of corporate equities, shareholders receive dividends and pay

taxes on them.       For other assets, taxes and cash flows may not be so closely

tied.     For real estate investments qualifying for accelerated depreciation

allowances, for example, investors might in some years receive positive cash

flows and tax refunds at the same time while in later years paying taxes equal

to a substantial fraction of cash flows.             In this section we treat the general

class of assets with arbitrary patterns of cash flows and tax payments.

        Let D5 be the cash distcibution received at date s, and let r5 be the tax

payment made at date          s.   For some assets, we might impose a restriction

relating r5 to      115,   but this is unnecessary for the derivation of a

holding-period neutral capital gains tax.            To the extent that there are

transaction costs associated with purchasing, selling or holding the asset,

these can be treated as negative distributions.

        We follow the same strategy as in Section         III,   first discussing the

evolution of the tax liability T that is necessary to ensure holding-period

                As before, we       assuise initially that the government wishes to tax
neutrality.

all asset income at a single rate t.



Proposition 4:       For the general class of assets just described, the following

         condition is necessary and sufficient for a tax to be holding-period

         neutral:
                                                  16


(14)                  V(T55 —       i(lt)T5 +     tiA5     -




£rQ1:     Following the proof of Proposition 1, we note that the yield on the

        net of tax asset value A-T must equal i(l-t).                  This yield consists of

        the return on the asset D plus the net capital gain A                    -    t minus   the tax

        payment r; thus1°



(15)                  V(A5      -
                                    t5) + O   -        —
                                                           (As   -
                                                                     T5)i(l-t)

Combined with equation (14), (15) implies that V(A5) +                        — iAn, regardless of

A   or a.   Hence (14) implies holding-period neutrality.                     Combined with the

requirement for holding-period neutrality that V(A5) +                    O   — iAa, that the

before-tax return required in the asset be independent of A5 or a, (15)

implies (14)QED

        Expression (14) aaya that, in computing their increase in tax liability

    investors should be given credit for taxea paid currently.                         Again, such a

provision is preaent in Vickrey's original scheme.                     As before, the rule

described in (14) is less restrictive in that it applies to the valuation of

returns ex ante rather than actual        g ppg returns in each state of nature.
Once again, there is a tax syatem that will satisfy (14) without requiring

information on the pattern of an asset's growth in value.



Proposition 5:    Suppose the realization tax liability is:




        T5 — (1 eti5)A5         ei(t)5[fg(e_e(1t)t)Dzdz                        + fge(1t)5rdz]
                            -
(16)




       Then the tax system satisfies      (14) for all s and hence                   is holding-period
                                                                 17

neutral.




rQL:       Taking the time derivative of (16), we obtain (substituting (16) into



        the result):

                                                                 +          + i(1-t)T5   -

Again, without restriction (see the proof of Proposition 2) we may assume
that the risk-adjusted, before-tax required return V() + D —     ao that                     i,
  + D —    i+       c    with V(c) — 0. Thus,

Since, by construction, V(c) — 0, application of V(.) to both sides of (17)

yields (14)•QEo

           As in the previous case, the solution involves taxing the asset's risk

premium at a rate (1
                                  -
                                      e_t15)       rather than         t.    A way of interpreting (16) is

to   rewrite     it     as:


(16')            T5      —
                              (1-e    t15)(Aa +       J eDdz)                 -       (f eDdz
                                             -   jg   e       t)(a-z)Ddz)
                                                                                  -
                                                 18


The term (A5 + jg     eD5dz)           is the present value, at date s, of the asset


plus all previous distributions.       Thus, the tax scheme begins by treating this

entire value as subject to the tax rate (1            -
                                                          eti5),   as in Section III.        Had

all distributions been received tax free and reinvested in the asset itself,11

this would be appropriate, for then the asset would be of the type analyzed

there.    However, because taxes have been paid in the past and the

distributions invested elsewhere, two corrections are necessary for taxes

already paid.    The last term in (16') is a credit for taxes already paid

directly on the asset, while the middle term in (16')                  is   an imputation for

taxes paid on the income generated by distributions invested in other assets

facing an income tax rate t.      That is, the treatment of distributions as

having been reinvested in the same asset assumes that they continue to

generate income at the before-tax rate of return              i, adjusted for risk.          Since

they were actually invested in other assets, which we may assume to face an

accrual-equivalent income tax rate t, we are therefore ignoring the subsequent

income taxes attributable to such reinvested distributions.                     The present value

of these imputed taxes at date     a   is   (f   e()Dzdz           -
                                                                       f e(]tX5)Dzdz).
Thus, the tax system in (16) can be interpreted as treating all distributions

as being reinvested and then applying the tax scheme described in Section III,

but giving credit for taxes paid along the way.

         Yet another interpretation of expression (16) follows from the following

logic.12     As is well known, share repurchases and dividends are equivalent

except for their tax treatment and, in this case, even the tax treatment is

the same.     Thus,   one should be able to view each distribution as a share

repurchase.     Since each such repurchase amounts to the investor's realization

of part of his assets, consistent treatment based on Proposition                    1   ought to

suffice.     If each "partial" asset sale receives such treatment, there ought to
                                                  19

be no deviation needed when the remainder of the asaet is sold.               Indeed, this

conjecture is correct.         Collecting terms in (16), we obtain:



(16'')        T    —   (let15)A     +   f5et51)[(leYtfr)Dr)dz

which says that the household's tax liability at date s equals the normal one

due on asset without previous distributions or tax payments plus the

accumulated deficit in tax payments on previous "realizations", i.e.

distributions 13

         Thus, one very simple approach to the achievement of holding period
                                                       asset at the rate
neutrality is to tax every distribution from s capital

(le_t15), where s          is the time since the asset's purchase.       In this event, the

informational requirements are no worse than in the previous case without

distributiona -

         More generally,     expression   (16)   Ia more complex than expression   (6)   ,   but

its informational requirements are still minimal.               In addition to what was

needed in the previous case, the government now must also know the flows of

previous taxes and distributions on the asset.

         A record of previous taxes can be obtained from past tax returns.               In

many instances, as with common stock, the taxes are directly based on the
                                                                   as easily
distributions, so records of the distributions themselves are juat

available.        Even in cases where the taxes r and distributions P are not sc

simply related (real estate investaents                for example), the law requires

                                                                  can be
 taxpayers to supply enough information so that the distributions

 recovered.       For example, a real estate investor would add interest payments

 and depreciation deductions back to reported profits in order to calculate the

 distribution from a property in a given year.
                                                       20

           As before, the tax rule can be extended to the case of different tax

rates on capital assets (t) and other income (t') by replacing the interest

rate i with the required before-tax return i(l-t')/(l-t).                   In cases where t

is known, this is a simple change.                  There are more complicated cases, though,

where tax preferences are given not via a reduction in                  t   but through tax

credits or accelerated depreciation, each of which affects the present value

of   r.     In this case, it is necessary to determine what effective tax rate                 t

is desired, and base the calculation in (16) on this value.                   Once this has

been done, the continued presence or absence of tax credits or accelerated

depreciation becomes irrelevant, for variations in these are simply offset by

changes in the last term of (16).

          For example, suppose the government wishes to lower an asset's effective

tax rate from          t' —   .4   to   t —   .2,   and might use an investment tax credit to

do   so.     Once t — .2 is used to compute T in (16), the investment tax credit

may be kept; but since it appears as a reduction in taxes paid by the

investor in the last term in (16), it will simply increase                   T by an amount

equal in present value.             Put another way, the formula ensures that the

specified effective tax rate will be achieved, regardless of the specific

pattern of tax payments chosen by the government (or, for that matter, the

investor who might choose or be required to make contributions toward his

accumulating tax liability).



IV.       Conclusion

          This paper has presented a scheme that taxes capital gains upon

realization without inducing a lock-in effect or providing the opportunity for

tax arbitrage.          The scheme requires information that is either publicly

available (such as interest rates) or present on previous tax returns (such aa
                                         21

past tax payments) but not the private (or potentially even unavailable)

information on the time pattern of an asset's accrued gains.     The scheme's

simplicity may obscure its quite general applicability.      It may be used for

any assets subject to capital gains or losses, essentially all classes of

assets,   this includes not only cossson stock and real estate, for which

capital gains treatment has historically been considered significant, but

also, for example, depreciable assets, which currently are subject to capital

gains taxes but also receive fixed,           depreciation   allowances in lieu of

deductions for accrued economic depreciationJ4

      Nothing about the tax system described here requires that all asset

income be taxed at the same rate for a particular investor.      Purchases of

certain assets can still be encouraged through a lower overall tax burden,

without the need to resort to   4 2t measures such as   accelerated depreciation

or distortionary ones such as low rates of realization-based capital gains

taxes that exacerbate the lock-in effect and the problem of tax arbitrage.

      In achieving the econoaic benefits of accrual taxation without its

associated liquidity or information problems, the new approach makes a move

toward a less distortionary capital gains tax feasible and eliminates the need

for the additional distortions induced by such anti-arbitrage provisions as

limited loss offsets.

                                       Footnotes

1.   The tax system elready has elements that effect accrual taxation, such

     as the mark-to-market requirements instituted in the 1981 Economic

     Recovery Tax Act to reduce tax arbitrage activity involving commodity

     straddles -

2.   If   the tax system is not indexed for inflation, then this rate should he

     viewed as a nominal interest rate.        Moreover, in the absence of a risk-

     free asset, one may reinterpret the paper's results in terms of a "zero-

     beta" asset that carries no risk premium.

3.   It might be argued that the investor may not achieve an interior

     solution to the portfolio choice problem in the case of assets subject

     to capital gains taxes.        For example, one cannot freely buy and sell

     assets that are indexed by having already been held for a specified time

     period.    However, our focus here is on the case in which the holding

     period becomes irrelevant to the portfolio choice problem.            fortiori,

     the assumption of portfolio balance is justified.

4.    It is straightforward to show that this solution for required

     holding-period yields is unique.        That is, there exists no other rate of

      return   j   L   i   for which the implied tax rule corresponding to (7) is in

      fact consistent with the portfolio balance condition (5) and the assumed

      rate of return j.

5.    In fact, as Cordon shows, the same general equilibrium outcome results

      from tax systems differing only in their treatment of excess returns, if

      private risk-pooling is efficient.          Otherwise, taxes on excess returns

      that have no value to investors may be pooled by the government,

                                                           In this event, the tax rate
      creating value and reducing aggregate risk.

      on risk premia influences the equilibrium outcome, even though the
                                         23

     investor's holding-period decision is not distorted.

6.   Since the tax liability is bounded by the asset's value, the liquidity

     problem disappears under this tax systea.     It is important to stress

     that such an accumulating tax liability over time works to remove the

     lock-in effect only if the tax is eventually imposed.      A provision that

     eliminates capital gains tax liability at death, for example, might

     cause the lock-in effect to be exacerbated by a move to such a tax

     system, since investors would have an even greater incentive to hold "to

     the end".

7.   This utilization of   g       equivalence does   suggest a potential

     political problem in implementing the retrospective tax scheme.        It

     taxes investors on what, in a sense,     their gains should have been.

           this   means taxing winners' and losers'   wealth at the same rate,

     treating them all as if their current wealth had been accumulated at the

     safe rate of return.

8.   One could conceive of a variety of opcimal tax or second-best arguments

     leading to such an objective.    For example, see Auerbach (1981) or the

     related discussion in Sandmo (1985).

9.   Such a solution will not exist, for example, if assets with different

     tax characteristics have the same return distributions, as in the case

     of perfect certainty.     In such cases, constraints on investors'

     positions, on borrowing or short sales,     perhaps, are required for any

     equilibrium to exist and corner solutions for individual portfolios will

     arise.   Here, the equivalence among after-tax returns holds only if

     shadow prices on the binding constraints are taken into account.         See

     Auerbach and King (1983).     If, for example,   an investor held no taxable

     debt, only tax exempt municipal bonds, the appropriate after-tax
                                           24

      opportunity cost would be the interest rate on municipal bonds.

10.   We assume for the sake of exposition that D5 and r5 are known at date   s,

      but this has no affact on the validity of the derivation.

11.   The asset "itself" here refers to the account established for an asset,

      not a specific asset.   If the unit of account were a business, for

      axample, a corporation reinvesting all its profits would be such an

      asset.

12.   I am grateful to Doug Bernheim for this suggestion.

13.   It is particularly clear from (16'') why the initial purchase price does

      not appear in the tax calculation.    One could view this initial cost as

      a negative distribution at date zero, but the appropriate tax on this

      negative distribution would ha zero.

14.   The economic effects of fixed depreciation allowances in the case of

      risky depreciation is discussed by Auerbach (1983) and Bulow and Summers

      (1984).
