                                              ABSTRACT


        Of the readily computed proxies for the prevalence of gun ownership, one, the percentage of
suicides committed with a gun, performs consistently better than the others in cross-section comparisons.
It is readily computed for states and counties and has a high degree of validity when tested against survey-
based estimates. It also appears valid as a proxy for changes over time in gun prevalence, at least at the
regional level. Our analysis of this proxy measure for the period 1979-1997 demonstrates that the
geographic structure of gun ownership has been highly stable. That structure is closely linked to rural
tradition. There is, however, some tendency toward homogenization over this period, with high-
prevalence states trending down and low-prevalence states trending up.

About 40% of America’s households own at least one firearm. The
prevalence of ownership differs widely by region, ranging from 25% in the
Northeast and 35% in the Pacific states, to 60% in the East South
Central region.1 Just where a particular state or city falls along this wide
spectrum may have a variety of consequences for crime and public
health. The probability that a gun is available for immediate use for a
suicide attempt, escalating an episode of family violence, or self-defense
against an intruder is greater in areas where gun ownership is common
than areas where it is less usual. But while firearms prevalence
influences availability for these uses, there is no scientific consensus on
the ultimate consequences of gun prevalence for suicide, homicide and
crime rates.

A systematic analysis of the effects of gun prevalence requires a valid
measure of gun prevalence. Prevalence cannot be accurately measured
from administrative records, since most states do not require registration
or licensing, and compliance is poor in those that do. When available,
surveys are a more promising source of data on gun prevalence. A
number of national surveys have provided such estimates, but national
surveys are not designed to support reliable estimates at the state or
local level. While there are occasional state or local surveys with gun-
ownership items, they provide only spotty coverage and are in any event
not entirely comparable due to differences in survey method, response
rate, and wording of items.

The remaining possibility for analyzing the effects of gun prevalence is
use of a good proxy that is consistently available at the desired level of
aggregation. Finding a valid and reliable proxy is an old problem (Cook
1979), and a number of alternatives have been proposed and utilized,
generally in rather ad hoc fashion.

In this paper we analyze several plausible proxies for gun prevalence for
which the data are readily available at the state and county level over a
number of years. We find that among these is a simple measure that
“performs” as well or better than the rest; namely, the percentage of
suicides committed with a firearm. After validating this measure, we use
it to describe the geographic structure of gun prevalence, documenting
the wide differences among states and the remarkable stability of these
differences over recent decades. We further demonstrate that this stable
structure is becoming “flatter” over time, with a trend toward greater
geographic homogeneity.

That this proxy performs well in the cross section is no guarantee that it
also tracks trends in gun prevalence. However, we find it does track

intertemporal variation in regional gun prevalence over the period 1980
to 1998.


1. Survey Estimates of Firearms Prevalence

Surveys provide the only useful direct estimates of the prevalence of gun
ownership. Most states lack any sort of registration or licensing
requirement for gun owners. Even in the handful of states that do have
such a requirement in place, the resulting administrative records provide
little useful information on the number of gun owners; such records are
typically incomplete (due to lack of compliance), out of date, and difficult
to access. Survey data fill this gap, but only to a limited extent.

 The "gold standard" for national surveys of gun ownership is the General
Social Survey, conducted by the National Opinion Research Center most
years from 1972 to 1993 and biennially since 1994 (Davis and Smith
1998). In its current form the GSS is conducted in person with a national
area-probability sample of 3,000 non-institutionalized adults. The
response rate has been quite high (for example, 78% in 1994, 76% in
1996, 76% in 1998). Its sample is chosen to be representative of the
nation and of each of the nine Census regions, but not of individual
states.

Two other readily available survey sources provide some information on
the prevalence of gun ownership at the state level. First, between 1992
and 1995 the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS)
included gun-ownership items in surveys conducted in 21 states (Powell
et al., 1998). These surveys were conducted under the auspices of state
health departments using the random-digit-dial telephone technique.
The median sample size of adults ages 18 and over was 2,061, and the
median response rate was 67 %.2

Second, two national surveys conducted on behalf of the Harvard Injury
Control Research Center (HICRC) provide the basis for state-level
estimates. These surveys were conducted by using the random-digit-
dial technique in 1996 and 1999, with sample sizes of 1,900 and 2,500
respectively. States were sampled in proportion to their population
relative to that of the United States, producing valid estimates of state-
level household gun ownership, albeit with small sample sizes. Detailed
information on these surveys has been published previously (Powell et al.


2 The median proportion of homes with telephones was 95.6%, and the median refusal
rate for the firearm section was 2.0%. For states that asked firearm questions in more
than one year, the most recent data were used.

1998; Azrael and Hemenway 2000; Miller, Azrael, and Hemenway 2000;
Hemenway, Azrael, and Miller 2000).

“Prevalence” may be usefully defined with respect to individuals or
households, and with respect to all types of guns or just handguns.3
(Handguns are of particular interest because they are vastly over
represented in crime in comparison with long guns.) The GSS provides
enough detail in recent years to estimate all four variants: the percent of
households with some type of gun, the percent of households with a
handgun, the percent of adult individuals who possess a gun, and the
percent of adult individuals who possess a handgun. These four
prevalence measures are highly correlated across the nine Census
regions. As shown in Table 1, the inter-region correlations are in every
case above 90% (based on estimates from the GSS for 1994, 1996, and
1998 combined). Hence a proxy that provides a valid approximation to
the geographic structure of, say, household handgun prevalence, likely
also provides a valid approximation of other measures of prevalence. On
the other hand, the four measures have followed somewhat different
trajectories over time at the national level.4

2. Alternative Proxy Measures

When survey-based estimates or other direct estimates of gun availability
have not been available, social scientists have used proxy measures.
Perhaps the first proxy employed in the social-science literature was the
fraction of criminal homicides committed with a gun; Brearley (1932)
utilized this measure in analyzing the effect of gun ownership on
interstate patterns of homicide. Since then it has been used to study the
effect of gun availability on homicide rates over time (Fisher, 1976) and
across nations (Etzioni and Remp, 1973; Curtis 1974).

Cook (1979) proposed and validated a related measure, namely the
average of the gun percent in homicide and with the gun percent in
suicide, demonstrating its application in a study of city robbery rates;
other analysts have utilized this "Cook Index" as well (Miller, Azrael, and
Hemenway 2001; Sloan 1990; Lester 1985). Kleck and Patterson (1993)
have offered the most-elaborate proxy, a 5-item factor computed from the
percentage gun use in homicide, suicide, assault, and robbery, as well as

3 The "handgun" category includes pistols and revolvers, while the long-gun category
includes rifles and shotguns. While handguns make up only about one-third of the
total guns in private hands, they account for over 80% of gun crimes and injuries (Cook
1991).
4 Since 1980 the household gun prevalence in the United States has trended down,

while the prevalence of individual ownership has been close to constant. The
explanation for the difference in trends is in the downward trend in the size of
households, and in particular the percentage of households that include a man.


                                          5
the value of stolen guns relative to the total property stolen. These and
other studies that utilized proxies computed from crime statistics and
mortality statistics are summarized in Kleck (1997, pp. 260-261).

An alternative source of proxy measures is statistical information on
participation in gun-related activities. Krug (1968), for example, utilized
data on the rate of hunting licenses issued per capita. Recently a
prominent study made use of county-level subscription rates to Guns &
Ammo (Duggan, in press), a magazine oriented to handgun users.

In what follows, we do not attempt an exhaustive analysis of possible
proxies, but focus on two types: those based on Vital Statistics-Mortality
data, and those based on subscription and membership information.
The Vital Statistics data have the virtues of being consistent across time
and space, of high quality, and readily available for annual estimates at
the national, state, or county level (though only counties with large
populations are identified in the public-use data files). We also assess
measures based on subscription data for Guns & Ammo, and on
membership information for the National Rifle Association; these data are
available for a number of years at the county level.

       The specific list of proxy measures is as follows5:

    FS/S      Firearms suicides divided by suicides, 1995-97
    FH/H      Firearms homicides divided by homicides, 1995-97
    Cook      The average of FS/S and FH/H
    UFDR      Death rate per 100,000 due to unintentional injury from
              firearm
    G&A       Subscriptions to Guns & Ammo Magazine per capita, 1996
    NRA       NRA members per capita, 1996

Appendix tables A1 and A2 provide descriptive statistics and source
information.

These measures are for the most part positively correlated with each
other, as shown in Table 2. The correlation between NRA (National Rifle
Association membership) and G&A (subscription rate for Guns & Ammo


5 Various refinements of each of these measures are possible and reasonable. For
example, it seems likely that the weapons used in killings of adults may be more
representative of household prevalence than killings of adolescents. It also may seem
reasonable to standardize the measures with respect to demographic characteristics; for
example, women may be less likely to make use of a gun in the house to commit suicide
than men, in which case a proxy based on the gun percent in suicide would be affected
by the gender mix. In practice, we find that such refinements tend to make little
difference in the validity studies we report.

Magazine) is 90%.6 FS/S (the gun fraction in suicide) is highly correlated
with UFDR (73%) but less so with FH/H (just 37%). Correlations
between NRA and mortality measures are low or even negative: .35
(FS/S), -.19 (FH/H), .55 (UFDR). Thus these proxies are not
interchangeable.


3. Evaluation of the Proxy Measures

The validity of these proxy measures can be evaluated by comparing
them with survey data. (See Appendix Table A3 for descriptive statistics
and source information.) We note that the survey data are subject to
sampling error, which may be quite large for small states, and to both
response and non-response errors. But they provide the only direct
measure of gun prevalence.

This comparison produces a clear winner, as shown in Table 3:
   • FS/S has the highest correlation with survey-based estimates of
      household prevalence for all three sources of survey data. The
      correlation coefficient is 90% across the 21 BRFSS states, and not
      much lower (81%) across the contiguous 48 states using the
      HICRC surveys, despite the large sampling errors for the smaller
      states in those surveys.
   • On the other hand, FH/H performs poorly in the cross-state
      analysis, and combining it with FS/S (the Cook index) is not as
      good as simply using FS/S by itself.
   • UFDR performs well enough but not as well as FS/S, and in any
      event is based on such a relatively rare event (unintentional
      shooting death) as to render it useless for small-area estimates.
   • NRA membership and the G&A subscription rate are also
      dominated by FS/S in these comparisons, and in the regional
      comparisons appear worthless.
We conclude that FS/S is a superior proxy measure for cross-section
analysis, easily computed from available data for state and larger local
jurisdictions and valid against survey-based estimates.

FS/S can also be calculated for counties and other sub-state levels from
readily available mortality statistics. To explore the performance of FS/S
as a sub-state proxy of firearm ownership we needed to identify states for
which sub-state firearm ownership estimates were available. Few states,
however, have such estimates. Of the 21 states that included the

6We also experimented with the subscription rates for American Rifleman and American
Hunter. The interstate correlation with NRA is 97% for each of them. Presumably it is
so high because a subscription to one of these magazines is a benefit of NRA
membership.

firearms module in the BRFSS only one state, Colorado, was able to
provide us with sub-state survey estimates of household firearms
ownership that corresponded to geographic units for which we could
calculate FS/S.7 Colorado collected firearm-ownership estimates (and
mortality data) for 12 of the state's 14 Planning and Management
Regions (PMRs) in 1996. The 14 PMRs are a partition of the state's
counties. Colorado did not estimate household firearm ownership rates
for 2 of the 14 PMRs because sample sizes from these 2 PMRS contained
too few people (N<50). For the 12 PMRs for which household firearm
estimates were available (median sample size=416, ranging from 57 to
2,752) the correlation between FS/S and survey estimates of firearm
ownership rates was 0.75 (unweighted). Weighting by sample size
increased the correlation to 0.87.

4. Estimation of Gun Prevalence from FS/S

The household or individual prevalence of guns in a particular
jurisdiction can be estimated from knowledge of FS/S for that
jurisdiction. As it turns out, there is a linear (but not proportional)
relationship between FS/S and prevalence over the relevant range.
Equations for doing the conversion from proxy value to prevalence
estimate are presented below. In order to correct for heteroskedasticity
due to sampling error in the surveys, these regression equations are
estimated using weighted least squares (WLS), with weights equal to the
square root of the sample size for each jurisdiction. The weights take
account of the fact that the survey-based prevalence estimates are much
more precise in some states than others, given that the smaller states
have sample sizes as low as 7.

To begin, Figure 1 depicts a scatterplot of state-level prevalence
estimates (from BRFSS) against FS/S. The WLS line is superimposed.
Note that the linear fit appears quite good for the range that we observe,
even though the underlying relationship must be curvilinear at the
endpoints (since the gun prevalence must lie between 0 and 1). Also
plotted in Figure 1 are the BRFSS estimates for the household prevalence
of handguns, which unfortunately are only available for 10 states.

       Reference: Figure 1

Figure 2 depicts a scatterplot of region-level GSS estimates for household
and individual prevalence of both firearms and handguns, all plotted
against FS/S. The four WLS lines are superimposed. The “fit” is
excellent in every case.

7Alaska, the only other state that could provide sub-state geographic estimates, could
only provide these estimates for four geographic areas.


                                           8
      Reference: Figure 2

Table 4 provides coefficient estimates and statistics on “fit” for these and
other WLS regression lines depicted in Figures 1 and 2. It also reports
the equation for the regression of household prevalence (estimated from
the HICRC surveys) against FS/S across the contiguous 48 states.

As shown in Table 4, there are three equations for estimating household
prevalence of firearms, based on quite different sources – GSS for 9
regions, BRFSS surveys for 21 states, and HICRC surveys for 48 states.
The three equations are remarkably similar, particularly with respect to
the slope coefficient, which is in every case close to 1.0 (implying a one-
to-one relationship between household prevalence percentage and gun
percentage in suicide).

Appendix Table A4 provides survey-based prevalence estimates for each
state together with the fitted values. The largest disparities,
unsurprisingly, show up in the states with small survey sample sizes.


5. The Geographic Structure of Gun Ownership

The prevalence of gun ownership has a strong regional pattern, with
relatively low rates in the Northeast and Pacific Coast, and high rates in
the South and Mountain states. This geographic pattern has been quite
stable over time, suggesting that the determinants of gun prevalence
have more to do with tradition, culture and childhood experience than
with concern about crime or other relatively volatile matters.8

To explore the evolution of interstate patterns over time, FS/S was
calculated for all 50 states and District of Columbia for each of three
different periods. As shown in Table 5, over a 19-year interval the
pattern remained essentially unchanged: the correlation across the
states between the earliest period (1979-81) and the most recent (1995-
97) is 95%.

What underlies this structure? The answer, to a large extent, is rural
tradition (Cook and Ludwig 1996). The percent of the state’s population
that was rural in 1950 is highly correlated (across states) with household
gun ownership over four decades later: the correlation with FS/S is 80%



8Cook and Ludwig (1996) found that 80% of adult gun owners had grown up in a
household with guns.


                                        9
(for the years 1994, 1996, and 1998 combined), and is almost as high for
the survey-based estimates.9

Nonetheless, this geographic structure is not immutable. In fact, there is
a pronounced tendency of increasing homogeneity. When the states are
sorted by 1987-9 values (to avoid regression to the mean), then 13 of the
bottom 15 have increased between 1980 and 1996, while all 15 of the
highest have decreased. Measures of dispersion tell the same story:
From 1980 to 1996, the interquartile range declined from 45% to 37%,
while the interdecile range declined from 50% to 42%.10

    6. The Validity of FS/S over time

Although the results presented above demonstrate that FS/S is a valid
proxy for cross-section variation, it is not necessarily true that it is also
valid as a proxy for variation. It is possible, for example, that trends in
weapon preferences by suicidal individuals, or in the demographic
composition of suicide, create a shifting relationship between gun
availability and weapon choice.

To explore the validity of FS/S as a proxy for changes in gun-ownership
prevalence over time, we once again use data from the General Social
Survey. It has included identical items on gun ownership for 14 of the
years between 1980 and 1998. As noted above, the GSS sample is
designed to be representative at the level of the Census region. Thus it is
possible to estimate gun prevalence for a panel of the nine regions by
year with only a few gaps. We construct such a panel for the four
measures of gun ownership: Individual gun and handgun ownership,
and household gun and handgun ownership.

Table 6 reports the results of regressing each of the four measures
against FS/S. All regressions include regional fixed effects, so the
coefficient estimates on FS/S reflect only inter-temporal covariance with
gun ownership.

FS/S performs well in these trials. The coefficients are in each case more
than twice the standard error, and perhaps more impressive, very similar
to those estimated from cross-section data on states (reported in Table
4), as seen below:


9 The correlation across 48 states between “percent rural in 1950” and household gun
prevalence estimated from the HICRC survey is 74%; the correlation across 21 states
using the BRFSS data is 79% .
10 Details available from the authors on request. We have not attempted to explore the

reasons for increasing homogeneity. It may reflect increased immigration and inter-
state migration.


                                          10
                              Cross-section         Panel Data

Household gun                 .97                    .91

Individual gun                .73                     .81

Household handgun             .78                     .74

Individual handgun            .55                     .55

We conclude that FS/S is a useful proxy for gun prevalence for inter-
temporal variation, at least at the level of the Census region. Over time,
as across states, a one percentage point increase in FS/S is associated
with a one percentage point increase in household prevalence of gun
ownership.

Appendix Table A5 elaborates on this validation test, presenting the
results of other regression specifications, and also includes a direct
comparison with another proxy, the subscription rate for Guns &
Ammo.11 FS/S outperforms the other proxy in every test.

     7. Conclusion

Of the readily computed proxies for the prevalence of gun ownership,
one, the percentage of suicides committed with a gun, performs
consistently better than the others in cross-section comparisons. It is
readily computed for states and counties and has a high degree of
validity when tested against survey-based estimates.

FS/S also appears valid as a proxy for changes over time in gun
prevalence, at least at the regional level.

Our analysis of this proxy measure for the period 1979-1997
demonstrates that the geographic structure of gun ownership has been
highly stable. That structure is closely linked to rural tradition. There
is, however, some tendency toward homogenization over this period, with
high-prevalence states trending down and low-prevalence states trending
up.



11 Duggan (in press ) utilizes the Guns & Ammo subscription rate as his proxy for gun
prevalence. His demonstration of its validity for inter-temporal variation is based
primarily on a set of regressions similar to those presented in Table A5, but using state-
level data. As he notes, the General Social Surveys do not provide representative
samples at the state level. For that reason our replication of Duggan’s validity test uses
the GSS data for regional estimates only.


                                           11
We conclude that FS/S provides the best of the readily computed proxies
for analyzing the influence of gun prevalence on gun use in criminal
violence and suicide.

      * Data come from a national random-digit-dial (RDD) telephone
survey, conducted by Fact Finders, Inc., a social science survey firm, in
1996 (n=1900) and again in 1999 (n=2500). The sample is representative
of United States households with telephones. (These surveys are
described in detail in Hemenway, Azrael, Miller 2000.) Alaska and
Hawaii not included in the 1996 survey so are excluded from analysis.

** Data were obtained from 1991 through 1995 surveys of the Behavioral
Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). Details have been published
elsewhere (Siegal et al. 1993; Frazier et al. 1992). Briefly, state health
departments conduct monthly telephone surveys of randomly selected
persons 18 years old and older. Over the 5-year study period, 22 states
asked about household firearms (Table 1]. The median sample size was
2061, the median response rate was 66.9%, the median proportion of
homes with telephones was 95.6%, and the median refusal rate for the
firearm section was 2.0%. For states that asked firearm questions in
more than 1 year, the most recent data were used.

***The General Social Survey (GSS) is fielded on a regular basis by the
University of Chicago's National Opinion Research Center. The GSS
utilizes personal interviews with an area probability sample. It has
included items on household gun ownership since 1972, and on
individual ownership since 1980. The most recent firearms data
available from the GSS are for the even-numbered years of the 1990s.
The GSS sample is structured so as to be representative of the
populations of each of the 9 census regions, but not necessarily of
individual states (Davis and Smith 1998).

Notes: Each cell contains the key coefficient estimate and SE from a
different regression. Each regression includes regional dummies; the
coefficients are not reported in this table. N = 126, annual observations
for the following 14 years: 1980-1982, 1984-1985, 1987-1991, 1993-
1994, 1996, and 1998. (The GSS was not fielded during the missing
years.) The four measures of gun ownership are the dependent variables
in the regressions.
The two proxies for gun ownership are:
       • FS/S = % of suicides in region committed with a gun, from Vital
          Statistics
       • G&A= Subscriptions to Guns&Ammo per 1000 residents of
          region from the Audit Bureau of Circulations
