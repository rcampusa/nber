              Effects of Expected Future Government
              Deficits on Current Economic Activity

                            ABSTRACT

          This paper considers that possibility that expected

future government deficits directly affect economic decisions,

in particular the decisions of the Federal Reserve.   Some

evidence is presented in Section II that indicates that the

behavior of the Fed may be influenced by expected future deficits.

The economic consequences of this behavior are examined in Section

III. The results in this section show that fiscal policy is less

effective if the Fed responds to expected future deficits than

otherwise. Quantitative estimates of the differences in fiscal—

policy effects are presented,

I. Introduction

         There has recently been considerable discussion about current and

expected future federal government budget deficits. While many people are

worried about the large size of the deficits, there is little clarity about

the ways in which the deficits affect the economy. One obvious answer is

that the deficits have no direct effects on individual and government

decisions, that they are merely the consequence of these decisions. In

a typical macroeconometric model, for example, the government surplus or

deficit is determined by an identity, and it does not appear as an explan-

atory variable in any of the stochastic equations. If this is all there

is to it, one should not worry about the deficits per Se. One should

merely be concerned about the standard target variables like real output,

the rate of inflation, the unemployment rate, and the size of the capital

stock.

         The purpose of this paper is to consider the possibility that ex-

pected future government deficits directly affect economic decisions, in

particular the decisions of the Federal Reserve. Some evidence is presented

in Section II that indicates that the behavior of the Fed may be influenced

by expected future deficits. The economic consequences of this behavior

are examined in Section III.



II. Fed Behavior

         The question considered in this section is whether expected future

government deficits affect Fed behavior. I have an equation in my U.S.

macroeconometric model (Fair (1984)) that explains Fed behavior. This

equation is an interest rate reaction function. It is a ?!leaning against

the wind" equation in the sense that as real economic activity or inflation

or money supply growth increases, the Fed is estimated to respond to this

by raising short term interest rates. The hypothesis that Fed behavior

is   also influenced by expected future   deficits can be tested by adding a

variable   measuring   expected future deficits to this equation. If the var-

iable is significant, this is evidence in favor of the hypothesis.

         Let Dt be the ratio of the federal government deficit (NIA defi-

nition) to GNP in quarter t       (both in current dollars).1 This is the

measure of the size of the deficit used in this study. Let D÷1 denote

the Fed's expected value of Dt+1 (i =      0,   1, .., ) ,   where   the expectation
is   based on information available through quarter t-l

         Since the interest rate reaction function is part of a complete

model, one could consider estimating the entire model by full information

maximum likelihood (FIML) under the assumption that the expectations of

the Fed are rational. All the equations in the model would be the same

except for the interest rate reaction function, which would have the addi-

tional variable           on the right hand side, where i       is chosen ahead



11n terms of the notation in Fair (1984), Dt =
is the federal government budget surplus and
                                                     _St/GNPt    ,   where
                                                   GNPt is nominal GNP.
                                                                             S
of time. Given a set of expectations of future exogenous-variable values

for each quarter of the estimation period, the method in Fair and Taylor

 (1983) could be used to obtain the FIML estimates. .(The simplest assump-

tion about exogenous-variable expectations is to assume that the expected

values are the actual values, although other assumptions are possible.)

Under the assumption that the Fed is using my model in forming its expecta-

tions of future deficits, the FIML estimates account for all the nonlinear

restrictions that are implied by the rational expectations hypothesis.

The constraints built into the estimation procedure are that the FedTs ex-

pectations of the future deficits (given the exogenous-variable expecta-

tions) are the model's predictions. One could estimate the model for

alternative values of i to see which choices, if any, resulted in a

significant estimate of the coefficient of D1

        The Fair-Taylor method is expensive for a model of my size (30 sto-

chastic equations and 98 identities), and no attempt has been made to use

it here. Instead, the limited information methods of Hayashi and Sims

(1983) and Hansen (1982) have been used to estimate the interest rate re-

action function. Because these methods are recent and have not been widely

used, the exact steps that were followed to apply the methods in the present

case will be explained.

        The interest rate reaction function is nonlinear in variables but

linear in coefficients, and so it can be written



(l)            =
                   Qtbi

                                ,

term.     Some of the variables in                            are nonlinear functions of the basic

endogenous and predetermined variables in the model. Let                                              be the

Fed's expectation error:



 (2)                       =   D         -
                                                                    ..., T
                  t+i              t+1        t+i

Substituting       (2) into (1) yields:


(3)                    =            +               ÷     -

                       =Xtb+ut,                    t=l, ...,T,

where        =
                  (Q       Dt.) ,            b =
                                                   () ,       and    u =     v   -
                                                                                     c÷1b2   .   In   what fol-

lows         is assumed to be of dimension p

          Consider first the two-stage least squares (2SLS) estimation of equa-

tion (3).        Let Z be a Vector of dimension k of first stage regressors.

A necessary condition for consistency is that                                    and u be uncorrelated.
This will be true if both                           and Et÷j are uncorrelated with Z                       The

requirement that Z and v be uncorrelated is the usual 2SLS require-

ment, The requirement that Z and Et+j be uncorrelated involves an

additional assumption, which is that the Fed has used the variables in
                                                                                                               Z
(perhaps   along with others) in forming its expectation of Dt+1 . Note
that this assumption does not require that the Fed?s expectation be rational.
It    merely requires that the Fed use all the information contained in the

       variables. Given this assumption (and the other standard assumptions

that are necessary for consistency), the 2SLS estimator of b in equation

(3) is consistent. This estimator (denoted b2SLS )                                   is:

                 b2SLS         (X'Z(Z'Z)'X)X'Z(Z'Z)z'y
                                                                                                  5



where b2SLS is p xl ,                X    is T xp ,     Z     is T x        ,   and   Y is T x

The application of the 2SLS estimator to models of the present type is due

to McCallum (1976).

        If u in (3) is homoescedastic and serially uncorrelated, the es-

timated covariance matrix for b2SLS is



(5)           &2(X'Z(Z'Z)Z'X)

where      is the estimated variance of                 u .           The problem in the present

case for i greater than 0 is that u. will be serially correlated even

if v. is not. If, for example, i is 2, an unanticipated shock in period

s will affect c                                   and                  and so ut will be a second

                         s—2+i   ,

order moving average. In general,                 Ut will be a moving average of order

i if Vt is serially uncorrelated.2 If v is serially correlated, the

process for u will in general, of course, be more complicated than simply

a moving average.

        Let V be the covariance matrix of u =
                                                                       (u1, ...,uT)? .   u   is

T xl and V is T x T .                The idea of Hayashi and Sims (HS) is to find an

upper triangular matrix W such that WVW =                         I    and then to transform the

data using W .           Let y* =    WY    and X =      WX    .       The HS estimator of b (de-

noted bHS )     is   simply 2SLS applied to Y* and X

The estimated covariance matrix for bHS is




2Note that it is assumed here that expectations are based on information
through period t-1 , not t .                 If
                                    information through period t were
used, the order of the moving average would be i-l

 (7)        (X*Z(ZiZ)Z!X*)

Taking W to be upper rather than lower triangular means that the trans-

formations are with respect to current and future values rather than cur-

rent and past values. This allows the transformed error term Wu to remain

uncorrelated with all the current and past values of the variables in Z

       The Hansen estimator of b (denoted bH )                    is

(8)         bH =   (X'ZMZ'X)X'ZMZ'Y

where M is some estimate of urn TE[Z'uu'ZJ                    .   The estimated covariance

matrix of b is

       Hayashi and Sims show that without more information on the determi-

nation of Z ,    it is not in general possible to determine the relative
efficiency of bus and b .                   Both estimators are consistent under fairly

general regularity conditions. Hayashi and Sims show that consistency of

bus is retained when the population V is replaced with a consistent es-

timate and that consistency of b is retained when the population M

is replaced with a consistent estimate.

       Computing bus is straightforward once an estimate of V is avail-

able. Given V ,        W       can be computed numerically, and the rest is simply

matrix calculations. For the work in this paper the best results were ob-

tained using Dt+4 ,            and so u in (3) was assumed to be a moving average

of order 4. Initial estimates of u were obtained from the 2SLS estimates:

           ii   = Yt       -
                               Xb1      ,    t   1, ..., T
                                                                                         7



The diagonal elements of V were taken to be T1iTi .                       The elements

once removed from the diagonal were taken to be (T_l) 21itiit1 ,                    and

so on through the elements removed four places from the diagonal, which
                   —1 T
were taken to be (T-4)  _5uu4
          Computing bH is also straightforward once an estimate of M is

available. The general way of computing M is as follows. Let

   =
        u®      Z .   Let   R =                       ,   where   j   0, 1, ...,   J
The estimate of M is (R0 +R1 +R +..                               For the work in this

paper J is taken to be 4.

          An alternative estimate of H is available under the assumption

that


                                        ]       E{uu5] for t > s
(11)                                        =
                 E[utu5lZt, Z1, ...


which says that the contemporaneous and serial correlations in u do not

depend on Z .         The HS estimator is based on this assumption. This assump-

tion is implied by the assumption that E[utZ5] = 0                for t     s if norm-

ality is also assumed. Under this assumption H can be estimated as

follows. Let

where     j =
                      a =
                0, 1, ..., J

                                   The estimate of H is (a0B0 +a1B1 +a1B +

+ aB ÷aB)              Again, J was taken to be 4 for the work in this paper.

          The I-IS and Hansen methods   were used to estimate equation (3) .           The

results    of   the estimation work for the interest rate reaction function are

presented in Table 1. The data set used for these results is the same as

 the data set used in Fair (1984). This data set contains observations for

 the 1952 I - 1982 III period, and the basic estimation period in Fair (1984)

was 1954 I -1982 III. In the present case the estimation period must end

 in 1981 III rather than in 1982 III because the last four quarters of the

data set are needed for the observations for
                                                       Dt÷4
       Equation 1 in Table 1 is the regular version of the reaction func-

tion, estimated by 2SLS. The first stage regressors that were used for

the estimation are listed in Table 6-1 in Fair (1984). Thirty-six vari-

ables were used. They represent the main predetermined variables in the

model. Equation 2 in Table 1 has Dt+4 added to it. It has been estimated

by 2SLS. For these estimates and for the estimates of equations 3-6, two

variables have been added to the set of first stage regressors:               Dtl and
D2 . Although           the estimates of equation 2 are consistent under standard

assumptions, the estimated standard errors and          thus   the t-statistics are

wrong because the addition of Dt+4 has introduced serial correlation into

the error term.

       Equation 3 is the same as equation 2 except that it has been esti-

mated by the HS method under the assumption of a moving average error term

of order 4. These estimates have accounted for the serial correlation prop-

erties of the error term. Equation 4 is the same as equation 2 except that

it has been estimatedby Hansen's method. The general way of estimating

M for Hansen's method (for J = 4         )   did   not result in a positive definite

matrix (a not uncommon problem), and so estimates for this case could not

be obtained. The alternative way discussed above of estimating M (again

for J =   4   )   did   result in a positive definite matrix, and the estimates

for Hansen's method in Table 1 are based on this estimate of M            .    These
estimates have also accounted for the serial correlation properties of the
                                                                             10



 error term.

        All summary statistics in Table 1 (SE, R2, and DW) are based on es-

timates of u. ,    not   of some transformation of   u .   In   other words, the

transformations that are implicit in the HS and Hansen methods were not

used in calculating the estimated error terms for the summary statistics.

       The coefficient estimates for equation 1 are similar to those in Fair

 (1984). The main difference that the loss of the last four observations has

made is that the coefficient estimate of the inflation variable
                                                                      Pb. has
been lowered from .0687 to .0478, and the t-statistic has been lowered from

2.11 to 1.40 (see equation 30 in Fair (1984) for the original estimates).

       The coefficient estimates for equations 2, 3, and 4 are similar.

All show that        is significant by conventional standards. Although

the t-statistics in equation 2 are not correct, the bias seems to be fairly

small in this case. Likewise, the differences between the results for the

HS method and Hansen's method seem small.

       The introduction of Dt+4 to the equation has essentially lowered

the coefficient estimate of Pb to zero. The effects on the other coef-

ficients are smaller, and all estimates are significant in equations 3 and

4 except for those for Pb .      The coefficient estimate of 22.1 for Dt+4

in equation 3 means that the one-period impact on the short term interest

rate of an increase in the deficit of 1 percent of GNP is 22.1 basis points.

The long-run impact is 22.1/(1 - .885) = 192.2 basis points, or about 2 per-

centage points.

      Since the estimates of the coefficient of      PDt in equations 3 and

4 are of the wrong sign and highly insignificant, the equations were re-

estimated with Pb    dropped.   These equations are 5 and 6 in Table 1.

It is clear that dropping PDt has had little effect on the other
                                                                             11




coefficient estimates.

        The value of the lead for D that gave the best results was 4.

It is interesting to note that the use of Dt or Dt1 in place of

results in coefficient estimates of the D variable that are insignificant

and of the wrong sign. The coefficient estimate for Dt was -7.3 with a

t-statistic of 1.05, and the coefficient estimate for Dti was -3.6 with

a -t-statistic of 0.55.   (The estimation technique in these two cases was

2SLS.      and Dt1 were entered separately.) There is thus no evidence

that the Fed responds to the current or lagged value of the deficit.

        In summary, the results seem supportive of the hypothesis that ex-

pected future deficits affect Fed behavior. The expected future deficit

variable is significant in the interest rate reaction function. The results

are, however, quite tentative, and they should be taken with considerable

caution. First, I have searched for the value of the lead for D that

gave the best results, and so there is an element of data mining here, which

always warrants caution. Second, this work is based on the assumption that

the interest rate reaction function is an estimate of Fed behavior, and

some may feel that this is not a good approximation. Trying to explain

Fed behavior is more difficult than trying to explain the aggregate behavior

of the household and firm sectors because the Fed is run by a relatively

small number of people. There may be fairly abrupt changes in Fed behavior

if the people with influence change their minds or are replaced by others

with different views. Finally, at the time of this writing the future de-

ficits seem likely to be on average larger than the deficits used for the

estimates in Table 1, and after more time has passed, one will need to re-

estimate the equation using the new, more extreme data to see if the sig-

nificance of Dt÷4 is retained.

III. Fiscal Policy Effects

       The question considered in this section is how much difference it

makes to the economy whether or not Fed behavior is affected by expected

future deficits. In particular, the sensitivity of fiscal-policy effects

to alternative assuiptions about Fed behavior is examined. My U.S. model

is used for this purpose. The following is a discussion of the experiments

that were performed.

       There are 5 assumptions that can be made about monetary policy

in my model:   1) the short term interest rate exogenous, 2) the money

supply exogenous, 3) nonborrowed reserves exogenous, 4) the amount of

government securities outstanding exogenous, and 5) the interest rate re-

action function used. Under the fifth assumption monetary policy is endog-

enous. One can examine the sensitivity of fiscal-policy effects to the

alternative monetary policy assumptions, and this has been done in Fair

(1978) and in Chapter 9 in Fair (1984). The results show that fiscal-policy

effects are quite sensitive to the alternative assumptions. The reason

for this is simple. The different assumptions lead to different values

of the short term interest rate for a given fiscal-policy change, and the

short term interest rate has important direct and indirect effects on con-

sumption and investment. The experiments in this paper are concerned with

the sensitivity of fiscal-policy effects to different interest rate reac-

tion functions, in particular to the inclusion of        in the functions.

       Three versions of the interest rate reaction functions were used,

all based on the coefficient estimates of equation 5 in Table 1. For the

first version the coefficient of D÷4 was taken to be zero, for the second

version equation 5 was used as is, and for the third version the coefficient

of Dt4 was taken to be half its estimated value. Since the versions are
                                                                          13



the same except for the coefficient of Dt+4 ,   they   allow one to examine

the differences in fiscal-policy effects that are due solely to how the

Fed reacts to expected future deficits.

       The fiscal-policy experiment consisted of a sustained increase in

federal government purchases of goods in real terms of 1.0 percent of real

GNP beginning in 1970 I. The results of this experiment are presented in

Table 2 for selected variables in the model. The row 1 results are for

the reaction function without the deficit variable, and the row 2 and row

3 results are for the reaction function with the deficit variable.

       The calculation of the row 1 results is easy to describe. The

actual residuals of the equations were first added to all the equations

in the model and were taken to be exogenous.4 This means that when the

model is solved using the actual values of the exogenous variables, a per-

fect tracking solution is obtained. In other words, the "base" values of

the endogenous variabLes for the experiment are merely the actual values.

The government spending variable was then changed and the model was solved.

The difference between the predicted value of a variable from this solu-

tion and its actual value is the estimate of the response of the variable

to the policy change.




4The actual residuals are the residuals that were computed at the time of
estimation except for the residuals for the interest rate reaction func-
tion. For this equation the residual for a given period is the difference
between the actual value of the left hand side variable and the predicted
value computed from the right hand side variables exclusive of the deficit
variable. This allows a perfect tracking solution to be obtained even
though the deficit variable is excluded from the equation. See Fair (1984),
Chapter 9, for a general discussion of the use of perfect tracking solu-
tions in the estimation of policy effects.

        The calculation of the row 2 and row 3 results is more involved.

The first problem that must be faced is what to assume about the expecta-

tion formation of the Fed. The assumption behind the estimation work in

Section II is that the Fed uses all the information in the        Z variables
in forming its expectation of           .   It   does not have to be assumed that

the Fed uses my model in forming its expectations, only that the        Z var-
iables are among the variables that it uses. When the estimated reaction

function is added to the model (with the expected future deficit variable

among the explanatory variables), a more specific assumption about expec-

tation formation is needed. Two assumptions have been made for the work

here. The first is that the Fed uses my model in forming its expectations,

and the second is that the Fed's expectations of the exogenous variables in

the model are equal to the actual values. These two assumptions imply that

the Fed's expectation of Dt+4 is equal to the model's prediction of it.

In this sense the Fed's expectations are rational.

       The solution of the model is more difficult when future variables

like Dt÷4 are among the explanatory variables. What this means is that

future predicted values of the endogenous variables affect current predicted

values, and so the standard way of solving models period by period cannot

be used. One must instead iterate over solution paths of the endogenous

variables. The exact method for doing this is presented in Fair and Taylor

(1983), and   this   is the method that has been used for the row 2 and row 3

results. Unlike the estimation method in Fair and Taylor (1983), which,

as mentioned in Section II, is expensive, the solution method is not very

expensive.

       The same fiscal policy experiment was performed for the row -2 and

row 3 results as was performed for the row 1 results. The only difference
                                                                          16




is that D        is included in the interest rate reaction function. Perfect
          t +4

tracking solutions for the experiments were obtained by adding the estimated

residuals to the equations and then taking them to be exogenous.5

       One feature of the model should be explained before the results are

described. The long term bond rate and the mortgage rate are linked to the

short term interest rate through standard term structure equations. Each

long term rate is a function of current and past short term rates. Another

possible way that expected future deficits could affect the economy would

be through the term structure equations. In other words, D+ might be

an explanatory variable in the term structure equations. No attempt was

made to test for this here, and so the long term rates merely follow the

short term rate for the present results.

       I have experimented with a version of my model in which there are

rational expectations in the bond and stock markets. This work is described

in Fair (1979) and in Chapter 11 in Fair (1984). This version has not been

used for the present results. The results in Chapter 11 show that the tim-

ing of fiscal-policy effects is significantly changed by the addition of

rational expectations in the bond and stock markets, but that the total

effects over, say, 12 quarters are only slightly changed.

       The following is a brief discussion of the policy effects in the

three versions of the model. Chapter 9 in Fair (1984) contains a much more

extensive discussion of the policy properties of the regular version of

the model (i.e., the version without the deficit variable in the interest



5For the row 2 experiment the residuals used for the interest rate reaction
function are simply the residuals computed at the time of estimation. This
is not true for the row 3 experiment, since the coefficient used for
                                                                     Dt÷4
is not the estimated coefficient. See footnote 4.

 rate reaction function).

        The results in Table 2 are simple to explain. Consider first the

 row 1 versus row 2 results. When the federal government increases its

 spending, this increases the model's predictions (and thus the Fed's ex-

 pectations) of the government's future deficits. For the row 1 results

 this has no effect on the Fed's behavior, but for the row 2 results it

 leads the Fed to raise the short term interest rate more than it otherwise

would. This results in an increase in the bond rate and (not shown in

Table 2) in the mortgage rate. The higher interest rates for the row 2

results are contractionary, and so the GNP changes are smaller in row 2

than in row 1. The differences are in fact quite large. After three quar-

ters the interest-rate changes in row 2 are about twice the size of those

in row 1. Aftereight quarters real GNP is .79 percent above the base

value in row 1, but .12 percent below the base value in row 2. After 12

quarters the values are .47 above in row 1 and .85 below in row 2. After

12 quarters the GNP deflator is .53 percent higher in row 1, but only .01

percent higher in row 2. The money supply falls much more in row 2 than

in row 1, which is due to the higher interest rates and lower income in

row 2 than in row 1.

       The deficit is higher in row 2 than in row 1. There are two main

reasons for this. The first is that tax collections are lower for the row

2 experiment because the economy is less expansionary. The second is that

government interest payments are higher for the row 2 experiment because

interest rates are higher.

       The row 3 results are for a coefficient of De       that is half the
                                                    t +4

size of the estimated coefficient. As expected, the row 3 results are in

between the row 1 and row 2 results. They are closer to the row 1 results
                                                                          18




than to the row 2 results, and in this sense the policy responses are non-

linear functions of the coefficient of D4 .     This   nonlinearity is not

surprising since interest rates have a positive effect on the deficit and

the deficit has (with a lead) a positive effect on interest rates.

       In summary, the results in Table 2 show that fiscal-policy effects

are quite sensitive to the Fed's response to expected future deficits.

If the Fed does respond to expected future deficits, fiscal policy is less

effective than otherwise.



IV. Conclusion

       The evidence in Section II suggests that Fed behavior may be in-

fluenced by expected future deficits. The results in Section III show

that fiscal-policy effects are sensitive to this aspect of Fed behavior.

It should be stressed, however, that these results are based on some strong

assumptions and are highly tentative. The estimation results in Section

II will need to be confirmed using future data before much confidence can

be placed on them. The policy results in Section III are based on the

assumption that the Fed uses my model in forming its expectations of future

deficits, which may not be a good approximation. The overall results of

this paper are thus only suggestive as to what might be the case.

      Two final points should be made. The first concerns whether one

thinks of the interest rate reaction as being derived from the solution

of an optimal control problem by the Fed. If the Fed were using my model

for this purpose, it is unlikely that the interest rate reaction function

with the deficit variable added would be a good approximation to the optimal

decision equation. It would require an unusual loss function, given the

model, for the deficit variable to be a variable in the decision equation,
                                                                           19



although one might argue that the deficit variable is proxying for other

variables. At any rate, if one feels that the estimated interest rate re—

action function is not a good approximation of the optimal decision equa-

tion, one must assume either that the Fed does not optimize and only follows

suboptimal rules or that the Fed uses a different model from mine in solv-

ing its control problem. The second assumption is not an attractive one

to make for purposes of this paper because it has been assumed in Section

III that the Fed uses my model in forming its expectations of future defi-

cits. The second assumption would thus imply that the Fed uses my model

for its expected future deficit calculations and uses some other model for

its optimal control calculations. This would only be a good approximation

if my model and the other model had similar properties regarding deficit

predictions.

       The second point concerns one other way in which deficits affect

fiscal-policy responses. If the Fed responds to i.   fiscal-policy   expansion

by raising interest rates (which the interest rate reaction function pre-

dicts is true even without the deficit variable included), there will be

an increase in interest payments by the federal government. The larger

is the size of the government debt, which is a function of the size of

past deficits, the greater will be the increase in interest payments.

Government interest payments are part of household nonlabor income, and in

my model nonlabor income has a positive effect on consumption. Therefore,

the greater is the government debt, the larger will be the effects from

a given fiscal-policy change if the Fed changes interest rates in response

to the fiscal-policy action. There is, of course, some simultaneity here

in that the Fed will offset some of this increased response by larger

changes in interest rates. This means that in a model like mine interest

rates respond more to a given fiscal-policy change the larger have been

past deficits. This is true even if the interest rate reaction function

does not include a deficit variable.
