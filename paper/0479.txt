                      Interrupted Work Careers



                              ABSTRACT



    The quantitative effects and even the existence of "human capital

depreciation" phenomena has been a subject of controversy in the recent

literature. Prior work, however, was largely cross—sectional and the

iotgitudina1 dimension, if any, was retrospective. Using longitudinal

panel data (on married women in NLS) we have now established that real

wages at reentry are, indeed, lower than. at the point of labor force with-

drawal, and the decline in wages is bigger the longer the interruption.

     Pnother striking finding is a relatively rapid growth in wages after

the return to worh. This rapid growth appears to reflect the restoration

(or "repair") of previously eroded human capital. The phenomenon of "dep--

reciation" and "restoration" is also visible in data for immigrants to the

United States. However, while immigrants eventually catch up with and

often surpass natives, returnees from the non—market never fully restore

their earnings potential.

INTERRUPTED WORK CAREERS: DEPRECIATION AND RESTORATION OF HUMAN CAPITAL


I. Introduction
       Interruption   of a work career, especia1lyrif it is   1enghy, can be expected
to   reduce a person's earning power. The quantitative effects and even the

existence of this "human capital depreciation" phenomenon have been a subject

of controversy in the recent literature.1 Prior work, however, was largely cross-

sectional, and the longitudinal dimension, if any, was limited to retrospectively

reported duration of past interruptions.
                                                                      2
      Using NLS longitudinal panel data on wages of married women, we are now

able to establish the existence of depreciation phenomena more firmly. We

observe that real wages at reentry are on the average lower than at the point of-labor

market withdrawal, and the decline is bigger the longer the interruption. If wage

setbacks due to interruptions were attributable solely to foregone growth of

transferable ("general") human capital wages of returnees would be lower than

wages of stayers, but not lower than their own wages at exit. Wages at reentry

would be lower than at exit to the extent that capital specific to the last job

was lost by separating. But if this were the case, the decline in wages would not

depend on the length of the interruption.3

Corcoran (1978), and Corcoran & Duncan (1979).

2We did. not explore work interruptions of men in the present study. They tend t
be infrequent and quite short. The longer ones are usually a matter of health,
schooling, or the military. See Corcoran and Duncan (1979) for a more detailed
discussion of sex differences in work interruptions.

3Our direct evidence contradicts the conclusions of the Corcoran-Duncan study to
the effect that "labor force withdrawals do reduce wages because work experience
is not being accumulated, but there is no additional penalty due to depreciation
of skills" (Corcoran and Duncan, 1979, p. 18). Their study utilizes a different
data set (PSID) and does not exploit longitudinal information on wages.
                                       2



     Although interruption periods typically mark sharp declines in earning

power, there is also a relatively rapid initial growth in wages after the

return to work. It is rather surprising to find that returnees from the non-

market appear to incur greater job— investments upon return to the market than

do stayers of the same age and education levels who just changed jobs, although

the returnees may invest more after than before the interruption.

     One interpretation of this wage "rebound" phenomenon is restoration or

"repair" of the previously eroded human capital, on the assumption that reconstruction

of occupational skills is more efficient, that is less costly, than new construction

of human capital. In effect, the rate of dc1ine in the rental value of the

depreciated stock is greater than its rate of "physical" depreciation. This

is because the market productivity of the eroded stok is greatly reduced even

if only small parts became defective. It may take relatively little effort to

replace or to repair the defective parts, and once accomplished the rental value

rises to its normal rate.

     Put in terms of the Ben-Porath model of production of human capital (1967),

the erosion of human capital reduces its market productivity more than its

productivity as an input in its own reproduction. As indicated, lack of homogeneity

or of complete divisibility of human capital may be the source of such "non-

neutrality".

     The fact that wages grow rapidly upon return to work suggests that different

estimates of depreciation rates can be obtained depending on the period

of observation. The estimate is smaller if wages of returnees are observed years

after the interruption spell than immediately after it. The distinction

between the short and long run may account for some of the variation in findings

reported in the literature.
                                            3




     The phenomenon of depreciation and restoration of human    capital   is not

restricted to intermittent workers. An interesting example is the economic

experience of international migrants. Recent studies of wages of immigrants

to the U.S. reveal comparable patterns of decline and increase in occupational

status before and after their arrival in the U.S.4 We review some of these

findings in the light of our   hypothesis   in the last section of the paper.



II. The Interrpted Earning Profile: AWorkingScheine

     A highly simpiUied graphic                     of thana1ys1s that follows is

shown in Figure 1. Age—earning profiles for a continuous worker and an inter-

mittent worker are given by the straight line J1L, and by the kinked line

ABCDEFG, respectively. For simplicity it is assumed that the intermittent

worker experiences only one interruption, which lasts only one period of time.

We may thus distinguish four typical phases in the work and wage history of

such a worker: a pre-interruption period (AB), the interruption (BCDE), a

restoration period (EF), and a post restoration period (FG).

     More generally, interruptions may be repetitive or unique, unexpected or

planned, or at least vaguely anticipated. A spectrum of such patterns can be

found in work histories of married women (Mincer & Polachek, 1974). If the

interruption is anticipated, the pre-interruption period may show a relatively

flat wage profile (segment AB rather than JK in Fig. 1) which reflects lower

rates of investment in human capital. Work prior to interruptions occasioned

by planned family formation is, or used to be, a typical example.

        In the presentation of the second phase, the interruption itself, we show

wages at the reentry point (DE) to be below wages at the point of labor force

withdrawal (cB). This finding can already be seen from a preliminary inspection

of the NLS data. Table 1 reports average hourly wage rates immediate].y before

the interruption, and immediately after reentry, for groups consisting of the

same individuals at the two points. (Obviously, such comparisons of wages at

different points in time are possible only with longitudinal data). It is evideit

that reentry wages fall short of withdrawal wages, and that the gap increases

with the duration of the interruption. This further indicates that the lower

wages earned by intermittent workers are not only a result of lost experience

during the interruption and less investment during the pre-interruption periods,

but also as a result of deterioration of earning power due to non—use.

        Another noteworthy feature of Table 1 are the lower pre—interruption wages

of workers who interrupt for longer periods. If intermittoncy is anticipated

or repetitive, the lower pre-interruption wage is a consequence of lesser investment

in human capital. More generally, an upward slope in the lifetime supply of

labor predicts that lower wage workers will interrupt their work careers for longer

periods and more frequently. In the cross—section data where the distinction

between prior and subsequent wages is not available, it can be argued that the

negative relation between interruptions and wages is really a supply effect of

(prior) wages rather than the effect of interruption on (subsequent) wages.

The longitudinal data clearly establish the latter effect, while they are

consistent with the separate reality of labor zipply effects.

    The period immediately after the interruption, the third phase, is assoc-

iated   with a rapid 'process of wage growth. As we infer once again from a
preliminary inspection of data, this time in Table 2, a rapid restoration process
of earning power takes place (roughly) throughout the first five years after

reentry. We further note in Table 2 that the rapid wage growth during that phase
 is   associated with accumulation of job tenure. (It appears however from our

 subsequent analysis that the tenure related wage growth accounts for the lesser

 part of the observed wage progress). The growth in wages of returnees should

 eventually level off and settle at a rate similar to that of continuous workers,

 or lower, if further interruptions are anticipated.              This point marks the

 beginning of the fourth and last phase of the process outlined above.

        Some aspects of the interrupted earning profile can be parameterized and

 estimated. In what follows, the short-run and long-run effects of nonparticipation

      and ,   in   Figure 1) and the long, run effect of experience (R are first estimated

 on the basis of retrospective data; and then, reestimated along with the short-

 run effect of experience (y) and tenure (T)from panel data.



 III. Estimations from Retrospective Data

        All the working estimators in the following analysis' are essentially special

 cases of the earning function

 (1) Ln(w) =       s   +    + ye1 +   h0   +   €hi +
 where the logarithm of wages Ln(w) is specified as a function of two pairs of
 experience—nonexperience variables: past and current labor force participation
                                                                                     6
 (e0 and e1, respectively); past and current nonparticipation (hand h1, respectively).

 We may thus interpret the coefficients p and y aa the long-run and short-run

 effects of participation;         and         as the long-run and short-run effects of

 nonparticipation. All these effects are controlled in Equation (1)

 5The parallelism of the last phase (of FG to KL in Figure 1) should, strictly speaking,
 hold for dollar profiles, if beyond F intermittent workers invest the same amounts as
 continuous workers. In Figure 1 wages are drawn in logarithms, so the parallelism
 denotes somewhat lesser investments by intermittent workers.

for schooling s, and for a vector x of "other" variables to be discussed later on.

      Wages, of course, are not observable for individuals currently out of the

labor force, except at the point of reentry, when current experience is still

almost zero. Estimation at reentry points is possthle with longitudinal data

because individuals observed at their labor force withdrawal and reentry points

are identifiable.

      Let the subscript T denote the timing of the most recent labor force reentry

(termination of the interruption period) for an intermittent worker. Then,

Equation (1) becomes

(2)   Lrl(wT) =   .s   + e0 + h0 + .h1 + U,XT

because e1 =      0.   This particular specification enables us to estimate the long-

run effects of prior experience (e0) and of prior interruptions (h0) as well as

the short-run effect of the just completed interruption (hi). Note, however, that

the reentry point occurs at different calendar times for different individuals,

and thus the observations must be aligned (according to T) and appropriately

adjusted for chronological differences such as inflation and age.



(a) The long-run effects

      Equation (2) has beem fitted to the NLS (mature women 1966—1974) data, and

the results are reported in Table 3. There are two major findings. First, the

long—run effects of market experience and nonexperience are both statistically

significant in the predicted direction. These further indicate that experience

and nonexperience have not only lagged effects on wages, but also that these

effects persist throughout and last beyond spells of labor force withdrawal, which

typically involve new jobs and new employers.

        Quantitatively, we find in the long-run between .6 and 1.1 percent decline

    in wages per year of nonparticipation (h0), depending on whether the estimates

 are derived from the sample including women with zero years of current interruptions

    (sample I, col. 1,2), or the sample confined to women with stricly positive

 current interruptions (sample II, col. 3,4) .'        Similarly,   a year of experience

    (e) results in a long-run increase in wages (calculated at the mean) ranging

 between .4 percent (sample II, col. 3,4), to 1.2 percent (sample I, col. 1,2). It

 should be emphasized that all these estimates represent partial effects: the

 long—run effect of non—participation is estimated holding experience constant,

 and the long-run effect of experience is estimated holding nonparticipation constant.

 It follows that in order to evaluate the total effect of work interruption the

 two   effects   should be summed up. Thus, the total cost of a year outside the labor

 force ranges between 1.5 percent (=1.1 +      .4,   for sample II) to 1.8 percent (=.6 ÷

 1.2, for sample I) of wage decline in the long-run.



    (b) The short-run effect of nonparticipation

        The second major finding is that the cost of nonparticipation is substantially

higher in the shortrun. The short-run effect on wages of current nonparticipation

    (h1) is estimated to range between 3.3 and 7.6 percent per year depending on the

specification and the sample used. Actually, the 7.6 percent figure is an over—

statement. since it includes the effect of foregone tenure, and the latter raises

wages of stayers by 1.6 percent to2.2 percent per year (2.2 percent in the

first year of job tenure according to the quadratic form in Table 7).           Thus,
growth of tenure accounts for a small       part   of the short—run wage rebound, which

is by definition equal but opposite in sign to the estimated short-run depreciation

coefficient.



(c) The nature and length of the interruption spell

      We note that interruptions associated with layoff (LYOF), ill health (HLTH),

and migration (MIG) result in greater than average depreciation. The nature of

these differences is not explored further in this paper. However, these and

other events which often cause withdrawals of women from the labor market are

directly related to the duration of the interruption spell by the regression results

reported in Table 4. Included in this estimation are all the NLS respondents who

have experienced a complete interruption spell within the survey period (1966-

1974). While the average interruption is 2.7 years long (with a standard

deviation of 1.6 years), the findings indicate that child bearing (BAB) is

associated with interruption significantly longer. Shorter than the average are

the interruptions associated with divorce (Dlv), layoff (LYOF), and unemployment

(UNEM).    The duration of interruptions associated with the occurence of marriage
(MAR), ill-health (HLTH), and migration (MIG) seem to differ little from the
average.
      We further note that the duration of the interruption is inversely related
to   the level of education. This is consistent with a positively sloping life-time

labor supply function. It is also coiisisteit with previois findings that the

depreciation rate increases with the level of education (Mincer & Polachek, 1974,

Tables 5 and 6; also Mincer & Polachek, 1978, Tables 1 and 2)8, thereby deterring

the more educated from lengthier episodes of non-participatic.




8Corcoran & Duncan (1979) did not find any relation between the depreciation rates
and occupation in the Michigan Income Dynamics. They do not report comparisons
by education level.

IV. Estimations from Panel Data

(b) Reestimating the short-run effects

        So far, the effects of nonparticipation have been estimated partly on the

basis of retrospective data.9 In this section we dispense with retrospective

data. To this en&we replace the retrospective experience—nonexperience variables

(e0, h0) by information on pre-interruption wages available in the panel data.

In this instance the specification of the earning function involves the following

steps:

     Let the subscripts V and T denote the years of labor force withdrawal and

reentry associated with the most recent interruption. Evaluated at point V the

original earning function (1) becomes:

(3) Ln(w) =    s + 8e + h0 +
since both e1= 0 and h1= 0. Substituting (3) into (2) we obtain
(4) Ln(wT) =           + h1     +
                                      (xT_xV)
where     =1. Alternatively, we may subtract (3) from (2) to obtain

(5) Ln(wT) -Ln(wV =      h1 +       (xT_xV)
Deterininistically, (4) and (5) are equivalent. Stochastica].ly, they differ

because of differences in the error term. Both specifications permit estimation

of the short—run effect of interruption,€, without a need to resort to retro-

spective data. Instead, they make more effecient use of the current data: wages

at the most recent points of withdrawal and reentry (wv and wT), the duration of

the most recent interruption (h1), and recent changes in "other"   variable,    (xT_xV).
Panel estimates of equations (4) and (5) are reported in Tables 5 and 6, respectively.

The estimates, of    are similar in both Tables and range between 5.9 and-8.9

percent. These results are coiparable and a bit higher than the 3.3 — 7.6 range

9Since the NLS panel started in 1967, all prior data are retrospective. Thus
                                                                             e0
and h0 are largely retrospective.

obtained         in Table 4 on the basis of retrospective data. They thus confirm and

reinforce the findings of the previous section, namely that the size of the short-

run effects of nonparticipation exceed by much the long—run effects and are

larger than any reported in previous studies.

         It is worth noting that the estimate of                   (the coeffecient of ln w),

which was not constrained to equal 1, is much less than 1. Unless errors of

measurement in wages are large, the estimate suggests larger (percent) losses

in wages at higher wage levels, given the length of interruption.



(b) Experience and job tenure in the post interruption period

         In order to analyze the process of wage growth in the post-interruption

period we now evaluate the earnings function (1) at a fixed chronological date:

the last year of the panel (1974) in our sample. Here (1) becomes

(6) Ln(w74) =        s + 8e + e1 + h0 +                        :
where h =0 and e = e            +   e       .   Information   on tenure (TEN) available only in the
             1              0           1
post—interruption        period, was explicitly included in the specification of (6).

Wage     growth during the post-interruption period is the sum of the three coefficients
B   + + (equa1 to the short-run effect of current experience). Equation (6)
has been fitted to the data (samples V and VI) and the results are summarized                      in

Table     7. Based on the results estimated by the linear form (col. 1,3), post
interruption wages tend to grow at an average rate of roughly 2.5 percent per
year    of experience. The          quadz'atic form (col. 2,4) results are somewhat higher:
3.3     to 3.6 percent at the mean (which occur about                9 years after the most recent
interruption        for the average respondent).
        When these estimates are projected down to the                 first   year after reentry the
rate    of   growth, as expected, is much higher: between 5.8 to 6.4 percent per year.

    This rate of growth of wages of women who were past the age of thirty at reentry

    is almost double of the estimated rate for men (3.4%) of the same age, projected

    to the outset of their working lives. (See Mincer & Polachek, 1974, Table 11).

    It seems more reasonable to us to view this large difference in wage growth as a
•
    difference in the nature rather than in scale of the human capital investment. A

    breakdown by factors indicates that in all the above cae3s j'ob tenure accounts for

    less than half of the post-interruption wage growth. More than half of it can

    be    ascribed   to experience net of the effect of tenure; namely, to growth of

    earning      power embodied in the worker (general training) and transferable with
    him across jobs. In turn, a half or more of the latter is due to the repair of
    human capital (coefficient of e1 holding e constant).

            In   addition to the various short-run effects outlined above, equation (6)

    offers reestimation of the long—run effects of experience            (e) and nonexperience
    (h). The findings of .4       to   .8   for the former, and -.4 to   —1.0 for the latter,
    are   in clear agreement with the findings obtained in the previous specifications

    (Section III).




    V. Some Conclusions, Conjectures, and the Case of Immigrants.

           Our short and long—run depreciation rates are linear estimates, representing

    the average loss of earning power due to an additional year of non-work. In

    longitudinal data the negative coefficient of h1 is, indeed, evidence on the

    existence of depreciation. We would expect that depreciation affects both

    general and specific human capital. But, while losses of general capital increase

    with the     duration of absence from work, the    loss of specific capital is a once
    for   all phenomenon   due to separation from the job. This means that, if the losses

    were only in specific capital, the corretly estimated marginal depreciation
rates would be zero. Consequently, we may reject the notion that observed depreciation

rates are restricted to specific capital. In previous work, (Table       in Mincer

& Polachek, 1978) we found that interruptions not exceeding a year had negligible,

insiginficant effects on wages. Apparently, intermittent workers lose little

in specific capital, probably because they accumulate little of it. Since we

find that wages decline as a function of duration of the interruption, what we

are observing is largely the phenomenon of depreciati-)n and restoration of

general human capital.

     Although we only estimated coefficients of a linear term in the current

interruption h1 we should not conclude that the depreciation rate is independent

of the duration of the interruption. Longer periods of absence may well

accelerate losses of knowledge and skill. Beyond some point,   with   a substantial

part of the stocli gone, additional losses may well diminish. Of course, when

all the skill has been forgotten and lost, no further erosion is possible. We

nay expect, that if observable over a long range of interruption periods, the

depreciation rate would be a growth (decay) type fundtion (1) of duration. In

 the previously referred work, (Mincer & Polachek,1978) we estimated separate

 (dummy) coefficients for interruptions of one, two and three plus years, and

 these showed negative coefficients increasing in size. This is consistent with

 the initial (accelerating) part of the proposed f   curve.
     Empirical estimation of the complete pattern of depreciation is difficult

for several reasons. Much longer panel data would be required to accoinodate

progressively lengthy interruptions. But even with very long panels, it is

unlikely that very long interruptions would be observed. This is because the

longer the stay in the non-market, the less likely the return to the market.

Although the interruption may result from an increase in the shadow wage (e.g.
increased family demand) above the market wage, a long decline in the latter

(due to depreciation) may well leave it below the shadow wage even when the

shadow wage returns to its usual level. At the saute time non-market skills may

increase with non-market experience thereby raising the "normal" level of the

reservation wage.

     Moreover, the longer the interruption that is observed the more likely

itis that the returnees are people whose human capital is especially durable,

whether it is a matter of personal resiliency (good memory), or environmental

(lesser changes in the field, or special opportunities that have arisen for them).

Consequently, our estimates of short and long-run depreciation, observed on

returnees (prior to 1974) only are likely to be understated. By the same token

the subsequent wage growth is probably overstated. Nevertheless, the ultimately

lower wage level of returnees compared to stayers indicates that to a sufficiently

large extent the wage rebound after interruption differs qualitatively from the

usual continuous investment trajectory.

     Partial losses of human capital may result from causes other than interruption

of market work by non-market activities. An interesting example is international

migration. Skills and knowledge are not completely tranferable across frontiers.

The greater the economic and cultural "distance" between country of origin and

of destination, the greater the "depreciation" of human capital. Here "distance"

plays the same role as duration of work interruption in the case of intermittent

workers. Since not all skills are equally affected, economically motivated

migrants are likely tobe selected among the most adaptable skills and persons.

Selectivity by occupational skill, though not by personal motivation and stamina,

is likely to be weaker in extra—economic migration, as in the case of political

or religious refugees. Therefore greater losses of human capital may be experiiced

by them. This is analogous to the experience of intermittent workers: returnees

tothe market are also likely to be those who lost least by interrupting, and

greater losses, on average, can be expected when the interruption is unanticipated.
                                       22




     Just as in the case of returnees to the labor market, new immigrants initially

experience the greatest loss in human capital. This is visible in occupational

data of immigrants to the U.S. Recent studies (Chiswick, De Freitas) have

emphasized the strong upward economic mobility of migrants in', the U.S. labor

market. However, the success story in the U.S. follows an initial drop from

the immediately preceding occupational position in the country of origin.

According to the 1970 census data, 22.6% of the men arriving in the U.S. between

1965 and 1970 (and in the labor force in 1970) experienced an initial occupational

decline, as measured by major occupational categories. As expected on the basis

of "distance", the extent of decline (proportion experiencing downward mnobilit')

was 11% for immigrants from English-speaking countries, 20.5% from other

developed countries, and 25.4% from LDC's. And, according to Chiswick, the

initial decline was largest or immigrants who are predominantly refugees.

     According to our interpretation of- the behavior of returnees from the

non—market, readaptation ("repair") of skills is likely to be more efficient

than new investments in human capital. The strong upward occupational mobility

of immigrants and the steep wage increases during the first half—dozen years

in the U.S. partially represent, in our view, the same "rebound" from the decline

occasioned by migration as by nonparticipation. Net of the standardizing

variables such as education, age, and others, coefficients of years of work

experience in the U.S. in immigrant earnings functions exceedthe comparable

coefficients of U.S. natives, especially at the start of U.S. experience.

    We would expect that intermittent workers are lesser life-time human

capital investors than continuous workers, Their wage profiles are lower

and flatter than the profiles of contfn'i'ous workers, despite the temporary steep

growth of wages following an interruption. In contrast, economic migrants may

well be persons with greater capacity or opportunity than comparable natives at
                                                                                       10
both origin and destination, and greater investors in their human capital.

        It is tempting, therefore, to interpret the steeper growth of wages of

immigrants than of comparable natives as evidence of their larger investments in

human capital (Chiswick). It is our     view,    however, that the initially lower

wages of immigrants compared to natives and the following initial rapid growth

are   in part a reflection of "depreciation and restoration" in the rental price
of the immigrant's human capital as    well     as   of   the larger scale of   investment   in
its stock which is evident as a lifetime proposition. But even with larger

investments than those of natives, immigrants from the most "distant" countries,

because they suffer the greatest initial differential (e.g. some Asians, and others

from LDC's) do not overtake natives in wages, as do migrants from the more

industrialized and culturally closer countries. (See Chiswick, 1978).

      Can we distinguish short-term "rebound" from long-term scale of invest-

ment? For one, the former implies greater concavity of earnings than the

latter. Secondly, strength of the rebound should be less sensitive to age

which   otherwise sharply reduces   the volume of investment. Evidence in favor

of   the existence of th&"restor4tion" phenomenon may be inferred from Table 8.
It provides a comparison of 1970    earnings functions of immigrants        to   the U.S.

with those of rative men who entered the labor force between 1960 and 1969.

The linear coefficient on the U.S. labor market experience of immigrants is

50% larger than the corresponding coefficients of native entrants into the

labor force, despite the fact that, on    arrival,        immigrants were, on average,

10 If greater ability raises both opportunity costs of and the returns to migration,
 say by an equal proportion, in the presence of direct costs of migration which are
 independent of ability; migràtthn.mutbe more *ofitable for the tnoè able
worker. (The argument is adopted from Becker (197 , p.      )). Even if abilities
did not differ, migration is likely to be selective of people for whom specia
opporufljties beckon at destination.
                                        25




in their second decade of working life. The deceleration of wages (coefficient

of the quadratic term) is over twice as strong for immigrants. Moreover,

the initial growth of wages after arrival in the U.S. is only slightly smaller

for older than for younger immigrants: it declines only .1% per year (coefficient

of interaction term) rather than .8% per year as would be indicated by the

quadratic term of their U.S. earnings profile. At this pace of decline, initial

U.S. wages of 50-60 year old immigrants still grow more rapidly than wages

of U.S. young labor force entrants. It seems apparent that efficient readaptation

of the previously acquired human capital stock is an important part of the immigrant

success story, as it also seems to be a condition of the reabsorption into the

labor market of returnees from the non-market.
