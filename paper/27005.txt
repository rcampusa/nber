                                         ABSTRACT

While economic theories indicate that market power by downstream firms can potentially
counteract market power upstream, antitrust policy is opaque about whether to incorporate
countervailing market power in merger analyses. We use detailed national claims data from the
healthcare sector to evaluate whether countervailing insurer power does indeed limit hospitals'
exercise of market power. We estimate willingness-to-pay models to evaluate hospital market
power across analysis areas. We find that countervailing market power is important: a typical
hospital merger would raise hospital prices 4.3% at the 25th percentile of insurer concentration
but only 0.97% at the 75th percentile of insurer concentration.

1     Introduction

Academics and policy makers have asserted that an increase in market concentration over
the last couple of decades has led to greater markups and higher prices.1 While the recent
literature has largely focused on increases in seller concentration, observers have also raised
concerns about buyer concentration.2 In many markets, seller and buyer market structure
(monopoly and monospony power, if you will) interact. Since most industries exhibit a
vertical structure with several layers of production before the final product sale, an increase
in concentration downstream can exert what Gailbraith famously termed "countervailing
power" (Galbraith, 1952). Monopsony power of downstream firms can counteract market
power upstream. For example, Walmart might use its leverage to negotiate lower wholesale
prices from suppliers in concentrated sectors, and possibly pass on a portion of the savings
to consumers.
    Understanding the role of countervailing power in affecting prices is particularly rele-
vant for antitrust enforcement. A theoretical literature has shown that, in the presence of
countervailing bargaining power, upstream mergers may raise input prices less than they
otherwise would (Loertscher and Marx, 2019b) and, in some circumstances, improve welfare
(Loertscher and Marx, 2019a). Since the magnitude of the price change from an upstream
merger may be affected by countervailing buyer leverage and forecasting the price conse-
quences of a combination is central to merger analysis, the extent of countervailing power
should enter into the competitive evaluation of an upstream merger. However, antitrust
policy is opaque as to whether and how to incorporate countervailing power in the merger
analysis of input products.3 Influential antitrust academics have also argued that countervail-
ing power should not be given much weight in the competitive analysis, with the justification
that more competition is generally good (Baker et al., 2008). In other words, "two wrongs
don't make a right."
    This paper uses novel and detailed data from the healthcare sector to examine whether
downstream monopsony power does indeed limit upstream market power. We focus on

                                              1
hospitals (upstream firms) in their price negotiations with insurers (downstream firms) and
study how the impact of hospital competition in affecting prices varies based on insurer
market concentration, using a national multi-year dataset of transaction prices.
   Healthcare is a particularly important sector for which to consider countervailing power.
For the commercially insured population, access to hospitals (which may compete in con-
centrated markets) is intermediated by insurers. Bilateral negotiations determine the prices
that commercial insurers pay hospitals. The bargaining positions of both hospitals and insur-
ers influence negotiated prices, with insurers serving as a potential source of countervailing
bargaining power to hospitals and other medical providers. As healthcare accounts for a
large (18%) and growing share of GDP, countervailing market power in this sector can have
significant welfare consequences.
   Our data are from the Health Care Cost Institute (HCCI). They include transaction-
level information from millions of hospital claims at thousands of hospitals from three large
insurers over the period 2011-14. We observe the actual prices that insurers paid to hospitals
for each inpatient encounter. We estimate the relationship between hospital prices and
hospital bargaining leverage and document how this relationship varies across analysis areas,
defined by a plan type and focal metropolitan area. We then evaluate whether insurers in
concentrated areas leverage countervailing power to lower hospital prices.
   Our estimation proceeds in three steps. First, we recover patient preferences by estimat-
ing a flexible choice model (Raval et al., 2017) and use our estimates to calculate willingness
to pay per person (WTPPP) for each hospital-level observation. Second, separately by anal-
ysis area, we regress price on hospital bargaining leverage as measured by WTPPP and
cost shifters. The principal output is the constant and WTPPP slope coefficients for each
analysis area.4 Third, we regress these constant and slope WTPPP coefficients on insurer
concentration.5 Together, these regressions allow us to measure how insurer concentration
affects hospital prices on average and also whether insurer concentration counterbalances
hospital bargaining leverage in its pricing impact.


                                              2
   Findings. We obtain two main findings. First, consistent with the literature, we find
that a higher WTPPP leads to higher prices across the majority of analysis areas. Moving
WTPPP from its 25th to 75th percentile increases prices by approximately $538 or 4.6% of
the sample hospital mean price, at the median level of insurer concentration. We estimate
substantial heterogeneity in this effect across our analysis areas. In 83 of the 111 areas,
WTPPP is positively associated with prices, with statistical significance at the 5% level in
37 areas. In the remaining 28 areas, the coefficient is negative. It is statistically significant
in 4 of these 28 areas.
   Second, we find that an increase in insurer HHI predicts a lower impact of WTPPP
on price. That is, when the insurance market structure is more concentrated, hospital
systems with higher WTPPP are relatively less able to translate that bargaining leverage
into higher prices than hospital systems with lower bargaining leverage. Specifically, moving
from the 25th to 75th percentile of WTPPP increases prices 7.1% at the 25th percentile
of insurer concentration, but only by 1.5% at the 75th percentile of insurer concentration.
Similarly, a typical hypothetical merger--which increases WTPPP 14.4% (Garmon, 2017)--
would increase the mean hospital price by 4.3% at the 25th percentile of insurer concentration
but only by 0.97% at the 75th percentile of insurer concentration. These findings show the
importance and presence of countervailing market power: on average, hospital mergers will
have a greater price impact in markets where insurer market structure is less concentrated.
   Relation to literature. Our paper primarily relates to two empirical literatures. First,
a literature has evaluated the impact of monopsony power in the healthcare sector (Feldman
and Greenberg, 1981; Melnick et al., 1992; Sorensen, 2003; Ellison and Snyder, 2010; Moriya
et al., 2010; Dafny et al., 2012; McKellar et al., 2014; Scheffler and Arnold, 2017). A common
finding is that larger insurers and insurers in more concentrated markets obtain lower hospital
prices. We add to this literature by examining how countervailing insurer market power
affects the impact of hospital mergers on prices. Countervailing market power concerns the
interaction of hospital and insurer market power and is distinct from an examination of


                                               3
either hospital or insurer market power.
    Second, a different literature has estimated bargaining leverage from hospital choice data
and used these estimates to evaluate the price impacts of mergers (Town and Vistnes, 2001;
Capps et al., 2003). This literature formalized the idea that WTPPP measures hospital bar-
gaining leverage. Gowrisankaran et al. (2015) and Ho and Lee (2017) developed empirical
equilibrium models with oligopolistic insurers and hospitals bargaining over prices. Using
these methods, Garmon (2017) finds that the impact of an increase in WTPPP on prices
varies across hospital mergers, and a survey article by Gaynor et al. (2015) finds that mergers
between hospitals tend to increase prices, but with heterogeneous effects across market set-
tings, hospitals, and insurers.6 We build on this literature through our use of national data
with transaction prices and variation across analysis areas in insurer and hospital bargaining
leverage. These national data allow us to examine the impact of WTPPP on prices across
many markets, which allows us to understand the impact of countervailing market power.
In particular, we assess whether insurers in more concentrated areas prevent hospitals with
high WTPPP from exercising their leverage.



2     Empirical Framework

2.1     Theoretical background

Our empirical specification is motivated by a simple bilateral bargaining game between an
insurer and a hospital system. This framework is similar to Chipty and Snyder (1999);
Capps et al. (2003); Gowrisankaran et al. (2015); Ho and Lee (2017). On-line Appendix A1
describes the relation of our empirical framework to the existing literature.
    Consider a market with m = 1, . . . M insurers, s = 1, . . . , S hospital systems, j = 1, . . . , J
hospitals, and i = 1, . . . , I individuals. Let Js denote the set of hospitals in system s and
let Nm denote insurer m's hospital network.
    The game has two stages. In the first stage, insurers and hospital systems negotiate over


                                                   4
the transfer payments paid to hospitals. In the second stage, some enrollees become sick and
obtain hospital care. The insurer's payoff (at the first stage) from reaching an agreement
with hospital system s is given by:


                             Vm (s, Nm ) = m (Nm ) - m (Nm \ Js ),


where m (Nm ) is the gross profit that the insurer achieves with all agreements and m (Nm \
Js ) is the gross profit the insurer earns in the absence of an agreement with system s.
   We assume that when an enrollee needs inpatient hospitalization, she seeks care at the
in-network hospital that yields the highest utility. Let qjm be the expected number of insurer
m's patients that seek care at each hospital j when in-network (where the expectation is
taken at the first stage of the model) and mcj be hospital j 's constant marginal cost. For
simplicity, if no agreement is reached between the hospital system and the insurer, the
hospital system does not treat any of the insurer's enrollees. Thus, the net value to hospital
system s for reaching an agreement with insurer m is Rsm -      j Js   mcj qjm , where Rsm is the
negotiated fixed transfer.
   The transfer price is determined by "Nash-in-Nash" bargaining. Namely, each bilateral
negotiation solves the Nash bargaining solution, embedded inside a Nash equilibrium where
the parties to each negotiation treat the outcomes of other negotiations as fixed.7 The Nash
bargaining solution selects the transfer that maximizes the (weighted) product of the surplus
from trade relative to the alternative of no trade. We write:


                   
                  Rsm = arg max(Vm (s, Nm ) - r)1-sm (r -          mcj qjm )sm
                                r
                                                            j Js



where sm  [0, 1], s, m are the Nash bargaining weights, which capture the relative bar-
gaining power of the two parties. A value of sm = 0 gives all the weight to the insurer, while
sm = 1 gives all the bargaining power to the hospital system. Solving this optimization
problem and dividing by the expected quantity yields the per-treatment transfer price for

                                              5
each hospital system:

                                                          mcj qjm
                            Rsm                       j Js             Vm (j, Nm )
               psm =                = (1 - sm )                   + sm             .      (1)
                           j Js qjm                     j Js qjm         j Js qjm



The first term on the right side of (1) is the weighted average marginal cost of the hospital
system, multiplied by 1 - sm . This marginal cost is the threat point (or value without a
contract) of the system. When sm = 0 (i.e., the insurer has all the bargaining power) the
negotiated price will equal this cost: even when the insurer has all the power, the hospital
system will not accept less than marginal cost. The second term is the gross insurer surplus
from the trade, multiplied by sm . The insurer will not agree to pay more than this surplus.
Therefore, this is what it gets paid when the hospital system has all the bargaining power.
For   (0, 1), negotiations result in a weighted average of these two extremes, where the
weights depend on the relative bargaining power.
   To compute Vm (s, Nm ), we would need detailed data on plan enrollment, premiums, and
employer contributions, which we do not have. Instead, we follow the literature in proxying
for Vm (s, Nm ) with costs and an estimate of the average willingness-to-pay that a given
hospital system contributes to a network (Capps et al., 2003). The idea is that, within
a market, higher WTPPP and lower cost hospitals increase insurer profits, all else equal.
Specifically, we assume:


                            Vm (s, Nm )
                                        =  c +  w W T P P Psm + esm ,                     (2)
                              j Js q jm


where W T P P Psm is the expected per-capita consumer surplus that hospital system s con-
tributes to the insurer's network and the residual, esm , is i.i.d. mean zero.
   Substituting (2) into (1), we obtain:


                                j Jsmcj qjm
           psm = (1 - sm )                  + sm  c + sm  w W T P P Psm + sm esm .        (3)
                                  j Js qjm




                                                  6
Our empirical specification is based on (3). The regressors of interest in (3) are WTPPP
and the constant term. We estimate this equation separately for each analysis area because
 c and  w (which approximate a reduced form of the underlying bargaining relation) may
differ across analysis areas due to variation in countervailing market power. For instance,  w
will likely be lower in areas with higher countervailing market power, since insurers will then
be able to extract more surplus from high WTPPP hospitals--as they will lose relatively
few enrollees from exclusion in these areas--while prices for low WTPPP hospitals will
remain relatively similar--since those hospitals were not getting much surplus even without
countervailing market power.


2.2    Estimation

Our empirical strategy proceeds in three steps.
   Step 1: Estimation of hospital choices. We estimate a hospital choice model using
the semi-parametric method of Raval et al. (2017). This approach assumes that patients
with similar characteristics have the same choice probabilities for each hospital. We start by
grouping admissions together based on them having similar characteristics and calculating
choice probabilities for groups that are bigger than a size threshold. We then iteratively
remove a characteristic and regroup observations with the smaller set of characteristics,
calculating choice probabilities for the new groups that are above the size threshold. We
repeat this process until we have assigned choice probabilities for every admission.
   We follow Raval et al. (2017) and use a size threshold of 25 and 9 patient characteristics
(patient county, ZIP code, major diagnostic category, emergency admit indicator, diagnosis-
related group (DRG) type--medical or surgical, DRG weight quartile, DRG, age group, gen-
der), removing the latter characteristics first. Using standard formulas, we obtain WTPPP
from our estimates. On-line Appendix A2 provides details.




                                              7
   Step 2: Regressions of price on WTPPP. We estimate an empirical analog of (3):


                                c   w
                          pah = a + a W T P P Pah + x xah + ah ,                           (4)


where observations are indexed by analysis area a--which includes the focal metropolitan
area and plan type--and hospital/year h. Our measure of plan type indicates whether a
claim is from a PPO or a POS plan. W T P P Pah indicates the willingness to pay per person
for the hospital system that owns hospital h in analysis area a. While it is now indexed by
hospital instead of by system and insurer as in (3), it still indicates the willingness to pay
for the entire hospital system.8
   The vector of hospital cost shifters, xah , includes year fixed effects, indicators for a
hospital's teaching status, for-profit status, and rural location, logarithm of number of beds,
full time equivalent residents, and the percent discharges from Medicare and Medicaid. The
unobservable is ah . We weight specifications by HCCI hospital admissions, and cluster
standard errors by hospital system.
                                             c      w
   We estimate the national distribution of ^a and ^a by estimating a separate regression
for each analysis area--which amounts to 111 regressions in all. Differences across analysis
areas provide variation in insurer concentration and hence in insurer bargaining leverage.
   Step 3: Regressions of insurer HHI (IHHI) on analysis area coefficients. In
order to measure the impact of insurer concentration, we estimate two separate specifica-
tions. The dependent variable in each regression is the estimated coefficients for the 111
                                                        c      w
different step 2 regressions. Specifically, we regress ^a and ^a on IHHI controlling for area
characteristics. Our empirical model uses the parameter estimates from (4) as the dependent
variable:


             c
            ^a =  I,c IHHIa +  z,c za + a
                                        c
                                            and     w
                                                   ^a =  I,w IHHIa +  z,w za + a
                                                                               w
                                                                                 .         (5)


Our coefficients of interest are  I,c and  I,w , which measure the impact of IHHI on the terms


                                              8
estimated in (4). The controls za capture factors that may affect prices and bargaining
leverage. They include a constant, plan type, hospital utilization (bed days utilized within
the analysis area), percent of total population uninsured, and percent of population with
income below 200% of the Federal Poverty Level. We pool all data used in the regressions
across years.



3     Data and Identification

Our analysis primarily relies on the Health Care Cost Institute commercial health insurance
claims database, from 2011 through 2014. This database combines administrative claims
from three large, national commercial insurers, Aetna, Humana, and UnitedHealthcare. It
includes information for approximately 40 million individuals under 65 years of age enrolled
in employer-sponsored health insurance (ESI). The database is unique in its large scope and
the fact that it includes "allowed payments" which are the actual transaction-level payments
made from the insurer to the provider. These payments are determined through negotiations
between the insurers and providers. A limitation of the database is that it does not allow us
to infer which claim is from which insurer.
    We limit our HCCI analysis sample to individuals with either a POS or PPO plan type.
These two plan types account for between 80% and 84% of the ESI enrollment in the HCCI
database in each year of the study.9 The data do not indicate the network for each plan. We
implicitly infer the network for a given plan type and analysis area based on the presence
of sufficient claims. Since we cannot differentiate variation in networks across insurers, this
may lead to some measurement error. However, the participating HCCI insurers have broad
and similar networks. For our sample in 2014--the year that HCCI first included an out-of-
network indicator--fewer than 1% of admissions were for out-of-network hospitals, consistent
with other studies on large insurers (Cooper et al., 2020). Thus, we believe that the extent
of the measurement error is small.



                                              9
   Additionally, we exclude claims with erroneous or incomplete data, such as missing DRG
codes, unclassifiable DRG codes (998 or 999), or allowed payments with negative, zero, or
unrealistically low dollar amounts. Low payment amounts are evidence of incomplete claims
or coordination of benefit payments and likely do not represent actual prices.
   We also limit our claims data to facility claims for inpatient admissions to a general
acute care (GAC) hospital. Following previous studies, we exclude claims at GAC hospi-
tals for non-GAC type admissions, admissions for newborns (but not their mothers), and
transfers because there is very limited or no choice of hospital for these types of admission
(Gowrisankaran et al., 2015). We perform our estimation separately by focal Core-Based
Statistical Area (CBSA) but allow our sample of hospitals and patients to extend outside
the focal CBSA to capture accurately patient volume and the relevant set of hospital choices.
On-Line Appendix A3 provides details on the sample construction by analysis area.
   We supplement the HCCI data with with five other data sources. First, we use hospi-
tal socioeconomic measures at the CBSA level from the U.S. Census, employing state-level
information for observations outside of a metropolitan CBSA. Second, we use hospital charac-
teristics from the American Hospital Association Annual Survey. Third, we use CBSA-level
measures of insurer concentration culled from the American Medical Association's (AMA)
Competition in Health Insurance: A Comprehensive Study of U.S. Markets reports from
2011-2014. Fourth, we use hospital-level data on the percentage of the population without
health insurance (uninsured) and the percentage of the population with incomes below 200
percent of the Federal Poverty Limit (FPL), from the Small Area Health Insurance Estimates
Program. Finally, we use a measure of hospital utilization based on the total inpatient bed
days occupied divided by the possible beds days (number of hospital beds × 365), from the
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Hospital Cost Reporting Information System data.
   Hospital Prices. For each hospital and each year, we create a severity-adjusted mean
hospital price. This price accounts for the differences in the resources necessary to treat
heterogeneous patients. Using patient-level observations, we first calculate a resource-use-


                                             10
adjusted payment by dividing the allowed payment by the corresponding Medicare MS-
DRG weight. Then, we regress resource-use-adjusted payments on patient characteristics
(age category, gender, age-gender interactions, and length of hospital stay) and a set of
hospital dummy variables. We use the patient characteristics coefficient estimates, evaluated
at the mean of the population, and the hospital-specific coefficient estimates to calculate
the severity-adjusted average price for every hospital. Our approach here is similar to the
methods used by Gowrisankaran et al. (2015) and Cooper et al. (2018). We calculate the
severity-adjusted mean hospital prices separately by plan type and year.
   Insurer Concentration.        We measure insurer market structure using the insurer
Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (IHHI) reported in the AMA reports. The AMA acquires these
data from Decision Resources Group Managed Market Survey. Decision Resources Group
collects commercial medical enrollment data from managed care organizations through the
Decision Resources Group National Medical and Pharmacy Census. Health insurers are
asked for their national, state, and county level enrollment for each plan type and funding
type (e.g., fully insured). The AMA data then report insurer HHI by plan type at the state
and CBSA levels. We define a hospital's IHHI based on the CBSA in which it is located, or
the state for hospitals not located in a CBSA. We use the mean of IHHI across hospitals in
the analysis area as our measure of insurer countervailing market power.
   An insurer in HCCI's sample is the largest or second largest PPO plan in all but 3 areas,
and is also the largest or second-largest POS plan in the majority of areas. A potential issue
is that HCCI data do not include Blue Cross plans, which is the largest group of health
insurers nationwide. Despite the exclusion of Blue Cross, we believe that the sizable market
shares of the insurers that we have allows us to obtain informative results on monopsony
power. Specifically, even in areas where an HCCI insurer is only the second-largest insurer,
under many economic theories of competition, it will price similarly to the largest insurer in
order to partially exploit the monopsony power present in the market.
   Identification. As is common in the literature (see, e.g., Gowrisankaran et al., 2015;


                                             11
Garmon, 2017; Ho and Lee, 2017), we identify the impact of hospital bargaining leverage
from cross-sectional IHHI variation in WTPPP within an analysis area. An alternative
identification strategy would rely on changes over time in hospital market structure caused
by horizontal mergers. Using HCCI data (from earlier years), Cooper et al. (2018) show that
pricing models identified from cross-sectional variation yield similar results to those relying
on hospital mergers. We also identify the effects of insurer concentration at the CBSA level
from cross-sectional variation that we assume to be exogenous. This is a common way to
identify the impact of insurer concentration (Moriya et al., 2010; Melnick et al., 2011; Trish
and Herring, 2015; Ho and Lee, 2017; Roberts et al., 2017). During our time frame there
are an insufficient number of insurer mergers to generate meaningful changes in insurer
concentration. Thus, given that our data is national in scope with significant geographic
variation in IHHI, we believe this variation is the most credible source available to us.

Descriptive statistics of data. Table ?? presents descriptive statistics of our four-year
dataset. We analyze POS and PPO plans separately, to allow for the possibility that bar-
gaining leverage and market structure differ across plan type. Our analysis data include 89
POS analysis areas and 22 PPO analysis areas, and account for over 2.25 million unique
hospital admissions. Ninety percent of the admissions in our data are among POS plan
members.10

   Step 1: Hospital choices. Table A1 in On-line Appendix A4 presents summary statis-
tics on the explanatory variables used in our Step 1 estimation.11 We predicted the largest
number of groups using ZIP code and county; the second largest number using major di-
agnostic category, emergency admittance, and the above two characteristics; and the third
largest number using all 9 characteristics.
   Table ?? provides summary statistics on WTPPP, the output of Step 1. Although there
are many fewer hospitals per analysis area in the PPO sample than in the POS sample,
WTPPP is reasonably similar across the samples, at 1.27 and 1.20, respectively. As a point
of reference, if each hospital in a market provided the same mean utility to each patient, and
a system controlled one-third of the hospitals, the system's WTPPP would be 1.22.12 Insurer
HHI is also similar across the samples, at .482 and .393, respectively. Both IHHI means are
over the regulatory threshold of .250 to be considered "highly concentrated" (Federal Trade
Commission and Department of Justice, 2010).
   Step 2: Impact of WTPPP on prices across analysis areas. We regress WTPPP
on severity-adjusted mean hospital prices controlling for hospital cost shifters, as described
                                                            c
in Section 2.2. The constant terms from these regressions, ^a , capture the mean price levels
in the analysis areas controlling for hospital cost shifters and WTPPP. Across the 89 POS


                                              14
geographic areas, the constant terms range from -21,780 to 22,870. The range of the 22
PPO constant coefficients is -10,853 to 24,271. Figure A1 in On-line Appendix A4 graphs
the distribution of the constant coefficients (and 95 percent confidence intervals) ordered
from lowest to highest.
   The mean and standard deviation of the constant terms over all 111 analysis areas is
9,356 and 6,724, respectively. Among the 20 analysis areas with the same index geographic
area for both plan types, the correlation between the constant terms is 0.565. This vari-
ability in hospital price levels across areas and plan types is consistent with the significant
heterogeneity in private health insurance hospital prices that have been documented else-
where (Cooper et al., 2018). However, to our knowledge, these estimates are the first that
specifically control for hospital bargaining leverage through WTPPP.
                                                   w
   The coefficient on WTPPP in these regressions, ^a , captures the impact of changes in
WTPPP on hospital prices for that analysis area. Figure ?? shows the distribution of the
coefficient estimates, ordered from lowest to highest from each of the regressions, and 95
percent confidence intervals. There is substantial heterogeneity in the impact of WTPPP
on hospital prices across analysis areas. Among the POS geographic areas, the WTPPP
coefficient estimates range from -5,927 to 11,845, while they range from -4,889 to 6,295
across the PPO geographic areas. The correlation between WTPPP coefficients for analysis
areas with the same index geographic area across plan types is 0.619. The mean of the 111
estimates is 1,531 (SD 3,252); 83 of the estimates are positive with a mean of 2,888 (SD
2,449). Of the 83 positive estimates, 37 are statistically significant at the 5 percent level.
There are also 4 negative coefficient estimates that are statistically significant. While this
may be due simply to random variation, Easterbrook et al. (2019) show that higher WTPPP
may lead to lower prices when, for instance, hospitals are complements to insurers.
   The majority of the significant coefficients are in the upper third of the distribution
of parameter estimates. Since most of the insignificant coefficients have point estimates
relatively close to 0, this suggests that the lack of significance in these analysis areas is driven


                                                15
by the coefficient being relatively close to 0 rather than to a differential lack of statistical
precision.

   Step 3: Impact of IHHI on analysis area coefficients. Table ?? displays results
from specifications where we regress the area constant term and WTPPP coefficient estimates
on IHHI. The constant term regressions, in columns 1 and 2, indicate  I,c , the impact
of insurer HHI on prices not considering WTPPP. These results are positive, though not
statistically significant.
   The WTPPP coefficients, in columns 3 and 4, indicate  I,w , the extent to which increases
in IHHI are associated with changes in the impact of hospital concentration on hospital
prices.13 These coefficients are negative and statistically significant at the 5% level, are
robust to the inclusion of additional controls, to alternative functional forms, and to stratifi-

                                                                  16
cation based on Blue Cross and HCCI insurer shares.14 The negative coefficients imply that
increased insurer concentration diminishes the impact of a hospital's bargaining position on
hospital prices. Said somewhat differently, the heterogeneity across markets in the impact
of a hospital system's bargaining position on prices is partly explained by insurer market
concentration.

   We now present graphical evidence to further display our findings of the impact of hospi-
tal bargaining leverage and insurer concentration on hospital prices. Figure ?? shows mean

                                                17
hospital prices by WTPPP for the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles of IHHI (with the infor-
mation in table form in Table A5 in On-line Appendix A4). The prices cross at a WTPPP
of 1.33 and a corresponding price of $12,240. This is slightly higher than our sample median
WTPPP of 1.22. At the median IHHI level, the mean hospital price would increase by $538
following WTPPP increasing from its 25th to 75th sample percentile, corresponding to a
4.6% increase in price.
   This effect is much higher at the 25th percentile of IHHI. In these markets with low
insurer concentration, prices increase by $822 (7.1%) with this WTPPP increase. Finally,
the effect is much smaller at the 75th percentile of IHHI. In these markets with this high
insurer concentration, this increase in WTPPP would increases prices by only $186 (1.5%).

Note: The graph shows the predicted average hospital-level price over the range of WTPPPs
for the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles of area-level IHHI in our sample. The 25th, 50th,

percentiles are 0.3654, 0.4430, 0.5386, respectively.

    These numbers suggest that countervailing market power from insurers is potentially
important. However, a relevant question is how much this force would constrain the likely
impact of price increases for real-world hospital mergers. To address this point, Figure ??
shows the range in percentage changes in expected hospital prices that are likely to occur
from a typical hospital merger, but across analysis areas with different levels of countervailing
market power. Specifically, we use the mean WTPPP from our sample, 1.26, as the baseline
and assume a hypothetical merger increases the WTPPP by 14.4%, the mean percentage
change in WTPPP from the 23 hospital mergers reported in Garmon (2017). We then
investigate the expected change in prices that would result from this merger across IHHI
percentiles of 25, 50, and 75.
    We find that this hypothetical merger would increase the mean hospital price by 4.3% if
insurer concentration were at the 25th percentile and by 2.8% at the median IHHI. At the
75th percentile IHHI, the merger would increases prices by only 0.97%. These figures do
not account for any changes in cost structure that might result from the merger and affect
prices. Our results suggest that a policy that only examines the change in WTPPP from
a hospital merger, without considering factors such as countervailing market power, would
not correctly predict the price impact of the merger.
    Overall, Figures ?? and ?? show that insurer HHI is an important predictor of the impact
of hospital competition on prices. Equivalently, IHHI is an important predictor of whether a
hospital merger is likely to raise prices or whether countervailing market power will restrain
this potential price increase.



5     Conclusion

Academics and policy makers have been concerned about increases in market concentration,
including the interaction of market power by suppliers and buyers. In particular, buyer
market power can provide a countervailing force that restricts the ability of concentrated

sellers to raise prices (Galbraith, 1952).
   We investigate countervailing market power in the hospital sector. This is a particularly
important sector for which to understand countervailing market power, given the size of the
sector, the levels of concentration on both sides of the market, and the fact that prices are
determined by negotiation. We use a novel dataset from HCCI, that is national in scope
and has claims information from thousands of hospitals, to understand how the interaction
of hospital market power and insurer concentration affects market prices. We find wide
variation in the impact of hospital bargaining leverage (which measures hospital market
power) on hospital prices. In concentrated insurer markets, hospital bargaining leverage has
a much smaller impact on hospital prices than in unconcentrated markets.
   In sum, we find evidence in favor of the countervailing market power hypothesis. This

conclusion has meaningful policy implications. Specifically, increases in hospital concentra-
tion due to mergers may lead to significant price increases in some analysis areas while the
same increase in concentration in other areas may have a limited impact on prices. Poli-
cymakers may not be able to infer accurately the price impact of a potential merger from
its resulting increase in WTPPP without considering characteristics specific to the analysis
area such as insurer concentration. This, in turn, suggests that optimal antitrust policy
should actively account for insurer countervailing market power when evaluating the impact
of hospital mergers.
   Our study has several limitations. Most importantly, we do not observe plan premiums.
For this reason, we cannot identify the extent to which costs from higher hospital prices are
passed on to consumers. Identification derives from variation across analysis areas in insurer
market structure. We also cannot distinguish the three insurers from one another in our
data. In addition, the HCCI dataset is not the universe of commercial insurers and excludes
Blue Cross plans during our sample period. Thus, the results may not generalize to other
commercial insurers or other insured populations (e.g. Medicare or Medicaid). Nonetheless,
our results add value in that they provide evidence that countervailing market power may
be important in hospital markets.

       Hemphill and Rose (2017) discuss general antitrust concerns with monopsony power

       For example, the Federal Trade Commission and Department of Justice's Horizontal
Merger Guidelines are silent on buyer monopsony power in antitrust market definition, and
market definition is a cornerstone of antitrust analysis. In FTC v. Sanford Health et al.
(D.N.D. 2017), the district court found that monopsony power should not be considered
as part of the market definition process, but the appellate court considered the "dominant
buyer" hypothesis (FTC v. Sanford Health et al., 8th Cir. 2019).

       Bilateral bargaining models (Town and Vistnes, 2001; Capps et al., 2003) motivate this

(IHHI).

   6
       Dafny et al. (2012) find that insurance premiums were lower in markets with higher
insurance concentration. Trish and Herring (2015) find that insurance premiums are lower
in markets with higher insurer concentration and higher in markets with higher hospital
market concentration. We do not consider health insurance premiums in this study.

       We exclude claims from Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) and Exclusive Provider

       We derive this figure as the WTP for each individual for the system, which is ln(3/(3-1)),
divided by the expected probability that the individual seeks treatment at this system, which
is 1/3.

  13
       Individually-owned hospitals with very little bargaining leverage will have WTPPP of
approximately 1. Combining the coefficients on the constant term and WTPPP, the impact
on prices for these hospitals of moving IHHI from 0 to 1 is imprecisely estimated but positive

A1      Relation of empirical framework to literature

We estimate empirical specifications that we motivate with a bargaining game. We now com-
pare our framework to the existing literature on hospital bargaining, focusing on Gowrisankaran
et al. (2015), or GNT for short.
   GNT estimated parameters for one area (Northern Virginia) with four insurers that
operate in that area. They observed the insurer for each discharge in their sample and
observed data that allowed them to infer coinsurance rates.
   We estimate parameters across many analysis areas nationally, with three insurers that
operate in these different areas. Our claims data are combined across insurers and hence we
do not observe the insurer for each admission in our sample. We also did not use coinsurance
data because they were very noisy and coinsurance frequently equaled 0 in our sample.
   In a first stage, GNT estimated the price elasticity from the patient choice model, by
including as a regressor the individual's out-of-pocket price. Our Step 1 is the analog of
GNT's first stage. However, our Step 1 does not include out-of-pocket price as a regressor
because of the noisy coinsurance data. Our patient choice model also uses more modern
semi-parametric methods than were used by GNT (Raval et al., 2017).
   In a second stage, GNT estimated bargaining weights, marginal costs, and a parameter
that weights WTP relative to costs in insurers' objective functions, using a GMM framework
that matches observed to predicted marginal costs. Our step 2 is the analog of GNT's second
stage. We do not recover bargaining weights and these other parameters but instead recover
the variation in the relationship between WTPPP and price across markets, which is a
function of multiple structural parameters.
   We have three principal reasons why we decided not to structurally estimate bargaining
weights or separate them from other parameters. First, it would be more difficult here than



                                              A1
in GNT to identify the bargaining weights since we lack usable coinsurance data. Second,
we could not identify bargaining weights by insurer/hospital pair given that we cannot
identify insurer identities. Third, understanding the extent to which countervailing market
power across markets increased insurers' relative bargaining power would require estimating
a model of insurer competition and we lack data on insurer premiums, shares, and identities
that would be necessary to identify such a model. In contrast, Ho and Lee (2017) estimate a
model of insurance demand using data on insurance choices and prices for CalPERS enrollees
across California and use it in a bargaining framework.
   Finally, note that GNT model insurers as valuing enrollee WTP net of costs (in GNT,
equation 6, for instance), while we model insurers as valuing profits. GNT did not model
competition between insurers and hence they did not directly estimate how profits would
change with changes in costs. We assume that insurers compete with each other. Specifically,
our profit function m captures the fact that if the insurer offers a product with low WTPPP,
it will lose enrollees and, through that, have lower profits. Our empirical specification then
models insurer surplus as a function of WTPPP and costs. Thus, our model captures the
same features as GNT, but with a different functional form. Unlike GNT, we require a model
of competition between insurers, because this competition is the source of countervailing
market power.



A2      WTPPP Construction

We construct W T P P Pah by estimating patient utility parameters and then simulating
changes in values from removing hospital systems. Specifically, denote patient i's utility
uij from choosing hospital j for her inpatient stay as:


                                       uij = ij + ij ,                                   (A1)




                                             A2
where uij is a function of the mean utility, ij , which depends on interactions of patient
and hospital characteristics, including travel costs between patient i and hospital j ; and an
unobservable ij , which is i.i.d. and distributed type I extreme value.
   We estimate ij using the semi-parametric estimator of Raval et al. (2017). The method
estimates the probability that each patient i seeks care at hospital j in system s, based on
the observable characteristics of the patient and hospital. We denote this probability probij .
   Following Capps et al. (2003), we then calculate W T P P Pah from these probabilities as:

                                            I
                                        -   i=1   log(1 -   kJs   probik )
                        W T P P Pah =             I
                                                                             .            (A2)
                                                  i=1   kJs probik


where h is the hospital-year for hospital j , the sum is over patients i in that analysis area
and year, and Js is the set of hospitals in system s.15 In (A2), the numerator is the sum of
the loss in utility from dropping hospital system s across patients while the denominator is
the sum of the total expected quantity for hospitals in the system.



A3      Sample Construction by Analysis Area

We perform our estimation of Steps 1 and 2 separately by analysis area. Each analysis area
corresponds to an index CBSA and a plan type of POS or PPO, with an average of 1,000 or
more admissions per year in the HCCI data. We define analysis areas that are intentionally
broad in order to capture accurately patient volume and the relevant set of hospital choices.
   We construct the set of hospitals and patients for each analysis area as follows. We first
include all hospitals with at least 25 admissions from the index CBSA and more than 10
beds. We then include all patient admissions with ZIP codes with eligible admissions with
admissions to these hospitals that are within 150 miles of the hospital. Finally, we include
all hospitals with at least 25 admissions from this set of patients and more than 10 beds.
With this definition, hospitals in each analysis area may lie inside the index CBSA, outside
the index CBSA, and potentially in other CBSAs. Hospitals may also be in multiple analysis

areas for the same plan type.

  Notes: The categories used to create cells include: gender, age group, DRG, DRG
  weight quartile, DRG type, emergency admit indicator, major diagnostic category,
  ZIP code, county. Cells with 25 or more patients are used to calculate shares used in
  the WTP calculation. Cells with fewer than 25 patients are returned to sample, one
  characteristic is removed, and patients are assigned to cells based on the remaining
  characteristics. The process is repeated until all characteristics are removed. Charac-
  teristics are removed in the order noted, gender first, county last. Standard deviations
  are shown in parentheses.
