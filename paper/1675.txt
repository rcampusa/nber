                      Stopping Hyperinflation:
                  Lessons from the German Inflation
                       Experience of the 1920s


                                ABSTRACT




    The special role of money in the hyperinflation process, and

particularly in the stabilization phase, has now been reconsidered in a best-

selling essay by Sargent. The message is that credible fiscal stabilization

is the sine qua non of stopping inflation. This is definitely not viewed as

being in conflict with the monetary hypothesis, but it does represent a shift

of emphasis. We draw attention to a third aspect of the hyperinflation

process, and the stablization, namely exchange rate and interest rate policy.

Even though a government may accomplish all the right measures in terms of

budget stablization or control of money creation, there remains the problem

of making these measures credible and hence being able to actually achieve

them. We argue that exchange rate and interest rate policy in the transition

have traditionally formed the vehicle for establishing that credibility by a

de facto stablization. We make that point by discussing the events of the

German hyperinflation. In that case the stablization was a much more

diffuse, accidental matter than a reading of the classics reveals with

exchange rate policy playing a key role. Immensely high interest rates in

the face of a sharply appreciating free market exchange rate wiped out

adverse speculation thus helping to establish stablization. The real

exchange rate sharply appreciated in the final stage and persisted at an

appreciated level well into the post—stabilization phase. It reflects the

reverse of the coin of real depreciation in the capital flight phase.

     STOPPING HYPERINFLATION: LESSONS FROM THE GERMAN INFLATION
                      EXPERIENCE OF THE 1920s

   Hyperinflations are the laboratory of monetary economics. It is

said that under these extreme rates of depreciation all other

considerations that may in normal times obscure linkages between money

and prices emerge strongly and obviously, beyond discussion or

controversy. Stabilisation of inflation proceeds If and only when the

source of inflation, money creation, is brought under control. This is

the traditional view endorsed by Keynes (1923) and particularly

developed by Cagan (1956) in his classical essay on the German

hyperinflation. The special role of money in the hyperinflation

process, and particularly in the stabilisation phase, has now been

reconsidered in a best—selling essay by Sargent (1982). In Sargent's

work primary emphasis is placed on the budget stabilisation rather

than on money growth per se. Indeed, he draws attention, as other

authors had before, to the very large rates of monetary growth

following the actual stabilisation.

     Sargent's message is that credible fiscal stabilisation is the

sine qua non of stopping inflation. This is definitely not viewed as

being in conflict with the monetary hypothesis, but it does represent

a shift of emphasis. The two views are not strictly Identical because

we can imagine a budget deficit financed by domestic or external debt

finance in one case or money creation arising from creation of credit
                              2


to finance private spending. It is therefore useful to separate the

point of emphasis of the two hypotheses even though they overlap in

practice.

     In this essay we draw attention to a third aspect of the

hyperinflation process, and the stabilisation, namely exchange rate

and interest rate policy. We argue that even though a government may

accomplish all the right measures in terms of budget stabilisation or

control of money creation, there remains still the problem of making

these measures credible and hence being able to actually achieve them.

Since policies are not in fact exogeneous the issue of credibility is

paramount. We argue that exchange rate and interest rate policy in the

transition have traditionally formed the vehicle for establishing that

credibility by a de facto stabilisation. We make that point by

discussing the events of the German hyperinflatlon. The discussion

also reveals that the stabilisation was a much more diffuse,

accidental matter than a reading of the classics reveals with exchange

rate policy playing a key role. Immensely high interest rates in the

face of a sharply appreciating free market exchange rate wiped out

adverse speculation thus helping to establish stabilisatlon.

     The discussion also draws attention to the behavior of the real

exchange rate during stabilisation. The real exchange rate sharply

appreciated in the final stage and persisted at an appreciated level

well into the post—stabilisation phase. This may well have facilitated

the political economy of the stabilisatlon because of the implicit

rise in real wages. It reflects the reverse of the coin of real

depreciation in the capital flight phase.

initial Conditions

     in the immediate aftermath of World War I Central Europe

resembled Latin America of the past twenty years: political turmoil

mixed with economic inequality, precarious democracy and financial

instability. Although the German hyperinflation stands out, problems

of high inflation or even hyperinflation prevailed In many countries,

including Russia, Austria, Poland, and Czechoslovakia. In fact, it is

doubtful that there was any country at all that escaped altogether a

significant increase in prices during World War I. The main difference

is how various countries coped with the subsequent stabilisation

effort.

     It is interesting to start our analysis well before the

hyperinflation got underway and compare Germany with other major

countries. Table 1 offers a comparison focussing on the price level

and the dollar exchange rate. The benchmark is the United States and

the comparison countries are France and the U.K.

     The central point emerging from Table 1 Is the large war-time

price increase everywhere, including the U.S. In the war years prices

more than doubled in the U.S. and in the U.K. In Germany and France

the increases were much larger, more than 300 percent and nearly 400.

But In this respect Germany was not much different from France.

Note: P denotes the Wholessale Price Index, e the index of the local
currency price of the U.S. dollar.



       The large change, of course, occurs in 1921: The U.S. and the

U.K. experience a sharp deflation as prices decline nearly 50 percent,

in France prices fall less than 40 percent and in Germany they

increase by a factor of 23 or 2300 percent. The U.K. returned to gold

at the prewar par in 1925. France stabilized in 1926-28 wIth a large

depreciation and a much higher level of prices, seven times the 1914

level. Germany by contrast underwent a hyperinflatlon before prices

were stabilized in a new currency. Clearly one decisive point is 1921

when other countries moved to deflation while Germany went into

inflation.

       Germany emerged from World War I with significant losses of

territory and with a burden of reparations to be determined by an

Allied Commission. The immediate post—war years were overshadowed by

expectations of the reparation payments and by domestic political

turmoil. There were revolutions and revolts ranging from Soviet

Republics in various states, including Bavaria, to rightwing activity

 of the demilitarised professional army. It was said that $100 could

 buy you a minor revolution. Uncertainty about the political and

economic future is reflected in the erratic behavior of the exchange

rate (Mark/$ U.S.) shown in Figure 1.

     In the brief period from October 1919 (the Treaty of Versailles

had been concluded in June 1919) to March 1920 the price of the dollar

tripled. The depreciation was a reflection of the uncertainty in

Germany, but it fed back to prices and fuelled the turmoil.. The sharp

collapse in spring 1920 was one of the few points of potential return.

Several factors helped create a moment of stability. The Erzberger

fiscal measures strengthened the budget, the right—wing Kapp Putsch

had been suppressed, and many other countries perhaps did not look

that much better. But these improvements did not last, in part because

of a sharp deterioration in the external balance.

     A definite deterioration in the inflation outlook occurs in late

spring 1921 and relates to reparations. The terms fixed by the

Reparations Commission required Germany to pay 2 milliard gold marks

(2 billion in U.S. terminology) a year, plus 26 percent of German

exports in addition to occupation expenses. The London Ultimatum of

May 1921 required a front end payment of 1 milliard gold marks by

August 1921 in foreign exchange, and a second slice of 500 million

gold mark by November 15th of that year. The 1.5 milliard payment

amounts to about half of' total tax revenue. Using 1925 data a payment

of 2 inilliard gold mark plus 26 percent of exports would amount to

about 6 percent of GNP.

      Further complications of the political climate arose when the

League of Nations imposed the separation of Upper Silesia from

Germany. Germany's foreign policy in respect to reparations and other

peace terms was a "policy of fulfillment'. At least as a matter of

policy, If not in the full delivery, Germany sought to implement the

terms of the London ultimatum. While the 1921 payments were in fact

met in early 1922, Germany protested her inability to fulfill these

stiff terms and in June 1922 suspended all payments. The French and

Belgium troops in response occupied the Ruhr area. The occupation was

met by German "passive resistance", the financial costs of which

completely outstripped any chance of price stability.



The Hyperinflation

     The prelude to the hyperinflation is the first part of 1923 when,

In the face of the Ruhr occupation, the government attempts to

stabilize the exchange rate. Figure 2 shows the official dollar

exchange rate. Following the collapse in January, at the time of the

occupation, the rate recovers and is stabilized between mid-February

and mid-April. Inflation that had run at 28 and 89 percent per month

In December and January, rises to 111 percent in February and in

March. After the stabilisatlon of the exchange rate, there Is actual

deflation of 17 percent and only 7 percent inflation in April. As soon

as the exchange rate support is abandoned, because of huge reserve

losses, the hyperinflation gets underway.

     Table 2 shows the dollar exchange rate (paper mark per gold mark

as well as the monthly rate of depreciation and of inflation for the

critical period in 1923. During the Ruhr occupation in January and

February 1923. prices had doubled each month as did the dollar rate.

But in March and April there was a brief reprieve with falling prices

and currency appreciation. The episode is explained by significant

Reichsbank Intervention In the exchange market. By May inflation and

depreciation accelerate and for the rest of the year the German

economy disintegrates as inflation rates reach at the peak nearly

30,000 percent per month, or just above 20 percent per day. At 20

percent per day inflation, the price level doubles in less than four

days I

         The stories of life in the most dramatic stages of hyperinflation

 are well known. Keynes reports how people would order two beers at a

 time because the beer would grow warm and stale more slowly than the

 price was rising. Taxis were preferred to streetcars because you paid
                              8



at the end of the trip. Other accounts include stories on how firms

made payments of workers by furniture van. Schacht (1927) reports that

the demand for notes was so immense that 133 printing firms produced

notes for the government on more than 1783 machines with 30 paper

factories working full time for the government needs.

     In July the inflation rate was still 3.5 percent per day. In

August it rose to 6.5 percent per day, in September to 11.2 percent,

and finally to an average of 20.9 percent in November. In the final

stages of the inflation, prices and exchange rates became closely tied

because even weekly reports on the cost of living or wholesale prices

were far out of line with current developments. Quotations of the

exchange rate and thus of the gold mark became the central pillar for

calculating prices. The shift to gold mark or foreign exchange based

pricing led to a big upsurge in inflation via, the once and for all,

elimination of lags. Perhaps it is this shift to foreign exchange sed

pricing that Is the ultimate element in the shift toward

hyperinflation. Clearly, in September—November prices were changed

more than once a day, and ultimately all and any inertia disappeared

in a process that Pazos (l978,p.93) has described as follows:



             "The reduction of intervals [for setting wages and
          prices} to their shortest possible duration and the pegging
          of wage adjustments——both upward and downward—-to the freely
          fluctuating quotation of foreign currency give
          hyperinflation a mechanism different from that of
          intermediate inflation. The day to day adjustments of all
          contracts puts an end to all connections between the value
          of transactions in successive periods..."
                              9




The StabilisatlOn

     Elements of the stabilisatlon occurred even before the extreme

explosion got underway. Three pieces were particularly significant:

First, on the political front the Streseman government, formed in

August 1923, put an end to passive resistance in October. Second, an

"empowering law" was passed that allowed the government to pass

regulations and laws even suspending the constitution wherever the

national economic interest so required. Third, as early as August 1923

the government had issued a 500 million gold mark loan, in part in

small denominations. These bonds had started circulating and had come

to be accepted as hard currency even though they carried no backing

other than the governments promise to redeem in gold. Where the

political improvement offered the prospect of budget improvement the

acceptance of the gold mark bonds (for which convertibility in gold

was certainly not assured) had paved the way for a new monetary

instrument. In fact the gold mark loan bonds served as backing for

gold mark liabilities issued by municipalities and other government

bodies.

     Plans for stabilisation focussed on two alternatives: a Gold Bank

 or a Roggen (Rye) Bank. In the end the idea of a Roggen Bank won out,

 although in a somewhat different form, as the Renten (mortgage) Bank.

 The key institutional elements of the stabilisation were three:
                                  10



     *   Legislation   in mid-October introduced the Renten Bank as a

semi-public body with capital represented by fictious claims on

industry and land. The assets of the bank were to be claims on the

government and credit to the private sector. The total loans were not

to exceed 2400 millIon Renten or gold mark, half to the government

half to private borrowers. Of the government part 300 million were to

be set aside to retire the government floating debt held by the

Reichsbank.

     *   The liabilities of the Renten Bank were the Renten Mark. They

had a convertibility feature that linked them to the successful gold

mark loan: upon request 500 Renten Marks could be converted into a

bond having a nominal value of 500 gold marks, thus establishing the

1:1 link between the Renten Mark and the circulating gold mark loan

certificates. Because these certificates were accepted as hard

currency the convertibility linkage of the Renten Mark could readily

take advantage. But the Paper Mark remained legal tender, and the

Renten Mark had the only claim that it had to be accepted by

government bodies in payment.

     * The    same legislation instituted the rule that the Reichsbank

would no longer be entitled to discount government bills. Reichsbank

note issue had to be backed at least one-third by gold and the

remainder by commercial paper.

     On November 15th the Rentenbank came into operation and issue of

the Renten Mark started. Prior to the actual issue the government had

already issued at the end of October a small denomination gold mark
                              11



loan. The loan was issued to cope with the cash crisis, namely the

fact that the real money supply had declined to levels so low that the

payments mechanism had substantially collapsed. Queues at the

commercial banks and the Reichsbank trying to obtain paper money grew

longer and more and more of the demand for paper money went

unsatisfied. Depreciation and inflation wiped out the real value of

money much faster than the government, municipal authorities and

practically anyone could create paper money.

     Within a month price and exchange rate stability had been

restored. Extra taxation and the sharply increased real value of tax

collection in January 1924 and beyond eliminated fiscal difficulties

as a source of inflationary deficit finance. But there remained a

different threat, namely Reichsbank commercial lending. During

December 1923 and in early 1924 credit expanded so rapidly that a risk

of renewed inflation and depreciation in March 1923 had to be checked

by a credit crunch.

     One of' the striking features of the stabilisation that is often

emphasized is the comparative stability of prices and exchange rates

in the face of rapidly expanding money and credit. Between the date of

stabilisation, November 15th, and the end of the year Reichsbank

credit increased fourfold. Over the same period the quantity of

Reichsbank notes outstanding nearly doubled.



Why Did Stabilisation Succeeed ?

     There is no single obvious explanation for the successful
                                  12



stablilsation of the German currency. The standard explanations are

five, involving in each case a combination of a gain in confidence

based on one or more of the following fundamental factors:

     *
         monetary stabilisation via the discounting restraints imposed
on the Reichsbank and the Rentenbank.

     *   fiscal   stabilisation

     *
         exchange rate stabilisatlon
     *
         political   stabilisation through the end of passive resistance

and the appointment of an expert group of the Reparations Commission.

     *   the   reduction in the real value of money.

     The question of how stabilisation was achieved is not exactly the

same as that of why hyperinulation occurred in the first place. But

the latter question provides a good starting point. There are broadly

two schools of thought: One emphasizes the budget and money creation

as active sources of the hyperinflation. Adherents of this theory

would make exchange rate adjustments passively respond to the domestic

inflation developments along Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) lines. The

alternative theory is the balance of payments approach. This theory

claims that adverse balance of payments developments force exchange

depreciation which then deteriorates inflation and with that,

budgetary performance. In a setting of passive money, exchange rate

disturbances then cause inflation. Political disturbances fit in

either setting as the proximate sources of disruption. For the

monetary—fiscal approach they initiate deficit finance. For the

balance of payments approach reparation payments are the source of
                              13



extraordinary foreign exchange demands which force depreciation of the

currency which then spreads to domestic inflation and a widening of

the budget deficit.

     For either of these schools the consolidation of the political

events via an end of passive resistance and the improved prospect of

stabilisation loans was thus an important Ingredient. But beyond that

there are differences on what Is the essential element In gaining

stability.

     Sargent (1982, p.83) attributes the stabilisation to the

institutional limit on monetisation of deficits and the resulting need

for fiscal correction. The limit on government credit from the

Rentenbank and the prohibition of discounting of government debt by

the Reichsbank combined to separate completely deficit finance and the

monetary system. He notes that the government was forced into budget

balance and thus the objective conditions for inflation were removed

"by a series of deliberate, permanent actions to raise taxes and

eliminate expenditures." He refers In particular to the cuts in

employment in the public sector.

     The success of fiscal stabilisation is seen in the budget shown

in Table 3.

     Figure 3 shows the value of tax receipts in gold marks. The

figure makes apparent the erosion of tax revenue in the hyperlnflation

and the very rapid recovery of real revenue once price stability

returns.

     The monetary—fiscal view would certainly be reinforced by three

further facts. First, the change in personnel, when in December,

Schacht, a self—confessed gold standard man, becomes central banker

replacing Havenstein, who thought of the monetary problem as being

that printing could not proceed fast enough. Graham (1930) is quoted

by Yeager (1981, p.59) as writing of Havenstein's death "a demise

which cannot be thought of as other than opportune'.

     An institutionasi feature worth recording is the extreme

difficulty of putting Rentenbank notes into circulation: a printers

strike was taking place at the very time the Renten mark was to be

issued. As a result the printing was delayed and the note issue

proceeded very slowly. Accordingly, at no time in the early

stabilisation did the Renten mark lose in scarcity.

     Two further facts were the following: in November—December 1923

there was an outright credit crunch. The Reichsbank had ceased

discounting government paper, which had been the chief source of

credit expansion. The increase in circulation from the Rentenbank

issue and expansion of commercial credit by the Reichsbank were not

sufficient to keep up with the increase in real money demand. Interest

rates went sky high. Pfleiderer (1976, p.192) notes the following

interest rates on paper mark credits, following the stabilisatlon:
                                15




     November   21,1923    6% per day
     November   27        10%
     December   11         3%
     December   31         1%


The Reichsbarik maintained an interest rate of 90% per year (and daily

charges) until the end of January 1924. Since between November 20th

and the end of December prices were constant, or actually falling,

realized real interest rates were extremely high.

     A further factor, as already discussed above, was' the effective

implementation of the monetisation restriction: The Reichsbank was

prohibited from discounting government paper. When the Finance

Minister turned in December to the Renten Bank, he could not secure

credit and had instead to raise emergency taxes, anticipate taxes and

issue gold mark bonds.

     The monetary-fiscal stabilisation is, of course, a central part

of the stabilisation and indeed the fundamental factor. But this does

not really answer the more basic question: How does a government that

plans to do all the right things and, indeed, puts them on paper

secure the credibility that then makes it possible to live with the

policies? It surely is not the case that there is an objective way of

doing things right which, when hit upon, always and invariably yields

instant public recognition and success. Observers of the time (as

opposed to say Sargent1s analysis) recognized this deeper problem.

They were sensitive to It because they had seen earlier attempts in

Germany and In other countries that started off right, but then fell

apart because they were not supported by stabilizing speculation. A

case in point might be the first Poincare stabilisatlon of 1924 which

evaporated while the second, in 1926, stuck. Where is the difference?

     Students of the German stabilisation were keenly aware of the

issue. Bresciani—Turroni (1930) refers to the stabilisation as a

 miraculous event" and notes (p.355):

             "The stabilisation of the German exchange showed, as did
          that of the Austrian crown, this characteristic: The
          exchange was stabilized before there existed the conditions
          (above all the equilibrium of the Reich Budget) which alone
          could assure a lasting recovery of the situation."



     Of course, one would argue today that the fact of stabilisation

is immaterial, what counts is the firm expectation. With the

expectation of reduced money creation and inflation, there is growth

in real money demand which will be split between the transitory blip

due to the Renten Mark issue and a fall in prices. But that, once

again begs the question of the certainty about the budget. Various

observers note that It was the very fact of the cessation of inflation

which provided the stabilisation of the budget via increased real

values of tax collection. This argument makes the termination of

inflation a precondition for fiscal stabilisation rather than the

other way round. That argument, however, is not completely right. The

fiscal stabilisation had, in fact, four elements:
                                  17


     *   the increase   in the real tax collection that came from the end

of inflationary erosion of the tax yield caused by collection lags.

     *   the elimination of the real value of the longterm government
debt in the hands of the public via the hyperinflation.

     *   the   elimination of part of the floating debt in the hands of

the Reichs Bank by the substitution of the (interest-free) Renten Mark

credit, and

     *   the   creation of new taxes and cuts in outlays.

     The important part, in respect to timing, concerns the longterm

public debt. The service of the debt amounted at the end of the war to

more than half the budget outlays. By 1924 it was less than 3 percent.

To achieve that result there was a need for a sufficently large

cumulative increase in prices before the other three factors could

complement the real debt reduction to stabilize the budget. In this

sense the timing of the stabilisation is not altogether indeterminate.

This point is certainly reinforced by the fact that the reduction in

outlays associated with the end of passive resistance was a

precondition for financial stability.

     A very interesting suggestion comes from the analysis of Keynes

(1923, p.46—48) and Bresciani—Turroni (1931). The argument is that the

rise in velocity, because of hyperinflation, ultimately reduces the

real value of cash balances to so negligible a level that two factors

are at work. First        sort of external loan will be sufficent to

place the entire currency outstanding on a gold cover, making it

possible to implement convertibility. Second, the extreme rise in
                              18



velocity is not sustainable (furniture vans delivering daily

payments). As Keynes (1923, p.47), writing before the actual

stabilisatlon, puts it:


          "... a minimum is reached eventually from which the least
          favorable circumstance will cause a sharp recovery. . .When
          the old value of the currency has fallen to a very low
          figure, it is easy for the government, if it has any
          external resources at all, to give sufficient support to
          prevent the exchange from falling further for the time
          being. And since by that time the public will have carried
          their attempts to economise the use of money to a pitch of
          inconvenience which it is impracticable to continue, even a
          moderate weakening in the degree of their distrust of the
          future value of money will lead to some increase    in their
          use of it; with the result that the aggregate value of
          note issue will tend to recover."



     Comparison of a number of stabilisation programs highlights this

critical aspect of exchange rate stabilisation. It appears invariably

as the key step in a program. It is not sufficient by Itself——this is

shown by the February—March 1923 attempt to stabilize, but it is the

critical step that coordinates expectations, at least temporarily,

around a new trend of prices and thus gives a chance to fiscal

stabilisation via the revenue effects. It might be argued that

stabilizing private speculation, in the face of the right kind of

objective evidence, would perform the same function. It might well,

but it would be difficult to disagree that to entice private

speculators to perform the stabilisation might require even more

monetary—fiscal overkill than if the government itself takes the

steps.
                                 19



       It is quite clear that the government was aware of the need to

establish a sound base of departure for the stabilisation. Schacht

(1927) makes a point that between November 14th, when the Renten Mark

was about to be issued, and November 20th the government devalued by

333 percent so as to raise the value of reserves relative to the

quantity of Reichsmark outstanding. With money issue practically

ceasing, at least for a while, this meant a huge contraction of the

money stock in terms of foreign exchange and also in terms of domestic

prices. The devaluation was also designed to move the official rate

more in line with the free market rate observed in the occupied

territories. The quotations for the official rate in Berlin and the

free Cologne rate are shown in Table 4. Figure 4 shows the same fact

using the Berlin and Amsterdam rates.

    The exchange rate data make the point that the stabilisation was

not an immediate, obvious set of measures reflected instantly in the

exchange rate in the free market. Even by November 30th, when prices

had stopped rising, the free market rate still exceeded very

significantly the official now fixed rate of 4.2 gold mark per $ U.S.

Only toward the middle of December, a full month after stabilisation,

did the market accept the policy. And as early as February—March,

because of excessive commercial credit expansion of the Relchsbank, a

new depreciation of the free rate ensued.

     The exchange market was perhaps slow in recognizing the viability

of the policies merely because they could prove themselves only over

time. The request of the Finance ministry for accommodation, in late

December 1923, really shows that there was at best a potential

stabilisation, with institutions that were there on paper and on

probation.

     Quotations from the weekly report of the Economist's reporter in

Berlin read as follows:

         November 27th, 1923:
              "The currency question continues to be in a mixed
          condition and it is very dangerous to predict how things
             will develop". (p.968)

             December 4, 1923:
                  "The finances continue to be in a hopeless condition
             and as the provisional Renten mark currency reform, which is
             at best doubtful, cannot possibly succeed without budget
             balancing the general situation is gloomy."

             December 16th, 1923:
                  "The currency condition has distinctly improved, owing
             to the price—fall now followed by a relative stability which
             creates the impression in the public mind that the Renten

         mark, gold loan currency and even the paper mark are, for
         some reason not known to the science of currency, really
         stable. This view cannot be held. The dominating influence
         is that for the moment the same views seem to be held abroad
         (as far as there is any dealing in German currency) and that
         so long as foreign Bourses do not depress the mark, causing
         a paper mark price-rise ... the stability will be
         maintained.'



     In that perspective a major credit for de facto stabilisation

must go to the actual fixing of the official exchange rate combined

with super tight credit. An interest rate of 3% per day, as prevailed

In November—December, after the stabilisation, amounts to a monthly

cost of credit of nearly 150 percent. In the face of an official

exchange rate that remained fixed the mere postponement of a

resumption of hyperinflation and hyperdepreciation by a few days meant

dramatic capital losses for foreign exchange speculators. The fact of

a depreciation of the dollar by nearly 100 percent, combined with the

huge cost of credit, operated as a dramatic stabilising device. It

brought gold into the central bank, thus further supporting the

ability to hold the rate, for the time being. In this view

stabilisation was de facto, just as it had happened in February—March.

Except that this time, in February-March, when the depreciation got

underway once more, another credit crunch immediately put off thoughts

of nearterm depreciation and thus sustained stability.

     The fact that stabilisation was not an obvious, ready event is

best appreciated from day to day interest rate data immediately

following the stabilisation and well into 1924. The data make clear

that a return to hyperinflatiOn was not at all excluded. Table 5 shows

data on day-to-day money on the Berlin Bourse. The rates are interest

rates per day. On the day the Renten mark came to be issued interest

rates sharply increased from 5-7% per day to upward of 20% and even

ten days later they still were above 5 or 6% per day at least. Only in

the first week of December did rates fall to the range of 1.5-2% per

day. It is worth noting, of course that in the meantime, as is

apparent from Figure 4, the Mark was strongly appreciating thus

causing immense capital losses for anyone speculating in goods or free

foreign exchange. Schacht (1927) points to these capital losses as

essential to establishing an effective stabilisation.

         A fact that has received no attention is that this regime of

extremely high real interest rates carried through for more than half

a year. This is apparent from the dolilar exchange rate, the price

 level and money market interest rates reported in Table 6.

     Note that the day—to—day money, for lack of a daily price index

is not indexed while Monthly loans are indexed. The large difference

between the rates In January 1924, a full month after the

stabilisation, reflects the ongoing possibility of a resumption of

depreciation and inflation. One might ask how, conceivably, interest

rates can be so high. Who would borrow and who would not lend? The

active margin in all likelihood is foreign exchange. Given earlier

experience with stabilisation, and especially in the period February

to April 1923, the public had every right to expect that from one day

to the next, because of political events, the exchange rate could

collapse and hyperinflation might resume. But even the indexed rate is

extremely high, in fact It Is Latin American. The difference here

reflects, in part, the fact that indexation is stated in terms of

prices and not the exchange rate. To the extent that a collapse would

start with the exchange rate the indexed rate should in fact also

reflect somewhat the risk of renewed depreciation.

     Note, too, the credit squeeze in April as the Reichsbank fights a

tendency toward renewed inflation by a sharp tightening of credit.

With prices falling and the stabilisation established the nominal rate

now falls below the indexed rate. Table 6 thus suggests that only a

few month after the stabilisation, and after repeated denmonstration

of the new rules was the reform, In fact, established. In the meantime

of course, realized real interest rates had been very large thereby

creating a burden on real activity that was reinforced by the strong

real exchange rate.

     The view that emerges in this rendition does recognize the

importance of institutions (no government discounting, fiscal

correction, printers' strike), but goes further to argue that these

measures must, in fact, be made sustainable by actual success. Huge

real interest rates and a stop to capital gains on the exchange market

are the way to bring hyperinflation to a screeching halt.



Exchange Rates and Inflation

     The discussion of the German hyperinflation, and of other

inflation explosions, invariably brings up the question whether the

exchange rate depreciation is the 'source" of Inflation. The argument

Is Immediately rejected on the ground that without validating monetary

policy the depreciation could not be sustained. But that argument may

be too cheap once It is recognized that money creation is certainly

endogeneous via the budget, and that the budget may be affected by the

rate of inflation and by the real exchange rate.

    Consider Figure 5 where we show at ten day intervals the prices of

domestic goods and of imports in gold mark, that is paper mark prices

translated into foreign exchange at the going official exchange rate.

A rise in the gold mark price of domestic goods thus represents a rise

in inflation relative to depreciation and conversely f or a decline in

the gold mark price. It is quite obvious from the figure that there

are huge shifts In the relative rates. During periods of exchange rate

stability, in early 1923 and In late 1923 prices are stable or

declining. By contrast, following an exchange rate collapse as in
                                 25


April 1923, July 1923 and August 1923 there is an outburst in

inflation. It is this sequence running from exchange rate collapse to

domestic inflation that motivates the balance of payments approach.

       The justification relates to the budget. If a large part of tax

collection is not indexed, or if spending and taxes are indexed

respectively to the exchange rate and domestic prices, then exchange

rate depreciation opens up a budget gap that needs financing and

thereby validates the depreciation. The argument can simply be made in

terms of a simple model of real money demand and inflationary finance

of the budget. Monetary equilibrium is described by the equality of

real balances, m, and the demand for real money balances L:




(1)          m =   L(p)


where p is the rate of inflation. Deficit finance implies that the

growth rate of money be equal to the real government deficit per

dollar real balances, or:




 (2)         gin =   d(p)   ,   d'   > 0



 where g is the growth rate of nominal money and d is the real budget

 deficit which is an increasing function of the rate of inflation

 because of a lack of complete tax indexation.
                               26


      The model is completed by an inflation equation which states that

the rate of inflation is equal to the growth rate of nominal money

(which is d(p)/m)) plus an influence stemming from stock

disequilibrium in the Money market:




(3)          p    d(p)/w + a(m —   L(p)),   —d'Im -*   a   <   0



      Figure 6 shows the possibility of instability. The schedule BB

shows equation (3). The dynamics arise from the gradual adjustment of

real balances. An increase in the rate of depreciation eliminates tax

revenue and therefore calls for an increased inflation tax. But real

money demand adjusts to the higher inflation rate thereby eroding the

inflation tax base and raising inflation still further.

      The model can obviously be complicated to multiple equilibria.

More realistically one might want to recoggnize that there is the

possibility of adjustment in taxation to inflation. Specifically there

might be a longrun tax function which is inflation proof, but a

shortrun one which responds negatively to inflation. This extension is

worth considering because it responds to the obvious problem that a

shift to more rapid inflation, for a while at least takes the tax

system by surprise. It ties in with the exchange rate issue precisely

because exchange rate collapse would be the kind of surpise to the

fiscal authorities that causes them for a while to be catching up and

printing money.
                              27



     Given the instability of the model, fixing the exchange rate (and

the rate of depreciation consistent with stable inflation) is simply a

socially acceptable form of price control that arrests the inflation

process.

     The exchange rate Issue enters the analysis in still another way.

One of the striking features of many stabilisations is the sustained

real appreciation. Figures 7 and 8 show the case of Austria and

Germany in the 1920s. The same is true for Poincar&s stabilisation in

1926-28. One explanation Is that the exchange rate is driven by the

portfolio holders decision to move out or into a currency. In the

phase of economic and political instability there is capital flight

which leads to real depreciation (and hence sharply accelerating

inflation). In the stabilisatjon phase, there are net capital Inflows

and stabilisation loans that allow current account balance or deficits

and hence a real appreciation. This fact is important because It helps

explain, in part, the success of stabilisation since It raises real

wages. But it also explains the immediately following

"stabilisierungskrise"—- the decline In activity that comes from the

combination of tight money and overvaluation.
