           Explanations of Exchange-Rate Volatility and other Empirical
                      Regularities in some Popular Models of
                           the Foreign Exchange Market



                                     ABSTRACT



      This paper is intended to accomplish two tasks.    First, exchange-rate

models of the sticky-price and flexible-price varieties respectively are

checked for their consistency with two key empirical regularities:    (1)     the

observed pattern of price-level vs. exchange-rate volatility, and (2)       the

observed pattern of spot exchange-rate vs. forward exchange-rate volatility.

Second, a widely neglected reason for exchange-rate volatility, activist

monetary policy is studied.

      It is found that both sticky-price and flexible price models explain

the empirical regularities rather well.   Further, if prices are sticky it

is found that exchange-rate overshooting may be empirically non-trivial.

                                T.    Introduction

       The wi.desprea.d floating of exchange r'ates since 1973 has provided

the first ·.vorld-vlide data for studying flexible-rate regimes in the post-

WJII era.     The larg.e volatility of exch.:::.nge. rates seen in these data

created a natural scientific demand {or .:In exchange-rate theory consistent

with the ne"l evidence.     The beginnings of such a t.heory, which became

known as the Asset Market Approach to Exchange Rates, emerged in 1976 in

the \·wrk of Dornbusch (1976),       Frenkel   (1.976)~,   Kouri (1976), and Mussa

(1976~.      In particular, these authors offered explanations for why

exchange rates may be expected to be more volatile than current underlying

exchange-marke t fundamentals):/

      Dornbusch (1976): suggested that goods markets adjust slowly while

asset markets (to a first approximation) adjust immediately.            Since exchange

rates are asset prices they adjust quickly compared with goods prices.

With both goods prices and exchange rates entering asset markets, exchange

rates must bear a larger immediate burden of asset market adjustment,

following a disturbance, than will be required once goods prices have begun

to adjust.     This was the celebrated overshooting result which has subsequently

been refined by Frankel (1979)1       Frenkel and Rodriguez (1980»)       Mussa

(1977)~'.   Rogoff (1979)   and Wilson (1979).'

      The explanation offered by Frem:el (1976) , andMussa (1976a) was

that since current exchange rates reflect agent~ beliefs not simply about

current market fundamentals but also about the entire future of such

fundamentals, a disturbance to current fundamentals may be magnified in

its exchange-rate impact because of the disturbance's effect on beliefs
                                    -2-



about future fundamentals.    This explanation was   call~d    the magnification

effect and has been studied by Bilson (1978),    (1979)       and Meese and

Singleton (1980a).
       The explanation offered by Kouri (1976)   was that a disturbance to

current fundamentals may be magnified through its. affect on the current and

expected future distribution of world wealth.    This explanation has been

studied in linear models with rational expectations by Boyer and Hodrick

(1980) and Flood (1979b).

       It is useful to think of the Kouri view as one which endogenizes

explicitly one of the elements of market fundamentals of the Frenkel-Mussa

model.    This is an interpretation pursued in the appendix.       Because of

the relative analytical difficulty of Kouri's model, magnification effects

are discussed here only for the Frenkel-Mussa model.

         The present paper is intended to accomplish two tasks.      First, models

predicting overshooting and magnification respectively will be checked          fo~


their consistency with two key empirical regularities:


(1)      the observed pattern of price-level vs. exchange-rate volatility,


(ii)     the observed pattern of spot exchange-rate vs. forward exchange-

         rate volatility.


Second, a widely neglected reason for exchange-rate volatility, activist

monetary policy, will be studied.

                            Accomplishing the first task requires that we note that two important

                      differences between the Dornbusch and the Frenkel-Mussa models are that

                      Dornbusch's has sticky goods prices while Frenkel's and Mussa's have freely

                      flexible prices, .and Dornbusch distinguishes between domestic goods and

                      other goods while Frenkel and Mussa deal only with a single aggregate

                      commodity.   In order to confront the pattern of exchange rates and price

                      levels the Frenkel-Mussa model is expanded presently to distinguish

                      domestic and other goods.    In the context of this expanded model it is

                      found that both the Dornbusch and the Frenkel-Bussa models are consistent

                      with observed data when the domestic share of the domestic good in con-

                      sumption is greater than the foreign share of the domestic good in their

                      consumption, and both models are inconsistent \dth the data when the above

                      condition on consumption shares does not hold.

                             The second empirical regularity, which is that the spot exchange rate

                      and forward exchange rates (of all maturities) tend to move closely together

                      . and thus have about the same degree of volatility is a striking fact which

                      is uot necessarily implied by either version of the mode2..~ :;£~:.iY.J... the
'.'   ':"'.'   ,~_.




                      differences in spot and 90 day forward rate volatility are explored for

                      five industrial countries and the results are interpreted in terms of

                      both the Dornbusch and Frenkel-Mussa versions of the model.         In addition

                      I examine the pattern of spot and forward rate vol~tility for the U.S.-
                      Canada rates for a forward maturity of 360 days.

                      The results here are suggestive of a methodology which may be useful in

                      measuring the importance of exchange-rate overshooting.
                            The paper's second task is to argue that activist monetary policy

                      contributes to exchange-rate volatility.      In an example it is shown that

                      if monetary policy is actually attempting to stabilize interest rates

                      and if a monetary innovation is treated as uncorrexated with other

                      disturbances in the economy then by ignoring the covariance of monetary

                      innovations wit:.l other disturbances, exchange-rate volatility will be

                      consistently under-predicted.

      TIle organization of the paper is as follows." In section II the two

versions of the model are presented and solved.        In section III both versions

of the model are called on to explain the observed pattern of prices and

exchange rates.         In section IV both versions are challenged to explain

simultaneously spot-rate volatility in excess of volatility in fundamentals

and forward-rate volatility which is approximately the same as spot-rate

volatility.         Section V contains the argument that activist monetary policy

exacerbates exchange-rate volatility.


     II.    Two Versions of a Two Commodity Exchange-Rate Model
      The model presented in this section describes a country which is

large oRly in the markets for its own money and its own output.        Both a

sticky-price and a flexible-price version of the model will be considered.

logarithms of the domestic              pric~        of domestic eu tput and the quantity of

domestic output, respectively.                  To simplify algebra I assume        ~2   = 1, which

implies that (1) may be written as

          Equation (4) says that the forward rate equals the expected future

information the price of domestic output for time t, Pt' is set at the

level expected to clear the goods market during period t.                     Such pricing is

purely anticipatory of events expected at t, but                  Pt   does not respond to

actual events at t and thus is predetermined.                   This type of pricing is

a polar extreme of standard pricing rules.                Mussa (1976b) and McCallum

(1980): derive rules where pricing is partly anticipatory and partly

dependent on past excess             demand.~/   In the Dornbusch model, pricing depends

entirely on past excess demand.                Thus, the present pricing rule and that

of Dornbusch are extremes, which are spanned by the rules of MUssa and

McCallum.     The extreme of purely anticipatory pricing has been adopted

presently because of its analytical simplicity.                   Where    app~opriate,


the modifications of the argument required for other sticky price rules

will be indicated.

      For flexible prices, equilibrium condition (9b) holds.                      Here~   Pt is

         The sticky price solutions in table I were obtained from equations

(2)-(8), (14), price setting in accord with (9a) and exogenous processes

(14), and (10)-(13) but uses (9b) instead of (9a).

         Note that the results of the sticky price version are similar to those

of Dornbusch (1976), and Mussa (1977).              If money follows a random walk

(p    = 1)   then Y1l       = 1,   implying the effect of a monetary disturbance on

the exchange rate (Y12) must be greater than the disturbance itself,

                    III.   Exchange Rates and Prices
       Recent empirical work has found that exchange rates and national

price levels (consumer prices or wholesale prices) do not follow closely

 ~e   predictions of purchasing power parity.    The relationship of prices and

exchange rates was studied by at the macro-level by Frenkel (1980a), (1980b)

and Krugman (1978) , and was examined at a more micro-level by K4avis and

 Lipsey (1978).    Isard (1977)   and Magee (1978)..      These studies suggest

 that except for the most   homoge~ous   of products, different countries' outputs

 .hould be treated as different products.     This regularity has been

 embedded in the two versions of the model at hand" by differentiating domestic

 and foreign goods.

        Another regularity concerning prices and exchange rates is that

 exchange rates are more volatile than relative national price levels

 (C.P.I. or W.P.I.).    This point was made by Stockman (1980),      Frenkel (1980a)
 and Frenkel and Mussa (1980)>> and is docuncntcd f~r the current definition

      It is interesting to ask how well the two versions of the present model do in
explaining exchange-rate volatility in excess of price-level volatility.        The domestic

    (2), (20) , (7) and (8) may be manipulated to yield


             TT t    -   'f'l'·k
                             t     = St +   (8 -   e-~)(p

    For the sticky price version, Pt is predetermined and for both versions

    ~      = q* = O.               It follows that              for sticky prices,




    Thus, if         e>            ~   (i.e. if home goods are a larger share of home consumption

    than of foreign consumption) (1                             +~   -   e) is a fraction and the sticky price

    model has no difficulty in reconciling exchange-rate volatility in excess

    of price-level volatility.

              We next turn to the performance of the flexible price version.                                 Equation

    (22) was a special case holding for predetermined Pt.                                    In general (with.

                          then this negative covariance unambiguously produces                                exchange-rate volatility

                          in excess of price-level volatility.

                                               Three points are demonstrated in the analysis of this section.                   First,

            I    -      both the sticky-price and flexible-price versions of the model predict

                        exchange-rate volatility in excess of price-level- volatility when the share

of domestic goods in domestic consumption is greater than the share of

domestic goods in foreign consumption.                                Second, deviations from purchasing

power parity, which may be                           obst~ined    from equation (21), show persistence
 if relative price changes show persistence whether prices are sticky or

 flexible.          For example, for flexible prices and the exogenous processes

presented here Pt - St (the terms of trade) fpllows a random walk implying

 (for    e 'f:    15k') that   TT
                                    t
                                        -   TT~ -     St also follows a random walk.         Third, both

 versions predict a negative correlation of innovations in St and innovations

 in the te~s of trade (p                         -    St).     For the sticky price version, the correlation
                                             t

 arises because exchange-rate innovations                             ~    innovations in the terms of

 trade.          In the flexible-price version the correlation arises because things

which tend to improve the                        te~s        of trade (positive   ut   negative   ~)   tend to
                          · currency.-

         Studying the time series behavior of spot exchange rates Meese and
Singleton (1980)          ~    found that they could not reject the hypothesis that

exchange r.ates follow a random walk around a linear trend.                                 This hypothesis
is formalized as


                                                                                                           (27)


                                                                                                           (28)

Equation (30) states that the volatility of any expected future spot rate

and the current spot rate are approximately equal.

     To the extent that forward rates are equal to expected future spot

rates, equation (24) matches closely the regularity noted by Mussa (1979,

page 14) that flFor all maturities of forward contracts, the day-to-day (or

week-to-week or month-to-month) change in the forward rate. is always

very close to the day-to-day (or week-to-week or            ffionth-to-mon~h)   change

in the contemporaneous spot rate."              Mussa's observation and equation (24)

        l~e   model at hand is special in that with purely anticipatory pricing,

the goods market is currently expected to be in equilibrium next period

and to remain in equilibrium indefinitely.         Thus, the economy is expected

to attain its long-run or benchmark path after a single period's adjustment.
This differs from sticky-price models with adjustments to lagged disequilibrium

because in such     model~   the economy approaches the long-run path assymtotically.

However, if the present model exhibited typical price adjustment to past

disequilibrium then it would converge          to the same path achieved in one

period by the present sticky-price version.

        Consider the nature of the difference in response patterns of current

and expected future spot rates for purely anticipatory pricing vs. lagged

disequilibrium pricing when the disturbance is believed to be a once-and-

for all increase in the money supply (p        = 1). With Pt predetermined, the
fi~st   period money-market response is the same for both pricing rules--the

forward premium adjusts to clear the money market.         Thus, the exact same

wedge must be driven between the current and the one period expected future

spot rate irrespective of the pricing rule.          However, with purely anticipatory

pricing the induced change in the forward premium is the exact measure of

overshooting as complete adjustment is expected to be made in one period.

        With pricing in response to lagged disequilibrium,       pri~e i~   B£! expected
to adjust fully by next period and thus real balances are expected to be

higher next period with lagged adjustment pricing than with purely

anticipatory pricing.        These additional real money balances require higher

money demand, which is accomplished by a second period rational forward
                                      -21-




discount on foreign currency (i.e. tEst+2 < tES~l).         Since this discount

is rational, the spot rate must be expected to continue falling during

tile second period.    Indeed; the argument maybe extended to show that the

spot rate must be expected to continue falling in all future periods until

goods market equilibrium is attained.

      The first period premium (tEst+l - St) is the sante for both rules

and both rules have the same long run, but the lagged disequilibrium rule

requires anticipated adjustments in st+j for j >'1.        Hence the lagged

disequilibrium rule must provide a larger immediate exchange-rate response

than the purely anticipatory rule.      l~is   larger response is entirely in

terms of greater overshooting.

      Since the long-run response is the same for both pricing rules

but the immediate response is larger for lagged disequilibrium pricing

than for purely anticipatory pricing, it follows that (for the disturbance

considered) for maturities greater than some length the difference in spot

and forward-rate volatility must be greater under lagged disequilibrium

pricing than under purely anticipatory pricing.

       This result is exactly correct for p      =1   and it will hold up for

- 1 S pSI.      When   I pi> 1,   then, irrespective of the pricing rule, for

maturities of forward contract greater than some length forward rates

would be predicted to be more volatile than spot rates.

      The example presented here gave current money market .disturbances a

central role.    It may be though that money market disturbances do not enter

the money market currently and/or that disturbances to other markets are

important for exchange rate determination.        First suppose that new information.
                                          -22-




involves future values of money market fundamentals rather than current

values.       If such in.formation is the s.ource of money market disturbances

then equation (la') indicates that since innovations in future market

fundamentals do not enter (la') through          ~t   or Pt then the innovations

must have exactly equal effects on St and tEst+l as would be true with

St following a random walk.          Second, suppose that disturbances to goods

markets are an important source of exchange-rate volatility.             (This would
                      2 2
be true presently if YlS(JuoJf were large relative to other components of

equation (32).)          If these goods market disturbances are    uncor~elated    with

money market disturbances then St and tEst+l must be affected equally by

such disturbances as would be true if St followed a random-walk.

         These last examples are not intended to suggest that exchange rates

actually must follow a random walk in response to the discussed disturbances.

They are only intended to point out that substantial co-mqvement of B and
                                                                     t
tEst+l is not ruled out by the sticky-price version.


The Flexible-Price Version

         To begin studying the flexible-price version it is useful to rewrite
(14) as


                    =-                                                                (34)




since    ~t   contains the nominal variable rot it is reasonable to suppose that

disturbances to       ~t   may, in part, be signals of disturbances to money growth

rates.        If such disturbances do signal. changes in money growth rates then
                                         -23-




 these disturbances will alter both sand (Es                   1 - s).   To the extent that
                                  ----      t         t   t+       t
                   ~




 a disturbance in ~t results in an unexpected increase in (tES~~l - St) then
 the disturbance's effect on St will be ~a~nified in its effect on St.                    Indeed,
 this is precisely the magnification effect of Frenkel (1976)                 and Mussa (1976) ••

 For a magnification effect to take place though, tEst+lmust be more volatile

 than St.   This point is illustrated in the following example.

       For the flexible-price version, use equation (17) to calculate.


                                                                                              (35)

                                                                         j   = 1,   2, 3, ... (36)


 By inspecting the values of Al2 and All listed in Table I we find

 that the expressions in (35) and (36) are exactly the same only when g = 1.

 If - 1 < p < 1 then (36) must be less than (35) for all j and if                   I pi> 1
 then (36) must be greater than (35) for all j.

       The case ofl~1 > 1 is relevant as this is required for the magnification

 effect to be present.   In this model, the magnification effect holds for

 monetary disturbances when A1       > 1.       The magnification effect is the flexible
                                 2
 price counterpart to overshooting in that it too explains spot-rate volatility

. in excess of volatility in curr.ent market fundamentals.


 Some Illustrative Calculations

       The point of the present discussion is to relate the above formal

models to the data.    To establish such a relation (without estimating the

model) assumptions need to be made about some of the model's parameters.

we find   ~ ~   .185, which says as much as 18.5% of U.S. - Canadian exchange-

rate volatility may be due to exchange-rate overshooting.

        It must be emphasized that the calculations in this section are

intended only as a rough comparison of the models and the data.               A more

elaborate study would estimate the relevant behavioral parameters and

parameters of the exogenous processes.              However, this preliminary examination

indicates that both versions of the model are roughly consistent              ~ith


the data and that exchange-rate overshooting may be phenomenon of              non-triv~al


magnitude.

                v.    Monetary Policy and Exchange-Rate Volatility
            The modeling of previous sections presumed money to be exogenously

generated by the simple autoregressive scheme of equation (10).                  This pre-

sumption is naive.             In fact, monetary policy is dominated largely by policy-

makers' desires to control variables other than the money supply.                  Such

policy is said to be activist policy, which is formalized presently by a

linear money supply rule linking money supply movements to movements in ~noth2r

variable             in the model.   In this section activist monetary policy will

replace the simple autoregression of previous sections.

            The point to be made in this section is that if monetary policy is

activist, in a realistic way, and if observers try to interpret exchange-rate

volatility conditional on non-activist policy (e.g. the autoregression of

past sections) then there is a natural tendency for observers to underpredict

the extent of exchange-rate             volati~ity:      Such an underprediction, of course,

gives the appearance of exchange-rate volatility in excess of volatility

in market fundamentals.

            Because the point to be made here is a point about monetary policy

and not about the market for home goods a special case of the flexible-price

version of the model will be adopted.                   To generate this special case let

        ~   =   in equation (6).     The goods and money markets thus collapse to

 and since v         is orthogonal to all variables dated t - 1 or earlier, a
                t

 exogenity, would not discover the true nature of v              and would interpret v

          The example at hand has been cooked-up to provide ease of computations.

 Note that expected money growth, tE(mt+l - mt ) is the constant m.                   With

 rational expectations, this         ~plies    that tE(st+l - St) is also a constant.

supply then the interest rate disturbance brings_abonc a monetary innovation

which alters excess demand for rooney in the same direction as the interest

rate disturbance alters the excess demand.      This exces's demand is balanced

and partially offset by overshooting which induces a change in the forward

premium.   The extent of overshooting however is exacerbated by the covariation

of monetary and foreign interest rate innovations.

      Second, suppose that money growth responds negatively to output

innovations.     If so, then an output innovation will raise money demand and

reduce money supply requiring a larger exchange rate innovation to clear

the money market than would be needed if monetary growth were exogenous

to output disturbances.     Third, in the above it has been assumed that money

growth responds only to innovations in endogenous variables.      Since the

levels of those endogenous variables must contain their innovations the

argument would not be much altered if (44) were to depend on the level of

it relative to a target.


               VI.   Some Policy Inplications

      The present analysis illustrates two well known policy implications

of the asset market approach to the foreign exchange market (see e.g.

Frenkel and Mussa (1980».       First, nonstationary growth of money (relative

to income) produces magnification of the exchange-rate effects 6f monetary

disturbances and thus produces high volatility of exchange rates relative

to the volatility of monetary disturbances.      Thus; policy makers desiring

to reduce exchange-rate volatility .might well look toward stabilizing

the money supply process.
                                       -31--




       Second, exchange rates are only a portion of the set of macro-

variables which concern policy makers, who opero.te using a limited set

of tools.   Concentration of policy on stabi.lizing variables other than

exchange rates can render exchange rates more volatile than they otherwise

would have been.     Thus, policy making with many "targets" but limited

"tools" requires coherent policy not a piece meal of "exchange rate

policy" and (for example) "interest rate policy."


                        VII.    Concluding Remarks

       Four main points emerge in this paper:

(iii) At the outset of the Asset Harket Approach to exchange rates Mussa

       (1976) pointed out the sufficiency of   ~reating   the money supply as

       "an arbitrarily prescribed stochastic process, a stochastic black

       exchange rate.    While this point is correct for the first

       compete for professional priority but they are in no way mutually

       exclusive.    Hence, it would be unsurprising to find all present,

The assumption a

                       = 1 allows us to ignore (Pt - qt) in money demand.                The

influence of (Pt - qt) is proportional to (a         - 1) times the share of
                                                 2
foreign goods in domestic consumption, which is the product of two small

is to deflate nominal money and nominal income by p           rather than   TI       •

11     Instead of assuming domestic output to be constant it may be assumed

that output depends positively on relative price (see Flood and Marion (1980)

Appendix 5) in \vhich case 8 , in (6) , would be interpreted as an                   ex~ess

~I     Mussa's (1976b) pricing rule may be written as

where Pt+j is the price which would clear the goods market at t                    =I-   j.

With   <S       =1   and t-lEPt-l   = p t-l    Mussa's rule is Pt = t-1 EP t' T,1hich is the

rule used in the present sticky-price version.                   Our pricing rule would

also result if output adjustment costs were zero in McCallum's (l980)                         ~od~l.

21     Flood (l979a) and Flood and Marion (1980a) have been critical of the

methodology of ignoring correlations among foreign variables.                     P~~sently


though, accounting for such correlations adds much complication without                                •

much illumination and thus they are ignored.

!/     Normally sticky-price models include at least one past price                      a.mQn.~

the set of state variables.               The assumption of purely      anticipato~y


pricing is attractive analytically because past price is irrelevant to

the current pricing decision.

effect on the exchange rate.                  Nonstationary money causes a nonstationa~y

exchange rate and the unconditional variance does not exist for a                        non~t3tiona~y

they would have had to be conditional variances.

10/   Since the C.P.I. is an average of prices sampled during the month

and the exchange rate is sampled at a point in time there is a natural

tendency for the exchange rate to be more volatile than a C.P.I. ratio.

As a crude correction for this problem I recomputed the u.S. - Canada

entry in Table II using a monthly average spot rate instead of a point in

time spot rate.    The result was a volatility ratio of 8.5 rather than the

16.6 reported in Table II.     Since the relative volatility of 8 continued

to match the regularity reported, this approach was discarded as being

redundant.

11/   Similar results are reported by Stockman (1980).

12/   The analysis of this section is based on the empirical regularities

summarized in Table III.     It thus has a different basis than the variance

bounds work of Meese and Singleton (1980b) who derive upper bounds on

exchange rate variance using the error orthoganality property of optimal

forecasts.   In the discussion that follows,one month will be taken as

the relevant period.   Thus f + refers to a forward exchange rate quoted
                             t 3
at time t for execution 3 months hence.

13/   Goldfeld found that the long run elasticity for' the interest rate

on time deposits was -.16 and that for the interest rate on commercial

paper was -.067.   Thus the combined interest elasticity is -.227           ~     -.23

(Goldfeld, p. 602 Regression A).

}i/ The present model assumes that money demand is semi-log linear, i.e.,
. the log of real money demand, rot - Pt' is linearly related to the level

 of the interest rate, it.                   Since it has a time dimension (e.g. 10 percent

 per year) the semi-elasticity must also have a time dimension (e.g. years)

 so that their product (alit) is units free.

15/     Flood and Garber (1980 ) refer to this requirement as process

consistency.
