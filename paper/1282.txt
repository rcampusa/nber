                                ABSTRACT



      During the decade since 1973, the U.S. economy has become increas-

 ingly interdependent with the newly industrializing countries (NICs)

among the developing countries. These countries have had high invest-

ment ratios to GNP, financed mainly by domestic saving, but also partly

by foreign borrowing. They have invested in manufacturing capacity,

importing capital equipment. This increase in international demand for

equipment has resulted in an increase of U.S. capital good exports to

over 50 percent of all U.S. manufactures. In turn, exports of consumer

manufactures by the NICs to the OECD countries have expanded rapidly.

As the NICs grew during the 1970's, they imported capital goods from the

U.S., and exported consumer manufactures to the U.S. This pattern of

trade has strengthened the interdependence between the U.S. economy and

the NICs.

     The geographical pattern of U.S. trade with the NICs shows some in-

teresting asymmetries. U.S. exports are relatively focused on Latin

America, mainly Mexico, and imports on the Far Eastern NICs. A trade

triangle has developed, with the U.S. exporting manufactures, mainly

capital goods, to the Latin American NICs; who in turn sell raw materials

on the world market. The Far Eastern NICs buy raw materials and sell

manufactures, mainly consumer goods, to the U.S. Thus growth in the

U.S. economy has become more interdependent with both the Latin American

and Far Eastern NICs.

Trade and Structural Interdependence
Between the U.S. and the NICs.*

1. Introduction and Summary.


        During the decade since 1973, the U.S. economy has become increas—

ingly interdependent with the newly industrializing countries (NICs) among

the developing countries. [See Table 24 for a list of identified NICs.]

These countries have had high investment ratios to GNP, financed mainly

by domestic saving, but also partly by foreign borrowing. They have in—

vested in manufacturing capacity, importing capital equipment. This in-

crease in international demand for equipment has resulted in an increase

of U.S. capital good exports to over 50 percent of all U.S. manufactures;

the 12 NICs enumerated in the tables in section 3 of this paper absorbed

22 percent of all U.S. capital goods exports in 1981.

        In turn, exports of consumer manufactures by the NICs to the OECD

countries have expanded rapidly. The 12 NICs provided half of U.S. im-

ports of consumer manufacture (non—food, non—auto) in 1980, and 40 percent

of European imports. As the NICs grew during the 1970's, they imported

capital goods from the U.S., and exported consumer manufactures to the

U.S.

        This pattern of trade has strengthened the interdependence between

the U.S. economy and the NICs. In section 3 below we show that U.S. ex-

ports of manufactures are less balanced across commodities than European

or Japanese exports, with high shares in the U.S. for capital goods and

chemicals. The NICs are a major market area for these U.S. exports.

        The geographical pattern of U.S. trade with the NICs also shows

some interesting asymmetries. In overall trade in manufactures, the U.S.

has a large surplus ($12.2 billion in 1980) in trade with the Latin

American NICs (Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico), a small surplus

($2.5 billion) with the ASEAN countries, and a large deficit ($11.3 bil-

lion) with the Far Eastern NICs (Hong Kong, S. Korea, Taiwan). Thus the

U.S. exports capital goods to the NICs and imports consumer goods from

them, following broad lines of comparative advantage. But the exports

are relatively focused on Latin America, mainly Mexico, and imports on

the Far Eastern NICs. In the data of sections 3—5 a trade triangle ap-

pears, with the U.S. exporting manufactures, mainly capital goods, to the

Latin American NICs; who in turn sell raw materials on the world market.

The Far Eastern NICs buy raw materials and sell manufactures, mainly con-

sumer goods, to the U.S. These patterns of interdependence should be a

major focal point of U.S. foreign economic policy.

        The data presented in sections 2—5 below support this view of in-

terdependence between the U.S. economy and the NICs, which differs from

the relations of Europe or Japan with those countries. In section 2 we

begin by describing investment and manufacturing—led growth in the NICs

since 1970 or so. This is part of a broader pattern of growth in manu-

facturing in the developing countries that has left only the African pri—

mary producers dependent on a single primary export. Growth of manu-

facturing capacity, particularly in the NICs, has provided a market for

exports of capital equipment.

        In sections 3 and 4 we compare the evolution of the geographical

and commodity composition of manufactures exports and imports of the
                                                                         3.




U.S., Europe, and Japan. The NICs take a high proportion of U.S. and

Japanese exports relative to European exports, with the U.S. relatively

concentrated on capital goods and Latin America. The U.S. is the biggest

market for NIC exports of manufactures, particularly consumer goods.

       The pattern of U.S. trade with the industrial NICs, disaggregated

by connnodity, is examined in section 5. There we see the geographical

imbalances mentioned above, which make growth in the U.S. economy inter-

dependent with growth both in Latin America and among the Asian NICs.

2.     The Rise of the NICs

2.1    Introduction.


       During the 1970s the relative size of the manufacturing sector ex-

panded in a broad range of developing countries. In a subset of these

countries in Latin america and Asia, this growth made them significant

producers of manufactures on a world scale by the end of the decade.

This group has been labelled the newly industrializing countries, or NICs.

In this section we analyze some aspects of the rise of the NICs that are

important for the later discussion of their trade interactions with the

OECD countries.

       Growth in manufacturing capacity and trade in the developing coun-

tries, which will he documented below, seems to have reduced their tight

dependence on OECD growth. While there is still a strong correlation be-

tween growth rates of industrial countries and the average across all de-

veloping countries, the correlation is less tight when we look at groups

of developing countries. It is no longer clear who is the "engine" and

who is the dead weight in the international growth process.

       Growth rate data since 1973 are summarized in Table 1 for areas of

interest for the analysis below. The data for the industrial countries

show the deepening stagnation in the OECD area, especially in Europe.

For example, the West German economic institutes are forecasting a signi-

ficant recover in 1984, with real GDP growing at 2—3 percent, and

ment rising only slowly. In Europe, recovery has been redefined to mean

only a small increase in unemployment! The average growth pattern over
                                                                              5.

all developing countries is roughly similar to that of the industrial coun-

tries, but there are important differences in timing. While the OECD

countries, led by the United States, went deep into recession in 1982,

growth was about the same as in 1981 in the developing countries.

       The subgroups of developing countries in Table 1 show a wide di-

versity of growth patterns relative to the industrial countries. The

low—income and the Western Hemisphere countries show a rise in the growth

rate in 1980, and the East Asian and Pacific countries show a sharp rise

in 1981. The middle—income oil importers in the Middle East and North

Africa, and the major exporters of manufactures (the NICs) show an in-

crease in the growth rate in 1982, when the OECD slump deepened. Thus

the pattern of growth among the subgroups of Table 1 does not mirror the

movement in the industrial countries. The increase in growth in the de-

veloping countries relative to the industrial countries in 1982 could

lead us to ask if the rules of engine and dead weight have not been

reversed.

       In the rest of this section of the paper, we will look in more de-

tail at the structure of growth in the NICs, the development of the manu-

facturing sector in the NICs and in a broader sample of developing coun-

tries, and the financing of this growth. The facts to be presented are all

well—known by now; the point here is to present them in a way that will

make clear the connection between these developments and the evolution

of the structure of trade between the NICs especially in Asia, and the

OECD countries especially the United States.

2.2    Growth in the NICs, 1970—81.


       There are about as many lists of which countries are ICs as there

are authors on the topic of their emergence and growth. So we have an

initial problem of identification of countries. There is also in the

background of this literature a deeper question of whether the identifi-

cation has not been done purely on an ex post basis by looking at a narrow

set of indicators related to growth in manufacturing capacity. It is

quite possible that the category NICs does not exist as measured by other

characteristics of the economy. For example, on the "distortion index"

of the World Bank, of the NICs listed in Table 2, Thailand, Korea, Malaysia,

the Philippines and Colombia are in the low—distortion category; Indonesia,

India, Brazil, and Mexico are "middle—distortion" countries; Argentina is

the only "high—distortion" country. [World Development Report, 1983,

P. 60].. Does this grouping imply that we can categorize NICs as relatively

"low—distortion" countries? The answer is not clear. An urgent topic

for research in this area would be on analysis using a "clustering algo-

rithm" grouping countries by a wide range of economic indicators, such as

the entire set of World Bank Indicators, to see if a category "NICs"

emerges statistically.

       In the face of these reservations, we must proceed, so I have de-

cided to adopt the list of NICs provided by Cohn Bradford (1982), which

includes countries which are on most lists. Bradford further introduces

the subsets of existing NICs and potential, or "New NICs," as they are

labelled in Table 2. The categories in Table 2 are also broken do.m by

the World Banks groupings by income level. Taiwan is omitted because it
                                                                         8.




no Longer appears in the World Bank data; it is included later in the

analysis of trade data.

      The growth rates of real GDP, investment, and manufacturing output

in the NICs are summarized in Table 2 for the period 1970—81. Among the

NICs identified there, the only countries with lower growth rates than

their income—group average were Argentina in all three categories and

Thailand in investment growth. Comparing growth rates across columns,

only Singapore shows slower investment growth than GDP growth, and only

Argentina shows slower growth of manufacturing output than GDP growth.

[Is Argentina already deindustrializing?]

       The impression left by the data of Table 2 is of investment—led

growth in the NICs, with manufacturing output growing faster than GDP.

Next we see the effects on the structure of output and exports, and how

this growth was financed.


2.3    The Shift toward Manufacturing.

       The increase in the manufacturing sector as a fraction of CDP and,

even more strikingly, of exports among the NICs is shown in Table 3. The

increase in the share of manufacturing in GDP from 1960 to 1981 was

greater than the average for the income group in all of the identified

NICs except Brazil and Argentina, where it actually decreased.

       The last two columns of Table 3 show the increase in the share of

manufactures in exports. Here the numbers are striking. Even in coun-

tries where the manufacturing share of output did not rise significantly,

the export share did. Indonesia, whose exports came to be dominated by

oil, in a mild version of the "Dutch disease",is the only country with a
                                                                           9.

small increase in the manufacturing share.

     This shift toward manufacturing exports is not limited to the NICs,

as we see in Table 4 and Figures 1—4, taken trom James Riedel (1982).

Table 4 shows the evolution of the distribution of non—fuel exports of

the developing countries from 1955 to 1978. Over that period, manu-

factures increased from 10 to 45 percent of developing country exports.

Noting that four Asian NICs——Hong Kong, S. Korea, Singapore and Taiwan——

account for over 60 percent of developing country manufactures exports,

Riedel went on to study a 54—country sample that excludes those four. The

sample was divided into 11 "balanced exporters," 22 non—African pri-

mary exporters, and 20 African primary exporters. The evolution of the

average export structure of the entire sample is shown in Figure 1. The

increase in manufactures share from 7 percent in 1960 to 18 percent in

1976—78 is balanced by the decrease in the share of the largest single

primary export from 47 to 36 percent. The experience of the "balanced

exporters," which include Brazil, India, and Mexico from our list of NICs,

is shown in Figure 2. The manufactures share rises from 15 to 39 percent,

and the largest single primary share falls from 43 to 22 percent. In

Figure 4 we see that the non—African primary producers, which include

Argentina, Malaysia, Philippines, and Thailand from our list, increased

their manufactures share from 4 to 16 percent, and reduced the largest

single primary share from 46 to 32 percent. Only the African primary

producers, shown in Figure 3, remain heavily dependent on the largest

single primary export. We will see below that this is the main market

among the developing countries for European exports.

       The developing countries on average, and especially the NICs, grew

rapidly in the 1970s, even in the face of stagnation in the OECD area.

Investment and manufacturing output grew faster than GDP in the NICs,

and the manufacturing share of output and exports increased substantially.

In later sections of the paper we link this growth in manufacturing out-

put to demand for capital goods exports from the OECD countries, parti-

cularly the U.S.


2.4     Investment, Saving, and Foreign Borrowing.

        Rapid growth in investment in the NICs has been associated with re-

latively high shares of investment in GDP, financed partly by high domestic

saving rates and partly by foreign borrowing. The data for 1981 are sum-

marized in Table 5. In the first column we see that among the identified

NICs, only Brazil and Indonesia had investment rates lower than their

group averages. The 25 percent investment share for middle income develop-

ing countries is itself high by international standards.

        The second and third columns in Table 5 show how investment in

1981 was financed. The upper middle income NICs, including Malaysia, have

saving rates not much different from the group average of 24 percent.

Singapore is higher and Brazil lower. So this group experienced a higher—

than—average foreign capital inflow, as shown in the last column of Table

5. On the other hand, the lower—income NICs, including India, all have

saving rates much higher than their group average, and lower—than—average

capital inflow.

           The data of Table 5 confirm the impression that the NICs have ex-

perienced high saving rates, around 23 or 24 percent, and even higher in-

vestment rates, grouped around 28 percent or so. The difference has been

financed by foreign investment of around 5 percent of GDP. The main ex—

ceptions are Indonesia, which has on balance been investing abroad, and

Brazil, with lower rates of investment and saving. Thus in general in-

ternational capital has flowed toward countries with high investment

          The consequences of this pattern of investment—led growth partly

financed by foreign borrowing are summarized in the debt and debt service

data of Table 6. The first two columns show external public and publicly—

guaranteed debt in billions of dollars in 1970 and 1981. The middle two

columns show this debt as a fraction of GDP. The last two columns show

the debt service ratio to export earnings. Since the data covers public

debt only, they seriously understate total national foreign debt in coun-

tries with extensive borrowing by the private sector, such as Brazil and

Mexico.

          While Brazil, Mexico, and Argentina do not stand out in the columns

showing debt—GNP ratios, they do stand out in the debt—service data, re-

flecting their lower levels of exports relative to GNP. All of the upper

middle income NICs show increases in the debt—GNP ratio from 1970 to 1980.

among them, Hong Kong and Singapore have markedly low debt—GNP and es-

pecially debt service ratios. Thailand and the Philippines also show in-

creases in both ratios from 1970 to 1981. The exceptions are India, with

a marked decrease in both ratios, Colombia, with debt and GNP growing at

the same rate from 1970 to 1981 and the debt service ratio falling, and
                                                                                   17.

Indonesia with a falling debt—GNP ratio and a rising debt service    ratio.
       It is clear from the data of Table 6 that while in general the

NICs have grown with foreign borrowing, their debt positions in the early

1980s varied significantly, from the low—exposure positions of Hong Kong,

Sinapore, and Malaysia, to the crisis conditions of Argentina; Brazil,

and Mexico. As we see below, U.S.   exports   are relatively more oriented

toward.the Latin American NICs, and Japan's toward the Asian NICs.

Thus while the U.S. economy has become more interdependent with the NICs

through trade, the Latin American orientation of its exports leaves it

more sensitive than Europe or Japan to a Latin American debt squeeze.


3.     The Structure of OECD Exports.

3.1    Introduction.


       During the past two decades, the share of U.S. exports going to the

NICs has increased substantially, while the NICs share of Japanese exports

has remained constant, and the NIC's share of European exports has de-

creased. In the the U.S. case, the NIC's share of each one—digit SITC

category of manufactures exports has risen. By 1981 the NICs absorbed

31 percent of U.S. exports of chemicals and 22 percent of U.S. exports of

capital goods, the two biggest single U.S. export categories. Overall,

by 1981 the NICs share of manufactured exports was 25 percent for Japan,

21 percent for the U.S., 13 percent for OECD Europe, and 9 percent for

the EEC. These data reflect one aspect of the increasing interdependence

of the U.S. and Japanese economies with the rapidly—growing developing

countries, especially as compared with Europe.
                                                                         19.




         In this section we summarize the comparative data on U.S.,

Japanese, and European exports to the NICs, especially the Asian NICs.

We begin by looking at the data disaggregated by one—digit SITC group

and destination, and then look at the distribution across commodity

groups of the exports of manufactures of each of the three main OECD

areas.


3.2.     Distribution of Total Exports and Total Manufactures
         Exports by Destination.

         The evolution of exports and their fraction going to the NICs and

the Asian NICs from 1964 to 1981 is shown for OECD Europe and the EEC,

the U.S., and Japan in Table 7 for total exports and Table 8 for total

manufactures exports. Intra—area trade has been excluded from the Euro-

pean data to make them comparable with the U.S. and Japanese data. Thus

EEC exports can be larger than OECD Europe exports because of the exclu-

sion of EEC exports to other European countries from the OECD Europe

data. The EEC here is the Community of nine countries, before the acces-

sion of Greece.

         In Table 7 we see that U.S. total exports grew a little less ra-

pidly than Europes from 1964 to 1981. In 1964 the totals for the U.S.

and OECD Europe are nearly equal, but in 1981, U.S. exports were 84 per-

cent of OECD Europe's. The differential growth took place during the

1964—73 period of rapid European growth; the ratio of U.S. exports to

European exports has stayed constant at about 85 percent since 1973.

Japan's total exports have grown much faster than Europe's or those of

the U.S., as is well known. In 1964 Japan's exports were about 25 per-

cent of the U.S. total; this ratio rose to 52 percent in 1973 and 67
                                                                        20.

percent in 1981. This growth of Japanese and European exports relative

to the U.S. was a natural result of recovery and development in Europe

and Japan, as discussed in Branson (1981).

        More interesting here is the distribution of exports by destina-

tion. The NIC share of OECD Europe and EEC exports fell from 1964 to

1973, and then rose a bit to 12.7 percent for OECD Europe and 9.3 percent

for the EEC by 1981. The NIC share of Japanese exports has remained at

about 25 percent from 1964 to 1981. The NIC share of U.S. exports was

about 16 percent in 1964 and 1973, but grew to 21 percent by 1981. Three

initial observations can be made from the data of Table 7. First, the

shares of European and Japanese exports going to the NICs have remained

roughly constant, low for Europe and high for Japan. Second, the NIC

share of U.S. exports has increased markedly since 1973. Third, about

half the 21 percent of U.S. exports to the NICs go to Asia, the other

half to Latin America.

        The distributional pattern of total manufactures exports, shown

in Table 8, is similar to the pattern in Table 7. Comparison of the two

tables shows that in 1981 manufactures account for 95 percent of Japanese

exports, 82 percent of OECD exports, and 71 percent of U.S. exports.

Agriculture and raw materials account for a higher fraction of U.S. ex-

ports than they do in Europe or Japan.

        The share of European and EEC manufactures exports going to the

NICs fell from 1964 to 1973, and then rose a bit to 1981. The NEC share

of Japanese manufactures exports stayed at about 27 percent for 1964 to

1973, and fell to 24.4 percent in 1981. The NIC share of U.S. exports

of manufactures fell a bit from 1964 to 1973, but then increased sharply

to   nearly 22 percent by 1981, with nearly half going to the Asian MICs.

           The fraction of U.S. manufactures exports going to the incipient

NICs in 1964 was the same as OECD Europe's. But as the NICs grew, the

share of U.S. manufactures exports to them also grew. By 1981 this share

was similar to the NEC share of Japanese manufactures exports, with the

U.S. relatively more concentrated in Latin America, and Japan in Asia.


3.3.       Disaggregation of the Distribution of Manufactures
           Exports by Destination.


           The distribution of manufactures exports by (approximately) one—

digit SITC code is shown in Tables 9—13 for Europe, Japan, and the U.S.

The exact definition of the categories is given in the note to Table 14.

Rather than discuss each table exhaustively, I will attempt to bring for-

ward the major points.

           Beginning with chemicals in Table 9, we see that the U.S. and

Europe are major exporters, and Japan is not. The NIC share of U.S.

chemicals exports is twice that of OECD Europe, at 30.9 percent, and

Japanese exports are highly concentrated on the Asian NICs. In Table 10

we see that Europe is the biggest exporter of industrial materials, with

Japan second and the U.S. third. The NIC share of Japan's exports is

high and Europe's low, with both concentrated on the Asian NICs. The NEC

share of U.S. exports is intermediate, and is concentrated on Latin

America.

           The important category of capital goods is shown in Table 11. As

the NICs industrialize, they import capital goods. In 1981, U.S. and

European exports of capital goods were about the same——$82.2 billion for

the U.S. and $84.7 billion for Europe——and Japanese exports were $51.7

billion.

           Both the growth since 1973 and the distribution of these exports

are interesting. As we see in Table 14 below, capital goods are 51.4

percent of U.S., 38.6 percent of European, and 35.7 percent of Japanese

manufactures exports in 1981. First, let us compare OECD Europe and the

U.S. In 1973 European capital goods exports were 13 percent greater than

the U.S., and the NIC share of European exports was also greater than

that of U.S. exports. By 1981 European exports were 3 percent greater

than the U.S., and the NIC share of U.S. exports was greater than that of

European exports, with the U.S. relatively concentrated in Latin America.

           Now, let us compare Japan and the U.S. In 1973 Japanese exports

of capital goods were 53 percent of the U.S.; by 1981 this ratio rose to

63 percent. Japan's exports remained highly concentrated on the Asian

NICs. The total of NIC share of U.S. capital goods exports grew faster

than that of Japan, but the U.S. also grew more concentrated on Latin

America.

           Thus in capital goods exports, U.S. total growth from 1973 to 1981

was slower than Japan's but faster than Europe's. The growth of U.S. ex-

ports to the NICs was about the same as that of Japan, but is significantly

greater than that of Europe. This suggests that the U.S. was maintaining

its competitive position vis—a—vis Japan, and both were improving relative

to Europe in capital goods. But the concentration of the U.S. on the

Latin American NICs, combined with the debt crisis of Argentina, Brazil,

and especially Mexico, provides a serious short—run threat to this other-

wise optimistic assessment of the U.S. position.

        Exports of consumder goods are shown in Table 12. Here the U.S.

was a major exporter after World War II, but returned to -its normal posi-

tion of net importer as Europe and Japan grew. This restoration of the

pie—war pattern of trade is described in Branson (1981, 1983). By 1981

Europe was the largest exporter, Japan second, and the U.S. third. The

NIC share of U.S. exports was close to that of Japanese exports, though,

much higher than that of European exports, with the U.S. concentrated on

Latin American and Japan in Asia.

        Finally, exports of other manufactured products are shown in Table

13. These include military equipment and automototive products. [Note:

These will be presented separately in the revised version of this paper.]

Here, as in consumer goods, Japan is the largest exporter, followed by

Europe and then the U.S. The U.S., however, has the largest fraction

going to the NICs, heavily concentrated on Latin America. The NIC share

of U.S. exports rose from 1973 to 1981, while their share of European and

Japanese exports fell.


3.4.    Distribution of Manufactures Exports by Commodity Group.

        The evolution of the distribution of each areas' exports of manu-

factures across commodity group is shown in Table 14. This table gives

the distribution of the totals from Table 7 across the one—digit catego-

ries of Tables 9—13.

        The main impression one gets from Table 14 is the relatively static

composition of OECD Europe's and the EEC's manufactures exports from 1964

to 1981, compared especially with the large changes in this composition

for Japan, with the U.S. in between. The share of industrial materials

(SITC 6) in OECD exports fell from 27.6 percent in 1964 to 23.9 percent

in 1981, while the share of capital goods (SITC 7) rose from 33.8 percent

to 38.6 percent. The other categories remained roughly constant.

        The composition of U.S. manufactures exports is dominated by a

high and rising share of capital goods (STTC 7), from 45.9 percent in

1964 to 51.4 percent in 1981. The shares of industrial materials (STETC 6)

and consumer goods (SITC 8) fell across this period.

        The structure of Japanese manufactures exports shows major changes

in all categories from 1964 to 1981. The biggest changes are the contin-

uous rise in the share of other manufactures (mainly autos) (SITC 9), the

jump in the share of capital goods (SITC 7) from 25.4 percent in 1964 to

35.2 percent in 1973, with a much slower increase after 1973, and the de-

crease in the share of industrial materials, which dominated the distri-

bution in 1964.

        Comparison of the structure of manufactures exports in 1981 across

the three major areas shows Japan with a significantly lower share in chem-

icals (SITC 5), and higher share in other manufactures (mainly autos)

(SITC 9) than the U.S. or Europe, and the U.S. with a significantly higher

share in capital goods (SITC 7) than Europe or Japan. In a sense, rela-

tive to the other areas, Japan seems to be specializing in SITC 9, and

the U.S. in SITC 7, with no single commodity group standing out in OECD

Europe or the EEC.

3.5     Conclusion.


        In Table 11 we saw that a high and rising share of U.S. capital

goods exports goes to the NICs. This share reached 22 percent in 1981,

with 9.7 percent going to the Asian NICs, and 11.3 percent to Latin America.

Then in Table 14 we saw that U.S. exports of manufactures are dominated by

capital goods exports to a degree that no one—digit commodity reaches in

Europe of Japan. By l98l over half of U.S. exports of manufactures

were capital goods.

        Thus rapid growth and high levels of investment in the NICs have

been associated with rapid growth and concentration in U.S. exports of

capital goods, and this association seems strongest with the Latin Ameri-

can NICs. This has contributed to an increasing interdependence of the

U.S. economy with the NICs, an interdependence that could have important

implications for U.S. foreign economic policy.

4.      The Structure of OECD Imports.

4.1.    Introduction.

        There have been two striking developments (aside from OPEC) in the

structure of OECD imports from the leading developing countries in the two

decades since 1964. The first has been the change in the structure of

European and U.S. imports of manufactured goods, mainly away from indus-

trial supplies nd materials and toward consumer goods, capital goods, and

automotive products. The other has been the rise of the NICs, especially

since 1970, as the source of manufactured imports to Europe and the U.S.

This has been most striking in consumer goods, where the NICs provided

nearly 40 percent of European imports and 50 percent of U.S. imports by

1980.

        As is well—known, the level of Japanese manufactures imports re-

mains low relative to the U.S. and Europe. Basically, the Japanese eco-

nomy exports manufactures and imports non—manufactures due to its rela-

tively poor resource base. Fully 95 percent of Japanese exports are man-

ufactures, but only 21 percent of Japanese imports. Comparable numbers

for the U.S. are 70 percent on the export side and 55 percent on the im-

port side. However, the fraction of Japanese and U.S. total manufactures

imports coming from the NICs are almost the same, a bit over 20 percent.

As on the export side, the proportion of European manufactures imports

coming from the NICs is smaller, under 15 percent in 1980.

        The evolution of total imports, total imports less fuel, and total

manufactures imports, and their distribution by source, is shown in
                                                                         35.




Tables 15—17 for OECD Europe, the U.S., and Japan. [Note: Tables 15—23

will be up—dated to 1981 and to include EEC in revision. The import

tape was not available when this was written.]. The total import data

are sufficiently influenced by oil prices since 1973 that we will begin

by focusing on Table 16, which gives total imports less fuel.

        In Table 16, we see that U.S. and Japanese imports grew much

faster than European imports from 1964 to 1973. Then from 1973 to 1980

growth rates were much more equal, with European imports growing fastest

and the U.S. slowest. The fraction of European non—fuel imports coming

from the identified NICs rose slowly throughout the period to 17.3 per-

cent 1964—80. The share of the NICs in U.S. imports was constant for

1964 to 1973, and then increased significantly to 23 percent by 1980.

The share of the NICs on Japanese non—fuel imports increased rapidly

over the entire period, reaching 40 percent by 1980. In contrast to the

export data, on the import side at this level of aggregation, both Europe

and the U.S. imports from the NICs are relatively more concentrated on

Asia than are the Japanese.

        The data on total manufacturing imports are summarized in Table

17. There we see the difference between the levels of imports of Europe

and the U.S., and of Japan. However from 1964 to 1980, Japanese manufac-

tured imports grew at the same rate as those of the U.S.; in 1964 their

ratio is 0.21, by 1980 it was 0.22. European manufactures imports grew

faster, though, especially after 1973. The ratio of European to U.S. man-

ufactures imports rose from 0.79 in 1964 to 0.8.1 in 1973, and then jumped

to 1.05 in 1980.

        The proportion of manufactures imports coming from the NICs has

increased over time in all three areas, with the biggest increase in

Japan, especially from 1964 to 1973, and the smallest in Europe. By 1980,

roughly 20—21 percent of U.S. and Japanese manufactured imports came from

the NICs, as compared with 15 percent of European imports. Again, in con-

trast to the export pattern, all three areas' imports of manufactures from

the NICs are concentrated in Asia, relative to Latin America.


4.3.    Disaggregation of the Distribution of Manufactures
        Imports by Origin.

        The distributions of manufactures imports for the one—digit SITC

categories are shown in Tables 18—22. The categories are the same as for

exports; details are given in the note to Table 14.

        Chemical imports, summarized in Table 18, are small, with the

largest total $14.6 billion in Europe in 1980. Relative to the other

areas, the U.S. has a higher proportion coming from the Latin American

NICs, and Japan from the Asian NICs, but the numbers are small. Imports

of industrial supplies are summarized in Table 19. There we see low num-

bers for Japan relative to the other areas, with a high concentration on

the Asian NICs. By 1980 Europe was a bigger importer than the U.S., but

they had similar contributions. Table 20 summarizes the distribution of

imports of capital goods. The world totals are similar to those of in-

dustrial supplies, with OECD Europe imports in 1980 of $48.6 billion,

compared to $37.8 billion for the U.S., and $8.7 billion for Japan.

There is a significant difference in the distribution by source, however,

both across importing areas in Table 20, and by comparison with indus-

trial supplies in Table 19. In 1980, 22 percent of U.S. imports of
                                                                                40.

comparison with industrial supplies in Table 18. In 1980, 22 percent of

U.S. imports of capital goods came from the NTCs, 16 percent from Asia.

The proportions for Europe and Japan are much smaller, with the Japanese

share for Latin America all coming from Argentina. [Note: We are check-

ing the data to see if this is a good observation] .   The U.S. is a much

bigger importer of capital goods from the NICs, especially in Asia, than

are Europe or Japan.

        The distribution of consumer goods imports is shown in Table 21.

Here the total imports are smaller than for industrial supplies or capital

goods, but the concentration on the NICs, especially in Asia, is much

stronger. Out of roughly equal total consumer goods imports of $23—24

billion in 1980, nearly half of U.S. imports and 40 percent of European

imports come from the NICs, mostly from Asia. The U.S. share has risen

much more rapidly over time than the European share. U.S. and European

imports of consumer goods from the NICs are greater than any of the other

one—digit categories as a result of this concentration. Japan also has

a relatively high share of consumer goods imports from the Asian NICs,

but out of a very small total.

        Imports of the other category, which includes arms and autos, are

summarized in Table 22. Here we see the relatively high level of U.S.

imports in 1980, and the rapid growth of both European and U.S. imports

over the entire period since 1964. The NIC shares of these imports are

very small, however. NIC exports of manufactures to the OECD countries

are concentrated in industrial supplies, capital, goods, and especially

consumer goods, with very small NIC export participation in chemicals

or autos.

4.4       Distribution of Manufactures Imports by
          Commodity Group.


          The distributions across commodity groups are given in Table 23.

Here the main impression is of change in the structure of manufactures

imports over time in Europe and the U.S., and stability in Japan, at

least since 1973. By 1980 the U.S. structure was more "balanced" than

that of Europe or Japan. The distributional peaks are 34 percent in

European capital goods imports, 32 percent for industrial supplies in

Japan, and 29 percent for industrial supplies in Europe and capital goods

in Japan. (Remember that in all cases the Japanese totals are relatively

small.)

          In Europe, the major movement has been away from imports of in-

dustrial supplies, with a share falling from 60.5 percent in 1964 to

29.3 percent in 1980, and to a lesser extent chemicals, where the share

fell from 17.1 percent in 1964 to 10.7 percent in 1973. The biggest in-

crease in import share in Europe came in capital goods, from 5.3 percent

in 1963 to 34 percent by 1980. Smaller but significant increases came in

their shares of consumer goods and other (auto) imports.

          In the U.S., the main shifts in the structure of manufactures im-

ports came between 1964 and 1973. In this period the share of industrial

supplies fell from 46.9 to 27.8 percent, while the share of capital goods

rose from 15.6 to 23.9 percent, and that of other manufacture (autos)

rose from 14.6 to 26.7 percent. Since 1973 the composition of U.S. man-

ufactured exports has been relatively stable, and more balanced across

categories than in Europe or Japan.

4.5     Conclusion.


        Among the OECD areas, Europe and the U.S. are the major importers

of manufactured goods, and thus the principal potential markets for the

NICs. In Table 17, we se that while European total manufactures imports

exceed those of the U.S. in 1980, U.S. imports from both Latin American

and Asian NICs—.-$5.9 and 21.5 billion respectively——are greater than those

of Europe. The U.S. is the largest importer of manufactures from the

NICs, especially in Asia, of the three main OECD areas.

        Despite the relatively balanced structure of U.S. imports across

commodities, the concentration on the NICs as a source, especially in

consumer goods but also in capital goods, gives this result. In 1980, the

shares of consumer goods imports in U.S. and European total manufactures

imports were about the same, 17.1 and 16.7 percent respectively. But the

U.S. concentration on the NICs, with a 48.9 percent share of the U.S.

market, compared to 39.7 in Europe, resulted in U.S. imports from the

NICs of $11.5 billion in consumer goods. This was the largest single

NIC export category to an OECD area in 1980. The $10.3 billion of Asian

NIC consumer good exports to the U.S. was the largest single category for

that sub—group in 1980.

        Thus on the side of NIC exports of manufactures to the OECD, the

U.S. is the largest importer, in spite of (a) a larger import total in

Europe, and (b) more balance of U.S. imports across commodities. This

imbalance in U.S. imports in favor of the NICs as a source adds to the

impression of a growing interdependence of the U.S. economy with the NICs,

as an exporter, mainly of capital goods mainly to Latin America, and an

importer of consumer goods, mainly from Asia.

5.      U.S. Trade with the NICs.


        The previous sections of this paper have compared the trade pat—

terns of the U.S., Japan, and Europe with the NICs, both Asian and Latin

American. Here we focus in more detail on the structure of U.S. trade by

one—digit SITC category with the individual NICs.

        First, in Table 24, we show the evolution of total U.S. manufac-

tures trade by commodity group from 1973 to 1980. The data in nominal

terms can be seen in Tables 14 and 23. In 1973 U.S. manufactures exports

were $46.5 billion, and imports $46.8 billion——almost exactly balanced.

In 1980, exports had increased to $149.4 billion and imports to $136.2

billion, for a surplus of $13.2 billion. But much of that increase was

inflation, so in Table 24 we show that the data deflated to 1973 prices.

The surplus on overall manufactures exports, in real terms, went from

zero to 6.8 billion (1973 prices) by 1980. Over a period when the U.S.

economy grew by about 2.5 percent per year (on average) in real terms,

manufactures exports grew by 9.8 percent a year, and manufactures imports

grew by 8.6 percent per year. This is hardly a picture of a "deindus—

trializing" economy; rather it reflects a rapid change in the structure of

U.S. industrial production, with export sectors drawing resources from

shrinking, import—competing sectors.

        The structure of U.S. trade in manufactures with the NICs in 1980

is shown in Table 25. There the countries are separated between the

Asian and Latin American NICs, and within each group, the NICs and the

"new NICs." At the bottom we present an ASEAN aggregate——Singapore,

Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand. Data are given for
                                                                                 50.

each of the one—digit SITC categories, and for the total. The balance on

the upper right—hand corner of the table is the $13.2 billion surplus al-

ready mentioned. The first row shows the structure of U.S. world trade

in manufactures: surpluses in chemicals and capital goods, deficits in

industrial materials, consumer goods, and "other."

        Let us focus first on the differences in trade patterns with the

Latin American and Asian NICs. In aggregate, U.S. trade with the Asian

NICs follows the broad pattern of U.S. world trade, except for balance in

SITC 9. But with the Latin American NICs, the U.S. has a surplus in

every category except consumer goods, where trade was balanced. Overall,

the U.S. had a deficit in manufactures trade of $6.3 billion with the

Asian NICs, and a surplus of $12.2 billion with the Latin Americans.

Mexico alone provided a $6.9 billion surplus to the U.S. in 1980, the

largest component being capital goods. This highlights the exposure of

U.S. trade to the debt situation in Latin America.

        Another interesting distinction appears when we separate the Asian

NICs into ASEAN and the Far Eastern countries of Hong Kong, S. Korea, and

Taiwan. In 1980 the Far Eastern NICs had an aggregate surplus of $9.3

billion in trade in manufactures with the U.S., while ASEAN had a $2.5

billion deficit, compared with the Latin American deficit of $12.2 billion.

On balance, the U.S. exports manufactures to Latin America, the Latin

American NICs sell non—manufactures (especially Mexican oil) into the

world market, the Far Eastern NICs buy non—manufactures and sell manufac-

tures to the U.S. A similar triangle could be drawn between the U.S.,

ASEAN, and the Far Eastern NICs, with Indonesian oil replacing Mexican.

These trade patterns highlight the importance of Latin America and ASEAN

as U.S. export markets, and the U.S. as an export market for the Far

Eastern NICs.

        The data of Table 25 thus show interesting patterns of imbalance

in U.S. manufactures trade both across commodities and geography. Fol-

lowing its lines of comparative advantage, the U.S. is a major exporter

of capital goods, chemicals, and military equipment, and importer of in-

dustrial materials, consumer goods, and autos. Net exports to the NICs

alone provide half the U.S. surplus on chemicals and one—quarter on

capital goods; the Asian NICs, mainly the Far Eastern ones supply three—

quarters of the U.S. deficit on consumer goods. U.S. trade in manufac-

tures has become increasingly interdependent with the three groups of

NICs——Latin America, ASEAN (plus India), and Far Eastern. The patterns

of interdependence are complicated, and will require increasing atten-

tion from U.S.   foreign   economic policy.
