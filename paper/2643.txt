                TAX AVERSION,   OPTIMAL TAX RATES, AND INDEXATION


                                     ABSTRACT




Taking account of the costs of tax evasion and avoidance activity

together with the governments costs of tax enforcement it is
shown that the optimal point on a stylized Laffer curve is located

on the positively sloped region,       not at the maximum point of the,

curve.   The analysis eschews the usual supply—side—type rationale

for the Laffer curve and shows that such a curve can arise solely

as a consequence of the optimizing tax aversion activity of a

utility maximizing economic agent.        The analysis further implies

that indexation to inflation     may   be warranted by considerations of

economic efficiency.

     Tax evasion,   the illegal underreporting of income,   is   now

recognized to be significant and growing in a number of
industrialized economies.'    It encompasses understatement and

deception about income producing activities that are reported on
tax returns, as well as the non—reporting of income producing

activities in the so—called "underground economy."     Tax avoidance,

the legal use of tax loopholes, has long been a common practice

afforded by a myriad of tax laws.    Both tax avoidance and tax

evasion activity, which we lump together under the term tax

aversion,   occasion real resource costs.   An accounting of the

costs to society of running a tax system should include the cost

of tax aversion activity as well as the governmentts cost of tax

enforcement.    Recognizing both kinds of costs, one of the main

purposes of this paper is to present an analysis that indicates
that the optimal point on a stylized Laffer curve occurs on the

positively sloped region—-not at the maximum point of the curve.
Wiile concern regarding the possibility of being on the negatively

sloped region of a Laffer curve is not misplaced, our analysis

suggests that such concern should properly extend to the
positively sloped region above the optimal point as well.        Given

this result, our analysis suggests that indexation to inflation of

a marginally progressive income tax structure   may   be warranted by

considerations of economic efficiency.

     Our analysis eschews the usual supply—side-type rationale for
the Laffer curve which is variously based on the incentive effects

of tax rates on total output and tax revenue,    typically by way of
the labor—leisure and/or saving and investment—capital
                                                                       2

accumulation decisions.2 Rather we show that a Laffer curve can

arise solely as a consequence of the optimizing tax aversion

behavior of a utility maximizing economic agent.      That is,

changing tax rates yield a Laffer curve eyen when the economic
agent's total income from all activities is assumed constant, or
in other words, even when the usual tax effects on the labor—

leisure decision are ignored.     At the appropriate point we will

indicate why recognition of the usual effects does not modify our

conclusions in any substantive way.
     In section I we show   how   the relationship between the

statutory tax rate and optimizing tax aversion behavior gives rise
to an expected tax rate.    Section II examines the determination of

the optimal level of tax enforcement and the optimal tax rate,       and

considers the nature of the deadweight losses that can arise when
the statutory tax rate is set too high.      Section III shows how a

marginally progressive income tax structure and inflation can
generate such losses.   Section IV concludes with a comparison of
the relative merits of two alternative strategies for avoiding

these losses: periodic discretionary tax cuts, and income tax

indexation.   Section V summarizes and concludes the paper.



I.   Tax Aversion Behavior and the Expected Tax Rate

     The ensuing analysis focuses on the utility maximizing

representative economic agent who engages in tax aversion, which

encompasses both tax avoidance and evasion behavior      Tax aversion

has associated costs such as, for instance, the use of the agent's
                                                                       3


own time to investigate and carry out aversion activities, and/or
the hiring of expert advice and assistance provided by accountants

and tax attorneys. The extent to which the     optimizing   economic

agent finds it worthwhile to engage in tax aversion is assumed to

depend on the relationship between the statutory tax rate, the
costs of tax aversio., the probability that tax evasion will     be
detected (not avoidance which is legal), and the fine if
detected.



l.a   The Effect of Tax Rates on Tax Aversion

      The literature on the theoretical   analysis of tax evasion

within an expected utility framework is fairly extensive; that on
tax avoidance is less          A case can be made that the two

activities should be analyzed jointly.     Cross and Shaw (1982) have

argued that a joint analysis is called for because of the

possibilities of substitutability and complementarity. For
instance, any reduction in the probability of detection of tax
evasion or in the penalty for evasion will raise the rate of
return on evasion relative to that on avoidance activity.

Similarly, any increase in the availability of avoidance loopholes
will likely increase avoidance relative to evasion activity.

Furthermore, Cross and Shaw point out that because certain evasion

(avoidance)   activities can affect the marginal cost of avoidance

(evasion)   activities,   the costs of engaging in evasion and

avoidance should be modeled as interdependent. For instance, an

accountant or attorney paid to advise on tax avoidance might
provide information on tax evasion possibilities,                  unwittingly or
otherwise.

      In Cross and Shaw's analysis of tax aversion expected utility

depends on both tax avoidance and tax evasion activities with
their interdependent costs to the taxpayer represented by a joint

cost function.       Assume that income Y is the agent's total income

from all activities,       earned in both the underground and above

ground economy, in both legal and illegal activities.                   Given a

proportional income tax rate t, assuming declining absolute risk
aversion, and that total income Y is exogenous, expected utility
is



(1)   E(U)       (l-p)U(V) + pU(X)



where the net income of the taxpayer if evasion is not detected is



(2)   V       Y(1—r) + (91Y +          —
                                           C(e1Y,    e2Y)


while if evasion is detected it is



(3)   X   =   Y(1—t) +   re1y   + te2Y(i—F)   —
                                                  C(e11,    e2Y)


where 0 < p. t, e1,    < 1; F > 1;                  > 0 and                         (

lowers (raises) the marginal cost of tax avoidance and causes an
increase (reduction)                   in avoidance activity.    This result is of

interest in view of some recent empirical findings by Clotfelter
                                   (l985). Using over 47,000 individual         U.S. tax
(1983) and Slemrod

returns for 1969 ciotfelter estimates the elasticity of tax
evasion with respect to marginal tax rates to be significantly

positive.             Using over 23,000 U.S. tax returns for 1977 Slemrod has
difficulty separating income from tax rate effects and concludes

(p.    238)       simply that the tendency for tax evasion increases for
higher income, higher tax rate households."                      Hence in the analysis

I.b      The Tax Rate—Expected Tax Rate Relationship

         The fraction of income that escapes taxation due to tax

aversion activity equals                     1 —    —
                         01 + 82.  Hence •       81   82 is the
fraction of income not subject to tax aversion. The expected tax

revenue from the representative economic agent is given by


                       +   rYp[     +
                                        82F]
                                                =   roY

and p, noting that 81 and 82 are functions of r, F, and p as

described above. Hence the tax aversion behavior of the

representative economic agent is defined by a tax aversion
function e(t, F, p), such that                        <   .   es.,   e > 0,   given that

and that (pF — 1)             < 0: e(-r,       F, p) is a decreasing function of

r    such that 0 <         e(-r,   F, p) < i.8

         The product of the statutory tax rate r and the tax aversion

function defines the expected tax rate

It is   the       fraction of income9 the government expects to collect in

tax revenue from the economic agent engaged in the optimal amount
of tax aversion for given levels of the statutory tax rate                                r,    the

fine F imposed if tax evasion is detected, and the probability p

of detection.          In general, for any tax aversion function Ott, F, p)

there is some level of the statutory tax rate r which yields                                   a

maximum expected tax rate, given the values of F and p.                             At that

value of      r

                                te')   <   o.10 For example, for given levels                      of

F   and p the relationship between                  r    and re(r, F, p) is represented

by a curve such as Oml in Figure                    1.    The maximum expected tax rate

             F, p) occurs at the statutory tax rate                        where    (8)   holds.

II.     The Optimal Level of Tax Enforcement and the                       Opmal      Tax Rate

        The shape and position of the Laffer curve in Figure 1 and

hence the specific value of                 r   which gives the maximum expected tax

rate is a function of the government's tax                         enforcement variables——
the fine F        and the probability           of detection p of tax evasion.                     An

increase in F and/or p shifts the curve upward, such as from Oml

The optimal setting         o   the tax enforcement   variables F and p as
well as the optimal setting of the statutory tax rate t depends on

the government's        desired expected tax rate, since it is the

expected tax rate that determines the amount of tax revenue the
government     expects to collect from the representative economic
agent.



II.a     Optimal    r, F, and   p Given   the Desired Expected Tax Rate

       Here we make the following assumption:          the government first

decides on the level of its total spending on all activities,
aside from tax enforcement expenditure,          and then determines the
level of the expected tax rate desired to finance such spending.11

The process and objectives which determine the government's total

spending are, like the level of its desired expected tax rate,

simply taken as given for the purposes of this analysis.
       Given the objective of establishing           the desired expected tax

rate, what is the optimal level of government spending on tax

enforcement     activity, per the representative economic agent, and
the optimal setting of the statutory tax rate?             From   socieyj
perspective,       it is that setting of F, p, and t which minimizes the

total of the government's          tax enforcement    cost per representative
                                                                                         9

economic agent          jj the         cost of tax aversion activity incurred by
the representative economic agent (the C(.,.) function in

equations        (2)    and (3)),      since the latter cost, like the former,
uses up resources otherwise available to society.                      The

government's           enforcement      cost per representative economic agent

may be represented by the function g(F,                   p)   where
                                                                         g,
>   0, reflecting the           assumptions      that such costs rises at an

increasing rate with             F,    the fine imposed on tax evaders, and         p.

the probability that an evader will be detected.                       Larger fines are

likely to involve the government in more litigation and lengthier

court contestations,             while raising the probability of detection

requires the employment of more tax agents and an increase in the

frequency and/or intensity of tax audits.                      The representative

economic agent's tax aversion cost function C(.,.) can be written,

using the results             (4),     (5), and (6), as



      C(r, F, p) —            C[e1,(r,      F, p), e2(t, F, p)]

agent, subject to achieving a desired expected tax rate, is

        The interpretation of       (16)   is facilitated     by Figure 2 where

the horizontal line at K represents the desired level of the

expected tax rate.          It intersects the economic agent's Laffer

curve at points a and b.         The slope of the Laffer curve, given by

the left side of (16) (see (8)), is positive at point                 a    and

corresponds    to   a   cost (tax enforcement     plus tax aversion cost)

minimizing position when }g,}        and

be a mininun cost position however.             For consider what happens to

costs (g(F,p)       +   C(t, F, p) in (11)) given F and p, which determine

the position of the Laffer curve, if at point b the statutory tax

rate t is reduced below              The only cost affected is the cost of
                               tb
tax aversion C(r, F, p) because t doesn't appear in g(F, p).

Since       > 0 the cost of tax      aversion ie reduced when          r   is

lowered, and the same expected tax rate K can be realized at a

lower statutory tax rate                                  to point a on the
                                ta    corresponding

positively sloped portion of the Laffer curve.
        It should be emphasized that a narrower cost accounting——say

from the tax collector's        perspective——would ignore the cost of tax
aversion activity to the economic agent represented by the C(w, F, p)
function.      Given this narrower perspective,            C(t, F, p) is dropped

from (11), and it must be true from (14) that the optimal setting
of r occurs where the slope of the Laffer curve, given by [e(r, F,

p) +           equals zero.      In that case the optiaal        r   corresponds    to
        t9].

tax rate, the position of the curve of course deternined by the

optimal setting of F and p.    By contrast, for    a   complete cost

accounting from society's perspective it is necessary to take
account of both   th3overnment 's cost   of   enforci_the       tax code on

the representative economic a2pnt, and the cost of the a2ent's tax

aversion activity; then the optimal settingef the statutory tax
rate will correjQgndto a point on the positively-s loped region of
the representative economic ggent's_Laffer curve.

       Note that these results derive solely from tax aversion
behavior since our analysis has completely ignored the tax effects

on the labor—leisure decision and hence on Y, which has been
assumed constant.    However our conclusions   are not affected in any

substantive way when we allow y to be affected by       t, F,   and p.13


II.b    The Maximum Optimal Expected Tax Rate

       We have examined the optimal setting of    r, F, and     p given a
desired level of the expected tax rate.       But what is the maximum

expected tax rate that can be achieved optimally? Does the
maximum expected tax rate that can be achieved optimally lie along
the positively sloped region of the representative economic

agent's Laffer curve, or does it occur at the maximum point?
       To answer this question we need to determine the maximum

expected tax rate net of tax enforcement      and tax aversion costs

that can be imposed on the representative economic agent.           The

expected tax rate minus enforcement   and aversion costs is given by
                                                                                               13

       According to (18) and (19) the maximws expected tax rate
can be achieved optimally occurs when tax enforcement effort,

implemented             by increasing F and p, has been carried to the point
where the expected marginal tax revenue, teF and re, equals the

marginal cost of tax enforcement plus the marginal cost of tax
aversion activity__(g + CF) for F and (g + C) for p. Recalling

(20).     But observe in    (20)   that (s(t, F, p) ÷ te') > 0, since               >

0, so that the setting of t that gives the maximum expected tax

rate that can be achieved optimally must lie along the positivell

sloped region of the Laffer curve, such as at point a in Figure 3
        As the curve indicates, it is possible to have a higher

expected tax rate than that at point a sImply by setting the
statutory tax rate higher than               But the additional tax

aversion cost (since          > 0)   required to achieve it would be
greater than the additional expected tax revenue it would
generate.     Note that if tax aversion costs are ignored, so that

only the narrower cost accounting of the tax collector's
perspective obtains, then C(t, F, p) is dropped from             (17)   and the

apparent "optimal" setting of t corresponds           to the maximum point        m
on the Laffer curve in Figure 3, since (e(t, F, p) +             tS) then
equals zero by      (20).

        Finally,   consider the case where          < }C,1 and    }g     <

Then the marginal costs of increasing F and p, the right-hand
sides of    (18)   and (19), are negative——governmentenforcement             costs

increase less than tax aversion costs decline.            This suggests that

the government step up enforcement           until the probability p of

detectiom of tax evasion equals         1,   and/or increase the fine F
until tax evasion activity is completely discouraged.              If C12 < 0

(for the cost function C(.,')         in (2) and (3)) is sufficiently

negative tax avoidance (a legal activity, not an object of
detection or fine) could also be eliminated.            Then the Laffer
curve would be the 45       line in Figure 3——the expected tax rate
0
                                                                      15

would equal the statutory tax for all levels of t.         On the other

hand, if the jointness of costs of tax avoidance and tax evasion

is weak or non-existent             0) then the Laffer curve would lie
                            (012
somewhere between the 45        line and the curve passing through point

a   in Figure 3.

       Generally,   it is not   a government's objective   to establish

the maximum optimal expected tax rate.       Rather government

expenditure levels determined by other objectives will dictate the
need for a given desired level of the expected tax rate and the

optimal setting of t, F, and p to satisfy equations (l2)—(l5), as
previously discussed.      However, what if the government expenditure

levels dictated by these other objectives are so high that the

given expected tax rate required to finance them exceeds the
maximum optimal expected tax rate?       Then we have the ingredients
for a structural deficit-—a situation where government

expenditures outstrip the capacity to finance them with tax
revenue.



II.c    Overshooting the Optimal Tax Rate:       A Deadweight Loss

       In the ensuing discussion we will use the term "optimal tax

rate" to refer to that value of the statutory tax rate given by

equations (12)—(15), the equations which give the optimal values
of t, F, and p for a given desired level of the expected tax rate.

       For example, in Figure 2 suppose ta is the optimal value of

the statutory tax rate and that
                                Fa and       a
                                          are the optimal settings

of F and p for achieving the given desired expected tax rate K =
                                                                                   16

Tae(t, Fa 'a'            Oml is the representative agents Laffer curve

determined by Fa and               and   a point a   on Oml corresponds    to the

optimal tax rate         ta    Note that given      a and p5 the   desired

expected tax rate K also can be achieved by setting the statutory
tax rate equal to rb corresponding to point b on Omi, giving

                         ta8(Ta F,
                     =
tbe(tb,    Fa                             a'      However,
                                             Tb is not optimal
because it gives rise to a deadweight loss to society due to the

larger tax aversion cost occasioned by tb relative to that which

occurs at    ta    since CT > 0.

        There are many other possible Laffer curves in Figure               2 (not

shown)    corresponding        to other levels of F and p, and hence many

other settings of         r   which would give the expected tax rate K.            But

none of them are optimal--they do not satisfy equations (12)-(15)
None—the—less it is true that, just like the optimal curve Omi,

each of these Laffer curves has two points——one               on positively

sloped region and one along the negative slope——correspondingto
the two levels of the statutory tax rate that yield the expected

tax rate K.       By the same argument as for the optimal curve Gal,

the lower level of t          occasions      less resource exppditure     on tax

aversion than the higher one.                Given the desired level of the

expected tax rate, for          y    Laffer curve, whether optimal by

equations (12)-(15) or not, we will refer to the lower level of t
which yields      the desired expected tax rate as the critical tax

rate.     Optimal tax rates are          a   subset of critical tax rates.     We

use such terminology in order to recognize that there are many

possible levels of tax enforcement               that are not optimal but yet
                                                                       17

admit the   possibility of attaining a given desired level of the
expected tax rate; therefore there are many possible Laffer
curves, each with its associated critical tax rate.

     In sum,   for   any given F and p and desired level of the

expected tax rate, whenever the statutory tax rate exceeds the
critical tax rate society suffers a deadweight loss—-nobody gains

—-because by reducing the statutory tax rate to the critical level
the economic agent is induced to expend fewer resources on tax
aversion activity.      Moreover, whatever the expected tax rate

levels attainable on the Laffer curve associated with the given F

and p, such expected tax rates can always be attained with lower

tax aversion costs to society by use of statutory tax rates

corresponding to the positively, as opposed to negatively,         sloped

region of the curve.


III. The Critical Tax Rate and Inflation

     Assume now that the tax structure is marginally progressive
and that tax brackets are defined according to nominal income
levels.     Also assume that the statutory tax rate   t   is   a weighted

average of the progressively higher tax rates associated with
successively higher income brackets, each bracket's tax rate
weighted by the percent of the representative economic agent's
nominal income in that bracket.       Given such a tax structure,    as is

well known,    inflation will   push the representative   economic agent

into successively     higher tax brackets, effectively subjecting an
evergrowing portion of the agent's income to higher tax rates.
                                                                              18

Because of this phenomenon,          popularly known as bracket—creep,       an

ever—increasing average income tax rate t           is   imposed on the
           14
agent.

       Such inflation generated bracket creep increases            r   along the

horizontal       axes in Figures 1-3.      The upper limit on r of course is

the statutory tax rate prevailing In the highest income tax

bracket of the marginally progressive tax structure; once reached,
t   will    cease rising despite continuing inflation.         The crucial

concern,        however   Is the   possibilityat    such   bracket_crepgn
push       r       the critical tax rate and ultimatejL onto the
                                                           This likelihood of
negatively sloped region of the affer curve.
course depends on the degree of marginal progressivity of the tax

structure as well as the position of the prevailing Laffer curve.


IV.    Discretionary Tax Cuts versus Income Tax Indexation
       One way to keep bracket creep from driving t           onto     the

negatively sloped region of the agent's Laffer curve is by
discretionary reduction of marginally progressive tax rates
whenever bracket creep pushes          r   above the critical tax rate.
                                                                             or
While such cuts could in principle maintain              r at the critical

even optimal level, given an optimal level of tax enforcement

(i.e., optimal levels of F and p), in practice inflation-generated

bracket creep operates continuously to push t above either a

critical or an optimal level while discretionary tax cuts are

typically infrequent and subject to the pressures of politics.
Hence even if   Is periodically moved back to a critical or an
                                                                       19

optimal level by discretionary tax cuts, bracket creep will assure
that   r   is almost continuously above such levels and that society

incurs the associated deadweight loss due to resource expenditure

on tax aversion activity.
       As an alternative to discretionary tax cuts, suppose the tax

brackets defined according to nominal income levels in the

marginally progressive     income tax structure are linked to real

income levels.     This can be achieved by indexing the bracket-

defining nominal income levels to the inflation rate.           In

principle such income tax indexing would allow establishment of
the optimal level of tax enforcement       in conjunction with

continuous maintenance of the optimal tax rate because it would

prevent bracket creep from driving     t   beyond thegtirnal tax rate.
       In reality, policymakers   don't know the optimal level of tax

enforcement     and hence the optimal level of t.    They don't even
know the relationship between a desired expected tax rate and the

critical tax rate needed to achieve it when government tax

enforcement     expenditures are not optimal.    Nonetheless,    whatever

the level of tax enforcement      it is still desirable to avoid

positions along the negatively sloped region of the associated
Laffer curve.      At a practical level then, it can be argued that

income tax indexing will prevent bracket creep from pushing t past

the peak of the agent's Laffer curve, or if already past it, at
least prevent further increases in the deadweight loss associated

with movement down the negatively—slopedregion of the curve.
                                                                         20



V.   Conclusion
     It has been shown that due to tax aversion behavior there is

associated with any statutory tax rate a corresponding       lower

expected tax rate, defined as the fraction of a dollar of income
that the government expects to collect in tax revenue.        Because

tax aversion behavior depends on the level of the statutory tax

rate there is some optimal level of tax enforcement       (some optimal

setting of F and p) and the statutory tax rate t    for    any

level of the expected tax rate desired by the government.          The

optimal statutory tax rate corresponds    to a point on the

positively sloped region of the economic agent's Laffer curve.
Furthermore,   there is an upper limit on the level of the expected

tax rate that the government can achieve optimally, and it too

corresponds to a point on the positively sloped region of a Laffer
curve.
     Given a desired level of the expected tax rate (assumed less

than or equal to the upper limit) and the associated optimal

setting of the statutory tax rate, society suffers deadweight
losses if the statutory tax rate is set higher than the optimal

level.   Given a marginally progressive   tax structure,    such

deadweight losses are particularly likely when there is inflation.
It may be argued that such losses are best avoided by indexing the

marginally progressive tax structure to inflation rather than by
periodically cutting statutory tax rates.

     Finally,   from an efficiency standpoint,   the proper question

is not is the statutory tax rate above the point where the Laffer

curve's slope becomes negative? Rather is the statutory tax rate
above the lower rate corresponding to the optimum point on the

positively sloped region of the curve?

     world magnitude of tax evasion.     The latest IRS report

     estimates that $90.5 billion   of federal income   tax was

     lost in the United States in 1981 due to unreported

     incomes, an amount approximately equal to 22 percant of

     total federal corporate and personal income taxes

     actually collected in 1981; $81.5 billion was due to

     unreported legal income and another $9.0 billion due to
     unreported income earned in illegal activities.     Witte

     summarized findings in several countries and reports
     that in general the Scandinavian countries, West

     Germany, and the United Kingdom have unrecorded economic

     activity (therefore untaxable) comparable to that of the
     United States where such activity amounted to

     approximately 12 percent of national income in 1979;
     such activity was estimated to equal 20—25 percent of
                                                                              2
     GNP in Italy, while for Belgiim and          France   it   was

     estimated    to be somewhere   between the estimates for the

     U.S. and Italy.

4.   Analysis focusing on tax evasion has origins in the

     expected utility analysis of Allingham and Sandso

     (1972): see, for example, Srinvasan (1973), Yitzhaki

     (1974), McCaleb (1976), Weiss (1976), Andersen (1977),

     Pencave].    (1979), Christiansen (1980), Isachsen and Strom

     (1980), Cowell (1981), Sandmo (1981), and Usher               (1986).

     An expected utility analysis of tax          avoidance     may be
     found   in   Kane and Valentini (1975) and Kane (1976).

5.   Note that the shifting between taxed and untaxed

     activities by the agent is in the analysis by virtue of
     the choice variables e1 and e2, the portions of income

     avoiding and evading tax respectively.

6.   The amounts of income avoiding and evading tax              are
     respectively denoted     A and   E by Cross    and Shaw where in

     terms of our notation A        e1y and   E     e2Y.    We express

     avoidance and evasion in terms of the fractions                   and

                 to expedite the ensuing analysis               and our use
     e2 in order
     of the concept of the expected tax rate.

7.   Some experimental evidence that there is a positive

     relationship between tax rates and tax evasion has been
     provided by Friedland, Maital, and Rutenberg (1978).
                                                                                                    24

8.    Noting that


                  =   - -—' +         (pF-1)        —
      it   follows that a sufficient condition for                                         < 0 is

      that pF <       1.       If the expected fine, pF, for tax

      avoidance is large enough, so that pF                          >       1, then there
      will be no tax aversion.                      In that case         e   =    1    for all      t.

      The condition            pF    < 1   also assures that                  >       0.
9.    Since the representative economic agent's income Y is a

      constant exogenous variable, Y is dropped from the

      ensuing discussing.                  Whenever the expected tax rate is

      mentioned       it is         the case that the statement could be
      taken to refer to the tax revenue expected to be

      collected from the representative economic agent since
      that revenue equals the agent's income Y multiplied by

      the expected tax rate re(t,                     F, p).    We will consider the

      implications of allowing Y to vary below.
10.   te(r, F, p) achieves a maximum when e(t, F, p) +
                                                                                             te =        0

      only   if            +           <   0; a sufficient condition for this
      to   occur   is that                 <   0,   given   e   <   0.
11.   We don't mean to imply that this is a realistic

      assumption about the way the government actually
      operates.       It may finance its spending in part by

      taxation and in part by bond financing or money
      creation, and it may be that its choice of how much to
                                                                                              2


      spend   is   in part dependent on concern about the implied
      size of the taxation and possible deficit financing

      required.
12.   It   can be argued that the desired expected tax rate                             K
      should be a function of              F   and p to the extent that there

      is concern to finance the government's                      tax enforcement

      efforts with tax revenue.                 Entering the desired tax rate

      K(F, p),     Ks,,
                               > 0 doesn't       affect     the   analysis     in any
                          K9
      substantive way.

13.   Allowing for such effects by explicitly recognizing Y in

      the analysis        (recall that its presence has been ignored

      since it was assumed given) and interpreting K in (11)

      as the level of tax revenue I (equals re(t,                          F, p)Y) the

      government desires to collect from the representative
      economic agent, optimization (analogous to (12)-(15))

      yields


      (16')    (e(-r,     F,   p)Y    +
                                          Yte   +   re(t,   F, p)


                                  +   te                          +   re
                      cT[-reF                             C[re                    <
                                                            g+C9

      Again by the        sante   argument as was made for (16) in

      conjunction with Figure              2    to establish the minimum cost

      position, the left side of (16'),                     which is the slope of            th
      Laffer curve, is positive at point a in Figure                          2       and again

      corresponds to the minimum cost position, no
      matter what is assumed about the signs of               r   ,
                                                                       F   , or
      It is also readily evident from the analogue to (14), which

      is

      (14')         C   —   X(e(t,   F, p)   +    +   te(r,   F, p)           = 0



      that    in the case of the narrower perspective             of the     tax
      collector where C(r, F, p) is ignored, so that C                     doesn't

      appear in (14'),       the optimal setting of           still occurs where

      the slope of the Laffer curve (the bracketed expression in

      (14')) equals zero.
14.   When Cross and Shaw        (1982)   amend the model of equations (1)-

      (3) to   specify a marginally progressive tax structure the
      ambiguity in      (4) remains, not surprisingly.            We continue        to

      assume that    e,      e   >   0 and hence that         >   0.
