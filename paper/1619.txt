                    Credit Rationing and
                  Effective Supply Failures



                           ABSTRACT




     This paper presents two macro models in which central bank
policy has real effects on the supply. side of the economy due to
credit rationing. In each model, there are two possible regimes,
depending on whether credit is or is not rationed. Starting from
an unrationed equilibrium, either a large enough contraction of
bank reserves or a large enough rise in aggregate demand can lead
to rationing. Monetary (fiscal) policy is shown to be more (less)
powerful when there is rationing than when there is not.
     In the first model, credit rationing reduces working
capital. There is a failure of effective supply in that
credit—starved firms must reduce production below national
supply. The resulting excess demand in the goods market may in
turn drive prices up and reduce the real supply of credit
further, leading to further reductions in supply and a
stagflationary spiral.
     In the second model, credit rationing reduces investment,
whichcuts into both .aggregate demand and Supply. Despite the
effect on demand, stagflationary instability is still. possible•. A
rise in government spending crowds out investment in the rationed
regime but crowds in investment in the unraticrxed regime.

         CREDIT RATIONING AND EFFECTIVE SUPPLY FAILURES


1. MOTIVATION AND BASIC IDEAS

     The topic of this paper is among the oldest and most

fundamental in monetary theory: how and why does monetary policy
affect real economic activity? Traditional answers hold that the
central bank can raise (shrink) aggregate demand by engineering
an expansion (contraction) of the medium of exchange.

     In its monetarist variant, this story posits a direct link
between something called M and aggregate spending. In its
Keynesian variant, the story holds that adjustments in asset
prices brought about by a change in M lead to more spending,

especially on capital goods.. In either case, short-run
stickiness of prices is needed to translate some of the changes
in demand into movements of real output.
     In recent years, these conventional stories have become

increasingly implausible, as Stiglitz and I (1983) have argued
elsewhere. With more and more assets apparently serving as rnedia
of exchange, it has become increasingly difficult to define M,

much les to believe that the central bank can cause a recession
by contriving an artificial •shortage of whatever it calls M. Put
differently, the point seems both simple and compelling: if
there are ready substitutes for money, control of money will not
give the authorities much leverage over the real economy.

     This paper develops a very different explanation for how
                                                     Page 2

central bank policy affects real economic activity: one based on
credit rationing. In order to make the credit—rationing
mechanism stand out in bold relief, most other channels of

monetary policy (such as interest elasticities and expectational
errors) are banished from the model. The reader should
understand that this is merely an expositional device. I would
not wish to deny that the interest—elasticity and expectational—
error mechanisms have some validity. But the spirit of this
paper is that those mechanisms do not seem important enough to
explain the deep recessions that are apparently caused by central
bank policy. There must be something else.
     The idea that credit availability impinges on economic
activity isp. of course, hardly new. But it does seem to have

gone out of style in recent years under the pressure of the
classical revival. Stiglitz and I (1983) recently suggested that
this fashion change may have been a mistake; and this paper is an
attempt to give analytical substance to the ideas we sketched

there.
     The basic principle is simple. Firms may have a desired or
"notional" supply based on relative prices, expectations, and
other variables. But they may need credit to produce the goods.
If the required credit is unavailable, there may be a "failure of
effective supply" in which firms fail, to produce as much as they
can sell. The idea of a supply failure contains a hint of what
is to come: if recessions are initiated by declines in supply,
rather than by declines in demand, then prices may rise, not
                                                       Page 3.
fall, as economic activity contracts.

     Where, then, does money enter the story? The banking system
both connects credit to money and creates what I call the "credit

multiplier." Suppose demand rises. Firms, seeing higher
expected marginal value products, borrow more and expand

production. As economic activity expands, higher transactions
balances are required; so bank deposits rise. As funds flow into
the banking system, the supply of bank credit is expanded
further. This credit expansion fuels both the increase in demand
and the increase in supply by easing credit constraints, and so
the expansion is amplified. This "credit multiplier"-—whereby
more credit leads to more hiring of factors, more production,
more bank deposits, and then to more credit—-operates alongside

the standard Keynesian income—expenditure multiplier because
demand expands as firms pay out more factor. income. The
interaction of the Keynesian and credit multipliers is at the
heart of this paper.1

     The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 outlines the
essential elements of the model, including heuristic

microfoundations for some of the assumptions. Sections 3 and 4,
the bulk of the paper, present and analyse two simple models in
which credit rationing impinges on the behavior of firms. In the
first (Section 3), credit rationing restricts the use of working
capital and thus reduces aggregate supply. While this mechanism
is the focus of the paper, credit rationing in the real world

also has important effects on aggregate demand. Therefore, in the
                                                     Page 4.
second model (Section 4), credit rationing restricts investment
spending, which naturally cuts into both aggregate demand and

aggregate supply. In both models, I show that credit rationing
enhances the power of monetary policy but reduces the power of
fiscal policy. Section 5 is a brief summary.


2. ELEMENTS OF THE MODELS

      While the two models considered in this paper differ in some

important ways, they share the following seven common elements:
      (1) Firms need credit for working capital (and for other
purposes). They must pay their factors of production before they
receive revenues from sales, and must borrow in order to do so.
The role of this assumption——which is, of course, overly
strong—-is to make credit an essential ingredient in the

production process. Firms that cannot get. credit must cut back
their hiring, which is what I mean by an effective supply

failure. Naturally, there are other ways to introduce demand for
credit, such as for financing inventories (which will appear in
Section 3) or for fixed investment (which will appear in Section
4).

      (2) There is no auction market for credit, •that is, no

commercial paper market. So firms wishing to borrow must borrow
from banks. The role of this assumption is to give banks primacy
in the credit market, albeit in a very stark way. As explained
in Blinder and Stiglitz (1983), this assumption may adequately
characterize the availability of credit to small firms whose
                                                   Page 5.
banks have certain informational advantages over other lenders.2
But it certainly is not realistic for large firms. A better
model would recognize the existence of two kinds of firms: large
firms that can borrow either at the bank or in the auction
market, and small firms that can borrow only at the bank. In
such a world, when bank credit is restricted, small firms may
borrow in the form of trade credit from large firms who can, in

turn, go to the open market and are rationed only by price.3 The
best way to think of this paper is as a stepping stone that
includes only the small firms.4 Subsequent models should include

the big ones as well.
     (3) Credit expands as economic activity expands. This is
the idea behind the "credit multiplier't sketched above. A rough
justification is as follows.5 When banks receive deposit
inflows, they set aside some reserves, invest some of the
proceeds in government bonds, and lend the rest to customers. As
the economy expands, business loans become less risky. So banks

hold smaller excess reserves (thereby raising the deposit
multiplier) and also shift their optimal portfolio proportions
away from riskiess government bonds toward risky (but higher
yielding) business loans.6 Specifically, suppose that banks hold
real excess reserves, E/P, that are a decreasing function of real

income :


                —
Cia) Et =
                                                                      Page 6.
where                and y are constants. If M is bank deposits, the
reserve identity is:


(ib) Rt =               rM   +
                                 Et

where               is bank reserves and r is the required reserve ratio.

The banks' balance sheet identity (ignoring net worth) is:


                                      =
(ic)                +
                        C + Bt

where B is the banks' holdings of government bonds. As just
mentioned, I assume that desired portfolios shift toward customer
loans as economic activity expands:



(id) C, =               h(l_r)M           +
                                              2t                > 0



                =
                        (1_h)(1_r)M
                                              —
                                                   2lt t
where               is the banks' notional demand for government bonds.7

Substituting from Cia) and (ib) into (Id) yields:


                = h(l—r)                      1h(l—r)       —
                         r                              -



which can be written compactly &s:

        C               Lt

            t            t
                                                     Page 7.


where Lt/Pt is a linear function of real bank reserves, Rt/Pt.
For convenience, I hereafter treat Lti not Rt, as the central
bank's policy instrument.
     (4) As mentioned already, all interest elasticities are
banned from the model, as are other responses to relative prices

such as input substitutions among labor, materials, and capital
in response to changes in relative factor prices.8

     (5) A simple Keynesian income—expenditure multiplier
augmented by a real balance effect comprises the entire demand
side of the model. There are no explicit investment goods in the
model of Section 3. Investment appears in Section 4, but does
not depend on interest rates. These assumptions' are strictly
expositional——to close off the standard Keynesian channel for

monetary policy.

     The real balance effect on consumption is included only as a

way to make the price level determinate when there is no credit
rationing; in several places I assume that it is 'tsmall."

     (6) Money plays no essential role in the models. Firms hold

money to facilitate production. But money adjusts passively to
income, as in King and Plosser (1984), not the other way around.9
     (7) In those places in which expectations enter the models,
I assuffie perfect foresight. So expectational errors also play no

role in the analysis.


3. CREDIT RATIONING AND WORKING CAPITAL
     This section embeds in an otherwise conventional macro model
the idea that credit rationing might create a shortage of working
                                                      Page 8.
capital, and thereby force firms to cut back on production. I

begin with a preliminary "finger exercise' version of the model

which, while incomplete, aids our understanding by making the

linkages from credit rationing to working capital to output
completely transparent. There will be time for subtlety later.


3.1       Preliminary Model
        Firms hire factors of production at constant relative prices
that are normalized to unity. Thus the quantity of factors hired
and real factor payments are represented by the same symbol, Ft,
which should be thought of as an amalgam of labor, materials, and
capital. Since relative prices do not change, neither should
factor proportions. It is important to note that, unlike many
other models of monetary policy, the expansions and contractions
of real output in this model do not stem, from any policy—induced
change in the real wage.
        Factors hired at time t are paid immediately and go to work.

One period later they produce output. Assuming constant returns
to scale and fixed factor proportions, the production function
is:



(2) y = VFt_1


where   v is a measure of productivity (v > 1).
        Aggregate demand comes from a simple linear consumption

function with a real balance effect:
                                                     Page 9.

                           L
(3) xt=a+byt+st
             t
                O<b<1, s>O,
where x is real final sales. Here "a" is Keynesian "autonomous
expenditure," "b" is the marginal propensity to consume, and "s"
indicates the wealth effect of outside money. I presume s to be
small.

       Credit rationing is the critical element of the model.

Under the assumption that firms expectations are correct, firms

today expect to sell x1 next period. To produce this much
output, they must hire x+i/v factors today. Hence, if
unconstrained, their hiring today would be x1/v, which
constitutes the notional demand for credit:


(4a)
         Cat= X+l
         Pt      V
where P is the price level and C. is nominal credit° However,
as explained in Stiglitz and Weiss (1981), banks normally ration
credit, to a maximum volume C. Hence actual credit is:


(4b) Ca = min(Cdt,Ct).


Since factor hiring and borrowing are taken to be equal (Ft =
              we have, in real terms:


             xt+lCt
(4) Ft = minE V


Finally, the price level adjusts according to the "law of supply
                                                      Page 10.
and demandt':



            —
                  = A(x     —           A   > 0



     Consider the credit—rationed regime. If the credit

constraint is binding, then (1), (2), and (4) imply the following
difference equation for factor payments:


(6) Ft =    (L/P)t    +
                          uFti
where u =   v.    Subtracting Ft_i from both sides gives a dynamic
equation for real factor payments:

(7) Ft -    Fti   =        — (i—u)Fti
Substituting (2) and (3) into (5) gives the other dynamic
equation, for the price level:



(8) P1            =   X(   + s    —
                                      v(1b)Ft_i).


By setting both equations equal to zero, we obtain the
stationaries P = 0 and tK = 0 in Figure 1. (It is convenient to
put LIP rather than P on the vertical axis.) The LP = 0 locus is

steeper so long as:


(9) v(l—b) > s(l—u),

which is assumed."
        As can be seen by inspection, the credit—rationed

equilibrium, point R, is a saddle point. If LI'? starts at just

the right level (given Ft_i), the system will converge to point R
along the stable arm indicated in the diagram. Otherwise, the

system will explode. In sharp contrast to many modern models with

rational expectations, however, there is no optimizing agent to
set L/P at just the right level to put the economy on the

convergent path. Hence the convergent path is a knife—edge
solution, obtained only by coincidence; instability is the more
likely, and therefore the more interesting, outcome.

         There-are two possibilities. Explosion in the northeasterly
direction means that output is rising while the price level is

falling (LIP is rising) -— a deflationary boom! With the supply
of real credit rising, you might expect that the credit
constraint would soon cease to be binding. When the model is        -




fleshed    out, this will, be shown to be the case.

        Explosion in the southwesterly direction is stagflationary

      output falls as prices rise CL/P falls). The dynamic mechanism
in this case is interesting and important enough to merit some
attention. Why is the model unstable?
  -



        Ignore the financial parameters s and u for the moment (that
is, set s = u =    0),   and suppose that, starting from equilibrium,
credit is reduced by one unit. Demand next period will fall by
by, but supply next period will fall by v, which is bigger.
Hence the restriction of credit causes excess demand as long as b< i.12
                                                      Page 12.


     Excess demand drives prices higher, according to (5). But
with L fixed in nominal terms, rising prices lead to further
reductions in real credit, and the whole cycle repeats: less
credit leads to excess demand which leads to higher prices which
leads to less credit .     . •This chain of events, which may lead
to dynamic instability under credit rationing, is the basic
message of this paper.

     Is this mechanism realistic? I think it is. Credit
restrictions do reduce effective supply in the real world (e.g.,
through investment). And if these effects are bigger than the

effects of tight credit on demand, inflationary pressures will
result. Section 4 will consider a model in which credit
rationing impinges on fixed investment, The rest of this section
elaborates the 'tfinger exercise" model based on working capital.

This elaboration is necessary because Figure 1 raises more
questions than it answers. What happens in the case of upward
explosion into the unrationedhl region? What factors determine
whether credit is rationed or not? Is the model still unstable
under alternative price—adjustment mechanisms?
     We can answer the last question right away. Suppose we
rep1ae the law of supply and demand by a Phillips—curve equation
with a natural rate at F*, viz.:


(10) Pt — Pt     1(Ft —   F*).
                                                       Page 13.
Using (6), it can be seen that the P =    0   locus is now:



      + uF       =

which is the downward—sloping line shown in Figure 2. Evidently,
the credit-rationed equilibrium is now stable. What has changed?
Notice that the demand parameters b and s from (3) are now

irrelevant because demand no longer enters the picture. If

inflation is determined by (10), a reduction in credit reduces

factor hiring, which is deflationary. (By contrast, under (5) a
reduction in supply is inflationary.) The price level falls,
thereby raising the real supply of credit back toward its

original level. The equilibrium is stable. (See Figure 2.)
      In the remainder of this section, as we elaborate and

complicate the model, the relative importance of price adjustment
according to (5) versus (10) will turn out to be critical to the
nature of the credit—rationed equilibrium (if one exists).

Figures 1 and 2 show, in the simplest possible terms, why this is
so.



3.2 Elaborating the Model

      In the model just sketched, demand (sales) and supply
(production) can differ. If they do, then inventories must be
changing. In order to add inventories to the model while keeping
the dynamics to second—order (so as to permit graphical

analysis), I switch to continuous time, thereby eliminating the
lags present in the preliminary model.13 Hence, equations

                              V                (H       H) I ,
                                      Pt
where H is the stock of inventories and H is the (constant)
desired stock.

       Compared to equations (1) and (2) equations (11) and (12)
eliminate the lag of production behind factor payments,

effectively removing the previous short-period dynamics of Ft.
The dynamics now come exclusively from inventory change and
gradual price adjustment. Owing to the elimination of the

one-period production lag, the need for working capital now
becomes entirely allegorical. Those obsessed with a need for
precision should think of factor payments as being paid 'tjust
before" output is produced, so that credit is only for. a fleeting
instant. Those not so obsessed should think of the one—period
lag as still being present in spirit, but suppressed to allow a
convenient graphical exposition of the ideas.

       Equation (14) requires explanation. As before, x is
assumed equal to expected sales. Now, however, a firm whose
initial inventories (Ht) differ from its desired inventory stock
                                                                           Page 15.
(H) will not wish to produce what it expects to sell. Instead,
as indicated in Blinder and Fischer (1981) and in Blinder (1982),

it will produce expected sales plus some fraction, 8, of its
inventory shortfall. This explains the first term in (14, which
applies when credit is not rationed.

     The second term recognizes that financing inventories is a
second use of credit, in addition to providing working capital.
The assumption is that the firm's equity is sufficient to finance

its steady—state inventory stock, H, but that bank credit is
needed to finance any inventories in excess of this norm.

Symmetrically, if inventory stocks are below normal, some of the

equity is freed to finance working capital, thereby easing
borrowing requirements. The available credit is still C/P, but
now (Ct/Pt) —            —   H) is available to finance working capital,
                   (Ht
and hence is the second term of (14).
     Two further amendments to the model are needed. First, we
need the identity that inventory change is the difference between
production and sales:


(15) H = y     -   x


The price adjustment specification combines the "law of supply
and demand" (5)and the "Phillips curve" (10):
        (16)        P =      X(x   —   y) + 'T'(y   —   y*),
where y is the (exogenous) natural rate of output. Obviously,
the special cases X= 0 and 1=                   merit special attention, for
                                                           Page 16

the preliminary model suggests that they could lead to quite
different dynamics under credit rationing.
       I proceed by analyzing the model separately in the two

regimes defined by (14), and then putting the two regimes

together.


3.3 The Keynesian Regime
       I call the regime in which the credit constraint is not

binding "Keynesian" because it yields a familiar Keynesian
solution. From (15) and (16), it is clear that steady state
equilibrium requires that x =   y =   y'.   By (14) and (12); then,

H=H. Hence the Keynesian equilibrium is defined by the pair of

equalities:

                 L
(17)    =   a-i-s —

              1-b
The first equality is the simple Keynesian multiplier formula.'
The second pins down the price level. (As mentioned earlier, this
is the only role of the real balance effect.) Obviously, one
requirement for a Keynesian equilibrium to exist is that:



(18)      y > a/Cl—b).


I assume throughout the paper that this condition holds; but
notice that it will be false if a is large enough relative to y.

       Away from the steady state, output is given by:
                                                                Page 17


         a + s   — e(H-Th
(19) y = _________________
                 1—b

which follows from (13) and (14). Output is higher the higher is
autonomous expenditure, the higher are real bank reserves, and

the lower are inventories. Since, by (13) and (19), the
difference x —   y   is 8(1! —   if), it   follows from (15) that the ii   =0
locus is the vertical line at H in Figure 3. Similarly, Appendix
A shows that the       = 0 locus is a straight line which crosses H =

H at a positive value of L/P so long as a Keynesian equilibrium

exists (i.e., if (18) holds), and whose slope has the sign of:

(20)    P   y   — A(1—b)


(See the two panels of Figure 3.)
       The sign of p depends on the relative sizes of A and y
If y = 0 (pure law of supply arid demand), P is negative; if A = 0

(pure Phillips curve), p is positive. The parameter p has the
following meaning. If higher inventories reduce prices, then p is

positive; if higher inventories raise prices, then 'P is negative.
In what follows, I will assume that P > 0 is the normal case, but
will allow for the possibility that P < 0 as well. Figure 3 shows

that the. Keynesian equilibrium is stable regardless of the sign

of P.

       Under credit rationing, (11), (12), and (14) imply that
output is given by:



(21) y =    lu    - (H -   B)]

Notice the differences between (21) and the Keynesian multiplier
formula (19). When credit is rationed, autonomous expenditure has

no effect on output, but bank reserves have a larger effect
(assuming that (9) holds). In terms of the issues that motivated

this paper, we see that monetary policy is more powerful, and
fiscal policy (a rise in "a" might represent a balanced—budget
rise in government purchases) is less powerful in the credit—
rationed regime than in the Keynesian regime. In fact, if the
real balance effect is absent (s =   0),   monetary policy has no
realeffects in the Keynesian regime while fiscal policy has no
real effects in the credit— rationed regimeL'4

      Equations (15) and (16) continue to require that x =   y =
in   steady state equilibrium, but H need not be equal to H when
credit. is rationed. Specifically, with some algebraic effort (see

Appendix A) it can be shown that an equilibrium with credit
rationing exists only when H < H and:


                    a
                1—b -
                        (l—u)
Since (18) continues to be the requirement for a finite price
level, there can be an equilibrium with credit rationing only if:
                                                              Page 19

        Appendix   A shows that the Ii = 0 locus in the credit—rationed

regime has a positive slope that exceeds unity (see Figure 4),
while the P = 0 locus is a straight line with slope:

where


(24) q E v(l—b) — s(l—u) > 0


This is clearly positive if either A = 0 (pure Phillips curve)
or y =     0 (pure law of supply and demand). To avoid &      taxanornic
treatment, I will hereafter assume that (23) is positive
regardless of the sign of p
       The two alternative phase diagrams for the credit—rationed
regime are shown in Figure 4. They are as follows:
   *   Panel   (a): If p is positive, which must be so if A =      0,
then Appendix A shows that the slope of the 11=0 locus must exceed
that of the P=0 locus. The credit—rationed equilibrium (if one
exists) is stable.
   *   Panel   (b): If both p and      pv + Xs(l—u) are negative (which
must occur if =O), the appendix shows that the slope of the P=O

locus is positive and larger than that of th H=O locus. In this
case, the credit—rationed equilibrium may be stable or unstable,
depending on initial conditions arid parameter values. The
unstable case here is the analog, in this more complicated model,
of Figure 1 above.



3.5 The Borderline between the Regimes

       To complete the phase diagram, it only remains to locate the
border between the Keynesian and credit-rationed regions. This is
easily done. The demand for credit in the Keynesian regime is:

         a + s     — 6(H - H)
                   v(l—b)
The supply of credit in the rationed regime is:

        L          —
        F-   (H - H)
             1-u
These are exactly equal when:

       L — (1—u)a ÷ (v(1—b)—8(l—ü)3(H—H)
(25)
                            q

which defines the border. Appendix A shows that the border and
the 1 = 0 locus of the credit—rationed region intersect at H = H,

with the former having the smaller slope. Since the slope of the
border can be either positive or negative, and is immaterial to
the analysis anyway, I will simply draw the border as horizontal
for convenience.

       Given the equation for the border, it is straightforward to
show (see the appendix) that the Keynesian equilibrium (point E
                                                               Page 21
in Figure 3) occurs above the border if:

                  a
(26)y*>
          1—b -
                  (1-u)
Similarly, some truly horrendous algebra shows that the credit—
rationed equilibrium (point R in Figure 4) lies below the border
if and only if (26) is reversed. Hence, we have the following

possibilities:
     (j) y* < a/(l—b) ———>               no equilibrium




     (ii) a/(1—b) < y* <
                                     a          ——> a credit—rationed equilibrium
                                (l—b)—--(l—u)


                            a
     (111) * >                           ——> a Keynesian equilibrium
                  l—b—-(1-u)
Notice that if S, the real balance effect, is very small, there
is little "room" between the two bounds in (ii). This makes the
existence of an equilibrium with credit rationing unlikely. So
the likely case is that a Keynesian equilibrium, but no credit
rationed equilibrium, exists.


3.6 Dynamics when p> 0
     I now put the two regions together and analyze the dynamics
of the complete system. Consider first the case p > 0 which, as
alreadymentioned, seems the more likely case. (It is the only
possibility if A =    0.)
     Combining Figures 3a and 4a gives the phase diagram shown in
                                                       Page 22

Figure 5, which shows a Keynesian equilibrium but no equilibrium
with credit rationing. Should a decline in L lead to a period of

credit rationing (see point B) a process of deflation would
begin, thereby raising L/P. This deflation would continue until

the price level rose by enough to restore L/P to its original
value (see point E). Hence the model is globally stable, and

credit rationing is a self—curing rrialady.5
     Let us consider the effects of central bank policy, starting
from equilibrium at point E. If L rises, real output will rise

(according to (19)), putting the economy in a position like D,
where the price level is too low. A period of inflation will
ensue, and will continue until L/P is restored to its equilibrium

level. During the inflationary adjustment, y will be falling
because L/P is falling.16 But all of this "action" induced by a
contraction àf bank reserves is presumably minor because the

impact multiplier for monetary policy is:

        dY    —    s
     d(L/P)       1—b



and s is assumed to be small.
     The effects of a decline in L are symmetric unless the

decline is large enough to push the economy into the
credit—rationed region. In the rationed region, the impact

multiplier for monetary policy is much larger, according to (21).
Specifically, it is:

       dY   —      v
     d(L/P)       1-u

If L is reduced starting from a point like B, prices and output
start to fall. Since output declines by more than sales,

inventories start to fall. Falling inventory stocks tend to push

output back up toward equilibrium. Eventually, inventories reach
a minimum and begin to be replenished. But deflation continues
until L/P is restored to its original level.
     So we conclude that the effects of monetary policy, while

qualitatively similar in the two regimes, may be rather weak in
the Keynesian regime and rather strong in the credit—rationed

regime. Translated into real—world terms, a tightening, of

monetary policy may have strong effects on the real sector when
money is already tight, but weak effects when credit is initially

plentiful.
     What happens if autonomous expenditure, a, rises? The
multiplier formula shows that y rises strongly if the economy is

in the Keynesian regime. Inspection of the equations that
underlie Figure 5 shows that (see Figure 6):
     (a) the P = 0 locus shifts to the right in both regions, so

the equilibrium point, E, shifts down vertically (to a higher

equilibrium price level);
     (b) the border shifts up;
     Cc) the H = 0 locus shifts to the left in the credit—

rationed region, but does not move in the Keynesian region.

These shifts are depicted in Figure 6, in which the "old" lines
are drawn broken and the "new" lines are drawn solid. We see that
a rise in "a" leaves the economy at a point qualitatively similar

to point 0 in Figure 5. The adjustment procass from D to E ——

which entails rising P and falling y —— has already been
described.

     Now consider the possibility that autonomous spending grows

so large that the Keynesian equilibrium depicted in Figure 5
ceases to exist, but that s is large enough so that an
equilibrium with credit rationing arises. This is shown in Figure
7.

     If that happens, the economy initially finds itself at a
disequilibrium point like C or, if the border shifts up strongly
enough, like B in Figure 7. A substantial inflation ensues ——

enough to drive L/P down to the new equilibrium level indicated
by point R. As the economy moves from point C down.to point D, y
is falling (slightly). Once the border is crossed, it is no

longer clear whether y is rising or falling because the

contractionary effects of declining L/P are counteracted by the
expansionary effects of falling H.


3.7 Dynamics when P< 0
     The case in which p < 0 must arise if I = 0.   As stated
earlier, I assume that I is, so small that the P = 0 locus in the

credit—rationed region is positively sloped. Since it must be
steeper that the H = 0 locus (see the appendix), there are again

two possibilities, depending on whether the equilibrium is
Keynesian or credit rationed.

     (a) Figure 8 depicts a Keynesian equilibrium which combines

Figures 3b and 4b. This case is qualitatively similar to Figure
5: the economy can be credit rationed for a period, but it

always returns to the Keynesian equilibrium. Nothing more need
be said.

     (b) Figure 9, however, depicts a more interesting

possibility: the economy's only equilibrium is credit— rationed,
but it might not be stable. Following a perturbation, the economy

exhibits a cyclical adjustment period which might alternate
between periods of rationed and unrationed credit. The adjustment
process could be stable (spiralling in to point R) or unstable
(spiralling away). The unstable case tells a story that is
similar to that told by our preliminary model in Section 3.1.




4. CREDIT RATIONING AND FIXED CAPITAL

     One valid objection to the model of Section 3 is that credit

rationing there affects only aggregate supply, whereas in reality
it is commonly believed that rationing has important effects on
aggregate demand (such as for housing and consumer durables). To
meet this objection, this section develops a model in which

credit rationing impinges on capital formation, and therefore
affects both aggregate demand (in the short run) and aggregate
supply (in the long run).


4.1 Structure of the Model
     Since the capital stock adds an additional dynamic variable,

and since I want to keep the dynamics to second order, I

eliminate inventory changes by assuming that firms always produce
to meet demand (y=x).

     To allow for capital accumulation, it is, of course,

necessary to distinguish between fixed capital, K, and other
factors of production -- which I call "labor, N. Hence the

simple production technology of Section 3 will no longer do. The
supply side of the investment model is best understood by

referring to Figure 10, which is a standard isoquant diagram. Ray
OE shows the expansion path of a firm with constant returns to
scale under the given wage—rental ratio. Since.the wage—rental
ratio is assumed constant throughout the analysis, the

cost—minimizing input combinations all lie along OE.
     Suppose the firm wants to produce y0, because that is the
amount demanded. The optimal capital stock for this level of
output is 4y0 (point A). Suppose the firms actual capital stock
is only K0. Its short—run strategy, I assume, is to produce y0 by
using K0 units of capital and N0 units of labor (point B), where
N0 is, obtained from the production function. This is a

disequilibrium situation in two respects. First, output is above
normal "capacity —— which is most naturally defined as K0/4. The
firm is not producing y0 at minimum cost, and so will want to

acquire more capital. Second, while I assume that workers supply
as much (or as little) labor as is demanded in the short run, the
level of employment, N0, may not match the notional supply of
labor. If it does not, there will be either upward or downward

pressure on wages and prices. (The real wage is constant.)
        The long—run equilibrium is determined by the notional
supply of labor, N* in the diagram. To employ the labor force

fully, output must be y (point F); and the capital stock must be
K* =    4y*,   Hence, while I assume that output is demand—determined
in the short run, it is supply—determined in the long run.

        A set of equations that captures these ideas is:


 (27)              y K/                              (capacity)
 (28)              N =    N(y,K)                     (employment)
 (29)              K =    I   =   (4y   —   K)       (investment)



where output is determined by (13) augmented by the addition of
investment:



(30)           y = a + by ÷           s(L/P)     +   I,

and the function NC.) in (28) is obtained by inverting the

production function.
        Two factors influence prices (and wages): the pressure of

output Cy) on normal capacity (y), and the pressure of employment
(N) on the available supply of labor (N*). Hence the price

equation is:


(31) P =       A   (y —   y)      +     y (N —
                                                          Page 28
where N* is the (exogenous) natural level of employment and         is

the (endogenous) capacity level.
     The model is completed by specifying the credit market. The
credit constraint now says that the volume of working capital, N,
and end—of—period fixed capital (K+I) cannot exceed the real
supply of credit:
(32) c/P > N + K ÷ I.

(Here the real wage is normalized to unity and the price of a
capital good is assumed equal to the price of a consumption

good.) The supply of credit is still given by:



(33) c/P =   L/P + y.


Equations (27)—(33) constitute the entire model. If(32) holds as
an equality, we are in the credit-rationed regime; if it holds as
an inequality, we are in the Keynesian regime.



4.2 The Keynesian Regime
     When the credit constraint is not binding, output is
determined by the conventional Keynesian multiplier formula. From

(29) and (30):


           a+s-p- K
(34) y =      1—b—

In the steady state, of course, y will be equal to the natural
rate, y, which is defined implicitly by N* =     N(y*,   $y*).
Similarly, K will be equal to K*= 4y*; so (34) becomes:
                                                          Page 29
                  L
             a + Sp
(35)    y*=1...b
which determines the price level so long as the existence
condition (18) holds.

       Using (29) and (34), investment in the model will be:


(36) K      I (l—b—)1 [(a + s(L/P))      —   (l—b)K)


so that each dollar of autonomous expenditure tlcrowds jfl

           U—           >0
           aa


dollars of investment. Equation (36), of course, defines the K=0
locus which appears in Figure 11.

       The rest of the dynamics of the model follow by substituting
(34) into (31) to get a nonlinear equation for P. Appendix B
shows that the P = 0 locus can be linearized around equilibrium

to get a line whose slope is less than the slope of the K=O

locus. Hence the phase diagram for the Keynesian region looks
like Figure 11. The Keynesian equilibrium at E is stable (if it
exists).



4.3 The Credit-Rationed Regime

       Two possible variants of credit rationing can be
accommoated within the structure of thismodel, depending on
whether it is fixed or working capital that is rationed. Since

rationing of working capital was studied in Section 3, I assume
here that it is investment that gets rationed when the credit

constraint is binding. Hence, when (32) holds as an equality, we
have:



                   C/P =   N(y,K)   + K +     I,

which, using (33), means that investment is rationed to:


                     I = L/P +      y   -   N(y,K)     — K.



Of course, a reduction of I will make y fall as well, as is

standard in Keynesian analysis. Substituting for I into (30)
gives an equation for the level of output under credit rationing:


            y = a + by +      s(L/P)    +   L/P    +   ay - N(y,K) — K,


which implicitly defines:

(37) y =    Y(a,   LIP, K)
              +     +

with    the signs of the partial derivatives as indicated.

        ?ppendix B shows that 3Y/3a is smaller than the

correspohding multiplier in the Keynesian •case (see equation
(34)), and that Y/3(L/P) is larger. These comparisons echo those
of Section 3, though the multiplier for autonomous expenditure is
                                                                           Page 31
no longer zero when credit is rationed.

      Using (37), the constrained rate of investment is found to
be:



(38) K =   I   =       L/P   - K +   cY(a,L/P,K)    -   N[Y(a,L/P,K),K].

Hence, using the expression for aY/aa derived in the appendix,
the degree of crowding out is:
               N
      31 — — y_—
      3a    l—b+N--cz



which is between 0 and —1.
      The k = 0 locus is defined by setting (38) equal to zero,
and the P =        0    locus follows from (31). Appendix B shows that, at
least locally, the slope of the P = 0 locus exceeds that of the I
= 0 locus. Hence the credit—rationed equilibrium, if one exists,

is a saddle point such as R in Figure 12.

      To see whether a. credit-rationed equilibrium can exist, ie

need to consider how the Keynesian and credit—rationed regions

fit together.


4.4 The Borderline between the Regions
      The borderline is easily determined. In the Keynesian
regime, the real demand for credit is:



                       N(y,K) + K +     (4y   -   K),

and the real supply of credit is:



             L/P+czy,


where in both cases y is given by (34). Setting these two equal
defines the border. Even after linearization, the slope of the
borderline could have either sign.



4.5 Dynamic Analysis
     Combining Figures 11 and 12 leaves two main possibilities,
depending on whether or not a credit—rationed equilibrium exists.

(I assume that a Keynesian equilibrium does exist.)
     In Figure 13 there is no credit—rationed equilibrium because

the two stationaries intersect outside the positive quadrant. If
the model gets into the credit—rationed region, deflation

eventually forces L/P up until credit is no longer rationed. The

model always converges to the Keynesian equilibrium (point E).
Figure 13 looks much like Figure 5 for the working capital model.

Since its comparative dynamics are essentially identical, I will
not bother to repeat the analysis.

     Figure '14 shows the other possibility. Here the economy has
two equilibria: a Keynesian equilibrium at E which is locally
stable, and a credit—rationed equilibrium at R which is (locally)

a saddle point. Depending on the initial value of L/P, the model
can converge to the Keynesian equilibrium, converge to the
credit—rationed equilibrium (a knife—edge possibility), or

explode in the southwesterly direction with prices rising and

capacity falling.
     Some properties of the credit—rationed equilibrium are worth
mentioning. Since investment is rationed and is zero in
equilibrium, K is naturally below K*. K is also below y
("desired capital"),, but investment is inhibited byrationing.
Thus, output is above capacity, even though it is below the
natural rate: y < y < y.
     The latter inequality means that there is unemployment in

equilibrium. This unemployment puts downward pressure on the
price level, but that is exactly offset by the inflationary

pressure caused by production beyond capacity. If that sounds
like a precarious equilibrium, it should——because the rationed

eçuilibrium is a knife—edge solution. Any departure from
equilibrium will lead either into the Keynesian region or to a
stagflationary explosion that is reminiscent of our first model

in Section 3.1.
     The stagflationary mechanism is little different here than

it was in the working capital model. Here rising prices reduce

LIP, thereby making credit rationing tighter. This reduces
investment and causes capacity to shrink, which is inflationary.


5. EMPIRICAL RELEVANCE
     Economics is not an art form, so a theoretical model like
this one needs to be justified. Precisely where is this model
applicable? There are several possible answers.
                                                      Page 34
     In the contemporary U.S. economy, there seems to be a strong

a priori case that quantity rationing is important in the housing
sector——where builders are mostly small, undercapitalized firms
that rely on banks for working capital. Also, if we think of
households as producing services from durable goods (which they
buy on credit), a similar story would apply to consumer durables.
In addition, the story of firms curtailing their activities for
lack of credit rings true for the small business sector (but not

for giant corporations). The importance of housing and durable
goods industries in business fluctuations is well known; I am now
trying to assess the importance of small business in business

cycles.
     It is also worth remembering that the complex, fluid
financial markets that exist in the United States (and perhaps in

England) are not typical of other industrial countries, where
securities markets may be rudimentary and much investment is
financed by banks. Indeed, the U.S. economy in the 1980s is
quite different in this regard from the U.S. economy in earlier
decades. In other times and places, close substitutes for bank
loans were not readily available.17
     Finally, it is not only in the industrial countries that
business fluctuations are apparently linked to central bank
policy. There is a growing literature in development economics
that argues——on both institutional and econometric grounds——that
credit restrictions which reduce the supply of credit for either

working capital or investment are a major channel through which
                                                        Page 35
financial policies have real effects.18
     Thus I think the approach followed here at least potentially

applies to several important sectors of the U.S. economy today,
to most of the economies of many other countries today, and to
almost all economies in earlier times.


6. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

     I have presented here two simple macro models in which
"money" plays no role, but in which central bank policy has

potentially strong real effects via its influence over the supply
of credit. The real effects of monetary policy do not derive from

interest elasticities, nor.from expectational errors, but rather
from credit rationing. And it is not hard (for me, at least) to

imagine that this channel of influence might be quite powerful.
     The central conclusions from the two models are:
          (1) Depending on the relative magnitudes of central
bank credit (here indicated by L/P) and autonomous expenditure
(here indicated by a), the economy may or may not be credit
constrained. Its behavior is qualitatively different depending
on whether or not the credit constraint is binding. For example,
when credit is rationed the effect of autonomous spending on
output is smaller, and the effect of monetary policy is larger,
than when credit is not rationed. In the investment. model,

autonomeus expenditure crowds out investment only when credit is
rationed (and then only partially); it crowds in more investment
when credit is not rationed.
                                                              .3b


      (2) When the economy is credit constrained, it is subject
to a kind of instability owing to inflation. If it reduces
supply more than demand, a reduction in credit can be

inflationary and can thereby make the real supply of credit

shrink further. The inflationary impact of tight credit found
here is different from the more familiar cost—push mechanism (the
so—called "Patman effect").19

          (3) Despite this destabilizing mechanism, dynamic
instability is by no means inevitable. Potential instability from

credit rationing may be overwhelmed by other stabilizing
influences in the model (represented here by the real balance
effect and the Phillips curve). If so, credit rationing is a

self—correcting malady.
     I believe that these conclusions are likely to be quite
robust, and hence are more interesting than the particular models
used to derive them. The paper is, nonetheless, only a fragment
of a more complete model. Its most important contribution, I
hope, is to start down the road toward a theory of effective
supply based on credit rationing (and perhaps on other phenomena
as well). When more fully developed, the principle of effective

supply may take its place alongside the Keynesian principle of
effective demand as the twin pillars of non—classical
macroeconomics.
                          FOOTNOTES

1. Bernanke (1981) sketches a similar scenario.
2. Nakamura (1984) argues for an important economy of scope in
    banking: banks get information from managing a firm's
    deposit account that isnot available to others and that
    enables banks to reduce the riskiness of their loans.
3. Empirically, however, we do not observe a negative
    correlation between (detrended) bank loans on the one hand
    and either (detrended) trade credit or (detrended) commercial
    paper on the other. So this "escape hatch" may not be as
    important as many economists have supposed.
4. Or as a model of an economy without a developed capital
    market. In fact, after circulating a first draft of this
    paper, I learned about several papers in development
    economics that are based on the use of bank credit to finance
    working capital. See, for example, van Wijnbergen (1983),
    who attributes the idea to Cavallo (1977), or Leff and Sato
     (1982).

5. Blinder (1984) constructs a precise micro model along these
    lines, building on the foundations laid by Stiglitz and Weiss
    (1981) and Jaffee and Russell (1976).

6. Banks sell the bonds to households, who pay with money.
    (Households do not care how much money they hold.)
    Presumably, interest rates would have to rise to clear the
    bond money market. But interest rates play no role in the
     model, so this is ignored..

7. If the rationing is effective, then Bt = Bt. If firms do not
    take up all the available credit, then Bt is found residually
    from (ic).
8. Of course, it is always:.possible to associate a shadow
    price——in this case, a. shadow interest rate——with any
    quantity rationed equilibrium and thereby translate the
    quantity story into a price story. In general, I think
    allowing interest rate channels would mainly reinforce the
                                                              -
    phenomena discussed in this paper.

9.   If firms enlarge their holdings of money as output expands,
     they must sell some other asset. Implicitly, this 'tother
     asset" (whose market is surpressed by Wairas' Law) is
     government bonds. Banks may buy some of these bonds, but
     there are two conflicting effects: inflows of deposits lead
     banks to expand their holdings of all assets (including
     government bonds), but decreases in riskiness lead to
     portfolio shifts away from bonds. The remainder of the bonds
     are presumed to be bought by households, whose money holdings
   are purely passive. See footnote 6.
10. Notice that "credit velocity," which I take to be constant,
    is normalized to unity.
11. Recall: The real balance effect is assumed to be "small."
    This is one specific definition of "small."
12. When s and u are not zero, excess demand eventually arises as
    long as condition (9) holds.
13. Continuous time also reduces the mathematical complexities
    caused by regime switching. See below, especially footnote
    15.

14. The later would not be true if banks' assessment of risk was
    more forward—looking than assumed in equations (1) (in which
    only today's output matters).
15. The regime change creates problems in analyzing the dynamics.
    However,. Honkapobja and Ito (1983) point out that, if the
    directions of motion are the same on both sides of the border
    (as is true here), the trajectory will pass through the
    border. Under certain other conditions, the "patched" system
    will be stable.if the component systems are. See Horikapohja
    and Ito (1983).
16. In this model, there is perfect foresight and no lags. As a
    result, inventories do not change during this adjustment
    period. If production lagged, then the surge in demand would
    lower inventories, creating an initial point somewhat to the
    left of D and kicking off an inventory cycle.

17. For example, Bernanke's (1983) analysis of the Great
    Depression is based on this idea.
18. See, for example, the references cited in footnote 4 above.
    There are others.

19. But see footnote 8 above.
