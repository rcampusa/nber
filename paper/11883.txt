                                           ABSTRACT

We present a new measure of legal protection of minority shareholders against expropriation by
corporate insiders: the anti-self-dealing index. Assembled with the help of Lex Mundi law firms, the
index is calculated for 72 countries based on legal rules prevailing in 2003, and focuses on private
enforcement mechanisms, such as disclosure, approval, and litigation, governing a specific self-
dealing transaction. This theoretically-grounded index predicts a variety of stock market outcomes,
and generally works better than the commonly used index of anti-director rights.

1. Introduction.

       Over the last twenty years, both academic and practical approaches to corporate

governance have increasingly focused on the problem of investor expropriation, sometimes also

referred to as self-dealing or tunneling. Specifically, those who control a corporation, whether

they are managers, controlling shareholders, or both, can use their power to divert corporate

wealth to themselves, without sharing it with the other investors. Various forms of such self-

dealing include executive perquisites to excessive compensation, transfer pricing, taking of

corporate opportunities, self-serving financial transactions such as directed equity issuance or

personal loans to insiders, and outright theft of corporate assets.

       The new emphasis on self-dealing is reflected in both theoretical and empirical work.

Earlier research on corporate governance has focused on such problems as managerial

consumption of perquisites (Jensen and Meckling 1976), managerial effort (Holmstrom 1979),

and over-investment in pursuit of growth (e.g., Baumol 1959, Jensen 1986). Modern theory of

corporate finance instead focuses on the ability of corporate insiders to divert corporate wealth to

themselves, reflected in the diplomatically named “private benefits of control” (Grossman and

Hart 1988, Hart 1995, Zingales 1994). Empirically, such diversion of resources from firms to

their controllers has been investigated in several contexts, including the U.S. savings and loans

crisis (Akerlof and Romer 1993), the Mexican and Asian financial crises (La Porta, Lopez-de-

Silanes, and Zamarripa 2003, Johnson et al. 2000a), legal disputes over tunneling (Johnson et al.

2000b), and corporate governance during the transition from socialism (e.g., Glaeser, Johnson,

and Shleifer 2001). The extent of diversion has also been measured by estimating the private

benefits of control from the market pricing of shares with superior voting rights and from the

treatment of controlling shareholders in takeovers (e.g., Nenova 2003, Dyck and Zingales 2004).




                                                  1
       Parallel to this recognition of the importance of corporate self-dealing, economists have

followed legal scholars (e.g., Clark 1986) in recognizing the crucial role played by the law in its

control. Initial research in this area argues theoretically and shows empirically that differences

in legal investor protection across countries shape the ability of insiders to expropriate outsiders,

and thus determine investor confidence in markets and consequently their development (Shleifer

and Vishny 1997, La Porta et al. 1997, 1998, Shleifer and Wolfenzon 2002). Yet while this

research presents several empirical measures of investor protection that predict financial

outcomes, it does not focus on self-dealing explicitly. In this paper, we rectify this omission.

       So what should be the role of the law in addressing corporate self-dealing? One approach

is to do nothing, and to count on market forces to sort out the problem. Virtually no society uses

this approach: the temptation to “take the money and run” in an unregulated environment is just

too great. At the other extreme, a society can prohibit conflicted transactions altogether: all

dealings between a corporation and its controllers – or any other entity these controllers also

control – could be banned by law. Yet no society finds it practical to use this approach either,

perhaps because in many instances related-party transactions actually make economic sense. So

what do societies actually do?

       In this paper, we explore this question empirically. To this end, we describe a

hypothetical self-dealing transaction between two firms controlled by the same person, which

can in principle be used to improperly enrich this person. We then ask attorneys from Lex

Mundi law firms in 102 countries to describe in detail how each country’s legal system regulates

this transaction. In principle, several approaches can be used. One approach is to facilitate

private enforcement of good behavior. This approach emphasizes extensive disclosure (sunshine

as the best disinfectant), approval procedures for transactions, and facilitation of private litigation




                                                  2
when self-dealing is suspected. Another approach is to rely on public enforcement, including

fines and prison terms for self-dealing, as the United States has been increasingly doing through

the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. From the detailed answers supplied by Lex Mundi attorneys, we

construct numerical measures of the intensity of regulation of self-dealing along a variety of

dimensions, covering both public and private enforcement. The anti-self-dealing indices are

constructed for 72 countries. These data enable us to address three broad sets of questions

concerning the regulation of corporate self-dealing in different societies.

       First, we ask what factors determine the structure of the regulation of self-dealing in

different countries. In previous work, we have argued that the country’s legal origin, including

the common law, French civil law, German civil law, Scandinavian law, and Socialist law, is an

important determinant of the country’s strategy for protecting investors. We found systematic

differences among legal origins in the protection of both minority shareholders and creditors

through corporate and bankruptcy laws (La Porta et al. 1997, 1998) and in the intensity of

regulation of security issuance through security laws (La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, and Shleifer

2006). In this paper, we develop measures of investor protection much more directly linked to

the control of self-dealing, and examine the variation of these measures across legal origins.

        Second, we examine whether the anti-self-dealing measures we construct are related to

the development of financial markets, and if so which aspects of social regulation of self-dealing

are related to which financial outcomes. This enables us to evaluate alternative strategies of

regulation of self-dealing from both the scientific and the policy perspectives.

       Third, we compare the performance of alternative measures of shareholder protection as

predictors of financial development. To this end, we first present revised estimates of the anti-

director rights index of La Porta et al. (1997, 1998) for our larger sample of countries. Several




                                                 3
authors have criticized this index for both its ad hoc nature (which the creation of our anti-self-

dealing index is supposed to address), and for several conceptual ambiguities and outright

mistakes in coding (Pagano and Volpin 2005, Spamann 2005). Here we address these concerns,

and then examine the predictive powers of the revised anti-director rights index, the anti-self-

dealing index, and two measures of investor protection derived from securities laws (La Porta,

Lopez-de-Silanes, and Shleifer 2006). The results reveal some important similarities between

these very different measures of investor protection, but also some key differences.

       As a last note, we emphasize that we consider garden-variety self-dealing transactions, in

which the controllers of companies make choices that may benefit them at the expense of other

investors, but follow the law regarding disclosure and approval procedures. We are not dealing

with cases of corporate crime such as Enron or Parmalat. To stop such cases, every country uses

harsh criminal punishments. We are interested in a very different situation: if a controlling

shareholder wants to enrich himself but also to follow the law, how difficult is it for minority

shareholders to thwart the deal before it goes through and to recover damages if it is carried out?



2. Methodology.

       Our data are based on answers to a questionnaire completed by attorneys from Lex

Mundi law firms. Lex Mundi is an association of international law firms with members in 108

countries. We invited Lex Mundi firms to participate in the project and received complete

answers from 102 of them. After processing the authors’ answers, we conducted follow-up

conference calls to seek clarifications and asked respondents to confirm our coding of the data.

The sample we use in this paper is based on the answers of 72 authors who have confirmed the

validity of our data. The countries included in the sample represent 99.3% of total world market




                                                 4
capitalization in 2003. Among the countries that are not included in the sample, Saudi Arabia

has the largest stock market (ranked 24th in the world), followed by Iran (ranked 41st in the

world), and West Bank and Gaza (ranked 55th in the world).

       A key contribution of this paper is to construct an index of the strength of minority

shareholder protection against self-dealing by the controlling shareholder (anti-self-dealing

index). Our earlier index of anti-director rights (La Porta et al. 1997, 1998) was based on an ad-

hoc collection of variables meant to capture the stance of corporate law toward shareholder

protection. The present index addresses the ways in which the law deals with corporate self-

dealing in a more theoretically grounded way. Specifically, we start with a fixed self-dealing

transaction, and then measure the hurdles that the controlling shareholder must jump in order to

get away with this transaction. The higher the hurdles, the higher the anti-self-dealing index is.

       As a first step, we describe to the Lex Mundi law firms the stylized transaction between

two companies (“Buyer” and “Seller”) illustrated in Figure I. We assume that Mr. James owns

90% of Seller and 60% of Buyer, and that the latter is a publicly-traded firm. Mr. James is a

director of Buyer and his son is its CEO. Seller operates a chain of retail hardware stores and has

recently shut down many stores. As a result, some trucks in Seller’s fleet are not being used.

Mr. James proposes that Buyer purchases Seller’s idle trucks for a cash payment equivalent to

10% of Buyer’s assets (the transaction). He argues that Buyer could use additional trucks to

expand its sales. Mr. James is on both sides of the transaction and could benefit if Buyer

overpays for Seller’s trucks. In fact, under our case facts, a $100 wealth transfer from Buyer to

Seller would reduce the value of Mr. James’ equity in Buyer by $60 but increase the value of his

equity in Seller by $90. Although the proposed transaction has a possible business purpose, it

involves an obvious conflict of interest.




                                                 5
       To gather data on the regulation of self-dealing, we designed an extensive questionnaire

and tested it on nine Lex Mundi firms. A revised questionnaire was sent to all Lex Mundi firms.

The lawyers received the case study and were asked to describe the minimum legal requirements

in force in May 2003 regarding: (1) who approves the transactions; (2) what needs to be

disclosed to the board of directors or supervisory board, the shareholders, the stock exchange,

and the regulators; (3) what are the duties of officers, directors, and controlling shareholders; (4)

how the transaction’s validity could be challenged; (5) what causes of action are available if

Buyer suffers damages; (6) what needs to be proved under each cause of action; (7) who has

standing to sue under each available cause of action; (8) availability of direct and derivative

suits; (9) access to information and discovery rights; and (10) fines and criminal sanctions.

       The lawyers based their answers on all binding (i.e., not voluntary guidelines) laws and

regulations applicable under our case facts and substantiated their answers with references to all

relevant legal provisions. In addition, they provided the text of laws, statutes, judicial precedent,

and regulatory opinions used to answer our questionnaire. Sources of law typically incuded: (1)

company act; (2) civil and commercial code; (3) case law and judicial precedent; (4) stock

market act and regulations; (5) stock exchange listing rules; (6) civil procedure code; and (7)

criminal code. We read the relevant laws and coded the respondents’ answers. Finally, we

emailed our coding of the data to the respondents and held conference calls with every country to

confirm our interpretation of their answers and to make sure that our coding of the data is

comparable across countries.




                                                 6
The Regulation of Self-Dealing

       In theory, the law can regulate a transaction involving conflicts of interest so that it

replicates the terms and conditions that would exist in an arm’s-length transaction. The law can

also empower minority shareholders to seek remedy for expropriation through the courts or to

provide fines and criminal sanctions to those who expropriate. Below we describe our approach

to organizing the data. The exact definitions of the variables are contained in Table I.

       We examine several areas of law relevant to the transaction and summarize them with

one index of investor protection against self-dealing and one of public enforcement. To measure

the role of private enforcement, we keep track of disclosure and approval requirements imposed

by law before Buyer may legally acquire Seller’s trucks and of immediate disclosures after the

decision to enter into the transaction has been made. Since even a duly approved and disclosed

transaction may damage Buyer, litigation may be necessary to obtain restitution. Accordingly,

we also keep track of how easy it is for minority shareholders to obtain redress through the

courts when the transaction damages Buyer if all disclosure and approval requirements are met.

The last assumption is crucial since the laws of most countries provide harsh penalties for

breaking disclosure and approval requirements. Factors that affect the odds that the plaintiff

prevails in court include liability standards and the right to compel evidence.

       In addition to looking at measuring private enforcement, we capture the strength of public

enforcement by keeping track of the fines and sanctions that may be applicable to Mr. James and

those in charge of approving the transaction.

       To be more specific, begin with private enforcement. The first area that the law may seek

to regulate is the approval process. The basic choice is whether the transaction requires approval

by disinterested shareholders or alternatively may be approved by the CEO, the board of




                                                 7
directors (a majority of whose members were by case assumptions appointed by the controlling

shareholder who is on both sides of the transaction), or the shareholder meeting where the

controlling shareholder votes. An important assumption in our case facts is that all parties (i.e.,

controlling shareholder, CEO, and directors) vote in favor of the transaction whenever legally

possible even when doing so may expose them to greater litigation risk. Thus where the

interested party – or people under his control – can act to influence the outcome of the decision,

we assume that they do. For this reason, we separate out disinterested shareholder approval as

the purest case of arms-length endorsement of the transaction.

        Another critical way in which the law may seek to regulate the approval process is by

mandating extensive disclosures by the company and the related party on the view that "sunshine

is the best disinfectant" (Brandeis 1914). We keep track of the extent of disclosures by Buyer

and the controlling shareholder before the transaction goes through.1                        Finally, before the

transaction is approved, the law may require a review by independent third parties (e.g., financial

experts) who make available a report on the transaction and may act as a check on the

opportunism of the insiders. We summarize our data on approval requirements and immediate

disclosures through an index of ex-ante private control of self-dealing by investors.

        The second area that the law may seek to regulate is the ease with which minority

shareholders can prove wrongdoing.               First, disclosure requirements in annual reports and

periodic filings may facilitate the scrutiny of related-party transactions by outside shareholders.

The extent of such disclosure varies across jurisdictions.




1
  Empirical studies of disclosure center on the effect of disclosure requirements imposed by securities laws on stock
market outcomes. The early empirical literature was inconclusive (Stigler 1964, Benston 1973). Recent studies find
that mandatory disclosure rules are associated with larger stock markets in a cross-section of countries (La Porta et
al. 2006) and higher market valuations in the US (Greenstone et al. 2006).


                                                         8
       Second, in most jurisdictions, any damage that the transaction causes is assigned to Buyer

rather than to any individual shareholders. Since Buyer is unlikely to pursue legal action that

would harm its controlling shareholder, we measure the obstacles (e.g., high ownership

requirements) faced by minority shareholders to gain standing to sue on behalf of Buyer. The

cost of private enforcement increases with the obstacles faced by minority shareholders to sue

derivatively.

       Third, courts may void the transaction in cases of negligent approval or approval in bad

faith, or alternatively when the transaction is merely unfair or involves a conflict of interest and

damages the company. Similarly, Mr. James and Buyer’s directors may be liable for damages if

it can be proved that: (1) they acted in bad faith; or (2) they acted with negligence; or (3) that the

transaction was unfair or involved a conflict of interest. Naturally, private enforcement is more

costly when plaintiffs need to prove bad faith on the part of Mr. James or directors than when

they are merely required to show that the transaction involved a conflict of interest.

       Fourth, plaintiffs are more likely to prevail if access to evidence is extensive. We

consider three aspects of access to evidence: 1) whether plaintiffs can request the court to

appoint an inspector to examine the affairs of the company; 2) whether plaintiffs must identify

(e.g., by providing title and author) the specific documents that they seek to review; and 3)

whether plaintiffs can directly question defendants and non-parties in court. We combine our

proxies for ex-post disclosure and the ease of proving wrongdoing into an index of ex-post

private control of self-dealing.

       Finally, we create an anti-self-dealing index by averaging the indices of ex-ante and ex-

post private control of self-dealing.




                                                  9
       We next consider public enforcement. The law may deter wrongdoing by sanctioning the

controlling shareholder and those who approved the transaction with fines and criminal

sanctions. As a practical matter, most countries impose severe criminal sanctions when the

transaction has been approved in violation of the law.     For this reason, we only measure the

sanctions that apply to Mr. James and those who approved the transaction if all disclosure and

approval requirements have been met. To be sure, this is not the principal focus of criminal law.

       Even under our case facts, fines and criminal sanctions apply to behavior ranging from

criminal intent to obtain unlawful profit to breaches of duties of care and loyalty. To illustrate

the scope of such sanctions, consider an example. Under our case facts, Mr. James abstains from

a board vote on the proposed transaction if legally required to do so. However, while abstaining

from voting, Mr. James can still influence other members of the board to approve the transaction

so that he can obtain a personal benefit at the expense of the company. In Belgium, the directors

who approved the transaction – but not Mr. James – will face criminal sanctions for misuse of

company assets. Mr. James does face criminal sanctions in Sweden if he intentionally caused

damage to the company. The scope of criminal sanctions is wider in Germany where members of

the management board can be criminally liable for breach of trust if they violate their duty to

care for the assets of the company and the company suffers damages. We keep track of

maximum fines and prison terms applicable for such violations of the law.



3. Regulation of Self-Dealing Across Countries.

       Table II presents our data on approval and immediate disclosure requirements. Countries

are arranged by legal origin, and we report the means for each legal origin and the tests of the

differences in these means.




                                               10
       Two examples, Italy and the UK, illustrate our data and empirical approach. Italy ranks

42nd on our anti-self-dealing index, and is representative of civil law countries. The UK ranks

5th, and most common law countries (but not the US) model their regulation of self-dealing on

the UK. Briefly, related party transactions in Italy are approved by disinterested directors, not

shareholders. Most of the disclosure regarding related party transactions takes place in periodic

filings. When related-party transactions cause damage to the firm, the cost of private litigation is

very high.    In contrast, related-party transactions in the UK are reviewed by independent

financial experts and approved by disinterested shareholders. Extensive disclosure takes place

both before and after the transaction is approved. However, as in Italy, litigation in the UK is

costly. To substantiate these claims, we next discuss these two countries in further detail.

       In Italy, Mr. James, as an interested director of Buyer, has to notify the other directors as

well as the internal auditor of his interest in the transaction (i.e., his relation to and ownership in

Seller), and abstain from participating in the decision. Moreover, because Mr. James is a

director of Buyer, the transaction must be approved by Buyer’s disintereseted directors – but not

disinterested shareholders. In addition, Buyer’s internal auditor is required to attend the meeting

of the board of directors and review the transaction.

       Once the board of directors approves the transaction, Buyer has fifteen days to make

public a document describing it. This document must include: (1) a description of the assets

purchased by Buyer; (2) the nature and amount of consideration paid by Buyer to Seller; (3) an

explanation or justification for the price paid by Buyer for Seller’s assets; (4) the fact that Mr.

James owns 60% of Buyer; (5) the fact that Mr. James owns 90% of Seller; and (6) all facts

about the transaction that a reasonable person would believe to be material.




                                                  11
       Gaining standing to sue is straigthforward in Italy.         Any shareholder or group of

shareholders owning 5% of the shares in the company may sue the directors on behalf of Buyer.

However, shareholders would rarely exercise their right to sue as their odds of prevailing in court

are slim. First, the transaction cannot generally be voided or rescinded provided that it was

approved by disinterested directors and all required disclosures were made. Second, holding

disinterested directors liable for damages requires proving that they acted negligently and that

their actions caused damages to Buyer. Italian courts have stated that, generally, directors cannot

be held liable on the merit of their actions, provided that they acted with care, diligence and in a

professional manner. Third, and most importantly, Mr. James cannot be held liable if he has

abstained from voting.

       Shareholders in Italy may have a hard time gaining access to the information required to

prove that Buyer’s disinterested directors acted negligently. First, in case of a well-founded

suspicion of serious irregularities in directors’ conduct, shareholders holding 5% of the shares

can report the facts to the court. The court can then order an investigation of the Company’s

management at the expense of the claiming shareholders. Second, the plaintiff’s request for

documents must specifically identify the document(s) sought (e.g., indicate title, author, date,

and contents). Third, the Judge – not the plaintiff -- is in charge of questioning non-party

witnesses. Fourth, normally parties (e.g., plaintiffs) are not permitted to give evidence in the

case. When they are allowed to testify, the questioning of parties follows the same procedures as

that of non-parties.

       To wrap up the review of Italy, criminal sanctions and fines generally apply in case of

fraud but are unavailable under our case facts. As a result, the regulation of self-dealing in Italy

is solely based on trusting disclosure after the fact and on disinterested directors doing the “right




                                                 12
thing”. In this regard, disinterested directors are unlikely to be found negligent if they lend their

support to a transaction which, while favoring Mr. James, has a plausible business purpose. At

the same time, disinterested directors owe their position on Buyer’s board to Mr. James.

           In the U.K., modern regulation of self-dealing evolved from the common law equitable

rule that directors, being subject to fiduciary duties, could not enter into engagements with their

company when they had or could have had a conflicting personal interest or a conflict with the

interests of those they were bound to protect. This “no conflict” rule was subject to an important

exception: conflicted contracting was permitted provided that the conflict of interest was

disclosed in advance to the shareholders, who then approved the transaction. The scope of this

rule was enormous. The requirement of shareholder approval did not require showing an actual

conflict of interest between the company and the director (a potential for conflict was enough).

Nor was it necessary to show that the conflict had an impact on the terms of the transaction. All

self-dealing transactions required shareholder approval even if they appeared fair.

           As discussed in Davies (2002), during the nineteenth century the rule of equity lost its

bite as courts came to accept that shareholder approval for self-interested transactions could be

granted in general, rather than for specific transactions, in the articles of association. Provisions

began to appear in these articles permitting the board to contract on behalf of its members. But

legislators stepped in to put constraints on self-dealing. Statues and regulations currently in

force require that our hypothetical transaction be approved by both Buyer’s board of directors

and its shareholders for two reasons (1) because it is a substantial property transaction (i.e.,

exceeds £100,000 or 10 per cent of the company’s asset value) involving directors, and (2)

because it is a transaction with a related party2. Moreover, under stock exchange listing rules,

Mr. James must abstain from voting at the shareholder meeting.                Extensive mandatory
2
    Section 320 of the Companies Act of 1985 and 11.4 of the Listing Rules.


                                                          13
disclosures ensure that disinterested shareholders are knowledgeable about the transaction before

they vote to approve it. Specifically, Buyer must send a circular to shareholders containing not

only all material information regarding the nature and extent of any interests of its directors in

the transaction, but also a statement by the disinterested directors that the transaction is fair and

reasonable and that the directors have been so advised by an independent adviser acceptable to

the UK Listing Authority. Finally, Mr. James and any director who is in any way directly or

indirectly interested in the proposed contract must make “full and frank” disclosure of the

existence and nature of that interest at a board meeting.

       Once the transaction is approved by shareholders, the next annual report must contain the

particulars of its principal terms (including the director’s name and the nature of his interest and

the value of the transaction).

       If the transaction is properly approved with full disclosure, disgruntled shareholders will

not find it easy to challenge it in court. Shareholders must first gain standing to sue. In

principle, any shareholder may sue Mr. James and the directors on behalf of Buyer if there has

been a fraud on the minority (i.e., the majority of the shareholders succeeded in expropriating at

the expense of the minority the money, property or advantages of the company) and the

wrongdoers are in control of the company. However, shareholders may have trouble persuading

the courts that Mr. James is “in control” if a majority of disinterested shareholders have

embraced the transaction. If shareholders are allowed to sue, a contract in which a director is

interested may be voided if it is not made bona fide in the company's interest or for proper

purposes even if all required disclosures were made. Shareholders may also recover profits and

damages from directors who failed to exercise adequate care and skill or had a conflict of interest

and failed to act in the best interest of the company. However, the general principle is that




                                                 14
English courts will not correct a "bad bargain".3 In practice, this means that, absent a failure to

disclose material information, it is difficult to hold directors liable when the transaction was

reviewed by independent financial experts and approved by disinterested shareholders.

         Aggrieved shareholders in the UK have extensive access to information both before and

during proceedings. First, shareholders may request that the Secretary of State appoint an

inspector if the company’s affairs are being or have been, inter alia, conducted in a manner

which is unfairly prejudicial to some shareholders. Second, once in court, the plaintiff does not

have to specifically identify the document sought (e.g., by indicating the title, author, date, etc)

but can rather request categories of documents pertinent to the case. Third, the claimant can

cross-examine both a defendant and a non-party witness on the contents of his witness statement

or on any other evidence he has given in direct examination without prior approval by the court

of the questions posed.

         Under our case facts, public enforcement is toothless in the UK.                           Absent criminal

behavior or breach of the law, no criminal sanctions or fines apply to Buyer’s directors.

         In summary, the strength of the regulation of self-dealing in the UK lies in the heightened

scrutiny of transactions involving related parties before they may be approved rather than in

favoring litigation by minority shareholders.                   This has led legal scholars to remark that

“…judicial assessment of the fairness of self-dealing transactions has not been a significant part

of British law” (Davies, 2002, page 171). In fact, minority shareholders face a high burden of

proof in challenging the transaction because it was approved by disinterested shareholders with

both the advice of independent financial experts and full disclosure of all material information.




3
 Naturally, courts would take a different view in the event of fraud (e.g., if a material fact regarding the transaction
was not disclosed).


                                                           15
       The difference between Italy and the UK is representative of broader patterns. Turning to

the data on Table II, the most pronounced differences are between civil and common law

countries. Differences among civil law systems are seldom statistically significant and we do not

focus on them. Disinterested shareholders must approve the transaction in forty-eight percent of

common law countries but only eighteen percent of civil law countries. In contrast, the CEO

may single-handedly approve the transaction in twenty percent of civil law countries but never in

common law countries.

       Turning to disclosure, we keep track of the disclosures that need to be made by Buyer as

well as by Mr. James before the transaction is approved. The disclosure indices range from 0 (no

disclosure) to a perfect score of 1 (full disclosure). Buyer is required to make full disclosure in

57% of common law countries, but in only 24% of civil law countries. This pattern is reflected

in the index of disclosure requirements by Buyer, which takes value of 0.62 in common law

countries and 0.38 in civil law ones. Similarly, Mr. James also faces more extensive disclosure

requirements in common law countries than in civil law ones (0.95 vs. 0.55). Consistent with

this pattern, an independent review of the transaction is required in 48% of common law

countries but only 27 % of civil law ones. We summarize these results with the index of ex-ante

disclosure requirements. This index ranges from 0 in the Ukraine to 1 in countries such as Chile

and the UK and averages 0.68 in common law countries but only 0.40 in civil law ones.

       The index of ex-ante private control of self-dealing summarizes the approval and

disclosure requirements for our hypothetical transaction.       Common law countries typically

require both extensive disclosures and the approval of the transaction by disinterested

shareholders (the ex-ante private control of self-dealing index equals 0.58). In contrast, civil law




                                                16
countries typically have fewer disclosure requirements and entrust the approval of self-dealing

transactions to the CEO or the board of directors (the ex-ante index equals 0.29).

       Table III presents our data on the ease with which minority shareholders may prove

wrongdoing by Mr. James and the approving body. The index of disclosure in periodic filings

ranges from 0 (no disclosure) to a perfect score of 1 (full disclosure). Buyer is required to make

full disclosure in 43% of common law countries, but in only 12% of civil law ones.

Shareholders controlling 10% of the stock can sue Mr. James and the other directors in 95% of

common law countries and in roughly 80% of Scandinavian and German legal origin countries.

In contrast, shareholders have standing to sue in only 53% of French civil law countries. Legal

families also differ in the burden of proof for rescinding the transaction as well as for holding

liable controlling shareholders and directors. Interestingly, France is the only civil law country

where rescission is available when the transaction causes damages to Buyer. Rescinding the

transaction is impossible in 71% of civil law countries and requires proving fraud in the

remaining 27%. In contrast, Kenya and Zimbabwe are the only common law countries where

rescission is unavailable. In addition, four common law countries (Australia, Thailand, Uganda,

and the UK) limit rescission to cases of fraud. In the remaining fifteen common law countries,

plaintiffs face a lower hurdle than fraud to rescind the transaction.

       Consistent with our findings regarding the burden for rescinding a transaction, it is

typically easier to hold Mr. James and members of the approving body liable in common law

countries than in civil law ones. For example, Mr. James may only be held liable for fraud – the

most demanding standard – in 37% of civil law countries and 24% of common law ones. Here

Scandinavian legal origin countries are an exception among civil law countries: it is significantly

easier to hold Mr. James liable in Scandinavian civil law countries than in French and German




                                                 17
civil law ones. Access to evidence is also sharply higher in common law countries than in civil

law ones (0.73 vs. 0.46). Once again, Scandinavian legal origin countries are an exception

among civil law countries: access to evidence in Scandinavian legal origin countries is

comparable to that in common law countries.            The index of ease of proving wrongdoing

summarizes the litigation variables. It ranges from 0.06 in Luxembourg to 1.0 in New Zealand

and Singapore. Based on the index of ease of proving wrongdoing, litigation is significantly

easier in common law countries than in civil law ones (index of 0.74 vs. 0.39).

       The index of ex-post private control of self-dealing encapsulates the disclosure

requirements after the transaction is approved and the ease of proving wrongdoing. It shows that

disclosures requirements are more stringent and it is easier for plaintiffs to prove wrongdoing in

court in common law countries than in civil legal origin ones (score of 0.76 vs. 0.43).

       Finally, we average the ex-ante and ex-post indices of private control of self-dealing and

create an “anti-self-dealing” index. The index is sharply higher in common law countries (0.67)

than in civil law ones (0.36). Consistent with this pattern, the anti-self-dealing index is lowest in

Bolivia (0.08) and highest in Singapore (1.00).

       Interestingly, the regulation of self-dealing in the US and France depart in important

ways from the patterns of their respective legal families. The US does not have shareholder

approval for related-party transactions and instead emphasizes litigation to protect minority

shareholders against self-dealing. France allows related party transactions to be carried out

without shareholder approval if they take place on “normal” terms. However, it is easy to

challenge related-party transactions that take place without shareholder approval.

       To be more specific, under Delaware law, the transaction may be approved by the board

of directors. In fact, Mr. James may even participate in the decision. However, challenging the




                                                  18
transaction in court is very easy if, as we assume, interested directors participate in the decision.

In view of the fact that Mr. James controls both sides of the transaction, a shareholder would

start off with a case in which Buyer’s board would have the difficult task of proving fair dealing

and fair price (i.e., the “entire fairness” of the transaction).4 Fair dealing covers such questions

as when the transaction was timed, how it was initiated, structured, negotiated, disclosed to the

directors, and how the approval of the directors was obtained. Fair price relates to the economic

and financial considerations of the proposed transaction, including all relevant factors. Directors

must then show “entire fairness,” where all aspects of the issue are examined. Here, unlike in the

UK, the image of a “smell test” is a fitting metaphor for describing the work done by the judge in

examining whether the transaction is entirely fair.

         In France, agreements between Buyer and, among others, 10% shareholders must first be

approved by the board of directors and then by disinterested shareholders. However, no special

approval requirements are necessary for agreements “… entered into subject to normal

conditions”. In our empirical work, we assume that the transaction is approved by Buyer’s CEO

as if its terms were “normal” (i.e. the transaction is approved in accordance with minimum legal

requirements).       In practice, bypassing the approval requirements legally prescribed for

transactions between Buyer and Mr. James may not be wise since such agreements may be

cancelled if they have prejudicial consequences for the company. In sum, the requirement to

obtain shareholder approval for related party transactions is easy to avoid in France. However,

related-party transactions are easy to challenge if they are not approved by shareholders. In

practice, shareholder approval is almost always sought.

4
  We assume that the transaction is approved in accordance with minimum legal requirements. The Buyer’s board
of directors could seek shareholder approval of the transaction. Approval by either disinterested shareholders or a
special committee of disinterested directors would shift the burden of the proof to the plaintiff, but the standard of
review would remain entire fairness. See Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., 457 A.2d 701, 711-12 (Del. 1983).



                                                         19
       Turning to public enforcement, Table IV shows our data on fines and criminal sanctions

applicable when all approval and disclosure requirements are met, but Mr. James or the

approving parties breach their duties to the company. Those who approved the transaction are

subject to fines in 43% of the sample countries. In addition, on average, they may be imprisoned

for about two years. Interestingly, criminal sanctions for those who approve the transaction are

most severe in German civil law countries and least severe in common law countries. There are

no other significant differences among legal families. Sanctions on Mr. James are even less

severe than on the approving body and show no variation across legal origin. Perhaps it is not

surprising that Mr. James faces minimal criminal sanctions (1.8 years). The more surprising

result is that Mr. James is seldom subject to fines (33% of the sample). The index of public

enforcement summarizes our data on sanctions. It shows no variation across legal origins.

       Our discussion of the results has so far emphasized the role of legal origin as a

determinant of the regulation of self-dealing. One may also wonder whether differences in the

regulation of self-dealing can be explained by differences in income levels. For example, rich

countries may optimally choose to regulate self-dealing whereas poor countries may not be able

to afford to do so. Table V sorts countries by per capita income and reports the means of our

summary indices for the bottom quartile, middle fifty percent, and top quartile. There is little

evidence that the anti-self-dealing index varies by income level. In fact, the correlation between

anti-self-dealing and (log) GDP per capita is only 0.11 and statistically insignificant (see the

appendix). However, the index of ex-post private control of self-dealing is highest in rich

countries (0.65 vs. world average of 0.53). Access to evidence is more extensive and Mr. James

is more likely to be held liable in rich countries than in middle- and low-income ones (results not

reported). At the same time, the index of public control of self-dealing is the lowest in the poor




                                                20
countries, though not very different between the rich and the middle income countries. At least

with respect to private control of self-dealing, this evidence should alleviate the concern that

cross-country differences are explained by differences in income.



4. Regulation of Self-Dealing and Stock Market Development

       We are interested in linking the regulation of self-dealing to measures of the development

of stock markets. Table VI presents five indicators of stock market development. The first

variable is the ratio of stock market capitalization to GDP. The second is the number of

domestic publicly-traded firms in each country relative to its population. The third is the value

of initial public offerings in each country relative to its GDP. All three variables are five-year

averages of yearly data (the first two for the period 1999-2003 and the last one for 1996-2000).

Theoretically, the first of these three measures is the most attractive, since in theory better

investor protection is associated with both a higher number of listed firms and higher valuation

of capital (Shleifer and Wolfenzon 2002). Except for some differences in scaling and timing,

these three variables were used in La Porta et al. (1997, 2006) to study the consequences of

investor protection on stock market development.

       The fourth variable is the (median) premium paid for control in corporate control

transactions. In several theoretical models, this variable has been interpreted as a measure of

private benefits of control, which are higher in countries with weaker investor protection

(Grossman and Hart 1988, Nenova 2003, Dyck and Zingales 2004). The fifth and final variable

is a proxy for ownership concentration among the largest firms in the country. Both theory

(Shleifer and Wolfenzon 2002) and prior evidence (La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, and Shleifer




                                               21
1999, Claessens, Djankov, and Lang 2000, Faccio and Lang 2002) suggest that ownership

concentration is lower in countries with better investor protection.

       Consistent with our previous work, Table VI shows pronounced differences in financial

development across legal families. The most striking differences are between common law and

French civil law countries. Common law countries have sharply more valuable stock markets

relative to their GDPs (85.5% vs. 42.0%), more listed firms per million people (32.6 vs. 19.6,

although statistically insignificant), more IPOs relative to their GDPs (3.7% vs. 1.7%), a lower

value of control (4% vs. 16%), and less concentrated ownership (44% vs. 55%). Stock markets

in German and Scandinavian law countries are also generally less developed than in common

law countries but this pattern is less systematic than for French civil law countries. In particular,

German and Scandinavian law countries have levels of ownership concentration and IPO activity

comparable to those of common law countries. In addition, the number of listed firms per

million people is higher in Scandinavian legal origin countries than in common law countries

(69.4 vs. 32.6). In sum, for most indicators, stock markets are best developed in common law

countries.   The development of stock markets in civil law, particularly French civil law,

countries lags behind that of common law countries.

       To assess regulation of self-dealing, we first consider the effect on market capitalization –

the most commonly used measure of stock market development -- of each of the following six

aspects of the regulation of self-dealing transactions: (1) approval by disinterested shareholders;

(2) disclosure requirements before the transaction may be approved; (3) index of ex-ante private

control of self-dealing; (4) disclosure requirements in periodic filings; (5) ease of proving

wrongdoing; and (6) index of ex-post private control of self-dealing. All specifications include




                                                 22
logarithm of per capita income5 and the efficiency of the judiciary as measured by the number of

days to resolve a commercial dispute (Djankov et al. 2003a). Table VII shows that both higher

per capita income and the efficiency of the judiciary is associated with larger stock markets.

           The key result on Table VII is that all six measures of the regulation of self-dealing are

both statistically and economically significant. Figures II and III illustrate the relationship

between stock market capitalization and ex-ante and ex-post private control of self-dealing,

respectively. The estimated coefficients imply that a two-standard deviation increase in the

indices of ex-ante and ex-post private control of self-dealing is associated with an increase in

stock market capitalization of 30 and 34 percentage points, respectively. These effects are

economically large: the sample average stock-market-capitalization-to-GDP ratio is 59%. In

Figures II and III, Switzerland and Hong Kong are major outliers. One may wonder whether our

results are driven by extreme observations. However, we obtain qualitatively similar results

when either excluding those two observations or using median regressions.

           Switzerland plays a key role in making the results weaker than they would be otherwise.

Switzerland’s legal environment, from the perspective of disclosure, approval, and the burden of

litigation is extremely friendly to insiders and hostile to outside shareholders. Yet Switzerland

has an extremely valuable stock market. We might have missed some important legal protection

of shareholders in Switzerland, or it might have developed mechanisms for protecting minority

shareholders separate from the law. Alternatively, the enormous investment resources of the

Swiss banks might have artificially inflated the value of its stock market.

           Table VIII shows the effect of the indices of ex-ante private control of self-dealing (Panel

A), ex-post private control of self-dealing (Panel B), and anti-self-dealing (Panel C) on our five

indicators of the development of stock markets (Table VIII also includes the results on stock
5
    Results are qualitatively similar with the log of GDP per capita in constant purchasing power parity dollars.


                                                            23
market capitalization reported in Table VII). All three measures of the regulation of self-dealing

are statistically significant for both stock-market-capitalization-to-GDP and block premium. In

contrast, the ex-post private control of self-dealing index and the overall anti-self-dealing index

are significant for both (log) firms per million inhabitants and IPOs-to-GDP. Finally, only the

ex-post private control of self-dealing matters for ownership concentration. Below we discuss

the economic significance of these results.

       All three measures of the regulation of self-dealing have a large impact on the stock-

market-capitalization-to-GDP ratio. We have already noted that improving the index of ex-ante

(ex-post) private control of self-dealing by two standard deviations increases the stock-market-

capitalization-to-GDP ratio by 30 (34) percentage points. In addition, the predicted effect of

improving the anti-self-dealing index by two standard deviations (roughly the distance between

Singapore and Belgium or India) is to increase the stock-market-capitalization-to-GDP ratio by

38 percentage points. To assess the magnitude of these effects, recall that the average stock-

market-capitalization-to-GPD ratio in our sample is 59%.

       Both the ex-post control and the anti-self-dealing indices have a significant effect on the

(logarithm of the) number of domestic firms per million inhabitants. A two-standard deviation in

the ex-post private control of self-dealing is associated with a 62% increase in the number of

domestic firms. Similarly, as illustrated by Figure IV, a two-standard deviation increase in the

anti-self-dealing index is associated with a 44% increase in the number of domestic firms.

       The ex-post private control and the anti-self dealing indices also have a significant effect

on the IPOs-to-GDP ratio. The estimated coefficient implies that increasing ex-post private

control of self-dealing by two-standard deviations is associated with an increase in the IPOs-to-

GDP ratio of 1.9%. This effect is very large since the sample mean of IPOs-to-GDP is only




                                                24
3.0%. Finally, as illustrated by Figure V, the predicted effect of improving the anti-self-dealing

index by two standard deviations is an additional 1.8% in the IPOs-to-GDP ratio. Note that

Figure V raises concerns about the role of outliers. However, we obtain qualitatively similar

results when either dropping the UK from the sample or running median regressions.

       The regulation of self-dealing also has a large impact on the block premium. Increasing

the ex-ante private control of self-dealing by two-standard deviations is associated with a

reduction of 9% points in the median block premium -- a large effect since the block premium

averages 11% in our sample. Similarly, the estimated coefficients on ex-post private control and

anti-self-dealing indices imply that increasing either measure by two-standard deviations is

associated with an additional reduction of 10% in the median block premium. Figure VI shows

that the block premium is very high in Brazil and Mexico (49% and 47%, respectively), two

countries for which the anti-self-dealing index is low (0.29 and 0.18, respectively). Excluding

both countries does not alter the statistical significance of the results. However, the anti-self-

dealing index loses statistical significance (t-stat of 1.5) if we run median regressions.

       Finally, only the index of ex-post private control of self-dealing has an effect on

ownership concentration. The left (right) graph on Figure VII illustrates the relationship between

the index of ex-ante (ex-post) control of self-dealing and ownership concentration. Ex-ante

control of self-dealing simply does not lower ownership concentration (this result does not seem

to be driven by a few outliers). In contrast, increasing the ex-post self-dealing index by two

standard deviations is associated with a reduction of 9% in ownership concentration.            To

interpret this magnitude, note that the average ownership concentration in our sample is 47%.

       One concern with our findings on the effect of private enforcement on the development

of stocks markets is endogeneity. To address this concern, Table IX presents two-stage least




                                                 25
square regressions using common law as an instrument for the anti-self-dealing index.

Consistent with our OLS results on Table VIII, the anti-self-dealing index is significant in the

regressions for stock-market-capitalization-to-GDP, (logarithm) firms per million inhabitants,

IPOs-to-GDPs, and block premium (Panel A). In addition, legal origin is a strong predictor of

the regulation of self-dealing. Note also that income per capita predicts the regulation of self-

dealing when legal origin is included in the regressions but not in univariate regressions. These

results should alleviate endogeneity concerns although they do not address the possibility that

legal origin has an effect on stock market development through other channels.

         Public enforcement is the last area of law we examine. Table X shows that public

enforcement is not associated with more developed stock markets. In fact, public enforcement is

significant, but with the wrong sign, in only one regression (block premium). Figure VIII

illustrates the relationship between stock-market-capitalization-to-GDP and public enforcement.

It shows that there is no relationship between public enforcement and stock market capitalization

and that this absence cannot be blamed on outliers. Advocates of public enforcement may

dismiss our findings by arguing that what deters self-dealing is the probability that criminal

sanctions will actually be imposed (rather than their mere existence). Unfortunately, we lack

data on actual enforcement practices to test this view. 6 However, we conjecture that a proxy for

actual enforcement would have a hard time fitting the data since criminal sanctions are simply
6
  Using data from Bhattacharya and Daouk (2002) on the enforcement of insider trading laws, we find no evidence
that our index of public enforcement contributes to the development of stock markets in the sub-sample of 24
countries where insider trading laws where first enforced before 1996. Moreover, controlling for the anti-self-
dealing index, a dummy equal one if insider trading laws were first enforced before 1996 is significant only in the
regression for ownership concentration. As another way of capturing the actual enforcement of fines and criminal
sanctions, we run separate regressions for rich (above median GDP per capita) versus poor countries (below median
GDP per capita). However, we find that ownership concentration in poor countries is the only measure of financial
development that is predicted by public enforcement. In contrast, there is little evidence that the anti-self-dealing
index works differently in rich versus poor countries. Specifically, we generally cannot reject the hypothesis that the
estimated coefficient for anti-self-dealing is the same in the samples of rich and poor countries. The anti-self-
dealing coefficient is different in the two sub-samples only in the regression using (log) firms per capita as the
dependent variable. In this case, the coefficient is larger in rich countries than in poor ones and the difference is
(marginally) significant at the 10% level.


                                                         26
unavailable in roughly half the sample (32 countries) and this group exhibits enormous variation

in the size of stock markets (e.g. Hong Kong vs. Venezuela, both with a public enforcement

index of zero). Perhaps a better reason to be cautious about our findings on public enforcement is

that the criminal sanctions most relevant to the development of stock markets may be those

applicable under different case facts (e.g., failure to disclose) than ours.

       In sum, our evidence shows that a high anti-self-dealing index is associated with valuable

stock markets, more domestic firms, more initial public offerings, and lower benefits of control.

In contrast, the anti-self-dealing index is not reliably associated with ownership concentration

(although the index of ex-post control is). Finally, public enforcement does not predict more

developed stock markets.



5. Other Measures of Investor Protection.

       In previous work, we have constructed three other measures of investor protection: anti-

director rights, disclosure in the prospectus, and prospectus liability. In this section, we examine

the robustness of our findings on the effect of anti-self-dealing on the development of stock

markets when including these three alternative measures of investor protection. In particular, we

are interested in understanding whether the theoretically-grounded anti-self-dealing index works

better than the original index of anti-director rights in explaining financial development.

       We begin with the anti-director index. The original anti-director rights index, reported in

La Porta et al. (1997, 1998), is available for 49 countries and is based on laws in force circa

1993. This index has been criticized by a number of scholars for its ad-hoc nature, for mistakes

in its coding, and most recently for conceptual ambiguity in the definitions of some of its

components (Pagano and Volpin 2005, Spamann 2005). Our first step is then to describe and




                                                  27
present a revised index of anti-director rights for 72 countries based on laws and regulations

applicable to publicly-traded firms in May 2003. The revised index relies on the same basic

dimensions of corporate law, but defines them with more precision.

       Both the original and the revised anti-director rights indices summarize the protection of

minority shareholders in the corporate decision-making process, including the right to vote. The

index covers the following six areas: (1) vote by mail; (2) obstacles to the actual exercise of the

right to vote (i.e., the requirement that shares be deposited before the shareholders’ meeting); (3)

minority representation on the Board of Directors through cumulative voting or proportional

representation; (4) an oppressed minority mechanism to seek redress in case of expropriation; (5)

pre-emptive rights to subscribe to new securities issued by the company; and (6) right to call a

special shareholder meeting. The general principle behind the construction of the revised anti-

director rights index is to associate better investor protection with laws that explicitly mandate,

or set as a default rule, provisions that are favorable to minority shareholders. We recognize that

firms may, in their charters, opt out of the default rules set in the law. Firms may also enhance

investor protection by including in their charters provisions favorable to shareholders. However,

it has been shown theoretically (Bergman and Nicolaievsky 2006) and established empirically –

including in this paper – that the actual rules do matter for financial development.

       Methodologically, the key difference between the original and revised indices of anti-

director rights lies in the treatment of enabling provisions. To illustrate, consider the example of

cumulative voting in the US. The Delaware code contains a provision that explicitly allows the

certificate of incorporation of any corporation to provide that directors be elected through

cumulative voting.    In our earlier work, we did not draw a distinction between enabling

provisions and mandatory and default rules. Accordingly, our original index of anti-director

rights treats the US as having cumulative voting. Arguably, an enabling provision may lower the

cost of private contracting. However, we ignore enabling provisions when coding the revised

anti-director rights index and now treat the US as not having cumulative voting. We do so

because enabling provisions are more prevalent in common than in civil law countries and we

want to bias the results against the hypothesis that common law better protects investors.

       The revised anti-director rights index is based on six proxies defined on Table XI. First,

to make voting easier, shareholders may appoint a proxy to take their place at the shareholders’

meeting and vote on their behalf. In many countries, the solicitation of proxies is unregulated

and shareholders lack sufficient information to provide specific instructions to the proxy on how

to vote on the items on the agenda. In other countries, in contrast, shareholders may vote by mail

on each of the items on the agenda through a ballot or proxy form. The regulation of the proxy

solicitation process makes it easier for shareholders to both cast informed votes and oppose

proposals put forward by directors. Thus our first sub-index reflects the difficulty of making

informed votes by mail.

       Second, in some countries, the law requires, or permits companies to require, that

shareholders who intend to vote at the shareholders’ meeting deposit their shares with the

company or a financial intermediary. The requirement that shares be deposited is closely related

to the existence of bearer shares and is intended to force shareholders to prove their right to vote.

This requirement imposes a cost on shareholders as they must obtain a certificate proving their

ownership or are unable to sell their shares (i.e., shares are “blocked”) or both. Moreover, when

the identity of shareholders is unknown, dissenting shareholders face great difficulties forming

coalitions with like-minded shareholders before the meeting.




                                                 29
        Third, some countries mandate or set as a default rule that shareholders cast all their votes

for one candidate for the board of directors or supervisory board (cumulative voting) or provide a

mechanism of proportional representation in the board of directors or supervisory board. The

effect of cumulative voting and proportional representation is to limit the power of controlling

shareholders to dominate the board of directors or supervisory board.

        Fourth, some countries provide legal mechanisms that protect minority shareholders

against oppressive actions by controlling shareholders. These mechanisms include the right to

rescind transactions that are prejudicial to the company or to recover damages suffered by the

company in case of prejudicial resolutions of the shareholders’ meeting, or decisions of the board

of directors, or both. In contrast, in other countries transactions may only be rescinded in case of

fraud and shareholders may only seek to recover damages suffered by the company if they can

prove that directors acted with negligence, gross negligence, or fraud.7

        Fifth, in some countries shareholders have a preemptive right to buy new issues of stock,

which can only be waived by a shareholder vote. In the absence of preemptive rights, insiders

may expropriate minority shareholders by offering shares to related parties, or even to

themselves, at below-market prices.

        Finally, we consider the minimum fraction of capital or votes that entitles a shareholder

to call a shareholders' meeting. Shareholders owning at least 3% of the capital are entitled to call

a meeting in Japan, Korea, and Taiwan. In contrast, shareholders must own at least 20% of the

capital to call a meeting in Belgium, Venezuela, and Uruguay.                           Shareholders in firms

incorporated in Delaware may not call an extraordinary shareholders’ meeting at all unless

  This fourth component of the anti-directors index is closely related to the sub-index of ease of proving wrongdoing
in the anti-self-dealing index.


                                                        30
authorized by the certificate of incorporation or bylaws. Insiders have greater control over the

firm where it is more difficult for minority shareholders to call a shareholders’ meeting.

       Table XII presents the revised index of anti-director rights. Note first that the correlation

between the revised anti-director rights index and one presented by La Porta et al. (1997, 1998)

is 0.69. As in the case of the original index, differences between English and French legal origin

countries are extremely pronounced and we discuss them first. English legal origin countries are

more likely than French legal origin ones to provide voting by mail (81% vs. 19%), avoid the

requirement that shares be deposited (100% vs. 44%), and provide an oppression remedy (95%

vs. 23%). Moreover, English legal origin countries require less capital to call a shareholders

meeting than do French legal origin ones (9% vs. 12%).            In contrast, French legal origin

countries are more likely than English legal origin ones to require cumulative voting (34% vs.

10%) and to offer shareholders preemptive rights (91% vs. 52%). The index of anti-director

rights aggregates the information contained in these six proxies for investor protection.

Consistent with our earlier findings, the index of anti-director rights is sharply higher in English

legal origin countries than in French legal origin ones (4.29 vs. 2.77).

       Also consistent with our earlier work, there are several differences among civil law

families. Specifically, Scandinavian legal origin countries are more likely than French and

German legal origin ones to avoid the requirement that shares be deposited ahead of a

shareholders’ meeting (100% for Scandinavian countries vs. 44% and 36% for French and

German countries, respectively) as well as to provide an oppressed minority mechanism (60%

for Scandinavian countries vs. 23% and 32% for French and German countries, respectively).

Capital requirements to call a shareholder’s meeting in Scandinavian and German legal origin

countries (9% and 6%, respectively) are lower than in French (12%) legal origin countries and




                                                 31
comparable to those in English legal origin ones (9%). As a result of these differences among

civil law families, the index of anti-director rights is lowest in French legal origin countries

(2.77) and highest in Scandinavian ones (3.80). In fact, the anti-director index in Scandinavian

legal origin countries (3.80) is not statistically different than in English legal origin ones (4.29).8

         Table XIII shows the relationship between our five proxies for the development of stock

markets and both the original anti-directors variable (Panel A) and the revised one (Panel B).

The original anti-director rights index is associated with a higher stock-market-capitalization-to-

GDP ratio, more domestic firms and IPOs-to-GDP, a smaller block premium, and less ownership

concentration. The revised one, however, is insignificant in the regressions for block premium

and ownership concentration. The revised index has a large effect on the development of stock

markets. For example, a two-standard deviations increase in the anti-director index is associated

with an increase in stock-market-capitalization-to-GDP of 23 percentage points (sample mean of

59%), a 91% increase in the number of domestic firms per million inhabitants, an increase of 1.1

percentage points in the IPOs-to-GDP ratio (sample mean of 3%), and a reduction of 7

percentage points in ownership concentration (sample mean of 47%).

         Table XIV presents horse races between the anti-self-dealing index, (revised) anti-

director rights (Panel A), and the two variables from the La Porta et al. (2006) study of securities

laws: prospectus disclosure (Panel B), and prospectus liability (Panel C). Before presenting the

horse-race results, note that the correlations of anti-self-dealing with anti-director rights,

disclosure requirements, and prospectus liability are 0.54, 0.67 and 0.40, respectively (see

correlation table in the appendix). This suggests that it is going to be difficult to disentangle the


8
  Scandinavian countries have significantly higher income per capita than the rest of the sample ($29,374 vs.
$9,295). This raises the question of whether the strength of investor protection in Scandinavian countries may
simply reflect the fact that they are rich. However, the index of anti-director rights is uncorrelated (-0.05) with (log)
GDP per capita (see the correlation table in the appendix).


                                                          32
effects of the anti-self-dealing index and the disclosure in the prospectus, which is not surprising

in light of the fact that both measures heavily focus on disclosure (albeit in different spheres).

       When controlling for anti-director rights (see Panel A), the anti-self-dealing index loses

significance for firms per capita and remains significant for stock-market-capitalization-to-GDP,

IPOs-to-GDP, and block premium. In the same regressions (i.e., controlling for the anti-self-

dealing index), the anti-director rights index loses significance for stock-market-capitalization-

to-GDP and IPOs-to-GDP and remains significant only for (log) firms per capita. With the

caveat that the two indices are highly correlated, we conclude that anti-self-dealing is a more

robust predictor of the development of stock markets than anti-director index.

       Controlling for disclosure in the prospectus (Panel B), the anti-self-dealing index is never

significant. Disclosure in the prospectus, however, is significant in all regressions except for the

block premium. The high correlation between the two measures invites caution in interpreting

this evidence.

       Controlling for prospectus liability (Panel C), the anti-self-dealing index remains

significant for (log) firms per population, IPOs-to-GDP, and block premium and loses

significance for market-capitalization-to-GDP. Prospectus liability is significant in all

regressions. These results are broadly consistent with the view that both the anti-self-dealing

index and prospectus liability matter for the development of stock markets.

       In sum, we find that the anti-self-dealing index remains significant in three regressions

when combined with either the anti-director rights index or prospectus liability. However, the

anti-self-dealing index is never significant when combined with disclosure in the prospectus. In

contrast, prospectus liability is significant in all five regressions and prospectus disclosure in four

of them. Finally, the revised anti-director rights index is significant in one regression. These




                                                  33
results are consistent with the view that both disclosure and the power to enforce contracts

through private litigation are important for the development of stock markets. Multicollinearity

makes it hard to disentangle the relative contributions to the development of stock markets of

disclosure in the prospectus and the regulation of self-dealing.



6. Summary and Implications.

       We have constructed a new index of shareholder protection for 72 countries. The index

addresses specifically the protection of minority shareholders against self-dealing transactions

benefiting controlling shareholders. As such, it is better grounded in theory than the index of

anti-director rights constructed by La Porta et al. (1997, 1998) and revised for this paper. We

have found that the anti-self-dealing index exhibits some of the same properties as both the anti-

director rights index, and the indices of shareholder protection through securities laws presented

in La Porta et al. (2006). Specifically, the index is sharply higher in common law countries than

in French civil law countries. The index is also a statistically significant and economically

strong predictor of a variety of measures of stock market development across countries. These

results support the findings of the earlier work, but also show that theoretically-grounded

measures of investor protection are closely tied to financial development. In conclusion, we

would like to delineate the implications of these findings in three areas: the measurement of

shareholder protection, the interpretation of legal origin, and desirable regulatory strategies.



Implications for the Measurement of Shareholder Protection

       The availability of four measures of shareholder protection, each collected with a

different methodology and addressing a somewhat different situation, raises an obvious question:




                                                 34
what is “the best” measure for researchers to use? Unfortunately, there is no clear answer to this

question, largely because the measures are highly correlated with each other.           There are,

however, some noteworthy differences. The measures of shareholder protection from securities

laws appear to “work” best in terms of predicting stock market outcomes, but they are only

available for 49 countries. These measures are particularly appropriate for studies of protection

of investors buying securities, as opposed to corporate governance per se. The revised anti-

director rights index and the anti-self-dealing index are available for a larger sample of 72

countries. The former has the advantage of continuity with many previous studies; the latter has

the benefits of greater conceptual clarity in general, and relevance to the pervasive problem of

corporate self-dealing (or tunneling) in particular. Indeed, this last benefit seems to us to be

crucial. To the extent that self-dealing is the central problem of corporate governance in most

countries, the law’s effectiveness in regulating this problem is the fundamental element of

shareholder protection. Having said all this, our intent in future work is to test the robustness of

findings to the use of alternative measures of shareholder protection, unless there is a compelling

theoretical case to use one or another.



Implications for the Interpretation of Legal Origin

       For all the measures of shareholder protection we have considered, there is a pronounced

difference between common and French civil law countries. The examination of specific legal

rules permits some further insight as to what explains these differences among legal origins.

       Johnson et al. (2000b) conjecture that common law is more suspicious of conflicted

transactions than civil law, and subjects them to closer regulation and legal scrutiny. The results

of this paper are broadly consistent with that conjecture. Specifically, common law countries




                                                35
subject related-party transactions to greater disclosure requirements as well as to more arms-

length approval, than do French civil law countries in particular. These different approaches to

the regulation of self-dealing appear to derive from long-standing legal principles, such as

fiduciary duty, which over time are incorporated into the statutes that we actually observe.

       Compared to our previous research, we still find greater emphasis on ex post litigation in

common law than in civil law countries, although it appears that ex post – once the disclosure

and the approval requirements are met – it is quite difficult for shareholders to recover damages

even in common law countries. The US seems to be exceptional, with its greater emphasis on ex

post litigation rather than ex ante disclosure and approval. The ex ante transparency in self-

dealing transactions appears to be the central difference between common and civil law.

       At a broader level, the results are consistent with the view of Djankov et al. (2003b) that

common law is distinguished from civil law by its encouragement of private solutions to

problems of “disorder.” Statutory law aims to reduce the costs of these private solutions, but not

replace them by public ones. Mandatory disclosure and arms-length approval are very clear

examples of this broader strategy of social control of business associated with common law.



Implications for Regulatory Strategies

       If we take the evidence in this paper at face value, several ideas for the improvement of

regulation of corporate governance, particularly in the area of self-dealing transactions, emerge.

Perhaps the most basic conclusion from the data is that laissez-faire – the strategy of no public

involvement at all – does not lead to developed financial markets. The public sector clearly has a

central role to play, but principally as the designer of the rules of the game, which are then

enforced by private action. Specifically, our findings reinforce those in La Porta et al. (2006) on




                                                36
securities laws, who also identify the key role of private contracting and enforcement for

financial development, and deemphasize that of public enforcers. Countries with successful

stock markets mandate that shareholders receive the information they need and the power to act

– including both voting and litigation – on this information. There is no evidence that these

countries rely heavily on fines and criminal sanctions. This, perhaps, is the crucial message. But

there are specific conclusions as well.

       First, the results suggest that an effective strategy of regulating large self-dealing

transactions is to combine full disclosure of such transactions (including the potential conflicts)

with the requirement of approval by disinterested shareholders. Our study does not address the

question of just how large a transaction needs to be for disinterested shareholder approval to be

desirable, and we are not suggesting that all conflicted transactions, no matter how small, should

be brought to shareholders. Still, we do not see why this approach is incompatible with any legal

system, and why it would not be appropriate for countries at any level of economic development.

Sunshine indeed seems to be the best disinfectant. We note that the benefits of full disclosure for

stock market development were also extremely large in our study of securities laws (La Porta et

al. 2006), where we focused on disclosure by firms issuing securities to the public.

       Second, the evidence suggests that on-going disclosure of self-dealing transactions,

combined with the relatively easy burden of litigation placed on the aggrieved shareholders, also

benefits stock market development. Here reforms may be more difficult, as their success would

depend on the more general structure and efficiency of legal systems in different countries.

Nonetheless, the results suggest that giving aggrieved shareholders the standing to sue, access to

information to identify self-dealing, and a low burden of proof would deter self-dealing and

promote stock market development.




                                                37
       Finally, the evidence suggests that the government’s power to impose fine and prison

terms for self-dealing transactions that meet disclosure and approval requirements does not

benefit stock market development. We stress that this is a narrow conclusion, since it does not

address the importance of public enforcement in situations where self-dealing transactions are

concealed, as in the cases of Enron or Parmalat. To avoid self-dealing, however, it appears best

to rely on extensive disclosure, approval by disinterested shareholders and private enforcement.

Figure I. Case facts. Buyer Co. (“Buyer”) is a food manufacturer company. It is a publicly
traded firm that is listed on the country’s largest stock exchange. Buyer manufactures and
distributes all of its products itself.

Mr. James is Buyer’s controlling shareholder and a member of Buyer’s board of directors. He
owns 60% of Buyer, and elected 2 directors to Buyer’s 5-member board of directors. Junior is
Mr. James’ son and CEO of Buyer.

Mr. James also owns 90% of Seller Company, which operates a chain of retail hardware stores.
Seller recently shut a large number of its stores. As a result, its fleet of trucks is not being
utilized.

Mr. James proposes to Buyer that Buyer purchase Seller’s unused fleet of trucks to expand
Buyer’s distribution of its food products. Buyer agrees. The final terms of the transaction
require Buyer to pay to Seller in cash an amount equal to 10% of Buyer’s assets in exchange for
the trucks. The transaction is part of Buyer’s ordinary course of business and is not ultra vires.

Buyer enters into the transaction. All required approvals are obtained and all the required
disclosures made. The transaction might be unfair to Buyer. Shareholders sue the interested
parties and the approving body.

                            Description of the revised anti-director rights index

Variable                                                                Description
Vote by mail                         Equals one if the law explicitly mandates or sets as a default rule that: (a)
                                     proxy solicitations paid by the company include a proxy form allowing
                                     shareholders to vote on the items on the agenda; (b) a proxy form to vote on
                                     the items on the agenda accompanies notice to the meeting; or (c) shareholders
                                     vote by mail on the items on the agenda (i.e. postal ballot); and zero otherwise.

Shares not deposited                 Equals 1 if the law does not require, nor explicitly permits companies to
                                     require, shareholders to deposit with the company or another firm any of their
                                     shares prior to a general shareholders meeting.

Cumulative voting                    Equals one if the law explicitly mandates or sets as a default rule that
                                     shareholders owning 10% or less of the capital may cast all their votes for one
                                     board of directors or supervisory board candidate (cumulative voting) or if the
                                     law explicitly mandates or sets as a default rule a mechanism of proportional
                                     representation in the board of directors or supervisory board by which
                                     shareholders owning 10% or less of the capital stock may name a proportional
                                     number of directors to the board, and zero otherwise.

Oppressed minority                   Index of the difficulty faced by (minority) shareholders owning 10% or less of
                                     the capital stock in challenging (i.e. by either seeking damages or having the
                                     transaction rescinded) resolutions that benefit controlling shareholders and
                                     damage the company. Equals one if minority shareholders may challenge a
                                     resolution of both the shareholders and the board (of directors or, if available,
                                     of supervisors) if it is unfair, prejudicial, oppressive, or abusive; equals one-
                                     half if shareholders are able to challenge either a resolution of the shareholders
                                     or of the board (of directors or, if available, of supervisors) if it is unfair,
                                     prejudicial, or oppressive; equals zero otherwise.

Pre-emptive rights                   Equals one when the law or listing rules explicitly mandate or set as a default
                                     rule that shareholders hold the first opportunity to buy new issues of stock;
                                     equals zero otherwise.

Capital to call a meeting            The minimum percentage of share capital [or voting power] that the law
                                     mandates or sets as a default rule as entitling a single shareholder to call a
                                     shareholders' meeting (directly or through the court). Define capital to equal
                                     one when capital to call a meeting is less than or equal to 10 percent and zero
                                     otherwise.

Anti-director rights index           Aggregate index of shareholder rights. The index is formed by summing: (1)
                                     vote by mail; (2) shares not blocked or deposited; (3) cumulative voting; (4)
                                     oppressed minority; (5) pre-emptive rights; and (6) capital.
