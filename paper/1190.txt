                                 The Economy of Israel


                                       ABSTRACT




        The paper   opens with   a description of the salient features of the

Israeli   economy. These consist of a large government sector         (the governnnt

budget has absorbed riore than 80% of GNP in some recent years); high levels
of defense spending; a large government budget deficit; a large current
account deficit (about 20% of GNP); triple digit inflation; and extensive
indexation of beth wages and long       term financial   conimitrrents. A descriptive
nodel   of the econany is then presented, which includes the particular
asset menu of the Israeli economy, and its properties examined. Finally,
the rrodel is used in analyzing aspects of the Israeli inflationary experience.
The currency liberalization of 1977, which increased the access of Israelis
to   foreign assets, shares respensibility for the high rate of inflation. The

pessibilities   of ending   the inflation are discussed.

       From 1953 to 1973 real GD? in Israel grew at an annual rate of
nearly 10%; over the next nine years the grewth rate us only 3%, as
Table 1 shows.' Fran 1953 to 1973, the average inflation rate (CPI)
was 7.1%; fran 1973 to 1979 the inflation rate averaged iore than 40%;
arid in the last three years the annual inflation rate has been in        the

triple digit range.
      The aims of this paper are to describe the structure and
pert ornnce of the Israeli economy, and to account for the worsening 01
its inflation perfonnce over the last decade. We begin with a
description of the current state and structure of the economy.

                            The Inflationary Economy.

        GNP per capita in Israel at the end of 1981 s about $5500, 45% of

the United States level, roughly at the levels of Greece, Singapore, and

 Ireland   2 Per capita consumption is also about 45% of the United         States

level.     P is around $22 billion.
        The Structure of Dennd: Table 2 provides a first perspective on
some special features of the Israeli economy. The consumption and
investment shares in GNP are not out of the ordinary. But government
consumption    is extremely high; the average for the     OEXD countries is
17%, with the share even in the case of Sweden being less than          30%. The
openness of the economy is shown        by the large shares of both exports and
imports in GNP, and the balance of trade problem by the rrgnitude of the
import    surplus.3

        The dominant role of government and the magnitude of the government
budget deficit are clearly revealed by Table 3,        which is based   on IMF
data. Over the past five years government has on         average disposed of
more than 70% of      GNP and received more than half of GNP in revenues.

The budget deficit has      averaged   more than 20% of GNP. Fiscal year

1982/3   shows the effects of the war in Lebanon, with government

expenditures reaching an extraordinary 90% of GNP, and        tax   revenues

exceeding half of GNP as a result of revenue measures imposed in mid—
1982.    It can   be seen that defense spending accounts for most      of
government consumption. The       share   of resources being used for defense

is   understat?d in the national accounts, in particular because
conscripts are    paid   a below market wage. One estimate   is that    total

resources devoted to defense may be 50% more than the amourt estimated
in the accounts.4

       Inflation,    the   Assets    Markets, and_Indexation: Figure 1 and Table

4 show CPI inflation rates fourth quarter over fourth quarter. Note in

particular that after 1954 the Israeli economy enjoyed a long period of

single digit inflation. Even after the 1967 war, the inflation rate

rnained in single         digits until 1973.    After the Yom Kippur War       there
were   tw   years of inflation near 40%, and then a to year decline in

the inflation rate in 1976 and 1977. Foreign currency holdings re

itheralized at the end of 1977. The inflation rate then increased, but

it was only in 179         that it   went above 100%. Since      then the inflation
rate has remained     in    a range   above 100%.

       Indexation    of asset returns and wages has been extensive in Israel
for over three decades, despite the fact that th inflation rate was
reasonably low and stable for most of the fifties and sixties.5
Israeli residents ny hold assets with returns indexed to either the
price level or the exchange rate. They have also been entitled since
the 1977 liberalization to hold foreign bank accounts and foreign
currency, up to specified limits.
     Table 5 shows the financial asset holdings of              the public,

excluding   ownership of      foreign   currency and assets held abroad, for
which there are no data. Shekel denominated (nominal) assets account
for less than 4%     of financial assets.6 The bulk of the public's
financial   assets   are indexed to the price level, although only a small

.rt of the indexed assets are           marketable.   }bst index bonds are     held
indirectly through private pension funds, which are             obliged    to hold the

bonds.7 Nate the large increase in the share of equity in financial

assets during   1982,      reflecting a stock market boom.

liabilities corresponding to most of the non—equity financial assets
owned by the private sector. Thu reserve requirement for the banks
against foreign currency linked deposits is 90%; and the indexation
provided by private institutions is based on their holdings of
government indexed liabilities. Thus the government's daninance in the
allocation of resources extends to the capital markets; indeed, most
private investment is financed with government assistance.
        Wage iudexatioa is included as part of   the   contract negotiated
between the Histadrut (trade union organization) and the Manufacturers'
Association. These agreements, typically biennial, cover most of the
labor force. The frequency and      details   of cost of living adjustments
have varied over the years. Currently the adjustments are made        every

three months, with compensation for inflation varying with the
inflation rate. For instance, if the quarterly inflation rate is less
than 20%, there is 80% compen.tion for inflation; if the inflation
rate    is more than 30%, compensation is 90%. It is also agreed that

ther: will be nego1tions between the Histadrut and the umployers if

the real wage falls.8

        The Activities and Financing of Government: The government budget

deficit reported in Table 3 for the years 1978—1982 is the       total
deficit      on both internal and external account, as recorded in the IMF

data,    for fiscal years. Table 6's more detailed budget data for

calendar year 1981 present a fuller description of the scope of

government     activity in the economy.9

        Note first that government purchases of goods and services, lines

(1+12) amount to 44% of ON]?. The 44% includes 27% in defense spending,

much    of   that abroad, and c1os to 6% that is investment spending

          above the 33% recorded as government consumption in Table 1.
          The difference is accounted for by government investment
          activities, and by the fact that government consumption in

Subsidies recorded in line 3 are for the purchase of goods and
services.
       In addition, the government provides extensive subsidies to
borrowers, scrne recorded in line 4. However, the major subsidization
of credit has occurred through the provision of low nominal         interest

loans; the Bank calculates the subsidy element in such credit during
1981 at nearly 7% of GNP. This amount is noted in Table          6, but   not

included     in any of the budget totals. The provision of low nominal
interest rate credit since 1979 has been in the process of being phased
out and replaced    by indexed   loans.11
       The government finances its activities mostly through taxation.
The largest revenue generators are the income tax and value added tax,
which in 1981 raised 18.1% and 5.2% of GNP respectively. National

insurance payments in 1981 were 7.7%        of   GNP. There is an impressive

array   of   other taxes. In addition, as Table 6 shows, U.S. government

grants provide a substantial     proportion of     the financing for government

spending.

       At this point, the logical step is to explain how the deficit of

19.4% of GNP in Table 6 was financed in 1981, through external

borrowing, domestic borrowing in the form of both price level and

exchange rate linked assets, and the creation of high—powered money.

Regrettably     data difficulties now become significant. The IMF presents

the data contained in Table 7a, for fiscal year 1981/2, which begins

April 1. The deficit before foreign grants in that period was nearly

23% of GNP. Foreign grants and loans financed more than half of that

amount. Domestic borrowing amounted to 10% of GNP, a large jrt of
that    from the Bank of Israel. The difference between entries 7 and 8

in    the table is presumably a result in the differences in       the tiinthg
with   which transactions are recorded by the Treasury and actual

payments. In fiscal year 1981, there was substantial use           of Bank of
Israel    credit by the Treasury, more than in most earlier years.
       Table 7b presents Bank of Israel data on government finance. The
data are much less clean than those of the IMF. The Bank does not
present a comprehensive table on the financing of the government
deficit,   concentrating instead on financing of the domestic component
of the deficit, defined as the deficit that arises from the
government's activities in the domestic economy. As can be seen, there
is a significant difference between the estimates of the domestic
deficit    in   Tables 6 and 7b. Bather than dwell on these difficulties, I

note that it appears that sales     of   both bonds and foreign exchange,       in
approximately equal amounts, provide most of the financing for the
domestic deficit. Nonetheless, the increase in the money base accounts
for the financing of a significant component of government spending-—
about 2.5% of GNP.1 2 Even though the monetary base in 1931 was under
3.5% of GNP, large amounts of     revenue can    be raised   at high rates of
inflation 13
       Part B of Table 7b attempts to account for the foreign component

of   the deficit. The government sector borrowed heavily abroad, using
the   proceeds both to pay for government imports and to sell to domestic
residents. In this account too      there    remains a sizeable discrepancy,
part of which may result from capital gains on the Bank of Israel's
holdings of foreign reserves. Adding parts A and B of Table 7b, we
find the general outlines confirm those of Table 7a, which applies to
fiscal year 1981. In both Table 7a and 7b it appears that foreign and

domestic borrowing are of the same order of magnitude.

       International Trade: Tables 8 and 9 present details of Israel's

international transactions in 1981. The bulk of imports of goods is

accounted for by intermediate products and by oil. A significant share

of   exports is accounted   for by industrial goods; some of these are

defense—related.     The service account is large on both the import and
export side, and is close to being balanced. Note that the balance on
goods and services in 1981 was just less than gross investment. It can
be said——though not accurately——that Israel's investment spending is
financed from abroad.
       Table 9 examines the financing of the current account deficit and
details of aid. Unilateral transfers, governmental and private, cover
most of the deficit on net goods and services account. Unilateral
transfers   to the government are American government grants. About half

a billion dollars is received by the national institutions, primarily

the Jewish Agency, as a result of donations by world Jewry. Farther

unijateral transfers from     indi'iiduals are   made   to   the private sctor.

German reparations continue at a level of close to a half billion

dollars; these restitution payments are made directly to individuals.

       Table 9C contains more detail on U.S. government aid. Before the

1973 war, U.S. aid was small. In 1973, emergency military aid

amounting to   more than 10% of GNP   was provided, and total aid has

remained    at approximately that level since then.          More than half   the
flow   of resources from the U.S government in any       one    year is grants.
The column "Net Loans" is the sum of new loans made within the year,
minus   interest   and principal payments. This amount         is   expected to
reach zero in 1983.

     U.S. government aid is related to purchases of defense equipnent
in the U.S. Aid arid defense imports are of the same order of
magnitude, with defense imports typically slightly in     excess   of aid.
      The exchange   rate has since 1977 been on a very dirty 'float. The

Bank of Israel intervenes in the market continuously, and occasionally

attempts to stabilize the inflation rate by causing the exchange rate

to appreciate. The reform of 1977 liberalized       the capital    account,

permitting free capital flows and also the holding of 'foreign assets by

danestic residents.15 Subsequently the authorities have intervened to

affect capital movements. Qe intervention took the form of a tax on

capital imports, imposed in 1979 when domestic tight monetary policy

raised interest races and caused an undesired (by the authorities)

capital inflow.

      Monetary Policy: Monetary policy in Israel is constrained by two

factors: first, real interest rates on index bonds are inflexible and

determined legislatively; and second, political pressures make it

difficult to allow the real exchange rate to move freely. Neither

constraint is absolute. First, it is only the yield on new bonds that

is fixed by legislation, and the Bank of Israel can intervene in the

secondary   market to attempt to move the yield on bonds. In       practice

itsinterventions are directed chiefly to stabilizing the price of
bonds. Second, the real exchange rate is sometimes allowed to
change 16

      Given   the constraints under which it works, the   Bank has not in
the   recent inflationary period pursued money growth targets. It has

pursued credit targets, by limiting the amount of credit banks can

provide   their customers. Strict credit targets and controls were in
                                                9



effect in 1979. At that time the targets were partially specified in

Israeli       currency terms, and partially in foreign        currency. This meant

the    nominal targets adjusted automatically for exchange rate changes.
But this was not the major hole in the credit constraint; it was
instead the availability of subsidized export credits. Up to the time
of the' 1979 credit freeze and squeeze, the export credits had not been
fully utilized.       Once the credit controls came         into   effect, exporters

took    the   full amount   of   export credit to which they were entitled, and

provided trade      credit to        their   customers. The private sector thus
began to find ways around the Bank's credit constraints, as it
typically does. Nonetheless, the 1979—80 period of restraint                 did

significantly reduce the balance of payments deficit.

        The Governor of the Bank of Israel is described by the law as the
government's economic adviser, but there is no evidence               that the advice

that    has been offered——which is typically to got the budget deficit
under control—-has been taken. The initiative for economic policy is
with the Finance Minister, and the Bank has attempted to ru'i a
restrictive policy only when the Finance Minister has so desired. This
has been infrequently.
       The Goals of Policy: Israeli policyinakers have generally given
first   priority to reducing          the balance of payments deficit. Cbncern
over    inflation has mounted in recent years, but has not been sufficient

to induce tough anti—inflationary policies. There were in the 1970's

two major episodes of contractionary policy, in 1975—76 and 1979—80,

each of which was aimed mainly at the balance of payments deficit, but

with the implied effects on the inflation rate clearly being welcome.

In both cases there was          a   significant reduction in the balance of
                                       10



payments   deficit, but less effect on the inflation rate.

       The liberalization of foreign exchange holdings in 1977 was

followed a year later by the transition to triple digit inflation. The

role, if any, of the liberalization in the increase in the inflation

rate will be discussed below.

       The most ambitious attempt to reduce the payments        deficit   and the

inflation rate was undertaken in 1979 by a newly appointed finance

minister, who   directed   his   efforts at   reducing the budget deficit,

partly   through freezing government employment and partly through
removing purchase subsidies. At the same time, the Bank of Israel was
to constrain credit growth. The policy began to work by increasing
unemployment in early 1980, the balance of payments deficit narrowed,
but there was no quick impact on the inflation rate. The restrictive
policies were extremely unpopular, and with an election expected, the
finance minister was replaced by the present minister.
       The new minister argued that supply side policies would reduce the
inflation rate, and claimed to iiçlement         them   by reducing import
tariffs and increasing subsidies. In the judnent of political
observers, the policies were successful at turning around an election
that had seemed lost by the government. There has been no subsequent
sign that the government is willing or interested in reducing inflation
if there is a price-—in terms of forgone output—-to be paid.
      The prolonged period since Qtober 1982 during which the real
exchange rate has been appreciating as part of an anti—inflationary
policy   is unusual   in that the balance of payments goal of policy has
been   sacrificed to the inflation goal. The preference for attempting

to stabilize    inflation by manipulating the exchange rate without
                                      11




pursuing other contractionary policies reflects the     general
unwillingness    of policy—makers in the period since   1973 to stabilize

the inflation rate by reducing aggregate demand and causing
unemployment.
                                     Model

     In this section I outline a descriptive model of the Israeli
economy based on the post—1977 strucutre of the financial system, that
I believe captures the main mechanLsn in the operation of the economy.
The model is presented both as an attempt to provide a concise
description of the economy, and because it is used in Section III to
guide the discussion of the causes of the current inflation and
pcsuible methods o1   reducing   the inflation rate.
The Structure of the Model.
     The Assets I&.rkets: There are four assets: money; domestic price
level (CPI) indexed bonds; foreign currency denominated securities; and
equity claims to the returns on physical capital. Money is denominated
in shekels and pays no interest. In the model v assume all money is a
government liability; we thus omit inside shekel-denominated
deposits.17     Index bonds are liabilities of the government. We assume
linkage is 100%, although formally some bonds have less than complete
linkage.18 1iysical capital (or the equity claims on capital's
returns) is assumed to be a perfect portfolio substitute for index
bonds.19
     Israeli   residents may hold both foreign securities and
domestically   issued exchange rate linked securities. In form, the

latter   are bank liabilities but because the reserve requirement against
such deposits is 90%, v, treat them as a liability of the government.

The governr13nt pays interest on the reserves held against the foreign
currency linked securities.

The appendix lists symbols in the order in which they appear.

            Equations (1) througi (3) are suppi equals den.nd conditions for
the real rney stock, real assets (bonds plus capital) and foreign
assets respectively. The stock budget constraint ensures that the
three equations are linearly dependent. The assets are assumed to be
 gross substitutes •2 I
                                           13




        An   increase in output increases the demand for money for
transactions purposes and therefore must, by            the   stock budget
constraint,     reduce the demand for at least one of the other assets.

Since foreign—currency linked deixsits are sneLiiiies              used as    medium   of
exchange, we assume that the demanJ for bonds and capital falls when

the level of output rises, sthile the effect on the demand for foreign

currency linked securities of a rise in output is allowed to be either

positive or negative. The demand for each asset increases with

wealth.

        Fquatton   (4)    states that the expected real yield on capital is

equal to the real yield on index bonds. This condition reflects the
assumption that the two assets are perfect portfolio substitutes. The

marginal     product of capital is assumed to decrease with              the capital

stock    and increase with the level of output.
        The Goods Market: There is a single domestically produced good,
with aggregate supply function:
    =                                                                              (6)

The supply function is homogeneous of degree zero in p, w, and ep.

        Aggregate demand     for   domestically produced goods is:

                   etpt
y                              Kt, G,T);        l>0, l>>0, (3>0 4>O1 (7)

Real    exchange rate depreciation increases the demand           for    domestically
produced goods. So does an increase in q, which increases investment
demand.22 For any given q, investment demand increases with the
capital stock, so that increases in K increase aggregate demand given

transfers) affect aggregate demand for danestic goods.
     Wage Settiag: The rate of increase
                                         of the nominal wage is in part
determined       by indexation, with past inflation rates      determining     present

rates of nominal wage        increase.    In addition, the   rate   of   wage increase

is affected by expectations of inflation and
                                                        deviations   of output fran

The term following the coefficient a1 represents the effects of
indexing: actual past inflation affects today's rate of wage increase.
 So too does anticipated inflation, to an extent that depends on how
 much compensation will occur through indexation. Indexed wage
 adjustments in practice take p!.ace every three months.
     The third term on the right hand side represents the pressure of
 demand on the wage. When output is expected to be above the full
 employment level, y*, wages rise more rapidly.
       When there has been unanticipated inflation in the past, with the
 coefficient a1 less than unity, some catch-up of real wages will ocur.
 These catch—ups occur mainly at the bargaining over base wages between
 the Histadrut (Labor Federation) and the employers. We represent them

in the    model by         including   a term in ((w/p)*            (w/p)), the difference
between    the    equilibrium or full        employment          real wage and the actual
real wage. The catch—up term nkes                      it   more difficult for accelerating

inflation permanently to reduce              the      real wage. There is accordingly

rocin   for real wages to be affected by                the dynamics of the inflation

process.     Because this last term adjusts the wage on the basis of the
difference between actual              and full employment wages, it            does not
represent "real wage resistance," a phencinemon which could be added.
Equation    (8)   is of course a Phillips curve.
        The Government Budget Constraint: The government purchases goods
both at    hone   and      abrcyad, and finances itself by taxation, money issue,

domestic security issues, foreign borrowing,                      and foreign   aid. The

government budget constraint is:

are exogeneous to the Israeli ecoriany. In discussing the determination

of short run           equilibrium   we take expectations (of the price level,

relative price of capital, and the exchange rate) as given.

         The    Assets Markets: Equilibrium         in the assets markets can    be
studied using equation (4) and any to of equations (1) — (3). The aim
is to show the asset market equilibrium values of q anti c/p conditional
on values of the price level and output, along with the stock and
expectational variables. We will examine                the proportis   of the
functions that express asset market equilibrium conditions:

         Figure 2 shows equilibrium loci for the money (IL) and bonds (BB)

markets. In drawing these loci,             the    level of output, y, is taken to be

constant, as are the other variables in the vector X defined in (15).

         The   IL locus in Figure 2 is negatively sloped because an increase
in q causes an excess demand for real balances through both wealth and
                                          18




rate   of return effects. The excess demand has to be offset by a
reduction   in e/p, reducing     real   wealth, to maintain    equilibrium. In
the   bond—capital   market,   whose equilibrium is shown by the BB locus, an

increase   in q causes excess supply       which is offset by an increase in

demand    induced through an increase in the real exchange rate. Also
shown in Figure      2   is the FF locus (equation (3)), which is positively
sloped   and steeper than the BB locus. Asset market equiltbrium obtains

at point E, with corresponding equilibritJn values of the price of

installed capital (and the real         interest   rate) and   the   real exchange

rate.

        We now show graphically how      changes   in the price level and the

level   of output respectively affect the equilibrium valucs of q and
e/p.    In Figure 3, an increase in the price level creates an excess
demand for real balances, thus shifting the IL curve to the left, to
LW. The increase in the price level creates an excess supply of
bonds, shifting B8 to the right, to BB'.            Clearly, q falls. The
effects on    the rea3 exchange rate appear        ambiguous. However, the real
exchange rate must fall, because both a rise in           the price level and

decline in q create an excess supply of foreign currency denominated
assets, which is removed by a fall in the real exchange rate. Thus the
new equilibrium at E' shows both q and e/p lower as a result of the
rise in the price level.
        In Figure 4 we present a similar analysis of the effects of an
increase in the level of output. This simultaneously raises the
transactions demand for money and the marginal product of capital. For
given q, the real interest rate rises. The net effect on the demand
for real balances is ambiguous, but we assume it to be positive.

Accordingly, the LL curve shifts to the left, to LL'.

       In the    market for foreign currency denominated assets, the
increase in output has an uncertain effect on demand through the
transactions variable, and reduces demand through the rate of return
variable.        We assume            demand falls, thus shifting the FF curve        in   Figure
4 to the left, to FF'. The real exchange rate fails. The effect on q
is uncertain. The transactions demand related effects tend to cause
to fal12 while those associated with the increase in the marginal

product of capital tend to cause q to rise. We assume the effect is

typically positive.

   Although a change in the stock of bonds has an uncertain effect on
the real   exchange rate that clears the assets markets (4-       is of
uncertain sign), an open market purchase (increasing M while reducing

B) increases e/p. In other      words, expansionary rionetary policy causes
the exchange rate to depreciate. A swap of domestic        for foreign

currency   denominated bonds, increasing B while reducing F, reduces q
and increases e/p. This open market operation corresponds to
sterilized intervention in the foreign exchange market.
       Under the assumption that bonds and capital are perfect portfolio
substitutes, an open market swap of bonds for capital can have real
effects only if the return on capital differs depending on whether it
is held by    the goverrnent or the   private   sector. For instance, if the

government    buys capital and takes it out of production, the marginal

product    of capital rises. As a result, q rises but the effects on the

real exchange rate are uncertain.

       Goods Market Equilibrium: Equilibrium obtains in the goods market

when the output of     domestic goods, y from     (6), .s equal   to   the demand

for those goods, yfrom (7).        In Figure 5 we show aggregate supply arid
demand curves in (p,y) space.25
       The carves shown in Figure 5 have the conventional slopes.
Ibwever, in the case of aggregate supply, there are countervailing
                                                                            *

ambiguity   arises because an increase in     output   increases the
transactions   demand for money, thereby causing a currency appreciation

through the assets markets, and a reduction in production costs. We

assume this effect is not large enough to cause the AS curve to be

negatively sloped.

     On the aggregate demand side, all the channels through which an

increase in the price level affect aggregate demand operate in the same

direction: an increase in the price level reduces aggregate demand. We

assun that an increase in output creates an excess supply of goods,

despite some ambiguities arising from asset market effects of an

increase in output.26

     The intersection of the aggregate demand         and supply curves
determines the price level and domestic output. Given expectations,

the foreign interest rate, and the stock variables, the joint

equilibrium   of   the   assets and goods markets   determines the price level

(p) and output (y), the exchange rate (e), the relative price of
installed capital (a), and the rca'. interest rate (rB).
     The exchange rate is accordingly determined by the interaction of
the goods and assets markets, without direct reference to the external
sector. But of course expectations of future exchange rates and the
levels of stocks of foreign assets affect the current exchange rate,          so

that there is no useful sense in       ich it can be said that the exchange
rate is determined uniquely in the assets markets, or that        it is not
influenced by the current account.

aipara.tive Statics.

     We now examine the effects of changes in asset stocks, fiscal

variables, and     expectations   on the equilibrium price and output levels.
                                          22



We start by considering the impact         effects of   an increase in the money

stock, holding expectations constant.

      An   Increase in the Money Stock: An increase in the money stock
increases both q and e/p in the assets markets. The goods market
effects are      shown in Figure 5. The depreciated real exchange rate and

the rise    in   q both increase aggregate demand, shifting the AD curve to

AD'. The higher exchange rate shifts the AS curve to AS'. The price

level and level of output both increase.27

      One source of the short run non—neutrality of money is the fact

that the    nominal wage   is pre—determined. But there is a second source

of   non—neutrality,    which has so    far been concealed   by concentrating on

the  goods and assets markets. The government budget constraint implies
that a money stock increase has to be accompanied by some other policy
change.28 For instance, the change could be an increase in government
spending, or cut in taxes. In this case, output and            prices would rise

by   more than would    result   purely from the increase in the money stock.
       An Open Market Purchase: An open mat ket purchase of bDnd3 has the
saii qualitative effects as are shown in Figure 5. Both q and             e/p   rise
in the assets markets, shifting the aggregate demand and supply curves
as shown. Both output and         the   price level rise.
       In discussing such an operation, we assume that expectations of
inflation, of the rate of change of the exchange rate, and of the rate
of change of q, do not change. But given the change            in   the composition
of the government debt, expectations will adjust. These effects are
discussed below.

securities more     attractive relative to domestic, and tends to reduce q

and increase e/p in the assets markets. Investment demand falls while

the demand for Israeli exports rises. The net effect on aggregate

diand     is   therefore uncertain. If the export effect dominates, both

the   price    level and output rise.

      The Effects of an Incrase in the Wage Rate:            An increase in the
wage rate      shifts the   aggregate supply curve up   and to the right,
raising the price level and reducing output. The relative price of

installed capital, q, probably falls, while the effects on the real

exchange rate are uncertain.

      Currency    Liberalization: The modelling of the currency
liberalization in the current model requires sane care. Foreign
currency denominated        securities were traded before the liberalization,

but   there was   no   free access to foreign capital markets. Fo.reii
exchange purchased through this market was typically at a premium over
the official rate. Modelling the operation of such a syste would
reçre the thtrodaction of a new variable, representing the premium
for foreign—currency linked securities over the official exchange
rate 29
      We do not explicitly model the pre—existing structure of the

capital markets. Rather,         we view the currency liberalization as an
increase in the yield available in the capital markets on foreign—
currency denominated        securities.   The effects   of   such   a change are
already implied     by (17) and (18): in the capital markets there is an

increase   in the real exchange rate (a depreciation) and a fall in q.
The effects on aggregate demand are thus uncertain, since the fall in q
reduces demand while the depreciation increases it. The depreciation
                                           24



in   addition shifts up     the   aggregate supply curve.

       The   above discussion assumes that asset     stocks   and expectations

remain unchanged. In the model with which we are vrking, it is
entirely possible in the short run and ignoring expectations, for both
the exchange rate and q to be kept at desired levels through open
market operations. It ould have been possible through open market
swaps of foreign exchange denominated assets for money and bonds for
the government to maintain both q and c/p at their pre—liberalization
levels. Had this been done, there would later have been budgetary
implications resulting from the substitution of         interest—bearing assets

for money in the portfolios of the public that would have increased the
inflation rate. Moving over to the goods markets, the only effects of
the liberalization in the current period would          have been a result of
changed      expectations   about future   budget deficits or values of q.

       The    liberalization thus need not have created any major short—run
disturbances to the economy except——and this is a major exception-—
through expectaions. But the liberalizatio..i a carried out dd affect
the goods markets directly. The liberalization was accompanied by the
removal of tariffs and export subsidies and by a 50% devaluation that
was intended to maintain the effective exchange rate fixed. Assuming
the effective exchange rate unchanged, the supply curve would not have
shifted as a result of the devaluation. But because there were pre-
existing foreign currency denominated assets, the 50% devaluation had a
large wealth effect, shifting up the aggregate demand curve and causing
the   price level to    rise. There was thus an iirnediate expansionary
effect    from the liberalization—cum--devaluatiofl.

       In addition, and not less important, the liberalization by causing
                                        25




ashift frito foreign currency denominated securities from domestic
money reduced the domestic currency denominated money base and thus
required higher rates of inflation to produce the same amount of
revenue from seigniorage.
      The External Sector: The trade account is completely determined
within each period by the level of output and the real exchange rate.
The service account is predetermined. An open market purchase that
causes a depreciation and expansion of output has ambiguous effects on
the trade account: the real depreciation tends to increase net exports
while the rise in domestic income tends to decrease net exports.

      A fiscal expansion (not studied above) unambiguously increases the
current account deficit.
      Long Run Constraints: Suppose the economy is in a steady state,
with given ratios of real balances to bonds and government issued
foreign currency liabilities. These ratios can be assumed to be
detennined   by monetary policy:

b =
      1                                                                 (20)

Lower   case letters without   time subscripts are   steady   state real values

of the equivalent upper case symbols.

      Substituting into equations (9) and    (10),   we obtain the steady

state government budget and balance of payments constraints:

              + b(141t)(n_rB) +   (fd_rS)[(if)(flITf)1   +    fa         (22)

where is per capita real government revenue from taxes net of
transfers
The   balance of payments constraint is:
fa+nx=g+(f±rs)(1t1)(n—rr)                                                      (23)

       The crucial point      about   these constraints-—arid a well—kriowa one——

is that the amount      of    seigniorage and the possibility of issuing other

assets to finance a budget        deficit   (in (22)) depends significantly on

the   growth rate of the economy. In a rapidly growing economy, the
government can finance a budget deficit through the printing of money
without creating inflation. When the growth rate is lower, it takes a
higher inflation rate, if indeed the budget deficit can be financed at
all   31


       Similarly, the relationship between the growth rate of output and
the   real interest rate is an important detetinant of whether a deficit

in either the government's account or the foreign trade sector can be

financed through borrowing against bonds or foreign exchange. If

growth      is rapid——as it   was in Israel up to 1972——there is no difficulty

in   having large budget deficits financed by households        wanting   to
acquire assets that will maintain the asset to income ratio constant.

But when growth is slow and        the   interest rate above the growth rate,

borrowing generates ever increasing burdens on the budget over time.

                                Inflationary Issues.

       In   this section we briefly analyze issues of general interest that

arise from the Israeli inflationary experience.

period   during     which seigniorage revenue was      at a n.ximum was   1970-1974,

when the     econany was groririg fast (at least into 1973), and when the

inflation rate was, by later standards, low. The ratio of high powered

money to income was during        that   period at about 12%, roughly the ratio

that was maintained from 1955 until the implementation of the

liberalization in 1977. Table 10 shows a sharp reduction in the ratio

 of monetary base to income-—which is the base of the inflation tax——

starting in 1979. This shift followed the liberalization with a lag.

The lag is probably a reflection of the fact that it took time until

foreign currency deposits began to be            used as means of parnent,    thereby

producing     the shift out of domestic        currency.

        Is   it possible that the current amount of seigniorage—about 2% of
GNP—could be obtained at a lower inflation rate? In other words, is
the economy on the slippery side of the laffer curve? That obviously
depends on the inflation elasticity of the demand for the monetary
base. If the ratio of base to incat              returned   to 10%, then an
in'1..tion of about :'.7% (plus 3% for growth) would generate revenue
equal    to 2% of GNP.

        There are two ways of producing such a shift. First, it could

happen if the inflation rate were reduced in the current post-

liberalization       institutional setting. That would         require a very large

elasticity     of   the monetary base with      respect    to inflation-—an

elasticity that is        not at all visible in the data in Table 10 for the
pre-reform      years.

        Second, such a shift could be       induced by undoing the currency
liberalization.          The demand function for high powered money       could   be

shifted by policy measures, such          as   that recently implemented that
                                      28



imposes a tax on the purchase of     foreign   currency. Even so, because
financial sophistication has increased rapidly since 1977, it is
doubtful that the system would return to a base to income ratio of 10%,

nearly double the current U.S. ratio.
      Thus a reduction in the inflation rate would have     to be

accompanied by a reduced reliance on seigniorage by the government.

      Is the Inflation Tax Negative? It is often asserted that the

inflation tax   in   Israel is negative. Table 11 shows the calculation:

the tax on the holdings of monetary base is more than offset for the

private sector by the fall in the value of its nominal liabilities to

the government. The point made by the table is that a marginal 1% of

inflation increases private sector wealth. The effect was at a maximum

in 1979 and is gradually becoming less important as the government

stops providing non—indexed loans to the private sector.

      Table 11 shows that the real balance effect would be negative in

Israel. That is, if economic agents regard their liabilities to the

government as liabilities, then their wealth wou increase wh€n the

price level increases. It does not necessarily follow that an increase

in the money stock would produce negative revenue for the government.32

An increase of one shekel in the money stock would in the first

instance provide one shekel's worth of resources to the government.

The subsequent negative effects, suimnarized in Table 11, would have to

be deducted from the initial positive effect. But it does appear from

the   table that   the effect through subsidized credit is so large—or was

so large until     recently——that an increase in the money stock would have
reduced the present discounted value of government revenue.

      This   of course   brings to the fore the basic question about the
                                         29



Israeli.   inflation: why   does   the government persist in policies that

produce such high rates of inflation? With nothing obviously gained by

continuing inflation, why not stop it? We return to this question

below.

The Balance of Payments and the Foreign Debt.

     The   balance of   payments has   been the   major preoccupation   of
Israeli policymakers for the past three decades. Figure 6 and Table 12
show net exports for the period since                  The foreign deficit has
been in the range of 20% of GNP for most of the period, with a sharp
increase taking place following the Ycn Kippur War and associated oil
shock.
     As noted by i.rni(1979), there are two        standard   argurients for the
case that the large import surplus is undesirable. The first is that
the accompanying accumulation of foreign debt places an undue burden on
future generations. The second is that the magnitude of the deficit
and the need to rely on external financing, some of it in the fona of
grants, makes or excessive vulnerability to outside pressure, economic
and political.
    Table 13 presents data on the extent of the external debt. The
gross debt passed the $20 billion mark in the third quarter of 1982.
The net debt at the end of 1982 was equal to 63% of GNP or 1.4 times
the value of exports. With a real interest rate of 5%, the annual
interest cost of the debt would be above 3.0% of GNP. This would be           a

manageableamount in steady state. But the ratio of the net foreign
debt to GNP is growing because of the size of current account deficits
financed through borrowing. By the end of 1982 net debt service
amounted   to   nearly 25% of exports and more than 10% of GNP.

       Is    the accumulation of the debt desirable, or at least bet Ler than

the alternatives?3 Note        ficst   part of the import surplus of the
                                        that

last   eight years has been associated with defense imports. Figure 6
includes data on defense imports, which show that most of the
significant increase in the import surplus in the mid—7OTs was defense
related (the rest was oil). Borrowing would be optimal if the current
defense burden were transitory. But if the current rate of defense
spending were to continue, it would become necessary to curtail
borrowing

       The   concern over vulnerability to foreign pressure resulting from
the import surplus and the magnitude of the foreign debt is a real one.
It   is also a very old concern. (See Halevi and Kiinov—Malul (1968)).

Such pressures have been      brought   to bear   in the past, though the abrupt
cut—off of aid that has been the primary fear of policymakers has not
happened. If it were to happen, the access of the Israeli government
and private sector to international capital markets would be curtailed;
there would be major disruption o the economy anc a reduction in the
standard of living.
       At least for this reason, successive Israeli governments have
sought to bring about a reduction of the import surplus.36 The level
of exports has risen rapidly relative to GNP, as Figure 6 and Thble 12
show. The economy succeeded in moving resources into the export sctor
through a variety of incentives, including subsidized export credits,
and recently, exchange rate insurance. Although the level of Imports
has risen along with exports, and the basic 20% of GNP import surplus
renains, the private sector import surplus has been reduced—defense
imports have risen as a share of GNP.

       The Israeli government has three times undertaken major
restrictive policies to reduce the balance of payments deficit. The
first period was 1965—67, which shows in Figure 6 as having the lowest
import surplus      of the entire period. After the 1973            war, there   was

again   a period    in   which taxes were raised and       the balance of payments
deficit    was   reduced.    The latter episode took      place    against a

background of high        inflation. So did        the attempted 1979—80 program to

reduce the payments deficit through restrictive fiscal and               credit
policy.     In each case there was       a   reduction in the payments deficit, at

the cost of higher unemployment. The conclusion, especially after the

painful 1965—67 episode, was that it              was preferable   to attempt to

improve the balance of payments gradually, excep in extreme

circimstances like those after 1973 when the import                surplus   moved   close
to 40% of GNP.

       It has    generally been believed that to achieve its eventual aim of
a substantially reduced        current   account deficit, the government will

have   to produce a cant Lnuing slow real devaluatiofl. ihether a real
devaluation is needed, though, depends on relative productivity trends
in Israel and abroad. It appears from Table 12 that the government has
had some success in achieving a real devaluation over the years,
although   the data      should be treated     with   extreme   caution; in any event,

the   success of the policy can also be gauged by its effects on the'
volume of exports and the import surplus. Taking defense imports into
account, this aspect of policy has been successful.
       The 1982—83 policy      that attempts to stabilize the inflation rate

by causing a real appreciation has, however, sharply increased the

balance of payments       deficit and foreign borrowing. This policy is
                                             32



undoing the reduction in the external deficit that was            painfully
achieved during the past decade. With an external deficit in excess of

$4 billion per year, projected by some estimates to rise farther in
1983, the prospects for a rising and ultiately unsustainable
                                                              external
debt burden become high. For this reason •the current policy will be
reversed.

      The   economy described in the first part; of this paper is very
different from the Israeli economy in, say, 1960. In that year
government expenditure was less than 30% of GNP, the government budget
deficit (IFS definition), was 4% of GNP the CPI was 2% higher than in
the previous year; only the import surplus, at 18% of GNP, was at a
modern level. It was the import surplus that was the radn cause of the
restrictive fiscal and monetary policies that produced the 1966—67
recession, which as we have seen in Figure 6 did improve the current
account. The question is, what happened after 160?
    Table 14 'esents sum.r data for the behavior of the major
macroeconomic variables over subperiods since 1958, and Figure 7 shows
some of the same variables graphically. The period up to 1967 looks
tranquil    fran today's perspective. Growth was          rapid, inflation low,
                                                                After the 1967 war
and   government spending and the budget deficit low.

there   was   an         apparently permanent jump in the level of government

spending, due largely but not entirely to higher defense spending. For

the next four years the economy             grew rapidly, absorbing labor from the
adntinistered territories and irrmigration. (Bruno, 1983). The increase
in the labor force permitted rapid growth without pressure on the real
wage. By 1973 the pressure of demand began to affect the inflation

rate,   which reached 20% even before the Yom Kippur War.

        Then in 1973 the oil and war shocks struck. Defense spending
jumped by nearly 10% of GNP once again. The supply shock both reduced

the   growth rate of    output and caused a rapid rise in the inflation rate

in   1974. In   that year the government made a deal with the Histadrut to

forgo    one round of   indexation of wages, which made        it possible to
reduce the real wage and appeared to start the inflation rate back down
towards the 20% level frau which it had ccw in 1972. Taxes were
raised and    credit    restricted to reduce the     balance   of payments deficit
and   inflation. Fran 1973 to 1977, GNP          grew slowly. Productivity

growth was negative in each of        the years 1975-1977. The balance of
jayments deficit did      fall.

        The high   levels of   goverrunent (especially defense) spending and

money growth continued. The inflation rate caine down frcn its 1974

level, but appeared to stabilize at about 30% just as it currently

appears to be stable at a higher rate. The government was taking about
3%   of GNP in seigniorage, less than it had taken in the three years
before 1973. But as shown above, with the low real growth rate, a
higher inflation rate was         necessary    to produce the saine amount of
seigniorage. Recall at this point that the real interest rate was kept
fixed,   so   that any amount of the deficit that could not be covered
through   bond sales at the existing interest rate autcxnatically fed into

either   an increase in the stock of high powered money, or the foreign

deficit. Indexation made the inflation tolerable, and there was no

willingness to pay the price in terms of            unemployment to reduce the
inflation rate significantly.
        Then came the liberalization of 1977. As noted above, the
                                           34



liberalization was       accompanied by    a devaluation that produced a wealth
                                                         the price level and thus in
effect   in the goods market, thereby raising

the short run the inflation rate. With a lag, the liberalization also

produced a shift in the demand for shekel denominated currency. The

initial   reaction was     to move largely from index bonds to foreign

           linked deposits,       thus not yet shifting the demand for local
currency

currency denominated money. It was              only   gradually that it was
understood   that the foreign currency balances could be used to make
transactions,   and the demand for shekel denominated assets therefore
shifted. Accordingly we see in Figure 7 that it is only in 1979 that
there    is a large increase in the inflation rate,            accompanied by a fall

in the growth rate of the money stock. Subsequently there is again                   a

                                                      rate and the
reasonably close correspondence between the inflation

growth of Ml.
     Because the jump in the inflation rate came at a time when                the


growth rate of Ml was       not   high,   there has been     a tendency in Israel to
describe the inflation as being caused by a "bubble", meaning that it
is due to unemplained sources rather than monetary pressures. But
given the shift in the demand for shekel denominated assets, the
inflation rate would at some         point   have had to exceed the growth rate

of money.
        But why   then   has the inflation rate not come down         subsequently?

 There   has not been a reduction in the growth rate            of   the nominal

 aggregates since the inflation rate broke through the triple digit
 range by the end of 1979. At one level this failure to reduce the
 growth rate of nxiinal money may be attributed to the need for revenue
 from seigniorage. But because during this period government revenue
                                        35



from   inflation was probably negative in the sense defined    at   the

beginning of this section (see Table 10), the inflation has      also     to be

blamed on a set of operating procedures (a constant real interest rate,
reasonably constant real wages, exchange rate targets) that made the

rate of growth of money endogeneous. From this viewpoint, the
continued rapid inflation can be blamed rather on the government's
failure   to reduce its budget deficit. The      large government deficit
ensures   that   after all other sources of   financing of the deficit have

been   tapped (foreign and domestic borrowing), the residual is financed
by the printing of money.
       Along with the   higher inflation since   1973, the Israeli economy
has   also experienced much slor growth than before. Part of the
decline in the growth rate is a result of slower accumulation of
factors of production (Bruno, 1983) and part a result of a fall in
productivity growth. The heavy pressure of defense and government
spending has resulted in a reduction in investment spending, and the
labor force hui be growing slowly. But productivity growth has
fallen more rapidly in Israel than in other countries. The reason for
this is not clear, though doubtless some blame attaches to the high
inflation    that   has moved resources into the financial sector.37
       Stabilization Policy: The model presented above indicated that
there is nothing particularly mysterious about the operation of either
monetary or fiscal policy in a heavily indexed economy like the Israeli
one, with its unusual menu of assets. Restrictive monetary or fiscal
policy    will reduce the price level or inflation rate. But     they will
also   reduce    the level of output.
       The indexation formulae for wages do not provide instant price
                                       36



flexibility.    There is a lag in the adjustment of     wages,    which means

that the real wage would be high during the course       of    a disinflation.
The one way    out   of this dilerrnia is an agreement with the His tadrut on a
wage and macro—pol icy package. Such an agreement was successfully
reached with the government in 1974, when it was necessary to have a
real   devaluation and labor was    persuaded to   forgo indexation
temporarily. In the absence of such an agreement, it will take the
pressure of unemployment to drive down the rate of wage increase and
thus    the rate of price increase. Israeli governments have not since

the    sixties shown evidence that they are    willing to have prolonged

unemployment. The       choice is thus between a package, and attempts to
disinflate gradually. In either case, the government           would have to

reduce its domestic deficit, to be sure that it would          not end   up again
relying on money printing to finance the deficit.
     The government has experimented with the alternative of trying to
reduce the inflation rate by keeping the prices of coTnodities or the
exchaige    rate stable.    Such policies have   not worked.    Fixing o    the

exchange rate for a period during which domestic inflation is

continuing only ensures      that a big   correction has to take place later.

Similarly, the attempt to use subsidies to stabilize scme nominal

prices leads to large increases in the budget deficit, and eventually

to the lifting of the subsidies and more inflationary pressure.

        There is one final question. The inflation rate is not a major

issue in Israel. It is talked about, but there is no grounds1l of

public    insistence that the rate be reduced. Indexation of pensions,

long term savings, and wages, cover most of the difficulties that            would

face an unsophisticated economic agent living in an economy with a high
                                        37



and variable rate of inflation. The question is: why disinf late?

Israeli policyinakers frequently assert that unemployment that would be

needed    to   disinf late successfully cannot be justified in Israel. The

1965—67   recession during %thich unemployment reached double digits and
there as net emigration has burned as deep a concern about
unemployment in the memory of policymakers and the public as the Great
Depression did in the United States.
      The arguments for undergoing the .in of disinflation have not
been established. It has frequently been asserted that the low growth
of   the seventies in Israel is a result of the high and variable

inflation, which draws resources into non—productive activities like

banking, and which distorts the price mechani. But the productivity

slowdown       is a worldwide phenanenon, which has take.a place in low
inflation as 1l as high inflation countries. A convincing
demonstration that it is indeed the inflation that is responsible for
low growth would make the case for disinflation.

    Unless   otherwise noted, data are from International_Financial
Statistics or the IFS tape.
2Kravis, lleston and Surrners (1978) present estimates of Israeli per
capita GDP adjusted for purchasing power differences that are around
60% of the United States level for the years 1970, 1973, and 1974.
The exchange rate mediated comparison for those three years ranged
from 40% to 60%.
    A similar table is presented in Shiffer (1982); his data differ
slightly      from those in Table 1, apparently as a result of data

revisions.

Berglas (1983).

5For accounts of Israeli indexation see Brenner and Patinkin (1977)

and Kleiman (1977).

6   In   1982 the   banks were encouraged to offer high nominal interest rate
time deposit accounts to increase the dnand for nominal assets. At
the name time, the tax treatment of nominal interest was adjusted to
ensure only real interest s taxed. Accordingly the share of non-4ft
nominal assets rose from 1.3% to 2% of financial assets. In April
 1.983 a 1% tax      was imposed on the turnover of foreign currency linked
assets, also with the aim of increasing the dnand for shekel
denominated assets.
7Total       net wealth of   the non—financial private sector for the end of
 1981 was estimated by the Bank of        Israel to be a little above 4 times

GNP      (Bank of Israel Annual Report, 1981, Hebrew edition, p.257): the
housing stock and value of plant and equipnent account for most of the
 excess of net wealth over financial wealth as recorded in Table 5.

8The less than 100% compensation for inflation was introduced on the
grounds that nominal wages should not be adjusted in response to
external shocks.        The lack   of full indexation has   led to   continuing
attempts by labor to restore real wages in mid—contract, and thus to
increased     labor   strife. Some    Israeli economists now argue that wage

indexation should be complete, frequent, and put in place as soon as

possible following each change in prices——on the grounds both that

this    would ininiinize labor trouble and     that it would   help the
disinflation process.
 I am indebted to Zvi Auerbach for his assistance in compiling Table 6

and to Zalman Shiffer for advice on Table 7.

10The Bank of Israel data differ in several respects from those of the

IMF, which are based on Treasury calculations. The two sets of data

are difficult to reconcile, in part because Bank data are typically

for calendar years and Treasury data for fiscal years. The underlying

sources of    the difficulties appear to be      the use by the Bank of a cash

basis   for expenditures and receipts as compared       ¶ith   a less clear set
of Treasury    conventions    on the timing of   expenditures and receipts;

and a wider definition of the government sector by the Bank.

11The estimate for 1982 is 5.1% of GNP; the peak, in 1979, was 11.3%

of GNP.

12The wide    definition    of the base is used in Table    7b.   Continuingthe

discussion    fran footnote 10, it is believed that the errors and
anissions recorded in line 2 of Table 7b, which is based on monetary
data as opposed       to the budgetary data that underlie Table 5, result

from:   the difference between accrual (Table 6) and cash (Table 7b)
accounting;    from the     treatment of interest; and perhaps from the
                                          40


treatment    of government support of housing investment. The difference

is unusually large in 1981.
13 During 1981 the change in       the money base amounted       to 2.4% of GNP

(calculated fran Bank of Israel Report, 1981         (Hebrew) p.251). However,

since Bank of Israel profits are included in government revenue, this
item is not shown separately in Table 7b.
14 It has   been   engaged   in such   an exercise since tober 1982, with the
result that the real exchange rate has appreciated over 30%, with no
visible effect on the inflation rate. A large devaluation is expected
as   of the time of writing (July 1983).

15 For a description and evaluation of the reform, see Sussan

(1979).
16See   Fischer    (1981) for a discussion of    monetary policy in
Israel.
17 In 1973   the   ratio of monetary base to Ml    was 93%; at the end of 1981

the ratio was 78%.      The ratio of reserve money to GNP (expressed at an

annual rate) yns 3 2% n the fourth quarter          of   1981.    The eQlivalent
ratio for    the United States was 5.5% in 1982.

18A bond with return that is 80% index linked can, at high rates of

inflation, be viewed as a fully linked bond paying real interest at a

rate equal to 80% of the stated real rate.

19Given that the Israeli tax system is more inflation proof than the

U.S. systn this assumption is more appropriate for Israel than it

would be for the U.S. There were nonetheless until 1981—2 rJor

inflation—related distortions in the Israeli tax system.

20The asset menu and equilibrium conditions in this rn1e1 are similar

to those in the valuable paper by Fraenkel (1979).

21An alternative formulation would           have the   real returns   on each
asset,      measured   in CPI units,    in the demand functions. The present

formulation is a specialized           version   of that form.

22   It   has been suggested that because government        intervention in the

investment process is so pervasive, it might be preferable to treat
investhtent as exogenous.
23This argument is based on an adjustment (of capital) cost function of
the       form K.C(I/K) where I is     the rate of investment.
     This can be seen    more clearly by adding the       BB curve to the figure.

25These curves embody the assumption of asset market clearing, since

the functions q( ) and h( ),           (13) and (14), are used to substitute for
q and e/p wherever they appear in (6) and (7).
26   These ambiguities arise only because          an increase in output is
assumed to increase q, thereby increasing demand both through a wealth
effect      and by raising investment. Ibwever, as noted in the discussion
of Figure 4, this effect is assumed to be snall.
27 The graphical analysis raisen the possibility that the su'pl:T side

exchange rate effect could lead to a fall in output when the money
stock rises. This possibility can be ruled out by noting that if the
price level were to rise in the same proportion as the money stock,
with output at its original level, the assets markets would be in
equilibrium, the demand       for goods would be at its original level, but
supply would exceed demand.
28   In a more detailed model, an l money stock increase could result
from a change in reserve requirements that would not necessarily
affect the government budget.
                                           42


29Such a variable would perform for foreign currency linked                securities
a role almost identical to that of q for capital: the value of the
stock of such assets (the left hand side of the market clearing
equation) would       reflect the prnium; the interest component of the

return would     be reduced     because   of the higher cost     of   the asset; and


expectations     of   changes   in ;the premiuii would affect the       expected

return on the asset.
30 The presence of the (l4) and (1 terms with b and (fd_rs)
respectively is a result of the assumption that the initial stock
                                                                  of
bonds in period t is sold at the end of period t—1.

  Edi Karmi     points out that     much of external borrowing during the
seventies was at negative real rates.
  Defense imports overstate the defense burden on the balance of
payments, since it is doubtful Israel would be exporting arms if it
were not for the defense burden of the past.
36Michaely (1974) describes the methods used to affect the balance of
trade    and   payments. He also calculates effective real exchange rates,
which    show little change over the period 1955—71.

  This point has been       emphasized by       Jacob Frenkel.
