                    The Profitability of Currency Speculation




                                       ABSTRACT



     This paper presents the results of a post—sample simulation of a

speculative strategy using a portfolio of foreign currency forward contracts.

The main new     features of the speculative strategy are (a)   the use of Kalman
filters   to   update the forecasting equation, (b) the allowance for transactions,

costs and margin requirements and (c) the endogenous determination of the

leveraging     of the portfolio. While the forecasting model tended to overesti-
mate profit and underestimate risk, the strategy was still profitable over a
three year period and it was possible to reject the hypothesis that the sum of
profits was zero. Furthermore, the currency portfolio was found to have an

extremely low market risk. Combinations of the speculative currency portfolio

with traditional portfolios of U.S. equities resulted in considerable

improvements in risk—adjusted returns on capital.

       In an earlier   study, Bilson (1981), a strategy for speculating ifl the

 foreign—exchange forward market was described. The strategy involved using

 econometric techniques to evaluate the forecasting efficiency of forward

 exchange rates, and financial techniques to estimate
                                                           mean—variance optimal
 portfolios of forward contracts. The econometric
                                                        analysis suggested that a
 composite forecast which included both the spot rate and the forward rate

 provided a statistically superior forecast of the future spot rate than did the

 forward rate by itself. In addition, it was not possible to reject the hypoth-

 esis that the weight given to the forward rate in a composite forecast should

 be zero, a result which implies that the
                                               spot exchange—rate evolves as a random
 walk. Since the difference between the forward rate and the spot rate at any

point in time is directly related to the difference in nominal interest rates,

the econometric analysis suggested a speculative strategy which involved

borrowing  in low—interest—rate currencies and lending in high—interest—rate
currencies. Since movements in foreign—exchange rates are correlated, the mean
variance   portfolio technique was employed to determine the optimal positions in

the set of nine currencies considered. The
                                                 results demonstrated that a specu-
lator who had employed the model would have realized an extremely high ratio of

profit to risk.

      These results have recently been confirmed by a number of other Studies.

 Hodrick and Srivastava (1983) consider an extended model in which the composite

 forecast includes the premiums or discounts on all of the currencies in the

 sample. Their estimates of the profitability of speculative trading in
                                                                            foreign
 currencies are slightly less favorable than those reported in the earlier

 paper, but they are nevertheless large and statistically significant. Fama

 (1983) and Korajcyzk (1983) also find that spot rates out—perform forward rates

 as forecasts of future spot rates. Furthermore, studies by Silson (1983),

Levich (1981), and Meese and Rogoff (1982) demonstrate that the spot rate fore-

casts are generally superior to forecasts generated by standard academic

exchange rate models and by commercial foreign exchange forecasting serices.

The consensus appears to be that exchange rates evolve as a random walk, and

that nominal interest rate differentials do not reflect market expectations of

changes in the exchange rate.

     The apparent profitability of currency speculation may be interpleted in a

number of ways. First, it could be the case that the results are specific to

the particular sample and   that   the apparent profits would fail to be realized

in post—sample speculations. Second, it could be the case that the actual risk

of the activity has been understated, either because of the failure of a low

probability outcome to occur in the sample, or because the measure of risk

employed (the standard deviation of the profit on the portfolio) is not an

accurate estimate of the! 'market' risk of the activity. Finally, it could be

the case that the market is 'inefficient.' Taken at face value, the results

suggest a world in which interest rates are basically determined by domestic

conditions, including the expected rate of inflation of domestic commodity

prices and domesticmonetary policies, and in which there is 'insufficient'

uncovered interest arbitrage (Mclcinnon (19791, chapter 7). If it is true that

  (1)            S(n,t + 1) = 8 S(n,t) + (1 — 8) F(n,t) +         u(n,t)

 Notation; S(n,t) = spot rate for currency 'n' at time 't'

                 F(n,t) =   forward    rate for currency 'ii'   at time    't'

                u(n,t) =    forecast    error for currency 'n' at time 't'


 If the forward—parity model is correct, the regression coefficient '8' should

 not he significantly different from zero. On the other hand, if the random

 walk model is correct, the estimate of '8' should not be significantly differ-

 ent from unity. The purpose of the econometric analysis is to determine an

 appropriate estimate of the weights in the composite forecast. In addition, an

 estimate of the covariance matrix of the forecast errors is also required.

        There are a number of issues that must be addressed in the estimation of

the regression coefficients. First, in order to control for heteroscedas—

ticity, we assume that the variance of the residuals is proportional to the

square of the spot exchange rate. Hence we adjust the equation by dividing

through by the spot exchange rate. Second, we take account of the correlation

in the forecast errors through the use of the seemingly unrelated regression

procedure developed by Zellner (1962]. Third, we take account of the colinear—

ity between the spot and forward rates by imposing the constraint that the

weights in the composite forecast sun to unity.

        Other   aspects of the estimation procedure have been dictated by        the nature
of   the   data. Since the variance of the residuals is large relative to the sam-

ple variation in the exogenous variables, it is extremely difficult to obtain

precise estimates of the weihts in the composite forecast. We increase the

signal to noise ratio by imposing the constraint that the weights in the com-

posite forecast are the same for all currencies. By combining low—interest—

rate    currencies like the Swiss       franc   with high—interest—rate currencies like
                                      —3—



exchange rates evolve as a random walk, then nominal interest rates on assets

denominated in different currencies should be approximately the same. In a

world in which speculators used the random walk model, it is more likely that

both exchange rates and interest rates would be more stable (Bilson [1982] ).

     Our purpose in this paper is to investigate the above—mentioned issues.

We consider the problem of sample specificity by examining the post—sample

performance of the earlier model over a three—year period, We address one of

the sources of excessive profitability by allowing for transactions costs in

both the estimation of the optimal portfolios and in the statistical evaluation

of the strategy. Finally, we examine both the absolute risk and the market

risk of the strategy by examining the correlation between the return on the

currency portfolio and the return on the s&P 500 index. Furthermore, we

introduce an extended mean—variance portfolio algorithm that allows for the

endogenous determination of the leverage on the portfolio.


                               I. &ONOI4ETRICS


     Our forecasting etluation may be considered as a synthesis of two popular

characterizations of asset price—movements, the first is the forward parity

model in which the best forecast of the spot price in any future period is the

forward rate for that maturity. The second is the random walk model in which

the best forecast of the spot price in any future period is the current spot

price. In this study, we shall be concerned with forecasting spot exchange

rates over a four week horizon. In order to do so, we create a composite fore-

cast from the spot rate and the one—month forward rate)




     The use of a one month forward rate with a four-week horizon was dictated
by our data source. Similar results have been obtained with other data. See,
for example, Korajczyk [1983]; Hansen and Srivastava (1983).

the Italian lira, we increase the sample variation in the right hand-side vari-

ables and lower the variance of the estimated coefficient. Finally, we take

account of the tact that extremely large values of the right hand—side variable

occur on occasion. In the         original    sample of 666 observations (9 currencies by

74 time periods), there were 55 instances, or approximately 8 percent of the

sample, in which the value of the regressor exceeded 10 percent per annum in

absolute value. In order to avoid having the results biased by these extreme

values, we allow for separate weights for values that exceed 10 percent in

absolute value.

        The data for the original study consisted of observations taken on the

Friday    of every fourth week on the spot rate and the one month forward rate.
The data covered nine currencies——Canadian dollar, British pound, Belgian
franc, French franc, Deutsche mark, Italian lira, Dutch guilder, Swiss franc,
and Japanese yen——over the period from July 1974 to January 1980. Further

details may be found in Bilson 119811. For present purposes, all that we

require are     the   final results.

In this equation, the    superscript '8' refers to the values of (S—F)/S that
are    less than 10 percent in absolute value while the superscript 'V refers to
values than     exceed 10 percent.

       These   results offer strong support to the random—walk model of exchange—

rate   movements. For small values of the forward premium or discount, the opti-
mal forecast     of the future spot rate assigns 74 percent of the weight in the
                                             —6—




 composite to the spot rate. The 26 percent weight assigned to the forward rate

 is not significantly different from zero at the 5 percent significance level.

 The results are even more extreme for the large values, where the weight on the

 forward rate is negative. For both large and small values,         the forward—parity
 model is decisively rejected: the weight given to the forward rate in the

 composite forecast is significantly less than unity in both cases.

         As was mentioned above, these results are not new. They were initially

 distributed as an NBER Working      Paper in   April 1980, and subsequently published

 in the Journal of Business in 1981. They consequently offer an opportunity for

 examining     the post—sample performance of the forecasting equation. For our
 post—sample     simulation, we update the estimates of the   equation in each period

 using   the Kalman   filter   technique.2 The estimated values of the two   coeff i—
cients      are given in Appendix A. these coefficients appear to be quite stable.

The end of sample estimates (.8892, 1.1707) are not greatly different from the

original estimates. We also update the covariance matrix of the forecast

errors. In each period, we compute a covariance matrix using the past 16 fore-

cast errors. This adjustment is important since changing monetary arrange-

ments, including the "snake," the "tunnel,' and the European Monetary System,

have a definite influence on the covariation between exchange rates. While the

16—period moving window is an extremely simple way of accounting for these

changes, it is certainly superior to the alternative of no adjustment at all.

       As   a consequence of the updating procedure, we have an estimate of the
bias in the forward rate in each period and an        estimate of the covariance

matrix   of the forecast errors. We stress again that all of the information


      21n  the Kalman filter program, we do not discount past observations.
Hence the results are identical   to a moving regression in which one observation
is   added each period.

 required   to form these estimates was available at the time, and that the
 techniques for constructing the estimates are standard. Using the information
 from the econometric analysis, we shall describe the techniques
                                                                 required           to

 estimate the optimal mean variance portfolio in the next section.           We shall

 subsequently examine the performance      of the portfolios over the three year
 post—sample   period.


                              U. THE SPECtJLArtv STRATEGY

      The econometric analysis yields forecasts of the spot exchange rate
                                                                          for
four weeks hence for each of the nine currencies and of the covariance
                                                                       matrix
of the forecast errors. In this section, we describe a technique which uses
this information as an input and creates a vector of positions (long or short)
in each currency. In our context, a position is a forward contract to buy or
sell the currency. The speculator offsets the forward contract at its maturity
by buying or selling an offsetting amount of currency in the spot market. Hence
the gross profit on the transaction is equal to the difference between the
forward rate at t, F(n, t), and the subsequent spot rate, S(n, t + 1),
multiplied by the quantity of foreign currency purchased or sold. For ease of
interpretation, we value all of the forward positions in U. S. dollars at the
current spot rate, S(n, t). Hence


(3)         Gross Profits =    [(S(n,   t + 1) —   F(n,t))/S(n,t)J   S(n,t)Q(n,t)


where Q(n,t) represents the amount of foreign currency purchased or sold in

the forward market. We simplify our notation by writing this definition as


(4)         Gross Profits =   r(n,t)q(n,t)
                                                —8—



 where r(n,t) =    (Sn,   t+1) —    F(n,t))/S(n,t)        and q(n,t) =   S(n,t)Q(n,t).   The

 quantity, q(n,t), represents the dollar value of the position and r(n,t)

 represents the profit per dollar of position. It is also the endogenous vari-

 able in the econometric forecasting equation.

        One important feature of the speculative model is that it takes account of

transactions costs in assessing the optimal positions. The transactions costs

are assumed to be 0.1 percent for the major currencies (CD, BP, DM, SF, fiG, J)

and 0.2 percent for the less—traded currencies (BF, FF, IL). Thus we assume

that it costs US$1000 to purchase one million dollars worth of British pounds,

and US$2000 to purchase one million dollars worth of Italian lira. Allowance

for transactions costs is of particular importance during periods in which two
or more currencies are highly correlated because of monetary arrangements.
Under these conditions, small differences in the premium or discount against
the    dollar would lead to extremely large spread positions if transactions costs

were    not accounted for.
       The speculator is assumed to choose a vector of positions in order to
maximize a utility function defined over expected profits, E(w)               ,   and the

variance of profits,      V(w) .     The   specific utility function is defined in
equation    (5).



(5)                          IJ[E(7r), V(ir)J = E(7T) —
                                                           (jx)v(1r)

The 'A' parameter represents the speculator's degree of risk aversion. The

'A' may be interpreted in the following way. If the speculator is offered the

opportunity to multiply the outcome of a drawing from a normal distribution

with a mean and standard deviation of unity by a certain number of dollars, and

if the speculator receives the product if positive or pays if the product is

negative, then 'A' represents the number of dollars by which that outcome
                                           —9—



 will be multiplied.3 In the following simulations, we assume a value for 'A1

 of $100. This assumption is inconsegential, since the positions and profits

 are all proportional to this parameter. The rate of return, and the ratio of

 profit to risk (standard deviation), are independent of the assumed degree of

 risk aversity.

        The expected net dollar profit on the portfolio is defined as


 (6)                           E(TT) =   qr —    gc
 where 'q' is an N x 1        vector whose typical value is the dollar value of

 the position taken in the nth currency. The typical element of the N X    1

 vector 'r' is the expected bias in the forward rate, expressed as a fraction

 of the current spot rate, r(n, t). The second term in equation (6), Jg'c,

represents the allowance for transactions costs. The costs are assumed to be

the product of the absolute value of the position and the transactions cost per

dollar purchased or sold, 'c'.

       The variance of profits is defined is equation (7)


(7)
                                   V(1r)qaq

2 represents the N X N covariance matrix of the forecast errors.

       Substituting the definitions of expected profit and the variance of profit

into the utility function allows for the level of utility to be expressed as a

function of the vector of control variables, q. It is, however, difficult to

maximize the function directly with respect to these variables because of the



       3Define k as a scale   parameter. Then U(,) = kEN) —(2iJk2V(ir). Maxi-
mizing the function with k as the choice variable yields k = AE(ir)
f V(w). For a N(1,1) distribution, kEN) = A. Hence A equals the expected
level of profits when the_distribution is N(1,1). More generally, kE(ir)
= s2A, where 5 =
                   E(w)/v'v(ir). We refer to 's' as the safety ratio.

                                                                        the transactions
  costs. We circumvent this problem by
                                             approximating the transactions costs with
  a quadratic form, as described in equation (8).

  C is a diagonal N X N
                        matrix. The typical diagonal element of                C is
 defined by


 (9)                            C(n, n) =    (2Ac)/Jq(n)

 Substituting (6), (7), and (8) into the objective function yields:

                        U(E(w), V(w)J
                                                    (j)q   ( + CJq

        This formulation demonstrates that the effect of the transactions costs is

 to add a positive diagonal terms to the covariance matrix. Since the transac-

 tions costs reduce the apparent correlation between
                                                              the returns, allos.iing for

 transactions costs will reduce spread positions and bias the estimated optimal

positions towards zero.

        Differentiating U(•) with respect to the vector q and setting the

resulting first order conditions equal to zero, yields the following solution

for the optimal portfolio.

(11)                              q = [2+C] —1 Ar

        The only difficulty with the estimation of the positions from this

equation is that the transactions cost matrix C depends upon the value of the

positions. We solve this problem iteratively. In the first iteration, the

elements of C are set equal to zero. We then use (11) to estimate q* and

we then use q* to estimate the elements of C.              This process continues until
the position estimates stabilize.

      In Table 1, we illustrate, the optimization procedures by providing a

 detailed description of a particular portfolio. This portfolio is not repre-

 sentative, since it has both the highest expected and highest actual
                                                                        profit,
 but it offers a clear demonstration of the speculative
                                                          strategy. The position
 was taken on May 22, 1981, and realized on June 191 1981. At that time, French

 and Italian interest rates were high relative to Swiss, German and Dutch inter-

 est rates. Hence the optimal portfolio basically consisted of long positions

 in French francs and Italian lira offset by an equally valued short position in

the Dutch guilder. It is noticeable that the program avoided a short position

in the Japanese yen despite the large (13.62 percent per annum) premium on this

currency, and that the net dollar position was small. Because of the higher

correlation between the seven European currencies than between the dollar, yen

and the Europeans, most of the positions taken by the program consist of

spreads between the European currencies. This fact will become 'more important

when the market risk of the speculative strategyis evaluated.

     The illustrative portfolio can also be used to demonstrate the concept of

the return on the portfolio that we shall use. Since the forward market posi-

tions do not require the placement of capital, it is often said that' the return

on forward contracts is either plus or minus infinity. However, even when a

large corporation obtains a foreign—exchange guideline from a bank, the bank

will typically require some deposits with the bank in order tc ensure delivery.

In addition, the transactions costs may be considered as an initial investment.

We assume a margin requirement of 10 percent of the absolute value of the

position, and we define the capital investment as being equal to the margin

plus the transactions cost. In calculating the return on the investment, we

 assume that the speculator earns the Treasury Bill rate on the
                                                                margin. Hence
 the total profit is equal to the profit front the
                                                      speculative activity plus the
 interest on the margin minus the transactions costs.      Using this definition,

 our most successful portfolio earned a return of almost 10 percent over the

 four-week period.

      In Table   2,   summary statistics relating to the performance of the port—

 folio over the period from February 1980 to December 1982 are presented. The

table offers an excellent example of the endogenous determination of the lever-

aging of the portfolio. The 'safety ratio,' defined as the ratio of expected

profit to the expected standard deviation of profit, is the most important de-

terminant of the degree of leveraging. The scale of the position in the market

is proportional to the square of the safety ratio.4 When the safety ratio is

around unity, the expected gross profit is around $100; when the safety ratio

is increases to around 5, the expected gross profit increases to around $2500.

It is noticeable that a large part of the total actual profits were made in a

few periods when the safety ratio was high.

     The fact that the expected profits are proportional to the square of the

safety ratio implies an important difference between the econometric and the

financial analysis of speculative efficiency. In the econometric evaluation,

concern is taken to ensure that the residuals in the regression are serially

uncorrelated and hognoscedastic. However, a speculator using the econometric

results will weight the observations by the square of the safety ratio so that

the unanticipated profit series will be strongly heteroscedastic. It is

straightforward to demonstrate that the expected variance of profit is

 Since the validity of equation (12) is an important component of both the

 evaluation of the speculative strategy and the econometric tests used in the

 evaluation, we begin by examining this relationship in the post sample

 simulation.

        In order to test equation (12), we posit an extended model of the variance

 of profits which includes both the level and the square of expected profits.

 In the absence of other information, it appears reasonable to assume that the

variance of profit would be proportional to the square of expected profits

rather than the level. Hence this model constitutes a natural alternative to

the relationship predicted by the speculative strategy. The alternative is

tested against the maintained model by regressing the square of the error in

forecasting profit, minus the value predicted by the maintained model, on the

additional variables. The results of the estimation are presented below.

Although the individual parameters in equation (13) are not stastistically

significant, the F—statistic demonstrates that it is possible       to   reject the

hypothesis that all of the coefficients are zero. Furthermore, since all of

the parameters are positive, the variance predicted by the alternative model is

greater than the variance predicted by the maintained model.

         The underestimation of the variance of profits is quite significant. In

 order to illustrate the dimensions of the problem, we provide standard summary

 statistics for the standard deviations forecasted by the maintained and alter-

 native models.

On average, the alternative estimate is twice that predicted by the maintained

model. The extent of the downward bias appears to be greatest for the small

values.

        The underestimation of the risk of the speculative strategy has two major

consequences for the evaluation. First, if the speculator had known the true

risk of the strategy, the scale of the position would have been reduced. Using

the maintained estimates, expected gross profits summed to $8,446 over the

sample   period. If the positions were re—estimated with the alternative risk
estimates,   expected profits would have summed to $2308. Hence the major part

of the profit realized from the positions taken was due to the fact that the




     51n footnote 3, it was demonstrated that kE(Tr) = 82A. Since 32 = E(IT)2/V(lr),
the effect of the underestimation of the variance can be described by the
relationship    kEN) =   S

                             VA(W)   where    VE(71)   represents the maintained
estimate of the variance and VA(w) the alternative estimate. The average
value of VA(w)/vA(ir) is approximately .5, hence the underestimation of risk
caused the average scale of the position to be twice as large as the speculator
would have taken with full information.
                                              —17—



 speculator underestimated the true risk of the strategy. Second, the underest-

 imation of the risk implies that the maintained estimates should not be used in

 tests of the hypothesis that the actual profits realized are either signif j—

 cantly different from zero or from the expected value. In
                                                                       correcting for the
 heteroscedasticity in the profit series, we shall use the alternative estimates

 of the variances.

       The first test of this type relates to the ability of the model to fore-

 cast situations in which currency speculation is profitable. We exatne this

 issue by testing whether expected profits provide unbiased forecasts of actual

profits. Our results are based on the estimates of the following regression

equation.

A(Tr)t =     actual   profits in period t; ELTI1t = expected profits in period
t — 1.     standard errors are presented in brackets beneath the coefficients.

This equation was estimated using      weighted        least squares. The weights were the

reciprocals of the alternative estimates of the standard deviations. We

observe first that the coefficient on expected profits is significantly greater

than zero at standard significance levels. The t—statistic for testing if the

slope coefficient is unity is 1.935. With 37 degrees of freedom, we are unable

to reject the hypothesis that the true slope coefficient is unity at the five

percent level, but we are able to reject at the ten percent level. Further-

more, the constant term in the regression is negative. These considerations

lead to the presumption that the model is tending to overestimate the profits

from the trading strategy. If we use an F—test to test the joint hypothesis

that the constant term is zero and     the    slope coefficient is unity, the value of
                                                   —18—




 the statistic turns out to be 3.74. The value is below the five percent criti-

 cal value of the F—distribution with 1 and 37 degrees of freedom. We are

 consequently unable to reject the hypothesis that the model is providing unbi-

 ased forecasts of actual profits. It is, however, true that the most likely

 direction of bias is towards overly optimistic estimates of expected profits.

          It was mentioned above that, had the speculator known of the overestima-

 tion of the variance, he or she would have reduced the total expected gross

profits from $8,446 to $2,308, by reducing the scale of the position. The

knowledge that the model tended to overestimate the expected profits would also

induce a contraction in the scale of the position. Combining both the adjust-
ment to the variance and the adjustment to expected profit, the total expected
gross     profit would have been reduced to $841.6 The same point can be made from

the point •of view of the certainty equivalence value of the strategy. With the

utility function that we have posited, the certainty equivalence value of the

strategy is equal to one—half of the expected profit.7 That is, given the

degree of risk aversion, the speculator would be willing to pay up to one-half

of the expected profit in order to partake in the speculative strategy. Given

the   maintained estimates of expected profit and the variance of profit, our
speculator would be willing to pay up to $4223 to own the strategy. With the
actual estimates, the maximwn payment would be reduced to $420, and the scale
of the position would have been reduced in proportion to the reduction in

           Again, kE(Tr) =      s (EM())     A where EA(1T) is the alternative estimate
of profit and EH(ir) is the maintained estimate. Since the alternative
estimate is always below the maintained estimate, the speculator would have
reduced the scale of the position. Combining the two corrections, we have

 expected   profits. In this sense, the post—sample performance of
                                                                               the strategy
 is disappointing.

        While the   profits   from the strategy were      less   than predicted, and while
 the risk was greater than predicted, it is still the case that the strategy was

 profitable on average. Losses were realized on only eight of the 39 portfol-

 ios1 and the largest loss, $476, was considerably smaller than the largest gain

 of $3049. We now examine the hypothesis that the sum of the actual profits is

 zero. In testing this hypothesis, the variance of the sum is              assumed to be the
 sun   of the variances predicted by the regression model presented in equation

 (13). Since these estimates are typically larger than the maintained esti-

mates, their use lessens the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis. We

test the hypothesis by computing the statistic


                                        T
(15)                              z=    E
                                                           t
                                       t=1 t/       t=i


Under the assumption that the true residuals are normally and independently

distributed, this statistic follows a t—distribution with 38 degrees of

freedom. The computed value of the test statistic is 3.298. This value

exceeds the one percent critical value of the t—distribution with 38 degrees of

freedom. We consequently reject the hypothesis that the true sum of profits is

zero. This test is probably the most important test for purposes of testing

the efficiency of the forward exchange market. In addition, we may wish to

test   if the sum of realized profits is significantly different from the           sum

predicted by the model. The test statistic for this hypothesis is —1.64. This
statistic lies within the critical values of the t-distribution at the ten per-
cent significance level. We are        consequently   unable to reject the hypothesis
                                         —20—




  that   the difference between actual and expected profits is due to sampling

  variation.

         It is interesting to compare this test with the test used in Bilson [1981)

 and ilodrick and Srivastava [1983).    In their tests, the individual values of

 actual and expected profits are divided by the predicted standard deviation in

 order to create a series of standardized actual
                                                    and expected profit. They then
 test if the mean of the distribution of actual
                                                   standardized profits is signif-
 icantly different from either zero or the
                                             average standardized expected profit.
 The average standardized actual profit is .2732, and the standard deviation of

 the average is .1622. The test statistic is computed to be 1.6841. Under the

 null hypothesis that the true average standardized profit is zero, this

 statisticfalls within the acceptance region of the t—distribution with 38
degrees of freedom. We are consequently unable to reject the null hypothesis.
We are also unable to reject the hypothesis that the true mean of the

distribution is equal to the average standardized expected profit.

     The difference between the two tests again relates to the timing element

in the speculative strategy. The speculator is not as concerned with the

average value of the standardized profit variable as with the ability of the

standardized expected profit to predict the standardized actual profit. By

scaling up the portfolio when the expected profit is high, the speculator

changes the distribution of the outcomes. In the case that we have considered,

most of the profits were made in two of the 38 periods. This is the reason why
                                         —21—



 the total profits are significantly different fran zero while the average

 standardized profits are not.8

      In this section we have considered the speculative strategy as an isolated

 activity. We found that while the strategy did not perform as well as it was

 expected to do, the actual profits were still significantly different from

 zero. The main defect with the evaluation of the strategy as an isolated ac-

 tivity is that the risk is measured by the variance of profits. When consid-

ered as a part of a wider portfolio, the risk should be measured in terms of

the contribution of the activity to the risk of the portfolio.


                IV. THE MARKET RISK OF THE SPECULATIVE STRATEGY


     In the previous section, the speculative strategy was evaluated as an Iso-

lated investment activity. In this section, we re—evaluate the strategy from

the perspective of an investor whose wealth is initially held in a diversified

equity portfolio. We represent the returnon this portfolio by the capital

appreciation of the S&P 500 index. while the index does not include dividends,

the return on this portfolio should be representative of the risk/return trade-

off front conventional U.S. equity portfolios. We shall also assume that the

expected capital appreciation of the S&P is equal to the Treasury risk—free

return Bill rate. Over the period from 1970 to 1981, Ibbotson and Sinquefield

(1982) report that the average capital appreciation of the s & p 500 index was

7.87 percent per annum. Over the same period, the average yield on U. S.




     8The statistic reported in equation (15) can be written as
                              Z =   1   E (t/at)kt
                                    N
where N represents the degrees of freedom. The test used by Bilson and
Hodrick and Srivastava sets kt equal to unity. The test described in
equation (15) sets kt equal to NUt/,iza. This weighting obviously gives a
larger influence to observation with larger positions.
                                              —22—




  Treasury   Bills was 7.43 percent. The main question that we will investigate is

  the following: given the opportunity to divide a fixed initial stock of

  capital between the S&P and the currency portfolio, what would be the Optimal

  allocation between the two instruments?
                                                 Furthermore, what is the effect on the
 risk and the return of the composite portfolio from the allocation of a
                                                                         part of
 the initial capital to currency speculation?

         Since we are dealing with the allocation of capital between two investment

 activities, we begin by restating the role of capital investment in the

 currency    portfolio. In order to implement the     speculative strategy, the
 investor    requires capital in order to cover margin requirements and transac-
 tions   costs. Although forward contracts do not typically require explicit

 margins,    a bank   may require that the investor maintain a security deposit in
 orderto ensure against default. We assume that the deposit amount to 10
percent of the absolute value of the position taken and that the interest
earned on the deposit is equal to the Treasury Bill rate. Both of these
assumptions    are conservative. The largest loss incurred in the simulation was

less than 2 percent of the absolute value of the position, and margins on

foreign    exchange futures are      around 5 percent of the value of the
                                  typically

position. Furthermore, the deposit would typically be held in the form of a
certificate of deposit. The yield on a certificate of deposit typically
exceeds   the yield on U.S. Treasury Bills. We define the investment as the

margin plus the transactions cost, and the revenue as the profit from the spec-

ulative activity, plus the interest on the margin, minus the transactions

costs.

     For an investor whose initial wealth is solely in equities, the derivative

of the variance of end—of—period wealth with respect to a marginal allocation

of wealth to the currency portfolio is determined by the 'beta' of the currency
                                            —23—




  portfolio. Following standard practice, we first estimate the 'beta' by

  regressing the returns from the currency portfolio on the return on the

  S&P 500. After presenting these results, we shall discuss some problems that

 arise with this approach in the present instance and present some alternative

 formulations.

         Estimation of the traditional market model led to the following results.


 (16)            RC — TSR = .0235 ÷ .0390 (RP -
                                                TSR] + u
                           (.0122) (.2350)
                                 = .0007   S.E. = .0765   D.W. = 1.944


 In equation (16), IC =    the   return on the currency portfolio, TSR = the

 Treasury Bill rate, K? = the return on the S&P 500, and u = the
                                                                 residual.
 Standard errors are presented in pirentheses beneath the coefficient esti-

 mates. In interpreting these results, the first important point is that the

 slope coefficient, which measures the market risk of the currency level of

market risk is small and not significantly different from zero. The low level

of market risk is also evidenced by the low value of the R2 statistic. In

fact, the adjusted K2 for the regression reported in equation (16) is nega-

tive. The low market risk of the currency portfolio is not surprising, since

the most common activity consists of spreads between the European currencies.

The second important point is the size and significance of the constant term.

In annual percentage terms, the constant term implies a return of 28.2 percent

per anntn above the Treasury Bill rate. the estimate is 1.9 standard devia-

tions from zero. While this value is not large enough to pass conventional

statistical tests, the probability that the true constant term is zero is less

than ten percent. The initial impression, then, is that the currency portfolio

offers   a substantial rate of return and an extremely low level of market risk.
                                              —24-



          There   are, however, a number of problems with the regression
                                                                            reported in
  equation (16). The first is that the residuals in the regression
                                                                            are likely to
 be heteroscedastic. We have already seen that the series of speculative

 profits are very heteroscedastic because of the leveraging of the portfolio.

 While some of this heteroscedasticity
                                              may be eliminated by dividing the profits
 by the investment, there is no necessary connection between the size of the

 investment and the variance of profits. For example, if two currencies are

 highly correlated, a spread position may imply a large margin, and hence a

 large investment, but little risk. In order to account for this problem, we

 reestimate the market model by weighted least squares. The weights are equal

 to the ratio of the investment to the standard deviation
                                                                  of profits, and the
 standard deviations are computed from the alternative model of the variance of

 profits introduced in the previous section. The revised estimates are

presented in equation (17).


 (17)                   RC — TBR    .03358 + .08428[Rp — TBR] +   u
                                   (.01175)   (.26294)

While the estimate of the market risk is still small and insignificant, the new

estimates result in an increase in the size and significance of the constant

term. The risk—adjusted return is now over 3 percent per month, or 40 percent

per annum, over the risk free rate, and it is possible to reject the hypothesis

that this coefficient is zero using standard significance tests.

        The second problem with the traditional market model analysis is that the

expected    rate of return is assumed to be constant throughout the sample
period.     The econometric analysis demonstrated that the risk and return on the

currency portfolio is not constant, and it would be useful to take this finding

into account in the assessment of the market risk of the activity. We do this

by introducing the difference between the expected rate of         return on the
                                           —25—



  currency portfolio and the risk free rate as an additional
                                                               right hand side
  variable.9 In this formulation, the risk adjusted return is allowed
                                                                      to vary
  throughout the sample period. As in the previous
                                                      estimation, weighted least
  squares is employed to account for the heteroscedasticity in
                                                                 the residuals.
 The results are reported in equation (18).


 (18)       RC — TSR = —.03273 + 1.1957[RE —
                                             TBRJ + .300197(J.p — TSR] + u
                       (.03285) (.5568)            (.27036)

 In this equation, RE =    the   expected return on the currency portfolio. This

 series is created using the same procedures as were used to compute the actual

 return. From this regression, we observe that the coefficient on the expected

 return is significantly different from zero, but not significantly different

 front unity. We consequently cannot reject the hypothesis that the model is

 providing unbiased forecasts of actual returns. When the expected returns are

 included in the regression, the estimate of the market risk of the activity is

 increased, but it is still small and not significantly different from zero.

        These results suggest that the currency portfolio would be a valuable

addition to a U.s. equity portfolio since the risk adjusted return is large and

statistically significant and since the incremental risk of the activity

appears to be small. We shall now explore this conjecture in
                                                                 greater detail by
simulating the performance of a combined equity/currency portfolio. This

simulation is subject to the following limitations.     First, we do not allow the

composition of the currency portfolio to be influenced by the fact that it will

be combined with equities. In other words, our investor is envisaged to face

the decision of dividing beginning of period wealth between an equities fund



     9Since we assume that the expected capital appreciation on the equity
portfolio is equal to the Treasury Bill rate, there is no need for an
additional term representing the difference between the expected equity return
and the risk free rate.

 and a currency fund. The fund managers do not take account of the activities
 of other funds in selecting their own positions. Second, the investor assumed
 that the   returns on the two funds are uncorrelated. This assumption can be

 relaxed, but it is roughly consistent with the evidence, and it avoids
                                                                          problems
associated with the use of ex post information. Although we shall use the

sample data to estimate the variance of equity returns, all other
                                                                    information,
including the expected return and the expected variance of the currency port-

folio, were available at the time that the investment decisions would have been

made. As was mentioned above, we approximate the expected capital appreciation

on the s&p portfolio by the Treasury Bill rate.

       We describe the investor's optimization process in the following terms.

At the beginning of each period, the investor divides his capital between the

two funds. At the end of the period, the returns are realized and the new

stock of capital is re—allocated. The information set available to the

investor includes the expected return and the variance of the return on the

mean/variance utility function specified in (19).


(19)                   U(E(R), V(R)1 = E(R) —   (1/(2A)Jv(R)

Since we are now dealing with the allocation of capital between two portfolios,

this utility function is specified to be a function of the expected rate of

return, E(R), and the expected variance, V(R), of the composite portfolio.

The risk aversion parameter, A, is set equal to .04 per month. This estimate
                                               —27-.




 is broadly consistent with the evidence on risk aversion by Friend and Blwrte

 [19751

        The expected return and expected variance are defined in equations (20)

 and (21).


 (20)                            E(R) = wE(R1) + (1 — w)E(R2)


 (21)                        V(R) = w2V(R1) + (1 — w)2V(R2)


 In these equations, Ri represents the return on the equity portfolio and

 P2 represents the return on the currency portfolio. The investor sets the

share of equities in the portfolio, w, at the value that maximized expected

utility. In equation (21), the covariance between the returns is assumed to be

zero. The optimal value of the portfolio share is defined in equation (22).


            w =
(22)              V(R2)/(v(R1)   +   V(R2)) + A(E(R1) — E(R2))/(v(R1) + V(R2))

The first term in this equation is the minimum variance allocation between the

two portfolios. The second term causes the actual share to deviate from the

minimum variance value as the expected returns on the two portfolios diverge..

        As in the previous simulation, we have attempted to restrict the infor-

mation set available to the investor to information that was available at the

time that the decision would have been made. In particular, the expected

returns and the variance of the return on the currency portfolio are the prior

values from the simulation analysis. We have already demonstrated that these



     10Friend and Blume use IRS data on asset holdings and conclude that the
behavior of investors can be described by the utility function U(W) =
where w represents wealth. Brown [1976] demonstrates that this function can
be approximated by a negative exponential utility function, U(R) = -exp(—R/A),
with A = .0416. Maximizing the utility function specified in equation (19) is
equivalent to maximizing a negative exponential utility function. See Jorian
[1983).

  values tend to be overly optimistic relative to the ex post outcomes, and that
  this excessive optimism will lead to an underestimate of the weight of equities
  in the portfolio. On the other hand, it turns out that the Treasury Bill rate
 Overestimated    the capital appreciation on the S&P      index    during this sample
 period, so that the net bias is uncertain. The
                                                      only ex post information that
 is used in the simulation is the estimate of the variance of the equity
 returns.
       The results from the simulation are     presented   in Table 3. Over     the sample
 period,    the investor allocated between 100 percent to 22 percent of capital to

 the currency portfolio. On an annualized basis, the combined portfolio

 achieved an actual rate of return of 31.37 percent per annum. In comparison,

 the S&P portfolio achieved an annualized return of 8.73 percent and the
 currency portfolio achieved an annualized return of 47.67 percent.
 Furthermore, the   standard deviation of the combined portfolio was not much
 greater   than the standard deviation of the S&P return.          Finally, we calculate
 the level of utility for the three portfolios.1'      All three turn out to be
negative. In fact, our      investor   would prefer a certain loss of some six

percent per month to an investment in the currency portfolio. For the combined

portfolio, the certainly equivalent value of the strategy was minus 1.6 percent

per month. These statistics need to be interpreted carefully. They are saying

that if the investor had a chance to participate in an investment offering an

expected return of 3.3 percent with a standard deviation of 7.6 percent, he or

she would decide not to participate because of the high risk. These statistics

represent   the average return and the standard deviation of the return on the

where A(1T) is the ex post average actual return, and V(ir) is the ex post
variance   of the return.

 actual outcomes from the currency portfolio. These results do not imply,

 however, that the investor would never allocate capital to the
                                                                     currency port-
 folio because the expected ratio of return to risk is not constant.

         We will illustrate this point by repeating the portfolio allocation deci-

 sion for a choice between a risk free asset bearing the Treasury Bill rate and

 the currency portfolio. The simulation results are presented in Table 4. For

 most of the periods, the investor holds between 60 percent to 100 percent of

 capital in the form of Treasury Bills. However, there are five periods——

associated with large differences in nominal interest rates——when urn percent

of capital is allocated to the currency portfolio and there are a number of

other periods in which the currency share is substantial. These occasional

allocations of capital to currency speculation substantially improved the
return on the portfolio. On an annualized basis, the pure Treasury Bill
portfolio had an average yield of 12.68 percent. The combined portfolio had an
average    yield of 25.35 percent per annum.

     We conclude this section by examining the    end of period wealth from the
various    strategies. We assume an initial capital of $1000 and allow for re-

investment of returns in each period.

These values demonstrate that the currency portfolio had the largest average

rate of return over this sample period. An investor who had taken the

positions suggested by the currency   portfolio would have had   an end—of-period

wealth   which would be more than twice that yielded by the traditional

investment instruments. Furthermore, the low correlation between the currency

portfolio returns and the return on U.S. equities implies that the addition of

a currency portfolio to a U.S. equity portfolio will tend to diversify the risk

of that portfolio. Over the sample period, an investor who had divided capital

between the two portfolios in the way suggested by our analysis would have

obtained a substantially higher average rate of return in exchange for a

moderate increase in risk.

        There   are a number of conclusions that can be drawn from this study.

First, there does appear to be a strong in—sample bias in tests of market

efficiency in the foreign exchange market. In particular, we find that stan-

dard regression procedures tend to underestimate the variance and overestimate

the mean of trading profits. As a consequence, speculators are likely to be

disappointed if they follow the rules outlined in this and other papers on

trading strategy.

        On the other hand, the strategy was profitable despite the allowances made

for transactions costs and margin requirements. Most of the profits were made

in a small number of instances when interest rate differentials were large.

Since these periods correspond to situations of unstable international monetary

arrangements, the profits could be associated with central bank intervention

(Taylor [1982]) or with a peso problem (Krasker [1980]) in which a small

probability adverse outcome has not occured in the sample. It should be

noticed, however, that the realization of the major part of profits in a small

number of   periods is a consequence of the trading strategy, rather than being a
consequence of unanticipated outcomes.
        In the final section of the paper, composite portfolios of equities and
currencies, and equities and Treasury Bills, were considered. Although the
share   of currencies in the composite portfolio was typically small, it is

probabily greater than existing investments by pension fund managers in forward

contracts. Furthermore, there were a number of periods in which the allocation

of capital to currency speculation was large, and these investments did

substantially improve the risk/return characteristic of the portfolio. It is

consequently unlikely that the failure of investment managers to engage in

currency speculation is due to risk aversion.
