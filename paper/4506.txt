                                             ABSTRACT
       This paper presents a neoclassical model of international capital flows, public investment, and
economic growth. Because public capital is non-traded and is imperfectly substitutable for private
capital, the open economy converges only gradually to the Solow steady-state notwithstanding the fact
that international capital mobility is perfect. Along the convergence path, the economy initially runs
a current account deficit that reflects a consumption boom and a surge in public spending. Over time,
the rate of public investment declines as does the rate of growth in the standard measure of
multifactor productivity in the private sector, the Solow residual.
       In the empirical section of the paper, we test the hypothesis that the log of the Solow residual
and the log of the public capital stock in the US, France, Germany, and Britain are cointegrated using
the multivariate maximum likelihood approach of Johansen (1991). We find that productivity and
public capital are coinregrated in each of these four countries. The estimated relationship between
productivity and public capital is quite similar across countries. These results do not convey any
information regarding causality. One plausible interpretation of our empirical finding of cointegration
betwen productivity and public capital is that productivity is exogenous with respect to public
capital, but that public capital is not exogenous and is thus Granger caused by productivity. We test
this hypothesis, and we find that it can be rejected for all four countries. However, there is also
evidence that public capital is not exogenous with respect to measured productivity. We conclude
that the structural relationship between public capital and productivity needs to be further investigated
in light of the cointegration and causality results reported in this paper.

1. Introduction

      Recently, and on both sides at the Atlantic, economists have begun to

reassess their thinking about international capital mobility and economic growth.

In Europe, there is an obvious interest in identifying and measuring the "growth

effects of 1992", the steady-state gains to be derived from an integrated market

in which goods and capital can move freely across national borders (Baldwin

(1992): Clarida and Findlay (1993)). In the US, the 1992 presidential election

focused voter - and academic -       attention   on the relationship among public

investment, international capital flows, and productivity growth. At least three

prominent proponents of the view that national public investment policies have

a role to play in raising productivity growth and wages have been named to senior

policymaking positions in the Clinton administration.

      In a world in which capital is internationally mobile, capital deepening

is not limited by national saving.     It follows that the process of convergence

to the Solow steady-state in a small open economy should be quite rapid -   indeed

theoretically instantaneous - and that current account deficits financed by

                                         1
capital inflows can provide the capital deepening required to equate domestic and

required world rates of return (Barro, Mankiw. and Sala-i-Martin (193fl.

Notwithstanding this theoretical implication of international capital mobility

and the Solow growth paradigm, OECD economies appear to converge quite slowl'.' to

their respective Solow steady-states (Mankiw, Romer, and Weil l99l): Helliwell

(1993)).   Barro, Mankiw, and Sala-i-Martin (1993) explicitly consider this

tension between the apparently high degree of capital mobility among countries

and the sluggish convergence of rates of economic to the Solow steady-state.

They show that if international capital mobility is to some degree imperfect -

for example,   if the outstanding stock of foreign debt cannot exceed the value of

the domestic capitaistock - then the optimal Ramsey accumulation path features

the gradual convergence to the steady-state observed in the data.

      While the evidence presented in Feldstein and Horioka (1980) indicates that

international capital mobility is far from perfect, recent research by Obstfeld

(1987) indicates that the degree of capital mobility among the major OECD

countries may be quite high (although see Feldstein and Bacchetta (1991) for

contrary evidence). In Section 2 of this paper, we present a neoclassical model

of optimal economic growth in a world of perfect international capital mobility

which features the sluggish convergence to the steady-state evident in the data.

Our framework augments the traditional Solow model by including productive public

capital in the aggregate production function.     In our model, public capital and

private capital are not perfect substitutes. Public capital goods are non-

tradable and must be produced with private capital and labor. The government is

assumed to select the time path of public investment to maximize the present

value of lifetime household utility, and to finance public investment with a lump

sum tax on household income.
      The model has a number of interesting implications. Along the optimal

convergence path to the Solow steady-state, the rate of public investment

declines as does the rate of growth in the standard measure of multifactor

productivity in the private sector, the Solow residual. These implications are

consistent with the empirical evidence reported in Aschauer (1989) for US data

and Ford and Poret (1991) who study the OECD countries.       Because of perfect

capital mobility, the rate of return on private capital is constant and equal to

the world level along the convergence path, as is the capital-output ratio. The

constancy of the capital-output ratio during the process of economic development

has been emphasized by Kaldor (1961) and is inconsistent with the predictions of

the neoclassical growth model in a world without capital mobility.         In our

framework, as public capital is accumulated, the private domestic capital stock

consistent with the required world rate of return is rising due to the

complementarity between the public and private capital stocks. The growth in

public and private capital raises real wages along the optimal convergence path.

Foreseeing this rise in wages, household initially seek to borrow from abroad to

finance consumption that exceeds current income. This dissaving by households.

along with the public investment plans of the government and the private

investment that will flow in to equalize domestic and world rates of return on

private capital, implies that the country must initially run a current account

deficit along the optimal convergence path. This is so even if, as we assume.

the government balances its budget each period by collecting taxes equal to the

current cost of public investment. Thus the initial current account deficit that

emerges during the transition to the steady-state reflects a consumption "boom'

relative to current income, a consumption boom that generates in a shortfall of

private saving relative to private investment.


                                        3
      In Section 3 of this paper, we investigate empirically tne relationship

between public capital and multifactor productivity in the US.    ermanv.   France.

and the United Kingdom. We find that we cannot reject the hypothesis that the

logarithm of the public capital stock and the logarithm of multifactor

productivity in all four countries are integrated 1(1) stochastic processes.

This suggests that a regression of productivity on public capital (Aschauer

(1989)) will be spurious in the sense of Granger and Newbold (197/i) unless public

capital and the Solow residual are cointegrated. Even if public capital and

productivity are cointegrated, OLS estimates of the regression coefficient, while

consistent, will be biased, and OLS standard errors will be inappropriate for

hypothesis testing (Campbell and Perron (1991)).

      We formally test the statistical hypothesis that the log of the Solow

residual and the log of the public capital stock in each country are cointegrated

using the multivariate maximum likelihood approach of Johansen (1991). We find

that we can reject the null hypothesis of no cointegration in favor of the

alternative hypothesis that productivity and public capital are cointegrated in

each of the four countries. Somewhat to our surprise, the estimated relationship

between public capital and productivity is quite similar across countries

      While these results indicate that the empirical correlation between the

Solow residual and public capital is not spurious, they do not convey any

information regarding causality. In particular, one plausible interpretation of

our empirical finding of cointegration between productivity and public capital

is that productivity is exogenous with respect to public capital, but that public

capital is not exogenous and is thus Granger caused by productivity. We formally




                                         'I
test this hypothesis for each country, and we find that it can be rejected for

all four countries. Notwithstanding the ex ante plausibility ot the hypothesis

that productivity is exogenous with respect to public capital, there is

substantial statistical evidence against this hypothesis in the US. French,

German, and British data. However, there is also evidence, especially in the

German and British data, that public capital is not exogenous with respect to

measured productivity. We conclude that the structural relationship between

public capital and productivity needs to be further investigated in light of the

cointegration and causality results reported in this paper.

      Barro (1990) and Barro and Sala-i-Martin (1991) have included government

provision of productive public services in an endogenous growth model. Their

focus is on the relationship among productive government services, the

distortionary taxes levied to pay for them, and long run growth in a closed

economy. These papers do not take into account that many productive government

services are in fact yielded by a stock of productive public capital that is

accumulated over time.   Imperfect substitutability between public and private

capital stocks, by introducing a second state variable, will in general

complicate analysis of transition dynamics in an optimizing model.             We

demonstrate that in a small open economy, the transition dynamics for the optimal

accumulation of public capital decouple from the transition dynamics for the

accumulation of tradeable wealth, comprised of private capital and international

bonds which are perfect substitutes. This decoupling, which is reminiscent of

the result presented in Blanchard and Fischer (1990), enables us to use a simple

phase diagram to characterize the process of convergence to the steady-state.




                                        5
2. Capital Mobility. Public Investment, and Economic Growth: A Model

      Consider a small open economy comprised of a representative household, a

representative firm with access to a technology for producing final output y(t).

and a government with access to a technology for producing public capital ACt).

Final output can be either consumed or costlessly transformed into private

capital. Household financial wealth w(t) is comprised of private capital k(t)

and internationally traded bonds b(t) which are perfect substitutes in

international portfolios, yielding an instantaneous equilibrium return of r, the

rate at which households discount future utility. The household supplies L hours

f labor inelastically receiving a wage of (t).                   The government levies a lump

sum tax of r(t) each period to defray to cost public investment.

      The household selects a time path for consumption c(t) so as to:


(1)           max S   etu(c(t))dt

subject to:

(2)           dw(t)/dt —    rw(t)   + ca,(t)L -   r(t)   -
                                                             c(r);
(3)           1im.,ew( r) — 0.

The solution to this problem must satisfy:


(4)           u'(c(A(t)))    —

(5)           dA(t)/dt —    0.

That is, the household selects the maximum sustainable consumption c(X) given

the intertemporal budget constraint. In particular:



(6)           c(A) —   rw(0) + rfett(w(c) -           r(t))dt.

                                                  6
To select c(A). the household must forecast the time path of wages and taxes.

We shall assume that expectations are rational. In the context of this small

open economy, this implies that households must forecast the time path of public

investment i(t) and the time path of multitfactor productivity a(t).

        We begin with the production function of the representative firm:


(7)           v(t) —


where 1(t) is the number of hours that the household works for the government.

so that L -   1(t)    is the number    of   hours that are supplied to the production of

final   output. Given the level of productivity a(t) and the private sector labor

supply L -    1(t).   the supply of capital available to the firm is determined by

the global capital market equilibrium condition that the marginal product of

capital must equal r + 6, where 6 is the rate of depreciation. We have:


(8)           k(t)    — (l-9)9(r   + 6) a(t)1(L -        1(t)).

Substituting for k(t). we obtain an expression for private domestic product:


()            v(t) -    ka(t)'(L   -
                                       1(t)):

where k (l-6)(r + 6)i1• Given labor's share of 6, (9) implies that the

equilibrium wage is just:


(10)          z(t) — 9ka(t)119.

Thus, the time path of wages in the small open economy is determined solely by
the time path of multifactor productivity. Private saving has no influence on

the time path of wages since the time path of k(t) is determined by the time path

of technology and the private labor supply.


                                                7
       We assume that the level of multifactor productivity in the private

domestic product production function is an increasing function of the public

capital stock (Aschauer (1989): Barro (1990)):


(11)         a(t) —   (kO18A(t)1.

The stock of public capital evolves according to:


(12)         dA(t)/dt —   -6A(r)    + 1(t).


The government hires labor 1(t) and private capital c(t) to produce public

capital goods according to the Cobb-Douglas production function:


(13)         i(z.A(t),1(t).,c(c))


To produce a "road", the government combines workers. "tractors", a fixed factor

z such as "land", and existing roads.             The cost minimizing bundle of inputs

chosen to produce public capital will satisfy c(t)/1(t) —                 ((a-)/E).'(t)/(r+6).
To ease notation, we shall assume (a-E)/E         —   1.   As will become clear, it is also

convenient, but by no means necessary, to assume that d                   r(l -

       e   suppose that the government maximizes lifetime household utility (1)

subject to (2), (3), (10). (11). (12), (13) and the balanced budget condition


(14)         r(t) —   w(t)1(t)   + (r + 6)K(t) —       2,.,(t)1(t).

Let p(t) denote the co-state variable for equation (12). Along an optimal path:


(15)         2A(t) p(t)A(t)h/9a(r÷6)21(t)a1:
(16)         ds(t)/dt —   (5+r)p(r)    -

                                       -      A(y/9)A(t)C79)9(L       -
                                                                          21(c)).


                                              8
The left hand side of (15) is just the marginal resource cost of an extra unit

of public capital multiplied by the marginal utility of consumption, A. which

is constant along the optimal path. This must be equal to the marginal product

of the resources diverted to the production of public capital multiplied by the

shadow value of public capital. ji(t). The shadow value of public capital is.

from (16), equal to the present value of the marginal social products of public

capital multiplied by the marginal utility of consumption. A:



                 rd-. f:e     (st)A(l,9)A(s)(7-)IO( (L-21   (s)) +   21(s)/aids



       Equation (15) can be solved for 1(t). yielding:


(17)           1(z(t)/A) —   (a(r+6)'2z1p(c)/2A)''1

Substituting into (13). we obtain an expression for optimal public investment:


(18)


ccording to equation (18), the rate of public investment i(t)/A(t) is an

increasing function of the shadow value of public capital and a decreasing

function of the stock of public capital as long as -y < .

       We   now investigate the stability properties of this dynamic system in A(t)

and t(t) defined by equations (12) and (16). Substituting (18) into (12). we

see that the dA(t)/dt — 0 schedule is upward sloping,


(19)           8p(t)/öA(t)I(t),dtD > 0:


and that in a neighborhood of the steady-state 6A —           zAhIO(a(r+6)ip(t)/2A)i.
A(t) is stable given p.        Turning to the dp(t)/dt schedule, we confine our


                                            9
attention to the empirically relevant case in which -v <            8.   This condition states

that the elasticity of productivity with respect to public capital is less than

the elasticity of private domestic product with respect to labor. labor's share.

ie differentiate (16) with respect to A(t) using (15) to find that if


(20)             (5+r)M(t) -   (t)(_y/8)A(t)(1_ /9z1(r+6Y221(tY) > 0:

the    dp(t)/dt-O schedule will be downward sloping


(21)             Bi.(c)/3A(t)d(t),dt,..o
                                           < °.

From    (16).   it   is evident that this condition must be satisfied in a neighborhood
of    the steady-state if L/2 >       1(t).       1(t) will be less than L/2 in the steady-

state if -y     is   sufficiently small.          Intuitively, the smaller is -y.   the smaller

is the marginal social product of government employment in the production of

public capital, and thus the smaller will be share of total employment devoted

to the production of public capital. It may also be verified by inspection of

(16) that, given A, (t)          is   unstable. Thus, as shown in Figure 1. the system

dynamics are characterized by a downward sloping saddle-path that lies everywhere

below the dp(t)/dt—O schedule.

         This model has a number interesting implications, several which can be read

off the phase diagram. Starting from a modest initial stock of public capital

A(O). the shadow value of public capital i(O) jumps in anticipation of the high

marginal social product of public investment in present and future years. This

triggers an initial increase in public investment in excess of the rate required

to replace depreciating public capital.                     The initial increase in public

investment leads to the accumulation of public capital, which over time reduces

the social product, and thus the shadow value, of additional public investment.

Given this decline in the shadow value of public capital. public investment

begins to fall and in fact declines -      relative      to the initial public investment

surge -   along the optimal convergence path to the steady state.              Given the

complementaritv public capital. labor, and private capital embodied in the

Aschauer-Barro production function for final output. these results can be used

to characterize the time path of private multifactor productivity growth in the

small open economy along the convergence path to the Solow steady state.                 In

particular. from (12) and (18) we see that:


(22)        dlog(a(t)) —     -+   (y/)zA(cY          -




                           -rdlogA(r).

which must falling over time since A(t) is rising over time and L(t)          is   falling.

       The neoclassical credentials of this model are impeccable, and thus the

intuition behind its implications is not elusive. Nonetheless, we would argue

that these implications are not widely appreciated.              In particular. the fact

that the public investment rate in the US (and other countries) has fallen over

the past two decades has been decried as prima face evidence that government

policy has failed to "put people first". In the context of our analysis, public

capital accumulation is the sole source real wage gains as is clear from equation

(10) and the fact that private capital accumulation cannot contribute to capital

deepening in a world of perfect capital mobility.                 In fact, in this world

capital deepening occurs solely because public capital accumulation raises the

marginal product of private capital inducing capital inflows, or a reallocation

of domestic wealth, sufficient to equalize domestic and world returns to private

capital. From equations (8) and (11) we see that:


(23)         dlogk(t)/dt -   dlog(L   -
                                          l(r))/dc   —   diogw(t)/dt   (-y/9)dlogA(t).

                                             11
(;iven the objective of maximizing (1). the policvmaker in this small open economy

does "put people first" arid does take into complete account that productivity,

wages. and household welfare are directly and decisively influenced by the time

path of public investment.    In short, the evidence reported in Aschauer(1989)

and Ford and Poret (1991) that a sustained decline in the rate of public

investment has been associated with a siuinp in private productivity growth is,

by itself, not inconsistent with the welfare maximizing accumulation of public

capital.

       Because of perfect capital mobility, the rate of return to private capital

is constant and equal to the equilibrium world return throughout the process of

convergence to the steady state. Using (8) and (9), we see that the capital-

output ratio is also constant and equal to:


(24)         k(t)/y(t) — (1 - 9)/(r   +   6).

The constancy of the capital-output ratio during the process of economic

development has been emphasized by Kaldor (1961) and is inconsistent with the

predictions of the one-good neoclassical growth model in a world without capital

mobil itv.

       In our framework, as public capital is accumulated, the private domestic

capital stock consistent with the required world rate of return is rising due

to the complementarity between the public and private capital stocks. The growth

in public and private capital raises real wages along the optimal convergence

path. Since public investment declines along the optimal convergence path. so

do lax collections(!).     Foreseeing this rise in wages and decline in taxes.

households initially seek to borrow from abroad to finance consumption that

exceeds current income. This dissaving by households, along with the public


                                           12
investment plans of the government and the private investment that will flow in

to equalize domestic and world rates of return on private capital, implies that

the country must initially run a current account deficit along the optimal

convergence path (cf. Blanchard and Fischer (1989) Chapter 1) This is so even

if, as we assume, the government balances its budget each period by collecting

taxes equal to the current cost of public investment. Thus the initial current

account deficit that emerges during the transition to the steady-state reflects

a consumption boom relative to current income, a consumption boom that generates

a shortfall of private saving relative to private investment.

       Up until now, we have abstracted from exogenous technical progress so as

to focus exclusively on the interplay between public investment, productivity

growth. international capital flows, and the gradual convergence to the steady

state in the open economy. Suppose, more realistically, that technical progress

augments at rate g the effective stock of the two factors in fixed supply so that

L(t) — e&tL and z(t) — e&tz.         It is straightforward to verify that in this

growing open economy, the steady state exhibits balanced growth with output.

wages, private capital, and public capital all rising at the rate g/(l -

       Optimal public investment is given by:

(26)          i(,j(t)/A;et;A(t)) —   e8tzA(t)O(a(r+6)j(t)/2AY1'.

Let A(t)    A(t)e    (1-1'/O)t•   Substituting   (26) into (12), we see that the

d(t)/dt — 0 schedule defined by:


(27)          (6 + g/(1--y/O))A(r) —


is   upward sloping and is stable in a neighborhood of the steady state.




                                           13
       Along the optimal accumulation path the shadow value of public capital

evolves according to:


(28)         dj(t)/dt — (6+r)(t)   -       ji(t) (i/9 )d(t)             ) -/2 (c)
                                   -       A(i/6)d(t)"9(L      -
                                                                   21(t)).

As demonstrated above for the case in which g — 0. the d(t)/dt schedule will

be downward sloping in a neighborhood of the steady state if -y is sufficiently

small. As before, the system dynamics are characterized by a downward sloping

saddle path that lies everywhere below the dj(t)/dt schedule. Along the path

of convergence, the growth in the public capital stock declines until reaching

its steady state rate of g/(l -    i/fl.    Along the convergence path. the growth

in private multifactor productivity:


(29)         dloga(r) — 9g + -ydlogA(t):

must also decline until reaching its steady state rate of 9g/(l -

IzzlDlicptions for Europe
       This model has several implications that pertain to the process ot

integrating the eastern European economies into the world's market - and

especially EC - economies and trading system.           The model sheds light on the

process of growth and development in a small open economy that is able to benefit

from international capital mobility. Notwithstanding the fact international

capital flows insure that the return to private capital is at all times equal

to the world return, convergence to the steady state growth path takes time as

the economy only gradually accumulates the public capital needed to complement

internationally mobile private capital and labor.             The World Bank and the

European Bank for Reconstruction and Development can play an important role in


                                           14
channeling funds and expertise to the most productive infrastructure projects

in these countries. Traditionally, it has not been uncommon for the lending on

such projects to be provided at a concessional interest rates. In the context

of the model presented above, it is straightforward to demonstrate that, to the

extent that a concessional interest rate lowers the rental cost of private

capital employed in the production of public capital. the optimal rate of public

investment, the equilibrium rate of private investment, and the speed of

convergence to the steady state growth path increase.

      Another implication of the model, discussed at length above, is that

expectations of rising wages set off a "consumption boom" in an economy     that

initially finds itself with a public, and thus in equilibrium private, capital

stock that is far below the steady state level. Of course, this consumption boom

occurs in conjunction with a private investment boom and a surge in government

spending and results in a current account deficit during the early stages     of

integration with the market economies and the global capital market.         The

conjunction of an initial consumption and investment boom and a rise in

government spending might be difficult to interpret within the context of a

Ramsey model of economic growth without capital mobility. In the Ramsey model.

an initial investment boom occurs when, the marginal product of capital   is high

relative to the rate of time preference. The high marginal product of capital

encourages households to defer consumption to the future.       Along the Ramsey

adjustment path, consumption is initially low and rising while net     investment

 is initially high and falling. By contrast, according to our model an initial

 splurge in consumption and government spending in conjunction with an investment

 boom does not necessarily represent an "excessiv&' demand for foreign capital

 inflows.


                                        15
     The model also sheds light on the mechanism by which "the growth effects

of 1992" may be achieved.     In a perceptive paper, Baldwin (1992) argues that

estimated static efficiency gains to European GDP arising from completion the

1992 program understate the

            • . . the economic effects of 1992, perhaps by an order
            of magnitude. In addition to the initial static effect.
            •  • . there will be medium term growth bonus as the
            static efficiency gains induce higher savings and
            investment. This medium term bonus will be achieved even
            if there is no permanent increase in the underlying
            growth rate. . . [T]he removal of barriers to the
            movement of goods, labor, and capital will improve the
            overall efficiency with which the EC labor force and
            capital stock are combined to produce output.       The
            result is a higher level of output for any given level
            of inputs (Baldwin (1992), pp. 250-252).

Baldwin conducts his analysis of the Solow growth model -     he also studies an

endogenous growth specification -   under the assumption that capital is immobile
so that the process of capital deepening that generates the "growth effects of

1992" must be financed by domestic savings.         In such a world, the 1992

efficiency gains, by shifting up the aggregate production function, set in

motion the traditional process of capital deepening and economic growth which

gradually lifts the capital-labor ratio and the level of income. Baldwin shows

that this "medium term growth bonus", the rise in income that follows from the

endogenous accumulation of capital in the Solow growth model, can be at least

as great as the "static efficiency effect", the initial shift in the aggregate

production function.

      In the context of our model, a shift in Europe's aggregate production

function brought about by 1992 efficiency gains will boost the marginal product

of private capital, inducing a capital inflow until the marginal product of

private capital is driven down to the world level. This is just the medium term



                                        16
growth, or more precisely "private capital deepening". bonus in a world of

capital mobility. But this is not the end of the story. Assuming that 1992

efficiency gains also shift the production function for public investment in

each country, it is straightforward to verify that "public capital deepening"

must also occur. Moreover, as each economy gradually accumulates public capital

according to the dynamic process outlined above, the complementaritv between

public and private capital induces additional investment in private capital.

We note finally that,, according to (29), the growth in private multifactor

productivity rises in response to the 1992 efficiency gains, and declines only

gradually back to the steady state rate 9g/(l -

3. Empirical Results

       In a widely cited but controversial paper Aschauer (1989), running

regressions of productivity on public capital using annual postwar US data.

concluded that the productivity slowdown in the US can be "explained" by a

roughly contemporaneous slowdown in the rate of US public investment. He also

argued that cross sectional differences in average annual growth rates in the

C7 countries appear to be associated with cross sectional differences in rates

of public investment. Aschauer recognized that the endogeneity of the public

capital stock makes it problematic to infer the direction of causality from the

correlations his regression estimates recover and he attempted to control for

it. but he concluded that his evidence was consistent with the hypothesis that

public capital augsents the US economy's aggregate production function, and that

the slowdown in US public investment can account for as much as 801 of the

productivity slowdown.

       Consider the equation a(t) —   A(t)7exo(a0 + E(t)) which should be thought
of as one equation from a simultaneous equations model. Taking logs:


(30)         ioga(t) —    + -ylogA(t) + (t).


In general, it is not possible to recover a consistent estimate of -y   from an OLS

regression of loga(t) on logA(t) if (30) is true.        There are two cases to

consider. If loga(t). logA(t). and (t) are stationary stochastic processes.

E(t) will in general be correlated with logA(t).           This is the standard

simultaneous equations problem and OLS will be biased and inconsistent.          If

instead loga(t). logA(t). and (t) are nonstationary unit root stochastic

processes, an OLS regression of loga(t) on logA(t) represents a spurious

regression in the sense of Granger and Newbold (1974).


                                         18
       There is a special case in which it is possible to obtain a consistent

estimate of -y from OLS estimates of (30). This is the special case in which

loga(t) and logA(t) are nonstationary in levels but stationary in first

differences and in which f(t) is stationary in Levels.                          Under these

circumstances, equation (30) represents a cointegrating relationship between

Loga(t) and logA(t).     OLS is consistent but is in general biased, and OLS

standard errors are, in general, incorrect (Campbell and Perron (1991)).

Fortunately, Johansen (1991) has developed a maximum likelihood procedure for

testing the hypothesis of cointegration. for estimating the cointegratirig

vector, and for testing exogeneitv hypotheses.      In this section of the paper.

we employ the Johansen approach to investigate the statistical correlation

between public capital and productivity using annual time series data for four

countries: the United States, France, Germany, and Britain.

       We test the unit root hypothesis with the augmented Dickey-Fuller t-test.

Under the null hypothesis that a variable x(t) is difference but not level

stationary, the regression:


(31)         tiX(t) —    + p,t + cox(t-1) + p1Ax(t-1)   +   .   ÷
                                                                    pA.x(t-p)
                                                                                  + v(t):


is   run, and a t-test of the significance of    is performed. Under the null.

  — 0 and the t-ratio has a skewed distribution that has been investigated and

tabulated by Fuller (1975). The results of this test applied to annual data on

public capital and multifactor productivity for each country are reported in

Table 1. There is no evidence at even the 10 percent level against the null

hypothesis that each variable under study is nonstationary in log levels except

UK public capital for which the hypothesis of a unit root can be rejected at the

10 percent. but not the 5 percent level.


                                         19
        Proceeding under the working hypothesis that all of the variables are

nonstationary in levels but stationary in first differences, we estimate

bivariate vector error correction models (VECM) for log productivity and log

public capital in each country. Letting y(t)                  [loga(t). logA(t)J' denote the

2 by 1 vector of the system's variables, the vector error correction model can

be written:


(32)            y(t) —       + r(L)Ay(t-1)     + 11y(t-1) +   c(t).

If the matrix TI is of full rank r —           2, the VECM reduces to the usual   bivariate
VAR    in   the levels of stationary variables. If the matrix [I is the null matrix

so that r — 0, the VECM        represents     a VAR in first-differences. The bivariate

VECH   differs      from the usual VAR   in   that it allows for the existence of a long-

run equilibrium relationship between the system's variables. If the matrix fl

is of reduced rank r — 1, it can be factored into the product of two 2 by 1

vectors       and     such that:


(33)            II—


where 8' is the 1 by 2 cointegrating vector, and                   is the 2 by I vector of

adjustment coefficients for the system's 2 equations. The cointegrating vector

defines a long run equilibrium to which the system ultimately returns after a

shock. The parameter in each of the 2 rows of the                vector determines the rate

at which each of the system's 2 variables adjust in response to lagged

deviations:


(34)            z(t-l) —


from the cointegrating relationship.

        Table 2 presents the results of two tests developed by Johansen to

investigate the hypothesis that the number of cointegrating vectors in a system

of n variables is less than or equal to equal to r.       For the US, France, and

Germany (Britain) and according to both the trace and the ,\-max statistic, we

can reject at the 5 percent (10 percent) level the hypothesis of no

cointegration against the alternative hypothesis that loga(t) and logA(t) are

cointegrated. A finding of cointegration implies that a regression of loga(t)

on logA(t) is not spurious in the sense of Granger and Newbold, and indicates

that an unbiased and efficient estimate of 'y can be obtained from the VECM for

each country.

        Table 3 presents for each country the Johansen maximum likelihood

estimates of 'y, the results of a likelihood ratio test of the hypothesis that

-y —     0, the estimates of the     vector of adjustment coefficients, and the

results of likelihood ratio tests of the hypotheses that       — 0 or    —   0.   As

can be seen in the second column of the Table, the point estimates of 1',         the
elasticity of productivity with respect to public capital, range from 0.37 in

the US to 0.48 in Germany.      Moreover, the estimates for y in the US. France,

and Britain are all clustered quite close to Aschauer's OLS estimate for the US

of 0.39. Each of these estimates of -y is significantly different from 0 at the

1 percent level.

         From the discussion in Ericsson (1991) and Johansen (1992). a necessary

condition for productivity to be exogenous with respect to public capital is

that the dynamic equation for productivity exhibit no error correction. That

is,    the exogeneity of productivity with respect to public capital requires that

   — 0.    The results of a test of the hypothesis that productivity is exogenous

with respect to public capital in each country are reported in the third column

Table 3.   For the US and France we can reject the hypothesis that productivity

is exogenous with respect to public capital at the 1 percent level, and for

Germany we can reject the hypothesis that productivity is exogenous with respect

to public capital at the 7 percent level.        For Britain we cannot reject the

hypothesis, which is necessary but not sufficient for the exogeneity of

productivity with respect to public capital, that h — 0.      Ericsson shows that

exogeneity requires, in addition to          — 0, that productivity growth not be

Granger caused by lagged growth in public capital. This hypothesis is tested

using the likelihood ratio test. We find, but do not report in Table 3, that we

can reject at the 1 percent level the hypothesis that productivity growth in

Britain is not Granger caused by lagged public capital growth. Notwithstanding

the ex ante plausibility of the hypothesis that productivity is exogenous with

respect to public capital, there is substantial statistical evidence against this

hypothesis in the US, French, German, and British data. However, there is also

evidence, in the form of significant adjustment coefficients q'2 in the German and

British data, that public capital is not exogenous with respect to measured

productivity.   Moreover, Granger causality test on the US and French data

indicate that lagged productivity helps to forecast future public investment.

We conclude that the structural relationship between public capital and

productivity needs to be further investigated in light of the cointegration and

causality results reported In this paper.
