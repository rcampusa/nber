            An Economic Analysis of the Diet, Growth, and
            Health of Young Children in the United States


                            ABSTRACT

     The purpose of this paper is to investigate the extent to
which family income and education are obstacles to the provision
of adequate diets for young children in the United States. An
examination of the Health and Nutrition Examination Survey reveals
the following:

     1. Average nutrient intakes of young children are well above
recommended dietary standards, with the exception of iron.
     2. Average nutrient intakes for children in households of
lower economic status are very similar to intakes of children in
households of higher economic status. Rates of children's growth
are also similar in these households.

     3. Family income and education of the household head have
statistically significant but very small positive effects on the
nutrient intake levels of young children.

     4. There are substantial effects of protein intakes on
children's height and head growth, even though protein is consumed
in excess of dietary standards. This finding and the apparent
correlation between children's growth and their intellectual develop-
ment brings to question the adequacy of present protein standards.
Could American mothers, who provide very high protein diets for
their children in households at all levels of socioeconomic status
know more about what constitutes an adequate diet for their
children than the experts do?

          "One Out of every three children under six years of age are
     living in homes in which incomes are insufficient to meet the
     costs of procuring many of the essentials of life, particularly
     food." Congressional testimony of Charles Upton Lowe, Director

                                    I. Introduction

     Interest in the nutritional status of young American children has

heightened considerably in the past decade. Nuch of the concern has re-

sulted from research suggesting varying degrees of under—nutrition in low

income    American school1 and pre—school children and from evidence indicating
a positive association between children's growth and their intellectual de-
velopment.2 In this paper we analyze the choice of diet for children.one to
five years in the United States and            its relation   to the children's growth
and health.      We are particularly     interested in    the   extent to which family in-
come and education    may be obstacles to the provision of adequate diets for
children in     American   families. The hypothesis that these obstacles are sub-
stantial underlies many government nutrition and income support programs and
has led to the Congressional mandate of two separate comprehensive national
nutrition surveys, The Ten State Nutrition Survey, 1968—1970, and the Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1971—1975.
     In   a   previous paper we used the Ten State Nutrition Survey (TSNS) data to
examine the nutritional status of children up           to    the age of 36   months in   poor
American families (Chernichovsky and Coate, 1978).              The   picture that emerged
from the analysis of TSNS data was         generally contrary to the impressions left
by much   previous research. The data indicated that low income parents had
pushed the growth of their children through choice of diet nearly as much as
                                    —2—


possible.    Protein, a relatively high priced    nutrient,   was consumed in quan-

tities two to three   times recommended dietary standards and to an extent where

its marginal impact   on the growth of children was very small. Family income

and mother's education were shown not to be significant (in the statistical

sense) barriers to the provision of adequate protein and calorie intakes for

children in poor American families. In the TSNS data average protein and

calorie   consumption was   in excess   of dietary standards whether the data was
stratified   by children's age, family income, or ethnic group. Protein intakes
in these cross—tabulations were consistently two to three hundred percent of
dietary standards.
       In this paper we analyze the Health and    Nutrition   Examination Survey (HANES)
data   to provide further evidence on the choice of diet for young American children
and its effect on their growth and health. This paper is divided into five sec-
tions. In the following section we describe the conceptual framework and sneèifv
a general model of children's diet, health, and growth. This is followed by a
discussion of the data that includes important descriptive statistics. In
Section IV, we present the estimated econometric model. The         final   section
summarizes the research.

                        II. Conceptual Framework
       As a point of departure we postulate that the utility of parents is a

positive function of their children's growth. That is, within the bounds of

perceived norms, parents desire heavier and taller children.3 For our analysis

it is not necessary that this desire be based on known correlations         between
current   period height and weight of children and their current and future period

health   status and intellectual development. Rather, we only argue that this
desire does exist and that parents make sacrifices or forego other pleasures
in- order to augment the growth of their      children.4
                                        —3—

        Although constrained by genetic and ohysiological factors, parents in-

fluence the growth of their children by their choice of diet for the children

and by their investment in their children's health (medical care, parental

care, sanitary conditions, etc.). The interdependencjeg among children's

growth, children's health and their diet are formalized in the following model.

        We begin by relating the parent's choice of the initial diet, D0, for a

new born to birth weight, BW, which is a proxy for the infant's demand, for

food, and initial period socioeconomic influences, E, that impact on the

quantity and quality of diet.


                           D = f°(BW, E).                                (1)


In each subsequent period the child's growth, G, is determined by genetic

and arental traits, Z, and by diet, Dci, and health status, Htl, in the

preceding period. Health status can be interpreted as an efficiency parameter

that affects the rate at which nutrients are converted into children's growth.

Formally,

                                =   f   (Z, Dtl, H1).                   (2)


The diet   in each period is a function of the child's growth, which serves as a
proxy   for appetite or the child's demand for food, and the economic status of
the   household.
                                =                                       (3)
                           Dt              Er).

The child's health status is a function of his diet, growth and other inuts which

produce good health, X,

                           Ht =     h(X,      Dr).
                                          —4—

       The levels of      are determined by socioeconomic status

                                          =
                                              e(E).                                (5)



       In order to statistically identify certain key relationships and to make

the model consistent with available cross—section data, several assumptions

are necessary, some of which are explicit in equations 1—5. First, birth

weight is considered exogenous to our model of children's growth, diet and

health. A more sophisticated model could include birth weight as an endogenous

variable and relate it to parental characteristics, diet of the mother and socio-

economic variables. We also assume that some variables are serially correlated

(e.g., diet, household income) or constant (e.g., mother's education, parental

traits) over t and that the time increments are infinitesimal.

       To isolate the role of diet as a bridge from socioeconomic status to

children's growth, we can, given the assumptions detailed above, derive the

following simultaneous equations from (2), (3), and              (4)

                             C   = g(D,   H, t, Z, BW)                             (6)
                             D = f(G,     E)                                       (7)
                             H=   h(,     C, E)                                    (8)

which specifies D, C, and H as endogenous variables. Equation (6) is basically
a technical relationship, describing how children's growth responds to diet and

health levels, given age, birth weight and            parental   and genetic characteristics.

Equations (7) and (8) are primarily behavioral relationships, explaining the

choice of diet in the household for the children, given socioeconomic constraints,

and   the   subsequent influence of diet and      growth on health levels.

                                  III.     The Data

        HANES is anationa]. sample of the population of the United States, with

oversampling of low income families. The entire HANES sample, which was

collected between 1971 and 1975 by the National Center for Health Statistics,

contains approximately 28,000 individuals between the ages of 1 and 74.

Slightly less than 3,000 children aged 1 to 5 years were included in the sample.

Dietary intake data for the previous 24 hours were collected for children less

than five years of age by interview of the homemaker. A working sample of 2515

was created by deleting all observations (children) with missing data. The

roughly 450 children deleted from the samDle did not differ significantly from

the   working sample in   terms of age and sex specific nutrient intakes or height,

head,   and weight growth. RANES is described in       detail by the National Center

for   Health Statistics (1973, 1977).
       Descriptive statistics for variables collected in HANES relevant to our
analysis are presented in      Table    1. Endogenous variables in our econometric
specifications are selected from the measures of children's diet, health,
and growth. Measures of children's growth are height, weight, and head cir—
cuinference. Measures of children's health are lifetime number of overnight

hospitalizations and number of colds in the six months prior to the medical

history. Children's    diet is    measured   by calorie, protein, calcium,   iron,
vitamin    A and vitamin C   intakes.

      Exogenous variables in the growth equations are measures of aenetjc            and
parental traits, namely children's        age, sex, birth weight, birth order, race,

mother's   height and weight,   and father's height. Exogenous variables in the
nutrient   intake and health equations are family income, family size, and dummy

variables reoresenting education of the household head and whether the head is

female.

         The mean family income     of    $9,280 is considerably below the 1972 na-

 tional average of $12,500 and       is   indicative of the oversampling of low    in-
 come families. The mean calorie and          protein intakes of 1516 and 56   grams
 are considerably above the protein         and calorie standards of roughly   1330

 and   26, grams for children of the age and weight corresponding to the sample
means.5 This finding of higher average protein and calorie intakes than
dietary standards is not surprising given the similar results from the
TSNS, a sample characterized by significantly lower family incomes. Chil-
dren's intakes of calcium, vitamin A and vitamin C average two to three
times recommended dietary standards in the MANES working sample. In the
case of iron, the average intake is two—thirds of dietary standards.
      In column 1 of Table 2, levels of growth, health, and nutrient intakes
are presented for children in households falling into the upper and lower
thirty percentiles of the       poverty index (PIR) distribution.6 There are no

significant      differences   in height, weight, or head growth between these

groups,      nor in protein, calorie, vitamin A,     or iron intakes. In the cases
of vitamin C and       calcium intakes    a statistically significant difference

emerges      in favor of the higher PIR group. For both groups      mean   nutrient
intake levels consistently exceed dietary standards, with the exception of
iron. There are also no significant differences in hospitalizations al-
though the lower PIR group had a significantly greater number of colds in
the six months prior to the medical history. The average family income and
household     size   for the higher PIR group are $14,766 and 4.2. The same fig-
ures   for the lower PIR group are $3,673 and 5.7.
        In   the remaining portion of Table 2 similar high and low PIR compari-
sons are made for blacks and for whites in the working sample. The pat-
terns of statistical significance within these stratifications are           similar

to that for the sample as a whole.

      Further information on the nutritional status of young American children
 can be obtained by examining the diets of children light for their age and
 sex. In our HANES working sample the calorie and protein intakes of children
below the 10th percentile in weight for their age and sex are 1440 and 53 grams,
not significantly different from the working sample means and indicative of
more than adequate intakes of these nutrients according to dietary standards.
The mean family income for this group of light children is $8470. Unless

present and past nutrient intakes are not correlated, these numbers imi,ly that

influences other than diet may be responsible for producing     the condition usually
associated   with undernutrition. The consideration of the emprical results in the

next section will, enable us to come to firmer conclusions about the role of

socioeconomic variables in the choice of diet by arents for their children and

about the subsequent effect of nutrient intakes on children's growth.


                          IV. Empirical    Results
     At the empirical level we have estimated several variations of our model

of children's diet, health, and growth. With the excei,tion of calories and

protein, the nutrient intake variables did not ai'proach statistical significance

on the growth equations, either because of their high correlations with rotein

and calorie intakes or because they have very small impacts on growth at the

margin. The health variables also oerformed poorly in the growth equations

in the statistical sense, apparently because these conditions have minor or

very short term growth effects that are rapidly overcome.

     In the presentation of the empirical results, therefore, we etmhasize a

model with the following endogenous variables: height, weight, head circumference,

protein intake, and   calorie   intake.   We also report results for the colds variable

and for vitamin C intake.

of   the diet. Protein and calories are highly colinear (           r=   .82) so a good portion

of the protein influence is captured by the calorie variable. An argument with a

similar   framework explains why protein appears in the height and head           growth equa-

tions while calories does not.9
        In elasticity terms the most important variables in the growth equations are
children' s   age and height of the mother and     height   of the father. These results
were expected and    demonstrate   again the importance     of   variables beyond the influence
of the household decision maker      in   the children's growth process. A result that is
surprising is the rather substantial elasticities of children's growth with respect
to nutrient intakes. The elasticities (at the means) of height and head circuxu—
ference with respect to protein are .05 and .25, respectively, and the elasticity
of   weight with respect to calories is .20. These results imply that an increase

in   daily protein consumption of ten percent or about five and one—half grams would
increase height by an average of one—fifth of one inch and            head   circumference by
an average of one—half of one inch. A ten percent increase in calorie intakes
would increase children's weight by an average of seven—tenths of one pound. The
protein elasticities in the height and head circumference equations seam particu-
larly large in light of the fact that protein intakes average more than twice
dietary standards. The protein effects on growth seem to be linear throughout the
range of    intakes characterizing the HANES working sample: that is, we do not

appear    to be approximating a non—linear protein effect with a very small impact
on growth at the margin. 10
        These substantial elasticities of growth with respect to nutrients that
are consumed in excess of dietary standards is consistent with the findings of
the evaluation of the Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Inf ants and
Children (WIC). This analysis showed that although children in poor American
households generally consumed nutrients well in excess of dietary standards,
their growth could be accelerated by increasing nutrient intakes. In light of
                                         — 15 —




 these findings the WIC evaluators       recor!,merlded a reassessment of dietary

 standards and singled out protein in particular (Edozien, et.al., 1976).


 C. Nutrient Intake Equations

        The simultaneous equation estimates of the protein, calorie, and vitamin          C

equations       are presented in Table 5. The results are similar for each of the

nutrients. Simply stated they indicate, within the context of our.model, that

children get the amount of these nutrients that they "ask for." The child's

demand       for nutrients, represented by weight of the child, is a very ir!rnortant
determinant of intakes. The nutrient—weight elasticities are about one in
each case and the t—values of the weight coefficients are substantial. The
family income coefficients approach statistical significance but imolv very
small       elasticities (about .02 in each case).
        Education   of the household head has a   positive but nonlinear effect on
nutrient      intakes. Children in families where the head has 12 years of schooling

receive about five iercent more of these nutrients relative to children in families

where the head has less than 12 years of schooling. However, this education differ-

ential falls when children in families where the head has college or graduate edu-

cation      are compared to children in families where the head has less than 12 years
of   schooling.

        A   primary purpose of this paper was to investigate the extent to which
family      income and education are obstacles to the provision of adequate diets for

young    children in the United States. Based on      our examination of the HANES   data
we have, found that:

      1. Average nutrient intakes of young        children   are well above recommended

dietary      standards, with the exception of iron.

        2.    Average nutrient intakes for children in households of lower eco-

nomic   status are   very similar to intakes of children in households   of higher
economic status. Rates of children's growth are also similar in these

households.
        3.    Family income and education of the household head have statistically
significant but very small positive effects on the nutrient intake levels of
young children in the model of children's diet, growth, and health estimated
in   this paper.

        These findings are very consistent with those from a similar analysis

we performed with the Ten State Nutrition Survey.      A most interesting result
of   the   present study is the rather substantial estimated effects of protein

intakes on children's height and head growth, even though protein is con-

sumed well in excess of dietary     standards. This   finding and the apparent

correlation between children's growth and their intellectual development

brings to question the adequacy of present protein standards. Could

american     mothers, who provide very high protein diets for their children
in   households at a].]. levels of socioeconomic status know more about what

constitutes an adequate diet for their children than the experts do?

        'For examples of research into the problem of undernutrition in American
 school and pre—school.    children in the U.S., see   Christakis   (1968), Owen   (1969),
 Sims and norris (1974), and     Owen   (1974).

        2Owen (1977), in his review of the effects of nutrition on growth and
 cognitivedevelopment, concludes that the "evidence, which still should be con-
sidered preliminary in nature, ... [indicates] that bigger is srtarter, at least
among    pre—school children."

        3More formally,   it could   be argued that rates of children's growth enter

the utility function in a non—linear fashion and that       excessive rates of growth
(e.g.    obesity) are negatively related to parent's utility.

        4it is often pointed out that in
                                            agricultural societies parents are very
concerned    about the size of their children because physical strength is an

important    correlate of individual output. Although a desire for larger children
in modern societies may not be based on a similar observation, there is evidence
that   the height or weight of children at younger ages correlate with their in-

tellectual develomnent and health in later years, and thus with         their   future

earnings.


     5The dietary standards cited in the text are those of the HANES dietary
standards committee for children 24—47 months weighing the sample mean of 15.5
kilograms.


           computed in HANES, the poverty index ratio takes     account   of household

income, household size, and household diet requirements as reflected by the age

distribution of the household members.

         Adjusted R2,s increased by less than .01 when the socioeconomic variables

were added to either height, weight, or head size regressions that already con-

tained age, the square of age, sex, parent's height, birthweight and birthorder.

It should also be pointed out that the limited significance of the socioeconomic

variables does not appear to be due to colinearity with the genetic and parental

trait variables. The t—values of the socioeconomic variables do not increase

markedly even when the genetic and parental trait variables are excluded from

the children's growth equations.

     8The results for the colds variable are also presented in Table 4 but are

not discussed in the text. Household income and education of the household

head are inversely related to the number of children's colds while protein and

vitamin C intakes do not have statistically significant impacts.

     9Because the growth equations formed part of a simultaneous system tradi-

tional F tests could not be employed to test the individual and joint contribu-

tions of the protein and calorie variables. Results from OLS regressions indi-

cate that protein makes a significant incremental contribution to explaining

the variance in height and head growth when added to regressions containing

the other independent variables, while calories does not. When both diet

variables are added jointly to height and head growth regressions the incre—

mental contribution is insignificant. For the weight equation, the incremental

contribution to explained variance is significant when the trotein and calorie

variables are entered individually or jointly to regressions contaning the

other independent variables.
