                                            ABSTRACT

This paper investigates whether subjective expectations about future mortality affect consumption
and bequests motives. We estimate a dynamic life-cycle model based on subjective survival rates
and wealth from the panel dataset Asset and Health Dynamics among Oldest Old. We find that
bequest motives are small on average, which indicates that most bequests are involuntary or
accidental. Moreover, parameter estimates using subjective mortality risk perform better in
predicting out-of-sample wealth levels than estimates using life table mortality risks, suggesting that
decisions about consumption and saving are influenced more strongly by individual-level beliefs
about mortality risk than by group level mortality risk.

I. Introduction
         A significant portion of household wealth is passed from one generation to
another by bequests. According Kotlikoff and Summers (1981), 80% of household wealth
was inherited. Gale and Scholz (1994) estimate that total bequests were $105 billion in
the U.S. in 1986. Hurd and Smith (2002) find that the elderly anticipate leaving roughly
40% of their wealth in bequests. Kotlikoff (1988) asserts that inherited wealth plays an
important and perhaps dominant role in U.S. wealth accumulation. Bequests may hold a
key answer to the social security problem that baby boomers may face: they may
eventually receive significant estates from their parents such that their dependence on
social security may be reduced.
         Predicting whether a large portion of wealth will be passed from one generation to
the next generation requires knowledge of the motives for bequests.2 As pointed out in
the literature (Hamermesh and Menchik 1987; Kotlikoff 1988; Hurd 1989), a large
amount of bequeathed wealth does not necessarily imply a substantial motive for
bequests. Without a well-functioning annuity market, people will have to save against
mortality risk, and the resulting bequests could be involuntary. If most bequests are in
fact involuntary or accidental, the value of the bequeathed wealth may decrease in the
future as the annuity market further develops.3 In addition, it is also possible that people
may change their perceptions of stock market risks after the recent crash of the market. In
that case, more people may move into annuities, and the total amount of bequeathed
wealth will decrease.4
         There is no consensus in the literature on the significance of bequest motives.
Some people (Hamermesh and Menchik, 1987; Bernheim 1987; Kotlikoff and Summers,
1988) argue that the bequest motive is important while others (Hurd 1989) claim that it is
almost zero, and most bequests are accidental or involuntary.


2
  Various incentives for bequest are offered in the literature. Some argue that bequests serve as incentives to
younger generations to provide appropriate care for older generations (Cox 1987; Bernheim, Shleifer and
Summers, 1985). Others argue that bequests are mainly motivated by altruism.

  Poterba (1997) documents that variable annuity premium payments increased by a factor of five during
the period 1988-1993.

  The S&P 500 index peaked on August 2001 at 1517.7. Since then, it has dropped to 879.8 at the end of
2002.

        However, previous analyses have based estimation of the bequest motive on
mortality risk derived from life tables. Yet, an individual’s beliefs or subjective
expectations about future events such as survival should be among the determinants of
economic behaviors such as saving, consumption and investment. It is unlikely that each
individual has the same beliefs as those summarized by a life table so that basing
estimation on a life table could lead to biased estimates of a bequest motive.
        Our main goal in this paper is to investigate the empirical relevance of subjective
survival rates as determinants of consumption, saving and bequests by the older
population. More specifically, we estimate a life cycle model with uncertain lifetime as
developed by Yaari (1965) and Hurd (1989). Instead of applying the commonly used life
tables to approximate individual survival expectations, we adopt the estimated individual
subjective survival curves from Gan, Hurd and McFadden (2003, henceforth GHM).
        Empirical estimates that are based on life-table survival curves are likely to be
biased. For example, consider a typical utility function:
                                                       ct1−γ
                                          u (c t ) =
                                                       1− γ
where ct is the consumption at time t, and is the risk aversion parameter. The first order
condition in a common formulation (without a bequest motive) is:
                           ∆ ln ct ≈ (r + ln β + ∆ ln st ) / γ + f ( X t ) ,
where Xt represents some socio-demographic and/or economic variables, r is the interest
rate, and is the time discount factor. st is the subjective survival probability at time t so
that - lnst is the mortality hazard rate. If st is not measured but it is correlated with Xt, we
have a classic problem of endogeneity when we substitute a life-table measure for ∆ ln st .
If st is measured with error, the parameter estimate of will be biased.
        One way to obtain individual subjective survival probability is to directly ask
respondents about their subjective survival probabilities. Hamermesh (1985) was the first
to investigate how people’s subjective survival probabilities are related to life tables and
what the implications of the subjective probabilities are. Recently, a large panel dataset,
the Asset and Health Dynamics among Oldest Old (AHEAD) collected data on people
who were born between 1890 and 1923 and their spouses (regardless of age) including




                                                   3
information on individuals’ expectations of a wide range of future events.5 Respondents
in the survey are asked about their subjective chances of living to a certain age. Earlier
work, such as Hurd and McGarry (1995, 2002) and GHM have studied the relationship
between subjective probabilities and actual survival rates. These papers have found that,
on average, individual subjective survival probabilities are consistent with life tables,
they vary appropriately with known risk factors and they have predictive power for actual
mortality beyond that contained in a life table. Therefore, there is important information
content in these responses on subjective survival probabilities.
           However, the subjective survival probabilities have serious focal response
problems: many individuals tend to give responses of 0.0 and 1.0. These focal responses
cannot be directly used in analyzing life-cycle models where survival probabilities are
required. To eliminate focal biases, GHM suggest a Bayesian updating method. For each
individual in the AHEAD data set, GHM estimate an “optimism” index. Compared to the
life table survival probability, an individual may overestimate or underestimate his/her
survival probability. The estimated “optimism” indices show significant individual
heterogeneity, and can be applied to derive individuals’ subjective survival probabilities
without focal biases.
           The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce a life-
cycle model with bequests. Our emphasis is on how to estimate such a model. Section 3
presents the estimation results. In particular, Section 3.1 introduces the data that will be
used in the paper. Three key variables are used in the empirical variables: wealth, income
and subjective survival probabilities. In Section 3.2, we present parameter estimates
based on various estimation methods. Section 3.3 calculates the bequest incentives based
on estimates from Section 3.2. In Section 3.4, we conduct out-of-sample predictions and
simulate the consumption and wealth trajectories under various sets of parameter
estimates. Finally, we summarize the results of this paper in Section 4.

II.        The Model
           Our starting point is the standard life-cycle model with bequests as in Yaari (1965)
and Hurd (1989). Let the utility function of a retired individual be:
                              N                       N
                                     β tU (ct )st +          β t B (wt +1 ) mt +1             (1)
                              t =0                    t =0


where st is the subjective probability that the individual will be alive at time t. mt +1 is the

subjective mortality rate at time t + 1: mt +1 = st − st +1 . The subjective maximal number of
periods an individual can survive is N. The time discount factor is denoted as .
Consumption at time t is denoted as ct, and wealth at the beginning of time t is denoted as
wt. The first term in (1) is the present value of utility from consumption conditional on
survival; and the second term in (1) is the present value of the utility from leaving a
bequest of wt+1 conditional dying at t + 1. The utility from a bequest, B(wt+1), is
increasing in wt+1.
           This model only applies to singles. The corresponding model for couples is much
more complicated because it has to account for bequeathing by a couple to the next
generation, and also for providing to a surviving spouse.6
           As in Hurd (1989), we further assume a borrowing constraint such that
bequeathable wealth cannot become negative. The constraint imposed on borrowing
indicates that future Social Security benefits cannot be used as collateral for a
consumption loan. This constraint arises from the fact that all heads of households in the
sample are older than 70 years old in 1993 when the survey started, and in the U.S.,
Social Security benefits cannot be used as collateral. Such a constraint imposes important
boundary condition in our analysis:
                          wt = (1 + r ) wt −1 + At −1 − ct −1 ≥ 0 ,                        (2)

where At −1 is annuity income at time t-1.
           It is typical in this literature to assume a constant risk aversion utility function
U (ct ) = ct1−γ / (1 − γ ) . Income from annuities such as Social Security is assumed to be

    Estimating the couple’s bequest motive is our next research objective.


                                                                5
constant. The marginal utility of a bequest, denoted as , is dependent on how many
children the person has:
                                   ∂B
                 Bw ≡ α ≡             = 1children (α 0 + α 1 * No. of children ) ,                      (3)
                                   ∂w
where 1children is an indicator function. The assumption that the bequest motive exists only
if the person has any children is important to identify the model. Otherwise, the
identification may only come from the functional form assumptions.
        The maximal age that a person may live, denoted as N, is obtained when the
person’s subjective survival rate st < 0.0001. Different agents have different maximum
ages N since their subjective survival rates are different. Given the interest rate r, income
A, and the parameter values of , , and , the paths of wealth are contingent on the initial
wealth w0. The analysis of the solution of the discrete model is similar to that of the
continuous model in Hurd (1989). Here we only state how to estimate the model.
        Estimating the model requires at least two waves of wealth data for each
individual. We use wealth data in wave 2 and wave 3 to estimate the model. The wave 4
wealth data is used for out-of-sample prediction.7 The wealth level in wave 2 serves as
the initial wealth w0. We use backward induction to find the trajectories of the wealth and
consumption. For a given set of parameter values , , and , we can obtain the
trajectories of wealth {wtb , t = 1,                , N + 1} , where the superscript b indicates the value is

calculated from backward induction. We then compare w3b at the trajectory with the
observed wave 3 wealth w3. We use the subscript 3 because in our data set the interval
between the two waves of wealth is 3 years. The parameter set that minimizes the
difference between w3b and w3 are our estimates.
        There are three types of consumptions paths corresponding to low, medium, and
high wealth. We discuss these three different cases in the discrete model:
        (1) In the first case, the bequest is strictly positive even if the individual survives
to the greatest age possible: i.e., wN +1 > 0 . Then the consumption trajectory satisfies:
                                 N
                 c t−γ s t = α          β i −t (1 + r ) i −t mi +1                                       (3a)
                                 i =t


7
 There is good evidence that wave 1 wealth data in AHEAD underestimate financial asset ownership and
hence the value of financial assets, so we do not use wave 1. (Rohwedder, Haider and Hurd, 2004).


                                                                     6
        The consumption trajectory that satisfies (3a), {ct*} , and actually initial wealth, w0,
generate the wealth path

                                                                     (        )
                                                t
                 wt +1 = (1 + r ) t +1 w0 +           (1 + r ) t −i Ai − ci* > 0 .                 (3b)
                                               i =0

        Equation (3a) shows that if the wealth level at N +1 is strictly positive, the
consumption trajectory depends on the subjective survival rate but is independent of
initial wealth w0 . This occurs because the marginal utility from consumption (left-hand-
side) at time t equals the present value of the marginal utility from bequests, which is
assumed to be independent of wealth level. The wealth trajectory, wtb , can be calculated
from the equation (3b), which shows that wealth trajectories vary according to the initial
wealth w0. Figure 1 shows typical consumption and wealth trajectories. Wealth
monotonically increases and consumption monotonically decreases with age, but other
patterns are possible. The only requirement for this case is that wealth is strictly positive
at any time in this person’s life span.
        The minimal level of initial wealth that corresponds to the consumption path (3a)
is w0* , given by:

                                                                         (     )
                                                N
                                       w0* =          (1 + r ) −i −1 ci* − A > 0
                                               i =0


        Any initial wealth larger than w0 > w0* will produce a consumption path {c * } as in

(3a), and will lead to wN +1 > 0 . Note that both N and w0* vary as individual subjective
survival rate varies.
        (2) In the second case, although the bequest is zero at the time of death, (wN+1= 0),
the borrowing constraint is not binding; that is, the wealth level is strictly positive for any
t<N+1. The consumption path satisfies:
                     ct−γ st = β (1 + r )ct−+γ1 st +1 + α mt +1 , for t = 0, 1,             N −1     (4a)
                                                      N
                     wN +1 = (1 + r ) N +1 w0 +              (1 + r )N −i ( Ai − ci ) = 0           (4b)
                                                      i =0


               wt > 0 , for t =1, 2,        N.                                                       (4c)




                                                                 7
       Equation (4b) states that the consumption trajectory should lead to zero wealth
level at time N +1: the person will leave no bequest should he or she live to the greatest
age possible. Figure 2 illustrates one case where wealth reaches zero exactly at the
maximum possible age. Consumption in Figure 2 first increases and then decreases as
mortality risk becomes large. However, it is possible that consumption monotonically
decreases if the time discount factor is small.
       There will be a range of initial wealth and associated consumption paths that
satisfy (4a), (4b) and (4c). The intuition for this result will be discussed when we provide
the estimation algorithm (Step 2 in the algorithm. See Appendix). Let w0* be the largest

of these values so that any value of w0 larger than w0* leads to wN +1 > 0 and the

consumption path will be independent of w0 . Let ŵ0 be the smallest of those values so
that any smaller value of initial wealth causes the wealth to reach 0 before N +1. Let
{cˆ} and {wˆ } be the individual’s consumption and wealth trajectories associated with ŵ0 ,

and {c*} and {w* } be the individual’s consumption and wealth trajectories associated

with w0* . Therefore, in the case of medium wealth, the consumption trajectory must lie

between {cˆ} and {c * } , and the wealth trajectory must lie between {wˆ } and {w* } .
       (3) Lastly, we consider the case that the borrowing constraint is binding. Let T be
the time when bequeathable wealth is exhausted. The consumption path is found from the
solutions to four equations, (5a)-(5d):
        ct = A , for t = T ,       ,N ,                                                   (5a)

        ct−γ st = β (1 + r )ct−+γ1 st +1 + α mt +1 , for t = 0, 1,        T − 2,          (5b)
                                T −1
        wT = (1 + r ) T w0 +           (1 + r )T −1−i ( Ai − ci ) = 0 .                   (5c)
                                i =0


        wt > 0 , for t =1, 2,          T − 1.                                             (5d)
       In this case consumption and wealth will eventually decline. Figure 3 illustrates
possible consumption and wealth trajectories in this case.
       Each individual in our sample has a different subjective survival curve. Therefore,
every individual’s critical value of wealth is different. We search to find out his/her
critical wealth value, and then calculate his/her consumption and wealth trajectories. Our

objective is to find a set parameter values that minimize the difference between the
predicted second wave wealth, w3b , and the observed second wave wealth, w3. We
consider two different objective functions: mean square loss function and the absolute
value loss function.

       The mean square loss function in (6a) is the one used in Hurd (1989). The
absolute value loss function in (6b) corresponds to median regression. The advantage for
median regression over the mean regression is that median regression is robust to outliers.
       We apply the Quasi-Newton method to mean square loss objective function (6a)
and Nelder-Mead Simplex method to absolute value loss objective function (6b). For any
given set of parameters, , , and , we need to find the predicted wave 3 wealth for each
individual. The detailed algorithm to find w3b is given in the Appendix.
       We briefly discuss how to estimate the covariance matrix. Let the parameter set
be denoted as = ( , , )’, and let the covariance matrix be . It is straightforward to
obtain the covariance matrix for estimates based (6a). The covariance matrix from
median regression in (6b) is given by:
                                                                            −1

where f u (0) is the density of the error term u evaluated at 0. The error term u is defined

as u = w3 − w3b . Empirically, we first conduct a non-parametric kernel regression, and

then evaluate the obtained density function at 0 to get f u (0) . The expectation part can be
calculated by sample average. Since no explicit solutions exist for the derivative
∂w3b / ∂δ , numerical derivatives are used in the calculation.




III. Data and Estimation Results

                                                                    9
3.1. Data
       Our data set consists of the second, third and fourth waves of the AHEAD sample.
We do not employ wave 1 data because there is good evidence that the first wave of
AHEAD underreported asset holdings. To select our sample, we use the following sample
selection criteria: (1) Because the model in this paper applies only to singles, our sample
only includes people who are alive and who are singles in both wave 2 and wave 3. (2)
Total wealth or non-housing wealth is non-negative in wave 2 and wave 3. (3) Responses
to the survival probability question in wave 2 are valid. When total wealth is used as one
of the selection criterion, the number of valid observations is 1,903. When we consider
non-housing wealth, the number of observations decreases to 1,752. Among these valid
observations in wave 1 and wave 2, only 1,460 of them are still valid in wave 3.
       Three key variables are used in this paper: household wealth, income, and
individual subjective survival curves. We now discuss these three variables in detail.
       (1) The Wealth and Income Data
       The AHEAD survey is a panel survey of older Americans. The wave 1 survey of
AHEAD was conducted in 1993. The initial sample of AHEAD includes a sample of
people who were 70 years old or more in 1993 (and their spouses regardless of age). The
wave 2 survey was conducted in 1995, and waves 3 and wave 4 were conducted in 1998
and 2000, respectively.
       The AHEAD data set provides more than 10 categories of wealth data. In
household surveys such as AHEAD a relatively large portion of people do not provide
valid responses to all wealth questions (Juster and Smith, 1997; Chand and Gan, 2003).
AHEAD uses a sequence of questions to bracket a wealth item. Although this technique
is very successful in reducing non-response rates, it requires serious effort to impute the
wealth values. Chand and Gan (2002) discuss various imputation methods. The imputed
wealth and income data used in this paper are obtained from Adams et al (2003).
       In Table 1, we list summary statistics of the total wealth and the wealth net of
housing wealth. For each wave of wealth, we list the mean, median, variance, minimum
and maximum values. From Table 1, mean wealth decreases slightly between wave 2 and
wave 3 but decreases significantly between wave 3 and wave 4. Specifically, between
wave 2 and wave 3, mean total wealth decreases 4.5% while non-housing wealth


                                             10
decreases by 2.5%. Between wave 3 and wave 4, mean total wealth declines by 18% and
non-housing wealth declines by 30%. The pattern for median wealth is different from
mean wealth. Between wave 2 and wave 3, median wealth decreased by 14% and 15%
for total wealth and non-housing wealth. However, between wave 3 and wave 4, there
was a slight increase in median total wealth of 5.8%. Non-housing wealth decreased by
6.2% between wave 3 and 4.
       As Table 1 indicates, median wealth is less than half of mean wealth, reflecting
the positive skewness that exists in the asset distribution. More specifically, the median is
respectively 35%, 32% and 48% of mean total wealth in waves 2, 3 and 4 and 20%, 14%,
and 19% of the mean non-housing wealth in waves 2, 3, and 4.
       In Table 2, we list age, the number of children and income. The average age of
respondents in the second wave is 79 years of old. Although heads of households in our
sample have to be at least 72 years in wave 2, their spouses who may be younger are also
included in the sample. The number of people in our sample who are younger than 72
years old is 46 (2.63% of the sample). Among all the people in our sample, 80.2% have
children. The average number of children in our sample is 2.55. One household has 16
children. Second wave income is used as a measure of people’s annuity income. The
mean income level is $18,107 with a large standard deviation of $22,873.
       (2) Individual Subjective Survival Probability
       In this paper, for each individual, we construct two survival curves: the life-table
survival curve and the subjective survival curve. The life-table survival curve is directly
obtained from the life table. The subjective survival curve is obtained from GHM. Here
we briefly describe the subjective survival curve.
       One innovation in two recent surveys (Health and Retirement Study and AHEAD)
is that they include questions about the respondent’s subjective probabilities about events
in the future. In particular, each respondent is asked about his/her perceived probability
of surviving to a target age that is between 10 and 15 years in the future. Although Hurd
and McGarry (1995, 2002) show that on average these subjective probabilities are
generally consistent with life tables, at the individual level, they suffer a serious problem.
In all age groups, a substantial fraction of respondents give responses of 0.0 and 1.0.




                                             11
These responses cannot represent the respondents’ true probabilities. GHM develop a
model to recover each individual’s “true” subjective probability.
          Given the same age and sex, different people may have very different subjective
survival probabilities. Some of the difference may relate to the health and wealth
situations of individuals, some may simply be reflect personality. For each individual in
their data set (AHEAD), GHM estimate an “optimism” index. Compared to the life table
survival probability, an individual may overestimate or underestimate his/her survival
probability. The estimated “optimism” index in GHM shows that significant individual
heterogeneity exist in the AHEAD population. In a simple life cycle model, GHM show
that ignoring individual heterogeneities may result in bias estimates. In this paper, we
apply both the subjective survival probability developed in GHM and the life table
survival probability.
          Four different “optimism” indices were estimated in GHM, representing four
different specifications. In this paper, we use the “unconstrained hazard-scaling” index.8
In particular, let the current age of individual i be a. His subjective survival probability to
age a+t is given by:
                                                              t
                                        sia (t ) = exp −          λia (a + r )dr ,
                                                              0


where     ia(a+t)   is the hazard function at age a+t. Further, let the individual’s life table
hazard be     i0(a+t).   The “unconstrained hazard-scaling” in GHM assumes that:
    ia(a+t)= i i0(a+t)   where   i   is the individual’s optimism index. If          i>1,   this individual is
said to be “pessimistic”; if         i<1,   then this person is “optimistic”. Table 2 has the
summary statistics of the optimism index estimated from responses in wave 2.
          The mean and median of             i   are .659 and .663, respectively. People in this sample
are on average more optimistic about their survival probabilities than the life table
implies. A more optimistic person may save more than a life-table person would do. If we
use an observed sequence of wealth to estimate our model, the estimates based on
subjective survival curves should indicate a lower time discount factor and/or lower
bequest motive than the estimates based on life tables.


8
  We select this index because it has the best predictive power of actual survival experience among all four
indices.


                                                         12
3.2. Estimation Results
        Our main results exclude housing wealth. In principle, at the extreme of very high
transaction costs, it is difficult to change the consumption level of housing.9 Therefore,
holding of housing wealth would simply reflect initial conditions and differences between
the rate of housing appreciation and the general inflation rate. Excluding housing wealth
from bequeathable wealth would give a better idea of the change in desired wealth
holdings than would be found from including housing wealth.10
        In Table 3, we report the estimates of our model using non-housing wealth and
assuming a fixed interest rate r = 0.04. We will test the robustness of our estimates later
by using different interest rates. In Panel (A) of Table 3, we apply median regression to
estimate the model using both subjective and life-table survival curves. Although the
marginal utility of bequests is estimated to be almost zero in both cases, other parameter
estimates vary significantly. Using life-table survival curve yields a higher time discount
rate than using subjective survival curves. This is expected because people subjectively
overestimate their survival probabilities relative to the life table. They behave
accordingly by saving more to prepare for a longer lifespan, rather than valuing future
consumption more than current-period consumption as implied by the estimates based
life-table survival curves.
        Panel (B) in Table 3 lists the estimates when the mean regression method is used.
The marginal utilities of bequest in this panel are much larger than those estimated in
Panel (A), which imply strong bequest motives. Another observation in Panel (B) is that
the time discount factor is estimated to be significantly larger than 1, indicating that
people value future consumption more than current consumption, and that of the time
discount factor is higher when the life table survival curve is used.
        It is important to note that in a life-cycle model of time-varying survival
probabilities, a time discount factor that is larger than 1 does not imply necessarily non-


9
  Indeed, some researchers found very little housing decumulation except at widowing (Venti and Wise,
2004).
10
   For completeness, however, we also estimated the model over total wealth, which includes housing asset.
The results over total wealth actually are very close to those over non-housing wealth. For example, the
estimates over total wealth and subjective survival rates for parameters risk-averse coefficient , time
discount factor , and bequest motive parameter 0, and 1 are 0.9088 (.1066), 0.9468 (.0641), 4.9759e-7
(.00126), 1.0272e-6 (.00075), respectively (standard errors are in parenthesis).


                                                   13
stationary growth in either consumption or wealth. Kocherlakota (1990) shows that it is
possible that people still prefer current consumption to future one even with >1, as long
as output or income grows at a rate that is sufficiently high. Kocherlakota’s discussion is
based on an infinitely lived representative agent. In our model, the individual agent has
constant income levels. From equation (1), even with >1, the rate of consumption
growth will turn negative at the time when the hazard rate - lnst is large enough.
       The empirical reason to have such an unusual time discount factor is that non-
housing wealth during the sample period declined by only 2.5%. Given the constant
interest rate of 4%, matching such a small decrease in wealth requires the individual to
have an incentive to save. This saving incentive has to come from a large time discount
factor. One major drawback, we suspect, is the interest rate we use: the return to capital
investment may not have been 4% during our sample period. However, how to formally
incorporate varying interest rate requires a model of portfolio choice, which is beyond the
scope of this paper.
       In summary, mean regression yields very different parameter estimates from
median regression. More specifically, mean regression suggests very large desired
bequests while the median regression implies almost zero bequest motives. The
difference is undoubtedly due to the large influence of the households at the top of the
wealth distribution when the estimation method is mean regression. Increasing wealth
between the waves among just a few high-wealth households will require a substantial
bequest parameter.
       In Table 4, we list results from median regressions with varying interest rates. The
risk-averse parameters and the time discount factor are very close to the reference value
when interest rate changes from .02 to .06. Within this range of interest rates the marginal
utility of bequests is very small.
       In the following section, we will try to understand the economic significance of
the bequest motive by some simulation exercises.


3.3 Bequest Simulations
       Among the four parameters we estimate, it is relatively easy to understand the
economic significance of the risk-aversion parameter and the time discount factor . To


                                            14
understand the effect of and on bequests, consider a familiar consumption growth
equation in the absence of the bequest motive: ∆ ln ct ≈ (r + ln β + ∆ ln st ) / γ . Given the

survival rate st and the risk-aversion parameter , a larger will increase algebraically the
slope of the consumption path and because of the lifetime budget constraint, initial
consumption will have to be reduced. Thus more wealth will be held and so bequests will
increase. Although the effect of the time discount factor on bequests is clear, the effect
of the risk-averse parameter on bequests is ambiguous. When the consumption path is
decreasing a larger will increase algebraically the slope of the consumption path
causing more wealth to be held and increasing bequests. When the consumption path is
increasing a larger will flatten the consumption path causing initial consumption to be
higher but later consumption to be lower. Therefore, the total effect on bequests or wealth
holdings for is ambiguous. It is important to note that a change in bequests because of a
change in either or is a change in accidental bequest.
        A non-accidental bequest is measured by the marginal utility of bequests. The
larger the values of the , the larger is the bequest motive.
        Two methods measure the economic significance of marginal utility of bequest, :
                                (1 + r ) −t [wˆ t (αˆ ) − wˆ t (0)]mt                    (8a)

                                [wˆ t (αˆ ) − wˆ t (0)] st                               (8b)

where αˆ ≡ 1children (αˆ 0 + αˆ 1 ⋅ No of children ) . In (8a) and (8b), wˆ t (αˆ ) is the optimal wealth

trajectory given initial wealth and the estimated values of parameters. The term wˆ t (0) is
defined in a similar way except that the marginal utility of bequests is zero. Equation (8a)
and (8b) represent two different ways to understand the effect of bequests. In (8a), we
calculate the present value of the increase in bequests due to a bequest motive. In (8b),
we calculate the population difference in wealth holdings with and without a bequest
motive. In Table 5, we calculate the effect of a bequest motive for a particular individual:
a male at age 79 whose initial wealth is $35,000 and whose income is $12,000. The
individual has two children. The optimism index of this individual is 0.6594.
        The results in Table 5 are presented in three different panels, grouped by their
estimation methods. In the first three rows, (R1)-(R4), we let the marginal utility of


                                                         15
bequests vary. In particular, row (R1) corresponds to a bequest motive estimated from
(A1) in Table 3 where subjective mortality risk is used. We let the time discount factor
vary in rows (R5)-(R7), and let the risk averse parameter vary in rows (R8)-(R10). The
marginal utility of bequest parameter has a significant impact on the level of desired
bequests and on the difference in wealth holdings. In rows (R1)-(R4) where the risk
aversion parameter ( ) and the time discount factor ( ) are estimated using the median
regression, the desired bequest rises from almost zero to $125,278 and the difference in
wealth holding increases from $1 to $1,082,618 when the marginal utility of bequests
increases from 2.47E-06 to 1. The effect of varying the marginal utility of bequests on
desired bequests and on wealth holdings is very large. When the marginal utility of
bequests is 1, the consumption path decreases slowly, from $1,211 at age 79 to $1,013
age 109, which implies that the agent saves 90% - 95% of annuity income ($12,000). In
contrast, when the marginal utility of bequests takes the value from median regression
with subjective mortality risk, the consumption path drops quickly, from $21,766 at age
79 to the annuity level of $12,000 at age 86. The large bequest parameters are from the
mean regression. While they may describe well the changes in population wealth
holdings between waves, they do not describe well the behavior of a typical person as in
our example. We take this example as additional evidence that the median regression is
more appropriate for describing the behavior of most households.
       In rows (R5)-(R7), we allow the time discount factor to vary while keeping the
risk aversion parameter constant. The marginal utility of bequests is constant at 0.001. In
this case, desired bequests increase from $2.58 to $1,408 when the time discount factor
increases from 0.7 to 1.3. The result that a larger time discount factor is related to a
higher desired bequest is consistent with the prior discussion. Finally, in rows (R8)-(R10),
we consider the effect of the risk aversion parameter . A larger implies a more risk
averse agent. When increases from 0.5 to 2.0, the desired bequest increases from $5.80
to $518.5.
       In summary, simulation results show that a higher marginal bequest motive, larger
time discount factor, and larger risk aversion parameter all increase the level of desired
bequests. But there are important interaction effects: when the bequest parameter is




                                              16
large, say 0.001, a modest increase in the discount factor or in risk aversion can lead to a
large increase in desired bequests and in differences in wealth holdings.


3.4 Consumption/Wealth Trajectory and Out-of-Sample Predictions:
       A typical way to evaluate parameter estimates from different methods is to
conduct out-of-sample predictions. We used wealth data in wave 2 and wave 3 to obtain
parameter estimates. We will now use the estimated parameters to predict the wealth
values in wave 4, and compare the predicted wealth to observed wealth in wave 4. Table
6 has the comparison results using various criteria. Each column in Table 6 reports results
based on a given set of parameter estimates. The columns numbered A1, A2, B1, or B2
correspond to the estimates listed in Panel A and Panel B in Table 3. These estimates
differ in their estimation method and their survival probabilities. The out-of-sample
calculation is based on the same survival probability as the parameter estimates are. For
example, if the set of parameters is obtained based on subjective survival probability, the
out-of-sample calculation is also based on the subjective survival probability.
       Parameter estimates in Columns (A1) and (A2) are from median regressions while
Column (B1) and (B2) are from mean regressions. From the first panel in Table 6, (A1)
and (A2) have smaller absolute errors and smaller mean square errors than (B1) and (B2),
regardless of error types. Furthermore, (A1) and (A2) have a lower sum of absolute errors
for low wealth people and a larger sum of absolute errors for high wealth people than (B1)
and (B2). This is expected because mean square regressions tend to fit high-wealth
observations better because the large wealth values are magnified by the square operation.
       Results in Table 6 can also be used to evaluate the advantage of using subjective
survival probabilities instead of life-table survival probabilities. When median
regressions are used, parameter estimates based on subjective survival probabilities (A1)
produce lower sums of mean square errors and lower sums of absolute errors in out-of-
sample prediction of wealth than estimates based on life-table survival curves. In
particular, the mean square errors and the absolute errors from subjective survival curves
are 42% and 5% less than the corresponding errors from life-table survival curves.
       The second and the third panel in Table 6 report comparison results based on
predicted mean and predicted median. Although predicted means using both survival


                                             17
curves are lower than the observed mean at wave 4, the mean ($87,033) from subjective
survival curves is much closer to the observed mean ($118,112) than the mean ($71,413)
from life-table survival curves. Further, we divide the sample into four quartiles
according to the wealth level at wave 3, and compare the predicted and observed means
in each quartile. In the fourth panel in Table 6, using subjective survival curves produces
better predictions than using life-table survival curves in all four quartiles. At the first
quartile, the predicted mean using subjective survival curves is $8.6 while the predicted
mean using life table is $2,385. The observed means at wave 4 is $-1,548. At the second
quartile, the predicted mean from subjective survival curves is $7,947, which is much
closer to the observed mean ($9,091) than the predicted mean from life table ($2,385).
Similar patterns are observed for the third and fourth quartiles.
        When the mean regression method is used, parameter estimates based on
subjective survival curves do not have a significant advantage in predicting fourth wave
wealth comparing to ones based on life-table survival curves. However, based on either
subjective or life-table survival probabilities, the mean regression method produces much
larger mean square errors and absolute errors than median regressions. From these results,
we conclude that median regression is better than mean regression, and subjective
survival probabilities better describe individual saving and bequest decisions than the
life-table survival probabilities.
        Finally, to better understand how people’s consumption and wealth vary, we
apply estimates from Table 3 to simulate a hypothetical person’s consumption and wealth
trajectories in Figure 2. The hypothetical person we consider is: single male at age 79
with an optimistic index of .6594. He has two children. His initial wealth and income are
assumed at the median values in Table 2. In addition, the parameter set for Figure 2 is
obtained from the median regression in Table 3. His consumption level is highest when
he starts at age 79, and decreases until he reaches age 85. His wealth decreases and
reaches zero at age 85. Above age 85, the person’s wealth keeps reaches zero and his
consumption equals to his annuity income at $12,000. If the person dies before age 85, he
leaves some bequest. However, such bequest is accidental since his bequest motive is
essentially zero. In all these cases, since the person values future utility lower than




                                              18
current utility, his consumption level peaks at the first year and then decreases until it
reaches his annuity income level.


IV. Conclusions
       Our main goal in this paper is to estimate a classical life-cycle model with
bequests, based on individual-specific subjective survival curves. In almost any life-cycle
model, individual mortality risk is an important factor that affects people’s decisions.
Previous literature assumes that individual mortality risk is the same as life-table
mortality risk, ignoring any individual heterogeneity in mortality risk. This assumption
may cause biases in parameter estimates. This paper applies the individual subjective
survival probability model developed in an earlier paper (GHM). Subjective survival
probabilities have significant variations across individuals, and provide explanatory
power for actual survival experience beyond life tables. We find that using subjective
survival curves produces much better out-of-sample predictions than using life-table
survival curves, suggesting that people’s consumption and saving decisions are consistent
with beliefs about their own mortality risk. In addition, we find that bequest motives are
very small, indicating that most bequests are involuntary or accidental.

the maximum age of life, i.e., wN+1 > 0.

         (2) Substitute the trajectory of consumption {ctb , t = 0,        N } into Equation (3b) to

get the wealth trajectory {wtb , t = 1,     , N + 1} .

         (3) If for all t ∈ {1, 2,    , N } , wtb ≥ 0 and w N +b1 > 0 , then report w3b and go to next
observation; else go to Step 2.

         Step 2: Check the medium wealth case, in which the wealth at the end of
maximum age of life is zero, i.e., wN+1 = 0, and at all other time periods t < N, wt > 0. We
use backward induction to get the consumption and wealth trajectories.
         (1) From (4a), ct (t = 0, …, N -1) is a function of cN by recursive iteration: ct =
ct(cN). Substitute the trajectory of consumption {ct(cN), t = 0, …, N -1} into Equation (4b)
such that wealth level in (4b) now is only a function of cN . In particular, we have:
                   wN +1 (c N , w0 ) = 0                                                       (A1)

         Given observed w0, we can solve (A1) to get cN, denoted as c Nb . Given c Nb , we can

apply (4a) to iteratively find out {ctb , t = 0,     , N − 1}. However, if we do not know w0, we
will have many values of cN and w0 such that (A1) are satisfied. Among them, the higher
bound w0* is the maximum of w0 such that (A1) is satisfied and ct > 0 for all t < N+1; the

lower bound ŵ0 is the smallest w0 such that (A1) is satisfied and ct > 0 for all t < N+1.

         (2) If for all t ∈ {0, 1,    , N }, ctb > 0 , then calculate the wealth trajectory

{wtb , t = 1,   , N } from Equation (2); else go to Step 3.

         (3) If for all t ∈ {1, 2,    , N } , wtb > 0 , then report w3b and go to next observation;
else go to Step 3.




                                                    20
         Step 3: Check the low wealth case, in which the wealth reaches zero at a time
period T < N. We search all over the possible T from the backward. The method is similar
to Step 2.
         (1) Let T = N. From (5b), ct (t = 0, …, T -2) is a function of cT-1 by recursive
iteration: ct = ct(cT-1). Substitute the trajectory of consumption {ct(cT-1), t = 0, …, T -2}
into Equation (5c) such that (5c) now is only a function of cT-1 . Solve the equation: wT=
0 to get cT-1, denoted as cTb −1 . We can get the consumption trajectory {ctb , t = 0,     , N } by

applying (5b) with given cTb −1 .

         (2) If for all t ∈ {0, 1,   , T − 1}, ctb > 0 , then calculate the wealth trajectory

{wtb , t = 1,   , T − 1} from Equation (2); else let T = T-1, and repeat (1) - (2).

         (3) If for all t ∈ {1, 2,   , T − 1}, wtb > 0 , then break from the cycle, report w3b and
go to next observation; else let T = T -1, and repeat (1) - (3).
