                                         ABSTRACT

To date, little is known about the evolution of market power for the economies around the world.
We extract data from the financial statements of over 70,000 firms in 134 countries, and we
analyze and document the evolution of markups over the last four decades. We show that the
average global markup has gone up from close to 1.1 in 1980 to around 1.6 in 2016. Markups
have risen most in North America and Europe, and least in emerging economies in Latin America
and Asia. We discuss the distributional implications of the rise in global market power for the
labor share and for the profit share.

    Competition is essential for a well-functioning economy. In the absence of competitive
pressure, firms grab market power which in turn allows them to sell goods at higher prices.
Market power naturally leads to redistribution of resources from workers and consumers to
the owners of firms: the profit share is higher, while the labor share to workers is lower and
the goods are sold at higher prices to consumers. Market power also has welfare effects: due
to higher prices, consumption is lower and a suboptimal number of consumers is priced out of
the market (Harberger (1954)), and market power stifles innovation and investment (Aghion,
Bloom, Blundell, Griffith, and Howitt (2005)).
    A precise measure of market power is crucial for numerous policy decisions, from taxa-
tion and redistribution to antitrust enforcement. While for antitrust policy, knowledge of mar-
ket power in a narrowly defined market may be sufficient, redistributive policies require such
knowledge for the entire economy. In an integrated and globalized world, we need informa-
tion on market power for the whole world. Just like climate change, redistributive policies
increasingly require a globally coordinated policy response. Here we present measures of mar-
ket power in the aggregate – for countries, regions and up to the entire world – as well as at the
finest granular level – with one measure for each firm.
    Despite its central importance in evaluating the health of an economy, little is known about
the evolution of market power in virtually all economies, let alone at the global level. The two
most commonly used methods to measure market power – 1. the so called demand approach,
and 2. direct measures of concentration such as the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) – are
not conducive to analyzing market power economy wide.
    To study market power, we need to estimate markups, the ratio of the price to the marginal
cost of production. For the estimation of markups, academic researchers typically rely on the
demand method (Bresnahan (1989), Berry, Levinsohn, and Pakes (1995)). This is a well-tested
and reliable way to measure markups. However, it requires not only detailed information
on transactions (prices and quantities), as well as assumptions on how firms compete and in
which market they compete. Due to these demanding data requirements, to date markups
have only been obtained for short periods of time and for specific industries for which such
detailed information is available, e.g. cars (Berry, Levinsohn, and Pakes (1995)), breakfast cereal
(Nevo (2001)), beer (Koujianou Goldberg and Hellerstein (2012)), and a variety of other retail
products. Because the required data is not available for all goods and industries, this method
cannot be used to obtain estimates economy-wide, let alone to document the evolution over
several decades for the global economy.
    While policy makers in anti-trust enforcement sometimes use the estimates from the de-
mand approach that academics prefer, they most often calculate measures of concentration,
most notably the HHI. For some market structures such as Cournot quantity competition, the
HHI is a direct indicator of market power. However, this holds only as long as products are per-
ceived as identical to all consumers. When products are differentiated (for example brands of
cars, such as Volkswagen and Land Rover), there is no longer a relation between concentration
and market power (see Bresnahan (1989)). In a world with increasingly differentiated prod-
ucts, the HHI is not an adequate measure of market power. In addition, these concentration


                                                2
measures require precise knowledge of what constitutes a market in terms of the geographical
location as well as the product definition. Does Procter & Gamble compete against Unilever in
the US market for all personal care products, or do they compete in the market for soap in the
Cleveland, OH with the specific products Olay against Dove? Finally, because concentration
measures are calculated at the market level, determining the market power of one firm requires
data on the universe of all firms in the market. If some firms are missing, the firm’s measure of
market power is biased. While there is progress in obtaining data on the universe of firms, the
definition of a market will always be ambiguous and susceptible to subjective interpretation.
More importantly, products are increasingly differentiated, and as a result, concentration ratios
as a proxy for market power will always remain contentious.
     Instead, we use the cost-based method, originally developed in Hall (1988) for aggregate
data and more recently adapted for applications to micro data (De Loecker and Warzynski
(2012)), and the calculation of aggregate average markups (De Loecker and Eeckhout (2017)).
With this method, we do not need to make any assumptions on the competitive behavior of
firms nor do we need to be able to define a market. Because the amount of information required
is less stringent, we can extract all necessary information from the financial statements of firms.
This allows us to construct a database of markup estimates for a long time series and aggregate
them to the entire economy. This database contains estimates of markups for each individual
firm, one for every year. Based on firm-level markups, we then construct a weighted average
markup for the entire global economy, as well as for any country, or region.
     We estimate markups using data on individual firms’ financial statements. Because finan-
cial accounting practices around the world are very diverse, we need to rely on uniform defi-
nitions and standardized statements. Ideally, we require a large enough sample of firms with
information on a long time series in order to document the evolution of markups over the last
decades, while covering a broad geographical coverage.
     Each firms’ financial statements includes the Income Statement, the Balance Sheet, and the
Cash Flow. This allows us to extract a measure of variable costs (cost of goods sold), a measure
of the overhead cost (selling, general and administrative costs), of capital expenditure, as well
as the firm’s sales. We also obtain information on some of the firms’ wage bill as well as the
dividends and the stock market valuation. We extract the data from the Worldscope dataset1
which contains standardized financial statements for over 70,000 companies worldwide. Data
coverage starts in 1980 and spans 134 countries. The individual companies tend to be large
and consist mainly of publicly traded, though there are also privately held firms. While there
is a genuine concern about the representativeness of the sample, in De Loecker and Eeckhout
(2017) we have found for the United States that the rise in market power occurs in all sec-
tors. Moreover, there we find similar results when using Census weights based on the entire
universe of companies, and not just the publicly listed firms. In the Appendix, we report a
robustness exercise where we weigh the firms’ markups by their country’s or continent’s share
of GDP rather than the firm’s sales share and find that the pattern of markups is similar.

     To implement the cost based method, we start from a conventional production technology
for a firm i at time t, denoted by Qit = Ωit Vitαit Kitβit . The technology represents the units output
produced Qit , where Vit is the variable input (labor, intermediate inputs, electricity,...), Kit is
capital, Ωit is Total Factor Productivity. While overhead costs affect profits, they are assumed
not to be a factor of production (for the estimation of production technologies with overhead
costs as a factor of production, see De Loecker and Eeckhout (2017)). Then the Lagrangian of the
firm’s profit maximization problem is written as PitV Vit + PitK Kit − λit (Ωit Vitαit Kitβit − Qit ), where
Pit is the output price, PitV , PitK are the input prices, λit is the Lagrangian multiplier, and Qit is
a constant. Under the assumption that variable factors of production can be adjusted without
frictions, the firms optimally adjusts the variable input immediately. We can then derive the
markup from the firm’s static optimization problem. The first order condition of this profit
maximization problem is PitV − λit αit Ωit Vitαit −1 Kitβit = 0. We define the firm’s markup µit as Pλitit ,
the ratio of the output price to the marginal cost. The marginal cost is measured by the shadow
value λit of the Lagrangian. Then after multiplying by Pit Vit , rearranging, and substituting for
Qit , the markup can be written as:
                                                       Pit Qit
                                              µit = αit V      .                                         (1)
                                                       Pit Vit
    The implementation of this approach has two steps. First, we estimate the output elasticity
αst for each sector and year (a sector s is defined by a two digit NAICS code). We thus assign
to all firms i in a sector s in a year t a common elasticity. The interpretation is that firms in the
same sector have access to the same technology, yet they differ in TFP (Ωit ) and of course the
optimally chosen input. In what follows we use the elasticity estimates from De Loecker and
Eeckhout (2017) for the United States.2 Second, we use the information on Sales (Pit Qit ) and
expenditure on variable inputs (Cost of Goods Sold PitV Vit ), to derive a firm’s markup.

   Those elasticities are sector-specific and time-varying. The underlying assumption in our approach is that firms
and therefore countries vary in their TFP and the chosen inputs, but not in the technology Q.

    This generates a database with 745,958 firm-year markup observations, for 67,491 distinct
firms in 134 countries, over the period 1980-2016.3 With those individual markups, we calculate
the average annual markup of any geographical area denoted by G, such as a country, a region
or continent, or the entire world. The average markup is the sales-weighted average of all
firms’ individual markup in the geographical area G in a given year.4

   In Figure 1 we report the evolution of markups for the world as a whole. Globally, since 1980
there has been a steady rise from a markup of around 1.1 to a markup of 1.6 in 2016. Observe
the steady rise in the first two decades (1980s and 1990s), and the virtually flat evolution in
2000s. In the last few years, there has again been a sharp increase.

                          Figure 2: The Change of the Global Distribution of Markups

    Because we have the markup for each of the firms, we can investigate the change in the
distribution. From Figure 2a, it is evident that the the increase in the average markup is due
to an increase in both the variance as well as the mode of the distribution. Most importantly,
we observe the fattening of the upper tail. And while the values of the higher percentiles have
increased substantially, there is little change at or below the median. Even in 2016, most firms
have markups that are relatively low. But in contrast, substantially more firms now have rel-
atively high markups.5 Figure 2b shows yet another way to analyze this distributional shift,
with the contour plot for all firms in 1980 and in 2016. The mass of the distribution is dis-
proportionately above the forty-five degree line which confirms that on average, firms have
higher markups in 2016. Moreover, below the diagonal the density is steep (the contour lines
are close together), and more spread out above the diagonal. This shows that the distribution
of markups now has a fatter tail. Consider a firm with a markup of 1 in 1980 for example by
drawing a vertical line through 1. By 2016, the distribution of markups is on average above the
forty-five degree line, and the upper tail is less steep.
   3
       We drop observations with missing data, and adjust for measurement error (2 % winsorization).
   4
       Formally, the average markup is µGt = i∈G SSit µit , where S Gt = i∈G Sit .
                                            P                           P
                                                    Gt
   5
   To the extent that markups are related to firm size, this fattening of the tail has important implications for
aggregate uncertainty. See Gabaix (2011).

    The breakdown of the evolution of markups in different regions of the world is documented
in Figure 3. The evolution of markups is comparable in Europe, North America, Asia and Ocea-
nia, with an increase from around 1 – 1.2 to 1.5 – 1.7, or an increase of about 0.4 – 0.6. With some
minor variation, these four regions are in line with the evolution of global markups. Instead,
in the emerging economies of South America the average markup is flat or even decreasing,
though it has been high from the start of the data availability. In Africa, the markup increases
sharply around 2000 and then drops, but is otherwise fairly flat.

    One interesting artifact of the global average markup and the four regions that have a sim-
ilar pattern is the fact that markups are flat in the decade starting in 2000. Until well after
the great recession, there is virtually no change in the average markup. In Europe and North
America, there is then a sharp increase again in the second decade of the millennium.6
    Table 1 shows the evolution of markups for a selection of individual countries (the Figures
in the Appendix show the pattern graphically for each country). The first column reports the
value of the average markup in 2016, and the second column reports the change between 1980
and 2016. Within each geographical region, we rank countries by the change in markup. While
   6
     This is consistent with some recent studies (Weche and Wambach (2018) and Calligaris, Criscuolo, and Marcolin
(2017)) that find little change in average markups for the beginning of the millennium. They use a alternative data
sources that cover that period only.

the pattern that emerges in the aggregate, both globally and for the regions, is the amalgama-
tion of each of the constituent countries, there is considerable variation across countries. Most
European economies have seen steep increases, particularly Denmark, Switzerland and Italy.
Except for Portugal, which had a modest decline in markups, the other European countries all
show an increase in markups that is in line with the overall trend.

  Difference between markup in 2016 and 1980. If the first observation (1980) is missing, we extrapolate
linearly.

    The pattern of the NAFTA countries Canada and United States, is very much aligned,
though the US started 20 points above Canada. Instead, Mexico has experienced a much more
modest increase, though it has had a high markup from the start.
    The evolution of the emerging economies of South America is more mixed. The average for
the region is flat, while Argentina and Colombia see an increase similar to the global average.
Instead, Venezuela and especially Chile see a substantial decrease. The economies of Peru and

Brazil are invariant.
    On average, Asia experiences a more modest increase than the global average, and it ex-
hibits some diversity within the region. South Korea has the biggest increase. The emerging
economies of Taiwan, Turkey, China and the Philippines experience a decrease in their aver-
age markups. The decrease in markups in China is consistent with recent evidence by Brandt,
Van Biesebroeck, Wang, and Zhang (2017) on the effect of trade liberalization on markups.
They find that China’s entry in the WTO in 2001 and the resulting lowering of tariffs has lead
to a decline in markups.
    Finally, the economies in Oceania experience an increase in line with the global average,
exemplified by Australia. New Zealand sees less of an increase. In Africa, the overall increase
is more moderate, and its largest economy, South Africa, has a modest change.

    In broad lines, markups are increasing across the board, in all continents. It appears that
the more developed economies tend to have bigger increases in markups whereas some of
the emerging market economies see a decline. The world map in Figure 4 summarizes the
geographic dimension of the markup in 2016. Most developed economies have moderately
high markups, with some high levels in Europe for Denmark, Belgium and Italy for example.
Those in emerging economies in Asia, Africa and Latin America are more mixed, with both
the highest levels (such as Russia, Bolivia and several African countries), as well as the lowest
levels (such as India and several African countries). In Figure B.1 in the Appendix we report
the change in the markup. We see there that the developed economies have experienced an
increase, while the experience of the emerging economies with already high levels of markup
was more mixed.

   High markups have efficiency implications, quantified in the deadweight loss (Harberger
(1954)). Because of high prices, marginal consumers choose not to buy. In addition, high
markups have distributional implications. Firms with high markups demand fewer variable
inputs. Due to higher prices, demand for the output falls, and as a result, the quantity produced

declines. As a result, the demand for inputs such as labor decreases. This follows immediately
from inspection of our expression for the markup in equation (1), which we can rewrite as
 VV
Pit  it
Pit Qit= αµitit . The expenditure share on variable inputs on the left-hand side is inversely related
to the markup. One such a variable input is Labor, Vit = Lit with wage wit = PitV , and as a
result, the labor share PwititQ
                              Lit
                                it
                                   – the ratio of the expenditure on labor over sales – is decreasing as
markups increase.
    Unfortunately, the information on the labor share in our data is not available for all firms to
draw conclusions. Because in many countries it is not mandatory to report the total wage bill,
we have that information for few firm-year pairs only. Moreover, the set of firms for which the
data is available is highly selective7 and therefore we cannot use the available data to analyze
the relation between markups and the labor share.
    We can however confirm the negative relation using aggregate data collected by Karabar-
bounis and Neiman (2014) on the labor share in 59 countries. In Figure 5b we plot their measure
of the global labor share together with the inverse of our measure the global markup. These two
series co-move, as predicted by the inverse relation between the labor share and the markup.

     A second distributional implication of high markups is the effect on profits. In our setup
and assuming the variable input is labor V = L, profits Π are given by Πit = Pit Qit − wit Lit −
PitK Kit − Fit . Then, after dividing by sales Pit Qit , we obtain that the profits share πit = PitΠQ
                                                                                                    it

With market power, the labor share declines, and in the long run so does the capital share. As
a result, either the profit share increases or the share of fixed costs PitFQ
                                                                            it

have reliable measures for the cost of capital that are comparable across the 134 economies.

        Until 2002, few firms report the wage bill and after 2002, the data remains a highly unbalanced panel.



                                                                                                     9
However, our data has detailed information on the market value of the firms. Because the
market valuation of a firm is the discounted sum of all future profits (or dividends), we can
use the market valuation relative to sales as a measure of the stock of profits. In Figure 5b, we
report the evolution of the global average of the market valuation as a share of sales, which
tracks that of the global markup. In the period when markups rise in the 1980s and 1990s, we
see a similar trend in this measure of firm profitability. From the 2000s, the average market
value share of sales is noisy but with no particular trend. In current decade starting in 2010,
markups rise again as does the average market value as a share of sales.

Standard Errors (in parentheses) clustered at the firm level.

    The positive relation at the aggregate level depicted in Figure 5b originates in the tight
relationship at the firm level between the share of market value and the markup. In Table 2
(columns (1) and (2)) we report the strong positive relation between the market value share
and markups. This establishes that higher markups lead to higher profits, and that they are not
driven by higher overhead costs. This further confirms the fact that the increase in markups
brings about a distributional change with more of the surplus going to the owners of the firms
and less to the workers.

                    Figure C.1: Global Markup: Weighted by GDP and by Firm Sales (Benchmark)

   One of the concerns about our data is that firms in some countries and continents are dis-
proportionally represented compared to actual economic activity as measured by GDP. If firms
from Europe and North America are overrepresented and firms in Africa are underrepresented,
then the global markup estimate will disproportionately reflect the markup of Europe and
North America. In order to adjust for the possible bias of a non-representative sample of firms,
we weigh the markup of each geographical region (a continent or a country) by their share in
global GDP,8 instead of by the firms’ sales share in the total sales of all firms in the world. In
  8
      We use GDP data from the IMF.


                                                                          13
Figure C.1 we plot the average global markup obtained weighted with the continents’ GDP
(C.1a) and the countries’ (C.1b) weights together with the average markup obtained with the
sales weights from the firms in our sample, as in Figure 1. The pattern of the GDP weighted
markups in both figures is remarkably close to the benchmark, except in the early 1980s. This
indicates that, except in the early years, there is no systematic bias in the markup measures.
    To get a better understanding, in Figure C.2 we plot the GDP shares over time for every
continent together with the sales shares of the firms in the continent. Both track each other
closely in all 6 regions, except for the early 1980s when North America is overrepresented, and
Europe.

                    Figure C.2: Share of each continent: firm sales (baseline) and GDP.

    We perform the same robustness using countries as the unit of observation for which we
use GDP weights, and we plot the country-weighted global markup alongside the unweighted
in Figure C.1b.
