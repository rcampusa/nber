                                            ABSTRACT

Why are people in the richest countries of the world so much richer today than 100 years ago? And
why are some countries so much richer than others? Questions such as these define the field of economic
growth. This paper documents the facts that underlie these questions. How much richer are we today
than 100 years ago, and how large are the income gaps between countries? The purpose of the paper
is to provide an encyclopedia of the fundamental facts of economic growth upon which our theories
are built, gathering them together in one place and updating the facts with the latest available data.

     “[T]he errors which arise from the absence of facts are far more numerous
     and more durable than those which result from unsound reasoning respect-
     ing true data.” — Charles Babbage, quoted in Rosenberg (1994), p. 27.




     “[I]t is quite wrong to try founding a theory on observable magnitudes alone...
     It is the theory which decides what we can observe.” — Albert Einstein,
     quoted in Heisenberg (1971), p. 63.




   Why are people in the United States, Germany, and Japan so much richer today than
100 or 1000 years ago? Why are people in France and the Netherlands today so much
richer than people in Haiti and Kenya? Questions like these are at the heart of the study
of economic growth.
   Economics seeks to answer these questions by building quantitative models — mod-
els that can be compared with empirical data. That is, we’d like our models to tell
us not only that one country will be richer than another, but by how much. Or to
explain not only that we should be richer today than a century ago, but that the growth
rate should be 2 percent per year rather than 10 percent. Growth economics has only
partially achieved these goals, but a critical input into our analysis is knowing where
the goalposts lie — that is, knowing the facts of economic growth.
   The goal of this paper is to lay out as many of these facts as possible. Kaldor (1961)
was content with documenting a few key stylized facts that basic growth theory should
hope to explain. Jones and Romer (2010) updated his list to reflect what we’ve learned
over the last 50 years. The purpose of this paper is different. Rather than highlighting
a handful of stylized facts, we draw on the last thirty years of the renaissance of growth
economics to lay out what is known empirically about the subject. These facts are
updated with the latest data and gathered together in a single place. The hope is that
they will be useful to newcomers to the field as well as to experts. The result, I hope, is
a fascinating tour of the growth literature from the perspective of the basic data.
   The paper is divided broadly into two parts. First, I present the facts related to the
growth of the “frontier” over time: what are the growth patterns exhibited by the richest
countries in the world? Second, I focus on the spread of economic growth throughout

the world. To what extent are countries behind the frontier catching up, falling behind,
or staying in place? And what characteristics do countries in these various groups
share?



1. Growth at the Frontier

We begin by discussing economic growth at the “frontier.” By this I mean growth among
the richest set of countries in any given time period. During the last century or so, the
United States often serves as a stand in for the frontier, and we will follow this tradition.


1.1. Modern Economic Growth

Figure 1 shows one of the key stylized facts of frontier growth: For nearly 150 years,
GDP per person in the U.S. economy has grown at a remarkably steady average rate of
around 2 percent per year. Starting at around $3,000 in 1870, per capita GDP rose to
more than $50,000 by 2014, a nearly 17-fold increase.
                          THE FACTS OF ECONOMIC GROWTH                               3


   Beyond the large, sustained growth in living standards, several other features of this
graph stand out. One is the significant decline in income associated with the Great
Depression. However, to me this decline stands out most for how anomalous it is. Many
of the other recessions barely make an impression on the eye: over long periods of
time, economic growth swamps economic fluctuations. Moreover, despite the singular
severity of the Great Depression — GDP per person fell by nearly 20 percent in just four
years — it is equally remarkable that the Great Depression was temporary. By 1939, the
economy is already passing its previous peak and the macroeconomic story a decade
later is once again one of sustained, almost relentless, economic growth.
   The stability of U.S. growth also merits some discussion. With the aid of the trend
line in Figure 1, one can see that growth was slightly slower pre-1929 than post. Table 1
makes this point more precisely. Between 1870 and 1929, growth averaged 1.76 per-
cent, versus 2.23 percent between 1929 and 2007 (using “peak to peak” dates to avoid
business cycle problems). Alternatively, between 1900 and 1950, growth averaged 2.06
percent versus 2.16 percent since 1950. Before one is too quick to conclude that growth
rates are increasing, however, notice that the period since 1950 shows a more mixed
pattern, with rapid growth between 1950 and 1973, slower growth between 1973 and
1995, and then rapid growth during the late 1990s that gives way to slower growth more
recently.
   The interesting “trees” that one sees in Table 1 serves to support the main point
one gets from looking at the “forest” in Figure 1: steady, sustained exponential growth
for the last 150 years or so is a key characteristic of the frontier. All modern theories
of economic growth — Solow (1956), Lucas (1988), Romer (1990), Aghion and Howitt
(1992), for example — are designed with this fact in mind.
   The sustained growth in Figure 1 also naturally raises the question of whether such
growth can and will continue for the next century. On the one hand, this fact more than
any other helps justify the focus of many growth models on the balanced growth path,
a situation in which all economic variables grow at constant exponential rates forever.
And the logic of the balanced growth path suggests that the growth can continue indefi-
nitely. On the other hand, as we will see, there are reasons from other facts and theories
to question this logic.

1.2. Growth over the Very Long Run

While the future of frontier growth is surely hard to know, the stability of frontier growth
suggested by Figure 1 is most certainly misleading when look back further in history.
As shown in Figure 2, sustained exponential growth in living standards is an incredibly
recent phenomenon. For thousands and thousands of years, life was, in the evocative
language of Thomas Hobbes, “nasty, brutish, and short.” Only in the last two centuries
has this changed, but in this relatively brief time, the change has been dramatic.1
    Between the year 1 C.E. and the year 1820, living standards in the “West” (mea-
sured with data from Western Europe and the United States) essentially doubled, from
around $600 per person to around $1200 per person, as shown in Table 2. Over the
next 200 years, however, GDP per person rose by more than a factor of twenty, reaching
$26,000.
    The era of modern economic growth is in fact even more special than this. Evidence
suggests that living standards were comparatively stagnant for thousands and thou-
sands of years before. For example, for much of pre-history, humans lived as simple

     Papers that played a key role in documenting and elaborating upon this fact include Maddison (1979),
Kremer (1993), Maddison (1995), Diamond (1997), Pritchett (1997), and Clark (2001). This list neglects a
long, important literature in economic history; see Clark (2014) for a more complete list of references.

hunters and gatherers, not far above subsistence. From this perspective — say for the
last 200,000 years or more — the era of modern growth is spectacularly brief. It is the
economic equivalent of Carl Sagan’s famous “pale blue dot” image of the earth viewed
from the outer edge of the solar system.
   Table 2 reveals several other interesting facts. First and foremost, over the very long
run, economic growth at the frontier has accelerated — that is, the rates of economic
growth are themselves increasing over time. Romer (1986) emphasized this fact for
living standards as part of his early motivation for endogenous growth models. Kremer
(1993) highlighted the acceleration in population growth rates, dating as far back as
a million years ago, and his evidence serves as a very useful reminder. Between 1
million B.C.E. and 10,000 B.C.E., the average population growth rate in Kremer’s data
was 0.00035 percent per year. Yet despite this tiny growth rate, world population in-
creased by a factor of 32, from around 125,000 people to 4 million. As an interesting
comparison, that’s similar to the proportionate increase in the population in Western
Europe and the United States during the past 2000 years, shown in Table 2.
   Various growth models have been developed to explain the transition from stag-
nant living standards for thousands of years to the modern era of economic growth.
A key ingredient in nearly all of these models is Malthusian diminishing returns. In
                               THE FACTS OF ECONOMIC GROWTH                                        7


particular, there is assumed to be a fixed supply of land which is a necessary input in
production.2 Adding more people to the land reduces the marginal product of labor
(holding technology constant) and therefore reduces living standards. Combined with
some subsistence level of consumption below which people cannot survive, this ties
the size of the population to the level of technology in the economy: a better technology
can support a larger population.
    Various models then combine the Malthusian channel with different mechanisms
for generating growth. Lee (1988), Kremer (1993), and Jones (2001) emphasize the
positive feedback loop between “people produce ideas” as in the Romer models of
growth with the Malthusian “ideas produce people” channel. Provided the increasing
returns associated with ideas is sufficiently strong to counter the Malthusian dimin-
ishing returns, this mechanism can give rise to dynamics like those shown in Figure 2.
Lucas (2002) emphasizes the role of human capital accumulation, while Hansen and
Prescott (2002) focus on a neoclassical model that features a structural transformation
from agriculture to manufacturing. Oded Galor, with his coauthors, has been one of
the most significant contributors, labeling this literature “unified growth theory.” See
Galor and Weil (2000) and Galor (2005).



2. Sources of Frontier Growth

The next collection of facts related to economic growth are best presented in the con-
text of the famous growth accounting decomposition developed by Solow (1957) and
others. This exercise studies the sources of growth in the economy through the lens
of a single aggregate production function. It is well-known that the conditions for an
aggregate production function to exist in an environment with a rich underlying mi-
crostructure are very stringent. The point is not that anyone believes those conditions
hold. Instead, one often wishes to look at the data “through the lens of” some growth
model that is much simpler than the world that generates the observed data. A long
list of famous papers supports the claim that this is a productive approach to gaining
knowledge, Solow (1957) itself being an obvious example.
   2
     I have used this assumption in my models as well, but I have to admit that an alternative reading
of history justifies the exact opposite assumption: up until very recently, land was completely elastic —
whenever we needed more, we spread out and found greener pastures.

      While not necessary, it is convenient to explain this accounting using a Cobb-Douglas
specification. More specifically, suppose final output Yt is produced using stocks of
physical capital Kt and human capital Ht :


                                         Yt = At Mt Ktα Ht1−α                           (1)
                                              | {z }
                                                   TFP

where α is between zero and one, At denotes the economy’s stock of knowledge, and Mt
is anything else that influences total factor productivity (the letter “M” is reminiscent
of the “measure of our ignorance” label applied to the residual by Abramovitz (1956)
and also is suggestive of “misallocation,” as will be discussed in more detail later). The
next subsection provides a general overview of growth accounting for the United States
based on this equation, and then the remainder of this section looks more closely at
each individual term in equation (1).


2.1. Growth accounting

It is traditional to perform the growth accounting exercise with a production function
like (1). However, that approach creates some confusion in that some of the accumu-
lation of physical capital is caused by growth in total factor productivity (e.g. as in a
standard Solow model). If one wishes to credit such growth to total factor productivity,
it is helpful to do the accounting in a slightly different way.3 In particular, divide both
sides of the production function by Ytα and solve for Yt to get

                                                            α
                                                    Kt       1−α
                                         Yt =                      Ht Zt                (2)
                                                    Yt

                          1
where Zt ≡ (At Mt ) 1−α is total factor productivity measured in labor-augmenting units.
Finally, dividing both sizes by the aggregate amount of time worked, Lt , gives

                                                           α
                                        Yt         Kt       1−α    Ht
                                           =                          · Zt              (3)
                                        Lt         Yt              Lt

In this form, growth in output per hour Yt /Lt comes from growth in the capital-output
ratio Kt /Yt , growth in human capital per hour Ht /Lt , and growth in labor-augmenting
  3
      Klenow and Rodriguez-Clare (1997), for example, takes this approach.
                          THE FACTS OF ECONOMIC GROWTH                               9


TFP, Zt . This can be seen explicitly by taking logs and differencing equation (3). Also,
notice that in a neoclassical growth model, the capital-output ratio is proportional the
the investment rate in the long-run and does not depend on total factor productivity.
Hence the contributions from productivity and capital deepening are separated in this
version, in a way that they were not in equation (1).
   The only term we have yet to comment on is Ht /Lt , the aggregate amount of human
capital divided by total hours worked. In a simple model with one type of labor, one can
think of Ht = ht Lt , where ht is human capital per worker which increases because of
education. In a richer setting with different types of labor that are perfect substitutes
when measured in efficiency units, Ht /Lt also captures composition effects. The Bu-
reau of Labor Statistics, from which I’ve obtained the accounting numbers discussed
next, therefore refers to this term as “labor composition.”
   Table 3 contains the growth accounting decomposition for the United States since
1948, corresponding to equation (3). Several well-known facts emerge from this ac-
counting. First, growth in output per hour at 2.5 percent is slightly faster than the
growth in GDP per person that we saw earlier. One reason is that the BLS data measure
growth for the private business sector, excluding the government sector (in which there
is zero productivity growth more or less by assumption). Second, the capital-output
ratio is relatively stable over this period, contributing almost nothing to growth. Third,
labor composition (a rise in educational attainment, a shift from manufacturing to
services, and the increased labor force participation of women) contributes 0.3 per-
centage points to growth. Finally, as documented by Abramovitz, Solow, and others,
the “residual” of total factor productivity accounts for the bulk of growth, coming in at
2.0 percentage points, or 80 percent of growth since 1948.
   The remainder of Table 3 shows the evolution of growth and its decomposition over
various periods since 1948. We see the rapid growth and rapid TFP growth of the 1948–
1973 period, followed by the well-known “productivity slowdown” from 1973 to 1995.
The causes of this slowdown are much debated but not convincingly pinned down, as
suggested by the fact that the entirety of the slowdown comes from the TFP residual
rather than from physical or human capital; Griliches (1988) contains a discussion of
the slowdown.
   Remarkably, the period 1995–2007 sees a substantial recovery of growth, not quite to

the rates seen in the 1950s and 1960s, but impressive nonetheless, coinciding with the
dot-com boom and the rise in the importance of information technology. Byrne, Oliner
and Sichel (2013) provide a recent analysis of the importance of information technology
to growth over this period and going forward. Lackluster growth in output per hour
since 2007 is surely in large part attributable to the Great Recession, but the slowdown
in TFP growth (which some such as Fernald (2014) date back to 2003) is troubling.4


2.2. Physical capital

The fact that the contribution of the capital-output ratio was modest in the growth
accounting decomposition suggests that the capital-output ratio is relatively constant
over time. This suggestion is confirmed in Figure 3. The broadest concept of physical
capital (“Total”), including both public and private capital as well as both residential
   4
    There are a number of important applications of growth accounting in recent decades. Young (1992)
and Young (1995) document the surprisingly slow total factor productivity growth in the East Asian miracle
countries. Krugman (1994) puts Young’s accounting in context and relates it to the surprising finding
of early growth accounting exercises that the Soviet Union exhibited slow TFP growth as well. Klenow
and Rodriguez-Clare (1997) conduct a growth accounting exercise using large multi-country data sets and
show the general importance of TFP growth in that setting.

and non-residential capital, has a ratio of 3 to real GDP. Focusing on non-residential
capital brings this ratio down to 2, and further restricting to private non-residential
capital leads a ratio of just over 1.
   The capital stock is itself the cumulation of investment, adjusted for depreciation.
Figure 4 shows nominal spending on investment as a share of GDP back to 1929. The
share is relatively stable for much of the period, with a notable decline during the last
two decades.
   In addition to cumulating investment, however, another step in going from the
(nominal) investment rate series to the (real) capital-output ratio involves adjusting for
relative prices. Figure 5 shows the price of various categories of investment, relative to
the GDP deflator. Two facts stand out: the relative price of equipment has fallen sharply
since 1960 by more than a factor of 3 and the relative price of structures has risen since
1929 by a factor of 2 (for residential) or 3 (for non-residential).
   A fascinating observation comes from comparing the trends in the relative prices
shown in Figure 5 to the investment shares in Figure 4: the nominal investment shares

are relatively stable when compared to the huge trends in relative prices. For example,
even though the relative price of equipment has fallen by more than a factor of 3 since
1960, the nominal share of GDP spent on equipment has remained steady.
      The decline in the fall of equipment prices has featured prominently in parts of
the growth literature; for example, see Greenwood, Hercowitz and Krusell (1997) and
Whelan (2003). These papers make the point that one way to reconcile the facts is
with a two sector model in which technological progress in the equipment sector is
substantially factor that technological progress in the rest of the economy — an as-
sumption that rings true in light of Moore’s Law and the tremendous decline in the
price of a semiconductors. Combining this assumption with Cobb-Douglas production
functions leads to a two-sector model that is broadly consistent with the facts we’ve laid
out. A key assumption in this approach is that better computers are equivalent to hav-
ing more of the old computers, so that technological change is, in a rough sense, capital
(equipment)-augmenting. The Cobb-Douglas assumption ensures that this non-labor
augmenting technological change can coexist with a balanced growth path and delivers
a stable nominal investment rate.5



2.3. Factor Shares

One of the original Kaldor (1961) stylized facts of growth was the stability of the shares
of GDP paid to capital and labor. Figure 6 shows these shares using two different data
sets, but the patterns are quite similar. First, between 1948 and 2000, the factor shares
were indeed quite stable. Second, since 2000 or so, there has been a marked decline in
the labor share and a corresponding rise in the capital share. According to the data from
the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the capital share rose from an average value of 34.2%
between 1948 and 2000 to a value of 38.7% by 2012. Or in terms of the complement, the
labor share declined from an average value of 65.8% to 61.3%.
      It is hard to know what to make of the recent movements in factor shares. Is this a
temporary phenomenon, perhaps amplified by the Great Recession? Or are some more
deeper structural factors at work? Karabarbounis and Neiman (2014) document that
the fact extends to many countries around the world and perhaps on average starts

  5
    This discussion is related to the famous Uzawa theorem about the restrictions on technical change
required to obtain balanced growth; see Schlicht (2006) and Jones and Scrimgeour (2008).

even before 2000. Other recent papers looking at this question include Elsby, Hobijn
and Şahin (2013), and Bridgman (2014).
   A closely-related fact is the pattern of factor shares exhibited across industries within
an economy and across countries. Jones (2003) noted the presence of large trends, both
positive and negative, in the 35 industry (2-digit) breakdown of data in the United States
from Dale Jorgenson. Gollin (2002) suggests that factor shares are uncorrelated with
GDP per person across a large number of countries.


2.4. Human capital

The other major neoclassical input in production is human capital. Figure 7 shows a
time series for one of the key forms of human capital in the economy, education. More
specifically, the graph shows educational attainment by birth cohort, starting with the
cohort born in 1875.

  Note: The blue line shows educational attainment by birth cohort from Goldin and Katz (2007).
  The green line shows average educational attainment for the labor force aged 25 and over from the
  Current Population Survey.




   Two facts emerge. First, for 75 years, educational attainment rose steadily, at a rate
of slightly less than one year per decade. For example, the cohort born in 1880 got just
over 7 years of education, while the cohort born in 1950 received 13 years of educa-
tion on average. As shown in the second (green) line in the figure, this translated into
steadily rising educational attainment in the adult labor force. Between 1940 and 1980,
for example, educational attainment rose from 9 years to 12 years, or about 3/4 of a year
per decade. With a Mincerian return to education of 7 percent, this corresponds to a
contribution of about 0.5 percentage points per year to growth in output per worker.
   The other fact that stands out prominently, however, is the levelling-off of edu-
cational attainment. For cohorts born after 1950, educational attainment rose more
slowly than before, and for the latest cohorts, educational attainment has essentially
flattened out. Over time, one expects this to translate into a slowdown in the increase
of educational attainment for the labor force as a whole, and some of this can perhaps
be seen in the last decade of the graph.

  Note: The supply of U.S. college graduates, measured by their share of total hours worked, has
  risen from below 20 percent to more than 50 percent by 2012. The U.S. college wage premium
  is calculated as the average excess amount earned by college graduates relative to non-graduates,
  controlling for experience and gender composition within each educational group. Source: Autor
  (2014), Figure 3.




   Figure 8 shows another collection of stylized facts related to human capital made
famous by Katz and Murphy (1992). The blue line in the graph shows the fraction of
hours worked in the U.S. economy accounted for by college-educated workers. This
fraction rose from less than 20 percent in 1963 to more than 50 percent by 2012. The
figure also shows the college wage premium, that is the excess amount earned by col-
lege graduates over non-graduates after controlling for experience and gender. This
wage premium averaged around 50 percent between 1963 and the early 1980s but then
rose sharply through 2012 to peak at nearly 100 percent. Thus, even though the supply
of college graduates was growing rapidly, the wage premium for college graduates was
increasing sharply as well.
   Katz and Murphy (1992) provide an elegant way to understand the dynamics of
the college wage premium. Letting “coll” and “hs” denote two kinds of labor (“college
graduates” and “high school graduates”), the human capital aggregate that enters pro-
   18                                  CHARLES I. JONES



duction is given by a CES specification:


                           H = ((Acoll Lcoll )ρ + (Ahs Lhs )ρ )1/ρ                   (4)


An increase in the supply of college graduates lowers their marginal product, while
an increase in the technology parameter Acoll raises their marginal product. Katz and
Murphy (1992) show that with an elasticity of substitution of around 1.4, a constant
growth rate of Acoll /Ahs , which Katz and Murphy call “skill-biased technical change,”
together with the observed movements in Lcoll /Lhs can explain the time series for the
college wage premium.
   Human capital includes more than just education, of course. Workers continue to
accumulate skills on the job. This human capital shows up as higher wages for workers,
but separating this into a quantity of human capital and a price per unit of human
capital requires work. One simple approach is to assume each year of work experience
leads to a constant increase in human capital, and this approach is commonly pursued
in growth accounting. Examples of richer efforts to measure human capital in a growth
setting include Lucas (2009), Lucas and Moll (2014), and Manuelli and Seshadri (2014).




2.5. Ideas

Our next set of facts relate to the economy’s stock of knowledge or ideas, the A in
the production function that we began with back in equation (1). It has long been
recognized that the “idea production function” is hard to measure. Where do ideas
come from? Part of the difficulty is that the answer is surely multidimensional. Ideas
are themselves very heterogeneous, some clearly arise through intentional research,
but others seem to arrive by chance out of seemingly nowhere. Confronted with these
difficulties, Solow (1956) modeled technological change as purely exogenous, but this
surely goes too far. The more people there are searching for new ideas, the more likely
it is that discoveries will be made. This is true if the searching is intentional, as in
research, but even if it is a byproduct of the production process itself as in models
of learning by doing. The production of new ideas plays a fundamental role in the
modern understanding of growth; see Romer (1990), Grossman and Helpman (1991),

       With this in mind, Figure 9 shows spending on research and development, as a
share of GDP, for the United States. These data can now be obtained directly from the
National Income and Product Accounts, thanks to the latest revisions by the Bureau of
Economic Analysis. The broadest measure of investment in ideas recorded by the NIPA
is investment in “intellectual property products.” This category includes traditional
research and development, spending on computer software, and finally spending on
“entertainment,” which itself includes movies, TV shows, books, and music.
       Several facts stand out in Figure 9. First, total spending on investment in intellectual
property products has rise from less than 1 percent of GDP in 1929 to nearly 5 percent
of GDP in recent years. This overall increase reflects a large rise in private research and
development and a large rise in software and entertainment investment, especially dur-

ing the last 25 years. Finally, government spending on research and development has
been shrinking as a share of GDP since peaking in the 1960s with the space program.
   Figure 10 provides an alternative perspective on R&D in two dimensions. First, it
focuses on employment rather than dollars spent, and second it brings in an interna-
tional perspective. The figure shows the number of researchers in the economy as a
share of the population.7
   Each of the three measures in the figure tells the same story: the fraction of the
population engaged in R&D has been rising in recent decades. This is true within the
United States, within the OECD, and even if we incorporate China and Russia as well.
   It is important to appreciate a significant limitation of the R&D data shown so far.
In particular, these data only capture a small part of what an economist would call
research. For example, around 70% of measured R&D occurs in the manufacturing

industry. Only 18 million workers (out of U.S. employment that exceeds 130 million)
were employed by firms that do any R&D in 2012.8 According to their corporate filings,
Walmart and Goldman-Sachs report doing zero R&D.
      So far, we have considered the input side of the idea production function. We now
turn to the output side. Unfortunately, the output of ideas is even harder to measure
than the inputs. One of the more commonly-used measures is patents, and this mea-
sure is shown in Figure 11.
      On first glance, it appears that patents, like many other variables reviewed in this
essay, have grown exponentially. Indeed, at least since 1980 one sees a very dramatic
rise in the number of patents granted in the United States, both in total and to U.S.
inventors. The difference between these two lines — foreign patenting in the U.S. —
is also interesting, and one testimony to the global nature of ideas is that 56 percent of
patents granted by the U.S. patent office in 2013 were to foreigners.
      A closer look at Figure 11, though, reveals something equally interesting: the num-

ber of patents granted to U.S. inventors in 1915, 1950, and 1985 was approximately the
same. Put another way, during the first 85 years of the 20th century, the number of
patents granted to U.S. residents appears to be stationary, in sharp contrast to the dra-
matic increase since 1985 or so. Part of the increase since the 1980s is due to changes in
patent policy, including extending patent protection to software and business models
and changes in the judicial appeals process for patent cases (Jaffe and Lerner, 2006).
      Griliches (1994) combined these two basic facts related to ideas (rapid growth in the
inputs, stable production of patents) to generate a key implication: the productivity of
research at producing patents fell sharply for most of the 20th century. Kortum (1997)
developed a growth model designed to match these facts in which he emphasized that
patents can be thought of as proportional improvements in productivity. If each patent
raises GDP by a constant percent, then a constant flow of new patents can generate a
constant rate of economic growth. The problem with this approach (or perhaps the
problem with the patent data) is that it breaks down after 1980 or so. Since 1980, the
number of patents has risen by more than a factor of four, while growth rates are more
or less stable. The bottom line is that the idea production function remains something
of a black box perhaps precisely because we do not have great measures of ideas or the
inputs used to produce them.9



2.6. Misallocation

The organizing principle for this section of the paper is the production function given
back in equation (1). In specifying that production function, I broke total factor pro-
ductivity into two pieces: the stock of ideas, A, and everything else, which I labeled
“M” either for the “measure of our ignorance” or for “misallocation.” It is this latter
interpretation that I wish to take up now.
      One of the great insights of the growth literature in the last 15 years is that misal-
location at the micro level can show up as a reduction in total factor productivity at a
more aggregated level. This insight appears in various places, including Banerjee and
Duflo (2005), Chari, Kehoe and McGrattan (2007), Restuccia and Rogerson (2008) and
Hsieh and Klenow (2009).

  9
   Examples of progress include Caballero and Jaffe (1993), Acemoglu, Akcigit, Bloom and Kerr (2013),
and Akcigit, Celik and Greenwood (2014b).
                            THE FACTS OF ECONOMIC GROWTH                           23


   The essence of the insight is quite straightforward: when resources are allocated
optimally, the economy will operate on its production possibilities frontier. When re-
sources are misallocated, the economy will operate inside this frontier. But that is just
another way of saying that TFP will be lower: a given quantity of inputs will produce
less output.
   As we explain in detail in the second part of this paper (in Section 4.6.), there is a
large literature on misallocation and development — this is our best candidate answer
to the question of why are some countries so much richer than others. There is much
less discussion of the extent to which misallocation is related to frontier growth, the
subject at hand.
   While it is clear conceptually that even the country or countries at the frontier of
growth can suffer from misallocation and that changes in misallocation can contribute
to growth, there has been little work quantifying this channel. Indeed, my own working
hypothesis for many years was that this effect was likely small in the United States in
the last 50 years. I now believe this is wrong.
   Hsieh, Hurst, Jones and Klenow (2013) highlight a striking fact that illustrates this
point: in 1960, 94 percent of doctors and lawyers were white men; by 2008, this fraction
was just 62 percent. Given that innate talent for these and other highly-skilled profes-
sions is unlikely to differ across groups, the occupational distribution in 1960 suggests
that a large number of innately talented African Americans and white women were not
working in the occupations dictated by comparative advantage. The paper quantifies
the macroeconomic consequences of the remarkable convergence in the occupational
distribution between 1960 and 2008 and finds that 15 to 20 percent of growth in ag-
gregate output per worker is explained by the improved allocation of talent. In other
words, declines in misallocation may explain a significant part of U.S. economic growth
during the last 50 years.
   Examples to drive home these statistics are also striking. Sandra Day O’Connor
— future Supreme Court Justice — graduated third in her class from Stanford Law
School in 1952. But the only private sector job she could get upon graduation was as
a legal secretary (Biskupic, 2006). Closer to our own profession, David Blackwell, of
contraction mapping fame, was the first African American inducted into the National
Academy of Sciences and the first tenured at U.C. Berkeley. Yet despite getting his Ph.D.
       24                                  CHARLES I. JONES



at age 22 and obtaining a post-doc at the Institute for Advanced Studies in 1941, he
was not permitted to attend lectures at Princeton and was denied employment at U.C.
Berkeley for racial reasons. He worked at Howard University until 1954, when he was
finally hired as a full professor in the newly-created statistics department at Berkeley.10
       Another potential source of misallocation is related to the economics of ideas. It
has long been suggested that knowledge spillovers are quite significant, both within
and across countries. To the extent that these spillovers are increasingly internalized
or addressed by policy — or to the extent that the opposite is true — the changing
misallocation of knowledge resources may be impacting economic growth.11
       As one final example, Hsieh and Moretti (2014) suggest that spatial misallocation
within the United States may be significant. Why is it that Sand Hill Road in Palo Alto
has Manhattan rents without the skyscrapers? Hsieh and Moretti argue that land use
policies prevent the efficient spatial matching of people to land and to each other. They
estimate that places like Silicon Valley and New York City would be four to eight times
more populous in the efficient allocation.
       Quantifying these and other types of misallocation affecting frontier growth is a
fruitful direction for future research.


2.7. Explaining the Facts of Frontier Growth

While this essay is primarily about the facts of economic growth, it is helpful to step
back and comment briefly on how multiple facts have been incorporated into our mod-
els of growth.
       The basic neoclassical growth framework of Solow (1956) and Ramsey (1928) / Cass
(1965) / Koopmans (1965) has long served as a benchmark organizing framework for
understanding the facts of growth. The nonrivalry of ideas, emphasized by Romer
(1990), helps us understand how sustained exponential growth occurs endogenously. I
review this contribution and some of the extensive research it sparked in Jones (2005).12

     For evidence on knowledge spillovers, see Griliches (1992), Coe and Helpman (1995), Jones and
Williams (1998), Klenow and Rodriguez-Clare (2005), and Bloom, Schankerman and Reenen (2013).
  12
     Romer’s insights are expanded upon in various directions. Aghion and Howitt (1992) and Grossman
and Helpman (1991) emphasize the important role of creative destruction. Jones (1995), Kortum (1997),
and Segerstrom (1998) clarify the way in which nonrivalry interacts with population growth to explain
sustained growth in living standards.

mium are looked at together in Krusell, Ohanian, Rios-Rull and Violante (2000). That
paper considers a setting in which equipment capital is complementary to skilled labor,
so that the (technologically-driven) decline in the price of equipment is the force of
skill-biased technological change. That paper uses a general CES structure. One of the
potential issues in that paper was that it could lead to movements in the labor share.
But perhaps we are starting to see those in the data.
   The presence of trends in educational attainment and research investment opens
up interesting opportunities for future research. Why are educational attainment and
the share of labor devoted to research rising over time? What are the implications
of these trends for future growth? Restuccia and Vandenbroucke (2013) suggest that
skill-biased technological change is itself responsible for driving the rise in educational
attainment. Acemoglu (1998) considers the further interaction when the direction of
technological change is endogenous. Jones (2002) considers the implication of the
trends in education and research intensity for future growth, suggesting that these trends
have substantially raised growth during the last 50 years above the economy’s long-run
growth rate.




3. Frontier Growth: Beyond GDP

The next collection of facts related to frontier growth look beyond the aggregate of GDP.
These facts are related to structural change (the decline of agriculture and the rise of
services, especially health), changes in leisure and fertility, rising inequality, and falling
commodity prices.



3.1. Structural Change

Figure 12 shows one of the most dramatic structural changes affecting frontier economies
over the last two hundred years and beyond: the decline of agriculture. In 1840, about
two out of every three workers in the U.S. economy worked in agriculture. By 2000,
this share had fallen to just 2.4 percent. Similar changes can be seen in value-added in
agriculture as a share of GDP as well as in other countries. For example, the chart also
shows agriculture’s share of employment in Japan, declining from 85 percent around

1870.13
    The structural transformation has several other dimensions and connections in the
growth literature. For example, the decline in agriculture is first associated with a rise
in manufacturing, which is ultimately replaced by a rise in services, including health
and education; more on this below.
    Another form of structural transformation that has seen renewed interest is the
possibility that machines (capital) may substitute for labor. Autor, Levy and Murnane
(2003) look at detailed occupational classifications to study the impact of computeri-
zation on labor demand. They emphasize a polarization, with computerization being
particularly substitutable for routine cognitive tasks that can be broken into specific
rules but complementary to nonroutine, cognitive tasks. That is, computers substitute
for bank tellers and low-level secretaries, while increasing the demand for computer
programmers and leaving untouched manual jobs like janitorial work. Brynjolfsson

     The literature on structural transformation and economic growth is surveyed by Herrendorf, Rogerson
and Valentinyi (2014). More recent contributions include Boppart (2014) and Comin, Lashkari and
Mestieri (2015), who emphasize demand systems with heterogeneous income effects.

and McAfee (2012) highlight broader ramifications of artificial intelligence, whereby
computers might start driving cars, reading medical tests, and combing through troves
of legal documents. That is, even many tasks thought to be cognitive and not easily
routinized may be subject to computerization. What impact will such changes have on
the labor market?
      The answer to this question is obviously complicated and the subject of ongoing
research.14 One useful reference point is the enormous transformation that occurred
as the agricultural share of the U.S. labor force went from 2/3 to only 2 percent, largely
because of mechanization and technological change. There is no doubt that this had
a transformative affect on the labor market, but by and large this transformation was
overwhelmingly beneficial. That’s not to say that it must be that way in the future, but
the example is surely worth bearing in mind.


3.2. The Rise of Health

A different structural transformation has been predominant during the last 50 years:
the rise of health spending as a share of GDP. Figure 13 shows this fact for the United
States and for several other OECD countries. In the United States, the health share more
than tripled since 1960, rising from 5 percent in 1960 to 17 percent in recent years. Large
trends are present in other countries as well, with the share in France, for example rising
from under 4 percent to nearly 12 percent.
      Hall and Jones (2007) propose that the widespread rise in the prominence of health
care is a byproduct of economic growth. With standard preferences, the marginal utility
of consumption declines rapidly. This is most easily seen for CRRA preferences in which
the intertemporal elasticity of substitution is below one, in which case flow utility is
bounded. As we get richer and richer, the marginal utility of consumption on any given
day declines rapidly; what people really need are more days of life to enjoy their high
level of consumption. Hence there is an income effect tilting spending toward life-
saving categories.
      One of the few time series related to economic growth that does not grow exponen-
tially is life expectancy, where the increases tend to be arithmetic rather than exponen-
tial. Figure 14 shows life expectancy at birth and at age 65 in the United States. Life

expectancy at birth increased rapidly in the first half of the 20th century, thanks to im-
provements in public health and large declines in infant mortality. Since 1950, the rate
of improvement has been more modest, around 1.8 years per decade. The figure also
shows that the rise in life expectancy occurs at old ages. Life expectancy conditional on
reaching age 65 has risen by just under one year per decade since 1950.15 Interestingly,
the mortality rate itself seems to grow exponentially with age, a phenomenon known as
the Gompertz-Makeham Law; see Dalgaard and Strulik (2014).


3.3. Hours Worked and Leisure

A standard stylized fact in macroeconomics is that the fraction of the time spent work-
ing shows no trend despite the large upward trend in wages. The next two figures show
that this stylized fact is not really true over the longer term, although the evidence is
  15
    Nordhaus (2003) and Murphy and Topel (2006) discuss the rise in life expectancy and the economic
returns to reducing mortality in more detail. Oeppen and Vaupel (2002) suggest that “record life
expectancy” (i.e. the maximum life expectancy across countries) has grown linearly at 2.5 years per decade
for more than 150 years.

somewhat nuanced.
   Figure 16 shows average annual hours worked per person engaged in work from
the Penn World Tables, which takes its data in turn from the Total Economy Database
of the Conference Board. Among advanced countries, annual hours worked has fallen
significantly since 1950. Average hours worked in the United States, for example, fell
from 1909 in 1950 to 1704 in 2011. In France, the decline is even more dramatic, from
2159 to 1476. The decline starts slightly later in Japan after their recovery from World
War II, with hours falling from 2222 in 1960 to 1706 in 2011.
   Figure 16 breaks the U.S. evidence down into more detail, courtesy of Ramey and
Francis (2009). First, the figure shows the split between men and women. Average
weekly hours of market work by men fell sharply between 1900 and 1980, before lev-
eling off. In contrast, market work by women has been on an upward trend. Ramey
and Francis (2009) also use time diaries to estimate home production, and this is where
the story gets more complicated. As men are substituting away from market work, they
are also substituting into home production. Home production by men rose from just 4

then, was much smaller than the decline in market hours suggests.


3.4. Fertility

The facts we have presented thus far in this section — the decline in agriculture and
the rise in services like health, the rise in life expectancy, the decline in hours worked
— are all consistent with a particular kind of income effect. As people get richer, the
marginal utility of consumption falls and people substitute away from consumption
and toward actions that conserve on the precious time endowment. Time is the one
thing that technological progress cannot create!
   The next fact on fertility raises interesting questions about this hypothesis. In par-
ticular, Figure 17 shows the large decline in fertility dating back at least to 1800, known
as the demographic transition. Since 1800, the birth rate has fallen from 5.5 percent
in the United States and 3.3 percent in France down to less than 1.5 percent in recent
years.
   In dynastic models like Barro and Becker (1989), in which having more children is

essentially a way of increasing one’s own effective lifetime or time endowment, there
is a force that tends to raise fertility, at least if income effects dominate substitution
effects. But instead, we see strong declines in fertility in the data. A large literature
seeks to understand the declines in fertility and the hump-shape in population growth
that are together known as the demographic transition. A key part of the standard
explanation is that children are themselves time intensive, in which case conserving
on children also conserves on time as people get richer.16


3.5. Top Inequality

One of the more famous facts documented during the last decade is shown in Figure 18.
This is the top income inequality graph of Piketty and Saez (2003). In both the United
States and France, the share of income earned by the top 0.1 percent of households
was around 9 percent in 1920, and in both countries the share declined sharply until

coming).

the 1950s to around 2 percent. It stayed at this low level until around 1980. But then a
very large difference emerged, with top income shares rising in the U.S. to essentially
the same level as in 1920, while the share in France remains relatively low. Much of the
decline in the first part of the century is associated with capital income, and much of
the rise in U.S. inequality since 1980 is associated with labor (and business) income.17
    It is also worth stepping back to appreciate the macroeconomic consequences of
this inequality. Figure 19 merges the Piketty-Saez top inequality data with the long-
run data on GDP per person for the United States shown at the start of this paper in
Figure 1. In particular, the figure applies the Piketty-Saez inequality shares to average
GDP per person to produce an estimate of GDP per person for the top 0.1% and the
bottom 99.9%.18
  17
     Possible explanations for this pattern are discussed by Castaneda, Diaz-Gimenez and Rios-Rull (2003),
Cagetti and Nardi (2006), Atkinson, Piketty and Saez (2011), Benhabib, Bisin and Zhu (2011), Aoki and Nirei
(2013), Jones and Kim (2014), Piketty (2014), Piketty, Saez and Stantcheva (2014), and Saez and Zucman
(2014).
  18
     It is important to note that this estimate is surely imperfect. GDP likely does not follow precisely the
same distribution as the Adjusted Gross Income data that forms the basis of the Piketty-Saez calculations:
health benefits are more equally distributed, for example.

   Two key results stand out. First, until recently, there is surprisingly little growth in
average GDP per person at the top: the value in 1913 is actually lower than the value in
1977. Instead, all the growth until around 1960 occurs in the bottom 99.9%. The second
point is that this pattern changed in recent decades. For example, average growth in
GDP per person for the bottom 99.9% declined by around half a percentage point,
from 2.3% between 1950 and 1980 to only 1.8% between 1980 and 2007. In contrast,
after being virtually absent for 50 years, growth at the top accelerated sharply: GDP
per person for the top 0.1% exhibited growth more akin to China’s economy, averaging
6.86% since 1980. Changes like this clearly have the potential to matter for economic
welfare and merit the attention they’ve received.

3.6. The Price of Natural Resources

This next fact is very different from what we’ve been discussing, but it is one of the
more surprising facts related to frontier growth. Figure 20 shows the real price of indus-
trial commodities, consisting of an equally-weighted basket of aluminum, coal, copper,
lead, iron ore, and zinc, deflated by the consumer price index. During the 20th century,
world demand for these industrial commodities exploded with the rise of the automo-
bile, electrification, urbanization, and the general industrialization that occurred in the
United States and around the world. The surprise shown in the figure is that the real
price of these commodities declined over the 20th century. Moreover, the magnitude
of the decline was large — a factor of 5 between the year 1900 and 2000. Evidently,
some combination of increased discoveries and technological changes led the effective
supply to grow even faster than enormous rise in demand.19

 19
      This fact has been noted before, for example by Simon (1981).
      36                                      CHARLES I. JONES



      Also striking, though, is the large increase in the real price of these commodities
since 2000. Part of the explanation could be the rapid growth of China and India over
this period and the large increase in demand for commodities that their growth en-
tailed. Interestingly, we will see later that many developing countries performed quite
well in the 2000s. Some of that growth contributed to the rise in demand for commodi-
ties, but some of that success may also reflect commodity-driven growth resulting from
the rise in demand from China and India.



4. The Spread of Economic Growth

Up until now, we’ve been primarily concerned with the growth of the frontier: what are
the facts about how the frontier is moving over time? Now, we turn to how growth is
spreading across countries: how are different countries moving relative to the frontier?


4.1. The Long Run

One of the key facts about the spread of growth over the very long run is that it occurred
at different points in time, resulting in what is commonly referred to as “The Great
Divergence.”20 Figure 21 illustrates this point. GDP per person differs modestly prior to
the year 1600 according to The Maddison Project data. For example, GDP per person in
the year 1300 ranges from a high of $1620 in the Netherlands (in 1990 dollars) to a low
of $610 in Egypt. But Egypt was surely not the poorest country in the world at the time.
Following an insight by Pritchett (1997), notice that the poorest countries in the world
in 1950 had an income around $300, and this level — less than one dollar per day —
seems very close to the minimum average income likely to prevail in any economy at
any point in time. Therefore in 1300, the ratio of the richest country to the poorest was
on the order of $1620/$300 ≈ 5. Even smaller ratios are observed in Maddison’s data
prior to the year 1300.
      Figure 21 shows how this ratio evolved over time for a small sample of countries,
and one sees the “Great Divergence” in incomes that occurs after the year 1600. The
ratio of richest to poorest rises to more than 10 by 1870 (for the United Kingdom) and
then to more than 100 by 2010 for the United States. Across the range of countries,

rapid growth takes hold at different points in time. Argentina is relatively rich by 1870
and growth takes off in Japan after World War II. In 1950, China was substantially poorer
than Ghana — by more than a factor of two according to Maddison. Rapid growth since
1978 raises China’s living standards to more than a factor of 25 over the benchmark level
of $300 per year.
   Figure 22 shows the spread of growth since 1870 in an alternative way, by plotting
incomes relative to the U.S. level. A key fact that stands out when the data are viewed
this way is the heterogeneity of experiences. Some countries like the U.K., Argentina,
and South Africa experience significant declines in their incomes relative to the United
States, revealing the fact that their growth rates over long periods of time fell short of the
2% growth rate of the frontier. Other countries like Japan and China see large increases
in relative incomes.

4.2. The Spread of Growth in Recent Decades

Figure 23 focuses in on the last 30 years using the Penn World Table 8.0 data, again
showing GDP per person relative to the U.S. Several facts then stand out. First, incomes
in the countries of Western Europe have been roughly stable, around 75 percent of the
U.S. level. It is perhaps surprising that countries like France, Germany, and the U.K.
are this far behind the United States. Prescott (2004) observes that a large part of the
difference is in hours worked: GDP per hour is much more similar in these countries,
and it is the fact that work hours per adult are substantially lower in Western Europe
that explains their lower GDP per person. Jones and Klenow (2015) note that in addi-
tion to the higher leisure, Western Europeans tend to have higher life expectancy and
lower consumption inequality. Taking all of these factors into account in constructing a
consumption-equivalent welfare measure, the Western European countries look much
closer to U.S. levels than the simple GDP per person numbers imply.
   Figure 23 also illustrates the “lost decades” that Japan has experienced. After rapid
growth in the 1980s (and before), Japan peaked at an income relative to the U.S. of 85

percent in 1995. Since 1995, though, Japan has fallen back to around 75 percent of the
U.S. level. The rapid growth of China since 1980 and India since around 1990 are also
evident in this figure. The contrast with Sub-Saharan Africa is particularly striking, as
that region as a whole falls from 7.5 percent of U.S. income in 1980 to just 3.3 percent by
2000. Since 2000, many of the countries and regions shown in Figure 23 exhibit catch-
up to the United States.
   Figure 24 shows GDP per person relative to the United States in 1960 and 2011
for 100 countries. Countries scatter widely around the 45-degree line, and the first
impression is that there is no systematic pattern to this scattering. Some countries are
moving up relative to the U.S. and some countries are falling further behind, and the
movements can be large, as represented by the deviations from the 45-degree line.
   Looking more closely at the graph, there is some suggestion that there are more
middle-income countries above the 45-degree line than below. At least between 1960
and 2011, countries in the middle of the distribution seemed more likely to move closer
to the U.S. than to fall further behind. In contrast, for low income countries, the oppo-
site pattern appears in the data: poor countries are on average more systematically
below the 45-degree line rather than above.

      Figure 25 shows one of the more famous graphs from the empirical growth litera-
ture, illustrating the “catch-up” behavior of OECD countries since 1960. Among OECD
countries, those that were relatively poor in 1960 — like Japan, Portugal, and Greece —
grew rapidly, while those that were relatively rich in 1960 — like Switzerland, Norway,
and the United States — grew more slowly. The pattern is quite strong in the data; a
simple regression line leads to an R-squared of 75%.21
      Figure 26 shows that a simplistic view of convergence does not hold for the world
as a whole. There is no tendence for poor countries around the world to grow either
faster or slower than rich countries. For every Botswana and South Korea, there is a
Madagascar and Niger. Remarkably, 14 out of the 100 shown in the figure exhibited a
negative growth rate of GDP per person between 1960 and 2011.
      There is some question as to whether or not these persistent negative growth rates
are entirely accurate. Young (2012) notes that the data on which these growth rates are
based is often of very poor quality. For example, the United Nations National Accounts

database publishes current and constant-price GDP numbers for 47 sub-Saharan African
countries between 1991 and 2004, but as of mid-2006, the UN Statistical Office had ac-
tually received data for only one half of the observations, and had received no constant-
price data at all for this period for 15 of these countries. Young uses measures of con-
sumer durables (e.g. radios, television sets, bicycles) and other information from the
Demographic and Health Surveys for developing countries to provide an alternative es-
timate of growth rates. He finds that living standards in Sub-Saharan African countries
were growing at around 3.5 percent per year during the last two decades, comparable
to growth rates in other developing countries.
   Barro (1991), Barro and Sala-i-Martin (1992), and Mankiw, Romer and Weil (1992)
provide a key insight into why the convergence pattern appears in Figure 25 but not
in Figure 26. In particular, they show that the basic predictions of neoclassical growth
theory hold for the world as a whole. Countries around the world are converging —
but to their own steady-states, rather than to the frontier. If one conditions on determi-
nants of a country’s steady state (such as the investment rates in physical and human
capital), then one sees that countries below their steady states grow rapidly and those
                                  THE FACTS OF ECONOMIC GROWTH                      43


above their steady states grow slowly (or even decline). The rate at which countries
converge to their own steady state — often called the “speed of convergence” — seems
to be around 2% per year, a fact sometimes known as “Barro’s iron law of convergence.”
The interpretation of the OECD countries in Figure 25, then, is that these countries
have relatively similar steady state positions, so that even if we do not condition on
these determinants formally, the convergence phenomenon appears. Confirming this
logic, the implied speed of convergence for the OECD countries estimated from the
slope of the best-fit line for Figure 25 is 1.8% per year.22
       These general patterns are examined in more detail in the following graphs and
tables. Figure 27 shows the standard deviation of log GDP per person over time for
this stable 100-country sample. As an alternative measure of dispersion, it also shows
the ratio of GDP per person between the 5th richest and 5th poorest countries in the
sample. Both measures reveal the same thing: between 1960 and the late-1990s, there
was a widening of the world income distribution, at least when each country is a unit
of observation. In the last decade or so, this pattern seems to have stabilized. In fact,
some of this pattern was already evident back in Figure 24. The poorest countries in
1960 such as Ethiopia were only about 32 times poorer than the United States. By 2011,
there are many countries with relative incomes below this level, and both Niger and the
Central African Republic were more than 64 times poorer than the United States.
       Table 4 examines the dynamics of the distribution of incomes across countries in
a more systematic fashion, following Quah (1993). First, we sort the 100 countries for
which we have data in both 1960 and 2010 into bins based on their income relative to
the world frontier, represented by the United States. Then, using decadal growth rates
for the 5 decades between 1960 and 2010, we calculate the sample probabilities that
countries move from one bin to another. Finally, we compute the stationary distribu-
tion of countries across the bins that is implied by assuming these sample probabilities
are constant forever.
       First, note that some of the patterns we have remarked upon already are present in
the 1960 and 2010 distributions shown in Table 4. For example, there is an increase in
the fraction of countries in the highest two bins in 2010 relative to 1960. There is also a
decrease in the fraction of countries between 5 and 40 percent of the U.S. level. On the

other hand, there is a (surprisingly?) large increase in the fraction of countries with less
than 5 percent of the U.S. income level.
       Iterating over the dynamics implied by the sample transition probabilities leads to
the stationary distribution shown in the third main column of the table.23 Many more
countries are projected to move out of the middle and into the top of the distribution.
But there is a large mass of countries — 26 percent here — that inhabit the bin of
countries with less than 5 percent of the U.S. income.
       Overall, the picture that emerges from this kind of analysis is that there is a basic
dynamic in the data for the last 50 years or more that says that once countries get on the
“growth escalator,” good things tend to happen and they grow rapidly to move closer to
the frontier. Where they end up depends, as we will discuss, on the extent to which
their institutions improve. And this process is itself captured in the Markov transition
dynamics estimated in Table 4. It is interesting that only 19 percent of countries end up
in the top bin, which may say something about how hard it is to adopt and maintain
the best institutions.
       Equally striking, however, is the fact that more than a quarter of countries are in
the bottom bin, below 5 percent of the frontier, even in the long-run distribution. This
surprised me a bit, as it didn’t happen with earlier versions of this exercise, for example
in Jones (1997). Nevertheless, a dynamic that appears in the latest version of the Penn
World Tables is that the very poorest countries seem to be falling further behind.
       One thing that may be misleading about this kind of exercise is that it implies that
the stationary distribution is ergodic. That is, countries move around this distribution
over time, so that, given enough time, even the U.K. can end up in the poorest bin. (The
last column of the table suggests that these dynamics are very slow.) Lucas (2000), in his
“Macroeconomics for the 21st Century,” suggests that from the standpoint of the year
2100, the most striking fact of macroeconomics may end up being how many countries
have moved close to the frontier. In other words, the Great Divergence of the last 200
years may turn into a Great Convergence over the next century. Perhaps the diffusion
of good rules and good institutions leads to a more or less permanent improvement in


  23
    Mathematically, the computation is easily illustrated. We estimate the Markov transition probabilities
of countries across the bins. Multiplying this matrix by the initial distribution yields an estimate of the
distribution of income for the next decade. Doing this many times yields an estimate of the long-run
distribution.

the distribution, which is only partially captured by the kind of calculation done here.24


4.3. The Distribution of Income by Person, not by Country

Up until now, we’ve taken the country as the unit of observation. This is appropriate
for some purposes, but there is also a good case to be made for taking the person as
the unit of observation: why should the 500,000 people in Luxembourg get the same
weight as the 1.4 billion people in China?
       Figure 28 approaches the data from the standpoint of the individual. We assume
each person in a country gets that country’s GDP per person and then compute the
world income distribution by person. More detailed calculations along these lines in-
corporate the distribution of income within each country as well and provide further
support for the basic point in Figure 28; see Bourguignon and Morrisson (2002) and
especially Sala-i-Martin (2006).

setting where countries learn from the growth experiences of their neighbors.

       In 1960, 51 percent of the world’s population lived on less than 3 dollars per day
(measured in 2005 U.S. dollars). By 2011, less than 5 percent of the world’s population
lived below this level. The big difference, of course, is China and India, which between
them contain more than one third of the world’s population. In 1960, China and India
were very poor, with incomes below $2.75 per day, while by 2011 average incomes were
$10 per day in India and $22 per day in China. From the standpoint of the individual
most outstanding fact of economic growth over the last 50 years is how many people
have been elevated out of poverty.




4.4. Development Accounting

Development accounting applies the logic of Solow’s growth accounting to explain dif-
ferences in the levels of GDP per worker across countries. Countries can be rich be-
cause they have large quantities of inputs or because they use these inputs efficiently.
Quantitatively, how important are each of these components?
       An early version of development accounting is Denison (1967), who compared 8
European economies to the United States in 1960. Christensen, Cummings and Jor-
genson (1981) work with a similar set of countries and extend the analysis to include
human capital. King and Levine (1994) focus on the role of physical capital versus TFP
in a broad set of countries, and provide the first use of the phrase “development ac-
counting” that I have found.25 Klenow and Rodriguez-Clare (1997) and Hall and Jones
(1999) incorporate human capital differences and consider a broad range of countries.
Caselli (2005) provides a detailed overview and analysis of this literature.26
       The basics of development accounting follow closely upon the analysis of growth
accounting that we conducted back in Section 2. To see this link, recall the production


  25
      Bob Hall and I (Hall and Jones, 1996) proposed the phrase “levels accounting” which doesn’t have
nearly the same ring!
   26
      The papers cited to this point assume a known production function — typically Cobb-Douglas with an
exponent on capital around 1/3. A related set of papers including Mankiw, Romer and Weil (1992), Islam
(1995), and Caselli, Esquivel and Lefort (1996) conduct a similar exercise in a regression framework. The
limitation of the regression framework in its simplest form is that it imposes an orthogonality between
inputs and total factor productivity which seems inappropriate. Estimating production functions is
notoriously difficult.

function we considered there:


                                  Yt = At Mt Ktα Ht1−α .                               (5)
                                       | {z }
                                          TFP

Some versions of development accounting work directly with this production func-
tion. The advantage is that it is the most straightforward approach. The disadvan-
tage is familiar from growth accounting and the standard neoclassical growth model:
differences in TFP induce capital accumulation that leads to differences in K across
countries. Hence some of what is attributed to K in this approach might more more
naturally be attributed to TFP.
   An alternative approach — pursued by Klenow and Rodriguez-Clare (1997) and Hall
and Jones (1999) — is to rewrite the production function in a way that assigns any
induced capital accumulation to TFP. This is accomplished by dividing both sides of
the production function by Ytα and solving for Yt to get

                                                     α
                                  Yt         Kt       1−α   Ht
                                     =                         · Zt                    (6)
                                  Lt         Yt             Lt

                     1
where Zt ≡ (At Mt ) 1−α is total factor productivity measured in labor-augmenting units.
To understand why this equation assigns the induced capital accumulation to TFP,
notice that in the steady state of a neoclassical growth model, the capital-output ratio
K/Y is proportional to the investment rate and independent of TFP. Hence the con-
tributions from productivity and capital deepening are separated in this version, in a
way that they were not in equation (5). This was the equation on which we based our
growth accounting, and we will use the same equation for development accounting.
   The Penn World Tables, starting with Version 8.0, contains all the information needed
to conduct the simplest form of development accounting as in equation (6). That data
set contains measures of the economy’s stock of physical capital and measures of hu-
man capital that are based on educational attainment data from Barro and Lee (2013)
and Mincerian returns to education of 13.4 percent for the first 4 years, 10.1 percent for
the second 4 years, and 6.8 percent for all additional years, as in Hall and Jones (1999).
We conduct our growth accounting exercise using this data and equation (6), assuming
                                THE FACTS OF ECONOMIC GROWTH                                         49


α = 1/3.27
       Table 5 shows the basic development accounting exercise using the Penn World
Tables data for a sample of countries.28 To see how the accounting works, consider
the row for Mexico. According to the Penn World Tables, Mexico has a GDP per worker
that is about 1/3 that in the United States in 2010. This 1/3 number is the product of
the next three terms in the row, following the formula in equation (6).
       Remarkably little of the difference is due to physical capital: the capital-output ratio
in Mexico is about 87 percent of that in the United States. Because of diminishing
returns, though, it is the square root (α/(1 − α) = 1/2 when α = 1/3) of this difference
                               √
that matters for income, and 0.87 ≈ 0.93, so differences in physical capital only lead
to about a 7 percent difference in GDP per worker between the U.S. and Mexico.
       In the next column, we see a larger contribution from human capital. In 2010, peo-
ple aged 15 and over in Mexico had on average around 8.8 years of education according
to Barro and Lee (2013). In contrast, educational attainment in the United States was
13.2. The difference is 4.6 years of schooling. With a return to each year of education
of around 7 percent, this implies about a 32 percent difference due to education. The
entry from human capital for Mexico is 0.76, and 1/0.76 ≈ 1.32, consistent with this
reasoning.
       The implied difference in TFP between the U.S. and Mexico is then 0.338/(0.931 ×
0.760) ≈ 0.477. Put another way, GDP per worker was 3 times higher in the U.S. than in
Mexico. A factor of 1.07 × 1.32 ≈ 1.4 of this difference is due to inputs, meaning a factor
of 2.1 was due to TFP, since 1.4 × 2.1 ≈ 3. From these numbers, one can also see easily
how the “Share due to TFP” column is calculated. For each 2 parts due to inputs, 3 parts
are due to TFP, hence the share due to TFP is calcuated as 60 percent (i.e. as 3/(2+3)).
       More generally, several key findings stand out from Table 5. First, the capital-output
ratio is remarkably stable across countries. Its average value is very close to one, and
even the poorest country in the table, Malawi, is reported by the Penn World Tables
to have a capital-output ratio very close to the U.S. value. So differences in physical


  27
     In fact, the Penn World Tables 8.0 contains its own measure of TFP as well. However, this measure is
based on Cobb-Douglas production functions in which the exponents on capital vary across countries. In
this sense, the measure of TFP that is reported there is incomplete: countries with the same inputs and
the same level of TFP will have different outputs!

capital contribute almost nothing to differences in GDP per worker across countries.
Caselli and Feyrer (2007) document a closely-related fact in great detail: the marginal
product of capital (which here is proportional to the inverse of the capital-output ratio)
is very similar in rich and poor countries.29
       Second, the contribution from educational attainment is larger, but still modest.
For example, countries like India and Malawi only see their incomes reduced by a factor
of 2 due to educational attainment. Loosely speaking, the poorest countries of the
world have 4 or 5 years of education, while the richest have 13. Eight years of education
with a Mincerian return of around 10 percent leads to a 0.8 difference in logs, and
exp(0.8) ≈ 2.
       Finally, the implication of these first two points is that differences in TFP are the
largest contributor to income differences in an accounting sense. Figure 29 shows the
levels of TFP plotted against GDP per worker for 128 countries in 2010. The two series
are highly correlated at 0.96. And the differences in TFP are very large: the Central

    The general lack of correlation between the capital-output ratio and GDP per person is discussed by
Inklaar and Timmer (2013).

African Republic is about 64 times poorer than the United States and its TFP is about
32 times lower than the U.S. level.
       The large contribution from TFP is verified by the last column of Table 5, where the
share explained by TFP ranges from just under 50 percent for Singapore and Hong Kong
to more than 90 percent for Malawi. To understand the “Share due to TFP” column,
consider the last row of Table 5. According to that row, the average country in the 128-
country sample is just over 5 times poorer than the United States. Essentially none of
this difference (a factor of 1.021) is due to differences in K/Y , while a factor of 1.42 is
due to differences in educational attainment. Taken together, this means a factor of
1.021 × 1.42 ≈ 1.5 is due to inputs, leaving a factor of about 3.5 attributed to TFP. We
then compute the “Share due to TFP” as 3.5/(1.5+3.5) ≈ 70%, as shown in the last entry
in Table 5.30 The rest of the shares are computed in an analogous way. For example, for
Malawi, about a factor of 2 is due to inputs and a factor of 26 is due to TFP, meaning
that 26/28 ≈ 93% is due to TFP.
       More generally, the share across all 128 countries is shown in Figure 30. There,
a systematic pattern is obvious. In the poorest countries of the world, well over 80
percent of the difference in GDP per worker relative to the United States is due to TFP
differences. Moving across the graph to richer countries, one sees that less and less is
due to TFP, and for the richest countries as a whole, TFP contributes around 50 percent
of the differences.


4.5. Understanding TFP Differences

The basic finding that TFP differences account for the bulk of income differences across
countries has led to a large body of research designed to explain what these differences
are. This is exemplified by the title of a famous paper by Prescott (1998): “Needed: A
Theory of TFP.”
       In the last 15 years, this challenge has been approach in two ways. First, several
papers have improved our measures of inputs in various ways, chipping away at the
contribution of the “measure of our ignorance.” Second, the literature on misallocation
has emerged to provide in general the kind of theory that Prescott was seeking. The
remainder of this section will review the efforts to improve input measurement, while
  30
       Or more exactly as 3.26/(3.26 + 1.021 ∗ 1.418) ≈ 69.2%.

the next several sections will consider misallocation and its implications.
   Caselli (2005) provides a detailed survey and analysis of the state of development
accounting as of 2005. The interested reader should certainly look there to get up to
speed. Caselli reviews progress on many dimensions: measuring the quality of edu-
cation using test scores (Hanushek and Kimko, 2000); considering differences in the
experience of the labor force across countries (Klenow and Rodriguez-Clare, 1997); sec-
toral differences in productivity, especially agriculture (Restuccia, Yang and Zhu, 2008);
differences in labor productivity due to health (Weil, 2007); differences in the quality
of capital (Caselli and Wilson, 2004); and the potential role of non-neutral productivity
(Caselli and Coleman, 2006).
   Much additional progress has been made in the decade since Caselli’s review was
published, especially with respect to misallocation, as discussed in the next section.
But there has also been much valuable work on measuring the inputs into development
accounting. Lagakos, Moll, Porzio, Qian and Schoellman (2012) use household survey
data from 35 countries to show that the returns to experience vary substantially across
       54                                      CHARLES I. JONES



countries, with poorer countries typically having much flatter age-earnings profiles.
Incorporating differential returns to experience in development accounting boosts the
importance of the human capital term by about 50 percent. Hendricks and Schoellman
(2014) use data on immigrants from 50 source countries into 11 different host countries
to improve our measurement of labor quality differences, providing another boost to
the human capital term — of about 30 percent. Ben Jones (2014) observes that the
standard approach outlined above treats workers with different levels of education as
perfect substitutes, up to differences in efficiency units. He proposes instead a general-
ized aggregator and shows that the traditional perfect-substitutes case delivers a lower
bound for the role of human capital. If workers with different human capital are less
than perfect substitutes, the share of income differences explained by human capital
can rise dramatically.31



4.6. Misallocation: A Theory of TFP

One of the great insights of the growth literature in the last 15 years is that misallocation
at the micro level can show up as a reduction in total factor productivity at a more
aggregated level. This insight appears in various places, including Banerjee and Duflo
(2005), Chari, Kehoe and McGrattan (2007), Restuccia and Rogerson (2008) and Hsieh
and Klenow (2009).
       As we discussed briefly in the context of misallocation and frontier growth (in Sec-
tion 2.6.), the essence of this insight is quite straightforward: when resources are allo-
cated optimally, the economy will operate on its production possibilities frontier. When
resources are misallocated, the economy will operate inside this frontier. But that is just
another way of saying that TFP will be lower: a given quantity of inputs will produce less
output.
       A simple example illustrates this point. Suppose output is produced using two

  31
     This finding is related to an observation made by Caselli and Coleman (2006). They noted that the
ratio of “skilled” to “unskilled” workers varies enormously across countries. For example, if we let high
school completion be the dividing line, the ratio of skilled to unskilled workers is just 0.025 in Kenya versus
1.8 in the United States — a difference of a factor of 70. If college completion is the dividing line, the
factor proportions differ by even more. When workers with different human capital levels are no longer
perfect substitutes, this ratio becomes relevant. The difficulty is that it can then imply implausibly large
differences in the return to schooling across countries if one is not careful. Caselli and Coleman introduce
additional TFP terms so they can match the returns to education, but then the large differences in factor
proportions shows up as enormous differences in the non-neutral TFP terms.

tasks according to Y = X1α X21−α . This could describe a firm, and the tasks could be
management and the production line, or this could be the economy as a whole and the
tasks could be manufacturing and services. Suppose that each task is accomplished
very simply: one unit of labor can produce one unit of either task, and the economy is
endowed with L units of labor. Finally, suppose that the allocation of labor is such that a
fraction s works in the first task, and the fraction 1−s works in the second task. We leave
the source of this allocation unspecified: labor could be optimally allocated, or it could
be misallocated because of taxes, poor management, information problems, unions,
or many other reasons. But given this allocation, there is a reduced-form production
function given by
                          Y = M (s)L where M (s) ≡ sα (1 − s)1−α                                  (7)

   In other words, total factor productivity in this economy is M (s), which depends
on the allocation of labor in the economy.32 Moreover, it is easy to see that the output-
maximizing allocation of labor in this example has s∗ = α, and any departure of the
allocation from s∗ will reduce total factor productivity. This is the essence of the litera-
ture on misallocation and TFP.
   This insight is at the heart of our best candidate explanations for answering the
question of why some countries are so much richer than others. Development account-
ing tells us that poor countries have low levels of inputs, but they are also remarkably
inefficient in how they use those inputs. Misallocation provides the theoretical connec-
tion between the myriad of distortions in poor economies and the TFP differences that
we observe in development accounting.
   The remainder of this section explores various facts related to misallocation.



4.7. Institutions and the Role of Government

Countries are a natural unit of analysis for growth economists for the simple reason
that national borders are the places where different political and economic institutions
begin and end. It has long been conjectured that differences in these institutions are
fundamental determinants of long-run economic success. But what is the evidence for

  32
     One could easily assume both capital and labor are used to produce each X so that the result in
equation (7) would be Y = M (s)K β L1−β , which makes the connection between M (s) and TFP even
more apparent.
       56                                    CHARLES I. JONES



such a claim? How do we know that the income differences we see across countries are
not primarily driven by differences in natural resources or other aspects of geography?
       One of the best sources of evidence on this question was provided by Olson (1996).
Olson observed that history itself provides us with “natural experiments” that allow us
to see the large impact of institutions on economic success. For example, prior to World
War II, North and South Korea were not separate countries. As a rough approxima-
tion, the north and south of Korea contained people that shared a cultural heritage, a
government, institutions, and even a geography. In fact, if anything, North Korea was
economically advantaged relative to the South, containing a disproportionate share
of electricity production and heavy industry.33 After the Korean War ended in 1953,
North and South Korea were divided and governed according to very different rules.
The resulting economic growth of the next half century was dramatically different, as
illustrated in Figure 31. The picture in this figure was taken by an astronaut on the
International Space Station in early 2014 and shows North and South Korea at night.
South Korea is brightly lit, while North Korea is almost completely dark, barely indistin-
guishable from the ocean. Whatever was different between North and South Korea after
1953 apparently had an enormous influence on their long-term economic success.34
       As a brief aside, it is worth noting that during the last several years, a number of
papers have used satellite data on lights at night to study economic growth. Hender-
son, Storeygard and Weil (2012) introduce this data and argue that it provides useful
information on growth and standards of living. They also note that it can be used to
study growth at the regional level, where income measures are not often available in
developing countries. Michalopoulos and Papaioannou (2014) take up this latter point
and compare the importance of national policies with subnational/cultural institutions
using the light data.
       “Natural” experiments similar to the North/South Korea example can be observed
in East and West Germany after World War II, Hong Kong and southeastern China,
  33
    “[Under Japanese rule before World War II], the colonial industries were unevenly distributed between
South Korea and North Korea. Heavy and chemical industries were concentrated in the North, while
many light industries, such as textile, food, printing and wood, were located in the South. In 1940, North
Korea’s share of the total production in the metal industry was 96 percent, and 82 percent for the chemical
industry. Also, 92 percent of the total electricity production originated from the North in 1945 (Lee, D-G,
2002: 39). Thus, in 1945 when Japan withdrew from Korea and when Korea was divided into two separate
political regimes, the South Korean economy in general and industry in particular were severely crippled.”

and across the Rio Grande between Mexico and Texas. These examples make clear
that something malleable matters for economic success even if they do not specifically
identify what that something is.
   Another fascinating piece of evidence comes from Acemoglu, Johnson and Robin-
son (2002) and is illustrated in Figure 32, the so-called “reversal of fortune.” Restricting
our attention to former European colonies, economic success 500 years ago is neg-
atively correlated with economic success today. That is, the places that were most
successful 500 years ago, as measured by population density or urbanization, are on
average comparatively poor today.
   A classic example of this phenomenon, highlighted by Engerman and Sokoloff (1997),
is the New World:


      [Latin America] began with — by European standards of the time — vast
      supplies of land and natural resources per person and were among the most
      prosperous and coveted of the colonies in the seventeenth and eighteenth
      centuries. Indeed, so promising were these other regions that Europeans of

         the time generally regarded the thirteen British colonies on the North Amer-
         ican mainland and Canada as of relatively marginal economic interest — an
         opinion evidently shared by Native Americans who had concentrated dis-
         proportionately in the areas the Spanish eventually developed. Yet, despite
         their similar, if not less favorable, factor endowments, the United States and
         Canada ultimately proved to be far more successful than the other colonies
         in realizing sustained economic growth over time. (pp. 260–261)

       These examples suggest that economic success is not permanently given, for exam-
ple by geographic endowments, but rather can be changed by the rules that are put in
place. Engerman and Sokoloff (1997), Acemoglu, Johnson and Robinson (2002), and
others suggest that the institutions adopted by Europeans in response to these initial
conditions influenced subsequent growth. In places that were already economically
successful in 1500, Europeans tended to set up “extractive” institutions to transfer the
economic gains back to Europe. In contrast, Europeans themselves migrated to places
that were sparsely populated in 1500, setting up “European” institutions that were con-
ducive to long-run economic success.35
       Dell (2010) provides a detailed analysis of the long-reaching nature of one such
institution in Peru. The “mita” was a forced labor system conscripting one seventh
of the adult male population in a region of Peru to work in local silver and mercury
mines between 1573 and 1812. A regression discontinuity analysis reveals that today
— two hundred years later after this system ended — consumption is lower inside the
former mita by 25 percent, educational attainment is lower, and the region is less well-
connected by roads and infrastructure.


4.8. Taxes and Economic Growth

One of the most obvious and readily quantified measures of government involvement
in the economy is taxes. It is easy to write down models in which governments that tax
heavily reduce the long-run success of their economies. The facts, however, are not so
clear.
       Figure 33 shows the growth rate of real GDP per person in the United States since

and Robinson (2012).

1980 as well as the total government tax revenues (including state and local) as a share
of GDP, updating a graph first highlighted by Stokey and Rebelo (1995). The stunning
fact that emerges from this graph is that taxes have increased enormously, from around
10 percent of GDP in 1929 to more than 30 percent of GDP at their peak in 2000. But as
we already noted earlier, growth rates over the 20th century were remarkably stable —
if anything, they were higher after 1950 than before.
   Figure 34 shows a related fact by looking across the countries of the world: tax rev-
enues as a share of GDP are positively correlated with economic success, not negatively
correlated.
   Of course, these are just simple correlations, and they have an obvious interpreta-
tion. Governments do not simply throw the tax revenue that they collect into the ocean.
Instead, this revenue — at least to some extent — is used to fund the good purposes that
governments serve: providing a stable rule of law, a judicial system, education, public
health, highways, basic research, and so on.

4.9. TFPQ versus TFPR


An important realization related to the measurement of either labor productivity or TFP
emerged during the last decade. Specifically, to measure true productivity, one needs
detailed information on micro level prices. Foster, Haltiwanger and Syverson (2008)
introduced the labels “TFPQ” and “TFPR,” which will be explained in detail below. This
distinction plays a crucial role in Hsieh and Klenow (2009). For more discussion, see
the recent survey by Syverson (2011).
   To see this point most easily, consider the following setup. The economy consists
of a unit measure of heterogeneous varieties that enter the utility function via a CES
aggregator:
                                            Z       1
                                       C=               (αi Yi )ρ di                 (8)
                                                0

where αi are taste parameters related to each variety and 0 < ρ < 1 governs the elastic-
ity of substition between varieties.
   Each variety is assumed to be produced by different monopolistically-competitive
firms using labor:
                                         Yi = Ai Li                                  (9)

where Ai is the (exogenous) productivity with which each variety is producted. Finally,
assume labor is homogenous and can be hired by any firm at a wage rate w.
   It is well-known that in this kind of setup, monopolistically-competitive firms charge
a price pi for their variety that is a markup over marginal cost:

                                                    1 w
                                        pi =         · .                            (10)
                                                    ρ Ai

This implies that sales revenue for each firm is pi Yi = wLi /ρ.
   Now consider measuring firm-level productivity in this economy. Since we’ve left
capital out of this example, we focus on labor productivity. But exactly the same issues
apply to TFP as well.
   In general, the data we have available on firms include sales revenues pi Yi and
employment Li . This leads immediately to an important point: if one does not have
data on the firm-level price pi , then one cannot recover Ai . For example, deflating
revenue by an industry-level price deflator is not the same as deflating by pi because
                           THE FACTS OF ECONOMIC GROWTH                           63


firms are heterogeneous and have different productivity levels. In the absence of firm-
level prices, one typically recovers

                                                            pi Y i       w
                        Revenue Productivity, TFPRi :        Li      =   ρ.


If firms have identical markups and do not face any distortions, revenue productivity
should be equated across heterogeneous firms. Workers have to earn the same wage at
each firm, and this equates the marginal revenue product of labor across firms, which
is all that is being recovered here.
   The same argument applies to total factor productivity, and gives rise to the label
TFPR, where the “R” denotes “revenue” TFP. The marginal revenue product of capital
should also be equated across firms in a simple model like this one, so weighted aver-
ages of the average revenue products of capital and labor — which is what TFPR is —
should be equated across firms.
   By this point, the reader should realize that in a world of heterogeneous goods, it
is not even obvious how to compare “true productivity.” How do we compare Ford’s
productivity in making pickup trucks to Tesla’s productivity in making electric cars?
Or how do we compare Dell’s productivity at making PC’s with Apple’s productivity at
making Macs? Even if we had detailed data on the price of Ford trucks and Tesla cars
— even if we recovered the Ai ’s using these prices — they would not be comparable,
because the products are different!
   Both of these issues are addressed by having knowledge of the utility function, in
this case the C aggregator in equation (8). In particular, knowledge of the utility func-
tion allows one to compute the marginal rate of substitution between different prod-
ucts — it tells us how to compare Fords and Teslas or Apples and Dells.
   To see how, recall that the demand curve from utility maximization of (8) is


                                       pi = ραiρ Yiρ−1 .                            (11)


Therefore, sales revenue for this variety is


                                       pi Yi = ρ(αi Yi )ρ                           (12)
       64                                   CHARLES I. JONES



and we can invert this equation to recover the term that enters utility from sales rev-
enue:                                                        1/ρ
                                                      pi Yi
                                        αi Yi =                      .                             (13)
                                                       ρ

And this is what we require. The αi terms tell us how to relate Fords and Teslas:36

                                                          α i Yi         (pi Yi )1/ρ
                     True Productivity, TFPQi :            Li      =         Li        = αi Ai .


That is, TFPQ (the “Q” denotes “quantity” TFP) tells us how effective a firm is at taking
a unit of labor (in this case, with no capital) and using it to produce Fords or Teslas in
comparable units.
       Notice that TFPQ is measured in this case using only the data we typically have —
sales revenue and employment — together with knowledge of the elasticity of demand.
       TFPQ reflects Ai but TFPR is independent of Ai in this simple specification.37


4.10. The Hsieh-Klenow Facts

Hsieh and Klenow (2009) use the insight that TFPR should be equated across plants if
resources are optimally allocated to quantify the effect of misallocation on aggregate
TFP. In particular, they consider misallocation across plants within 4-digit manufactur-
ing industries in the United States, China, and India.
       The first part of their approach has already been explained in the previous section:
they assume CES demand, and use this elasticity to back out prices and real output
from sales revenue. This allows them to measure “true” TFP, called “TFPQ,” for each
establishment in their data. The average distribution of TFPQ within 4 digit manufac-
turing that they recover is shown in Figure 35.
       As shown in this figure, the distributions within industry of TFPQ in the United
States and China are relatively similar, while the distribution is significantly wider in
India.38 What is surprising, perhaps, is just how large the differences in TFPQ are
within an industry. Hsieh and Klenow (2009) find that the 90-10 ratio of TFPQ across
plants is 8.8 in the United States, 22.4 in India, and 11.5 in China. One way of thinking
  36
      I’m dropping the ρ1/ρ term in the equation to keep things clear.
  37
      In richer settings, TFPR can depend on Ai , for example if there are fixed costs in production.
   38
      However, the authors note that small firms are underrepresented in the Chinese data, so this could
reflect differences in the sample.

about these large differences is to note that employment differences across plants is
very large. Why does a large textile manufacturer employ many more workers than a
family shop? One answer is that TFPQ is much higher for the large plant.
   Hsieh and Klenow’s most valuable contribution, however, is to quantify misalloca-
tion. To see how they do this, Consider a plant that produces with a Cobb-Douglas
production function, using capital and labor, and that faces distortions τK and τL in
choosing its inputs. These distortions are modeled as if they are taxes, but the liter-
ature interprets the distortions much more broadly to include credit market frictions,
hiring and firing costs, quantity restrictions, and so on. The profit-maximizing firm will
hire capital and labor until the marginal revenue product of these factors equals their
net-of-distortion rental price. Written differently, payments to factors will equal the
product of the factor exponents and the distortion terms:

                                                      (r + δ)Ki
                                    αK (1 − τK ) =                                                   (14)

                                          αL (1 − τL ) =         .                                    (15)
                                                           pi Yi
Roughly speaking, Hsieh and Klenow observe the right-hand side of these expressions
in the data — they observe the share of revenues spent on labor and capital. They then
use these observed spending shares to back out the distortions.
       The key identification issue in recovering the τK and τL is this: when a manufac-
turing plant pays a large fraction of its revenue to labor, is that because it faces a low
τL , or is that because its technology is labor intensive (a high αL )? Hsieh and Klenow
solve this identification problem by assuming that all firms within a 4-digit industry
have common αK and αL Cobb-Douglas exponents. Then variation in factor shares
across plants reflects distortions rather than technologies. (This is one of the reasons
why their approach works well within industries but would run into problems across
industries.)
       TFPR is a weighted average of the marginal revenue product of capital and the marginal
revenue product of labor, relative to the average values in the industry, and with no
distortions would take a value of one. It is therefore also equal to a weighted average of
the 1 − τK and 1 − τL distortions, where the weights are the Cobb-Douglas exponents
in the production function.39
       The average distribution of TFPR within 4-digit manufacturing industries is shown
in Figure 36. The first thing to note about this figure is that TFPR is not equal to one
for every firm, not even in the United States. One interpretation of this fact is that
resources are misallocated even in the United State and to use the deviations from one
as a measure of U.S. misallocation. Another interpretation — and these likely both
contain elements of truth — is that there is measurement error in the U.S. data, and
some of the deviations away from one reflect this measurement error.
       The second point to note in Figure 36 is that the dispersion of TFPR in India and
China is significantly larger than the dispersion in the United States. To the extent
that this does not reflect larger measurement error in India and China, it suggests that
the misallocation of capital and labor across establishments within 4-digit industries

  39
    For aggregating the τK and τL into a single index of “TFPR”and to measure the effect of the distortions
on TFP — Hsieh and Klenow actually require values for the Cobb-Douglas exponents. They assume the
U.S. average shares are undistorted and assume China and India have the same Cobb-Doulgas technology
as the U.S.

in China and India is a factor reducing GDP in those economies. Hsieh and Klenow
quantify these effects and find that if China and India has the same dispersion of TFPR
as the United States, their aggregate TFP would be higher by 30% to 50% in China
and 40% to 60% in India. GDP would be higher by approximately twice this amount
if capital accumulates in response to the higher TFP.
   In a recent follow-up paper, Hsieh and Klenow attempt to understand what could
be causing this misallocation. Hsieh and Klenow (2014) looks at how establishments in
the United States, India, and Mexico grow as they age. The remarkable finding of this
paper is summarized in Figure 37: plants in the United States get much larger as they
age, while this is barely true at all in India.
   To be more precise, plants that are more than 35 years old in the U.S. have more than
8 times the employment of plants that are less than 5 years old. In contrast, old plants
in Mexico are only twice as large as young plants, while plants in India exhibit even less
employment growth. The suggestion, explored in detail in this paper, is that distortions

in Mexico and India prevent the most productive plants from growing in size, and this
is one cause of the lower aggregate TFP in these economies. They estimate that moving
from the U.S. life cycle to the Indian or Mexican life cycle of plant growth could reduce
aggregate TFP by about 25 percent.
   Motivated by facts like these, a growing number of recent papers explore various
kinds of misallocation their effects on TFP. Asker, Collard-Wexler and Loecker (2011)
examine the role of volatility and adjustment costs in explaining variation in TFPR and
TFPQ. Midrigan and Xu (2014) and Moll (2014) study the extent to which credit market
frictions can generate misallocation and TFP losses. Peters (2013) considers the role of
heterogeneous markups in accounting for misallocation. Guner, Ventura and Yi (2008)
and Garicano, Lelarge and Van Reenen (2014) consider the effect of regulations tied
to the size of firms. Akcigit, Alp and Peters (2014a) suggest that incentive problems
for managers limit the ability of potentially highly-productive small firms to expand,
leading to lower TFP.




4.11. The Diffusion of Ideas

Figure 38 shows our next fact: lags in the adoption of new technologies have declined
sharply over the last 200 years. This fact is taken from Comin and Hobijn (2010) and is
based on the CHAT (“Cross-country Historical Adoption of Technology”) database that
these authors previous assembled. The database contains information on the diffusion
of more than 100 technologies, in more than 150 countries, since 1800.
   For 15 technologies, the graph plots the year of invention of each technology versus
an average adoption lag across 166 countries. More precisely, the adoption lag for
each country/technology observation measures the number of years between the date
a technology was invented and the date it was adopted in the country.
   A strong negative correlation is evident in the graph, suggesting the fact that tech-
nology adoption lags have been shrinking over time. Comin and Hobijn (2010) estimate
that technologies invented ten years later are on average adopted 4.3 years faster.
   Note how misallocation can show up in ideas as well.

4.12. Urbanization

We remarked earlier on the inverse correlation between urbanization in the year 1500
and income per person today. Figure 39 exemplifies the large trend in urbanization over
time. The figure shows the number of cities containing more than a million people,
by continent, since 1800. The large rise in urbanization over the last two centuries is
well known. This figure also emphasizes the extent to which that urbanization is even
stronger in Asia than in Europe and North America.



5. Conclusion

While this paper has covered a large number of facts, there are still important facts
that I have neglected. Partly this is because the paper is long enough, and partly this
is because some of these facts are not as fully established as we might like. Therefore,
this final discussion also can be read as a suggestion for places where further research
might be helpful.

   One of the important facts omitted here is globalization and its effects on growth:
the decline of trade barriers, the decline in transportation and communication costs,
the rise of vertical supply chains. There is an old stylized fact from Sachs and Warner
(1995) that “open” economies grew more rapidly over the period 1970 to 1989 than
countries that were “closed.” However, the definition they used of open and closed
is so broad as to include other forces, and this dichotomy is surely correlated with
institutional quality more generally.
   There are many other facts related to institutions that we wish we understood bet-
ter. It is relatively clear from the kinds of evidence reviewed earlier that “institutions
matter.” But how important are different institutions, and how do institutions change?
Is democracy conducive to growth, or does democracy typically result from growth, or
both (Barro, 1999; Acemoglu et al., 2014)? Does human capital accumulation lead to
good institutions, or vice versa, or both (Glaeser et al., 2004)? What is the relationship
between culture, “fractionalization,” institutions, and growth (Alesina et al., 2003)?
   Another fact that we’d like to know more about is the extent of knowledge spillovers
across countries. It is well appreciated that each country benefits from knowledge
created elsewhere in the world, but quantifying these benefits is difficult. Eaton and
Kortum (1999) represent one attempt and suggest that only 60% of U.S. growth in recent
decades comes from knowledge created in the United States, and the numbers for
local knowledge in Japan (35%) and the U.K. (13%) are even smaller. A related fact
courtesy of Freeman (2010) is this: In the 1970s, China produced a negligible number of
Ph.D.’s in science and engineering, but by 2010, China was producing 26 percent more
than the United States. In a world of ideas, the economic development of China and
India may have a profound affect on growth in the future. How many future Thomas
Edisons, Albert Einsteins, and Steve Jobs are out there, waiting for their talents to be
appropriately nutured?
