                                            ABSTRACT

We extend range-based volatility estimation to the multivariate case. In particular, we propose a
range-based covariance estimator motivated by a key financial economic consideration, the absence
of arbitrage, in addition to statistical considerations. We show that this estimator is highly efficient
yet robust to market microstructure noise arising from bid-ask bounce and asynchronous trading.

1. Introduction

The price range, defined as the difference between the highest and lowest log asset prices over a fixed sampling
interval (for concreteness, we focus on a one-day interval), has a long, colorful, and distinguished history of use
as a volatility estimator.1 As emphasized most recently by Alizadeh, Brandt and Diebold (2002), the range is a
highly efficient volatility proxy, distilling volatility information from the entire intraday price path, in contrast
to volatility proxies based on the daily return, such as the daily squared return, which use only the opening and
closing prices. Moreover, data on the range are widely available for individual stocks and for exchange-traded
futures contracts (including currencies, Treasury securities, and stock indices), not only presently but also, in
many cases, over long historical spans. In fact, the range has been reported for many decades in business
newspapers through so-called “candlestick plots,” showing the daily high, low, and close.

        Despite these appealing properties of the range, one cannot help but notice a large and striking gap in
the range-based volatility estimation literature: it is entirely univariate. That is, although range-based variance
estimation has been extensively discussed and refined, range-based covariance estimation remains uncharted
territory. The reason is that it is not at all obvious how to construct an appropriate range-based covariance
estimator. Hence the range would seem to join the ranks of other famously obvious and intuitive univariate
statistics, such as the median, that have no similarly obvious or intuitive multivariate generalization.

        The apparent failure of range-based volatility estimation to generalize to the multivariate case is
particularly unfortunate because financial economics is intimately concerned with multivariate interactions.
Consider, for example, three pillars of modern finance: asset pricing, asset allocation, and risk management.
Asset prices depend on covariance with the market and perhaps other risk factors. Similarly, optimal portfolio
shares depend on the variances and covariances of asset returns, as does portfolio vale at risk.

        We attempt to remedy the situation by proposing a simple and intuitive range-based covariance
estimator. Our approach is not merely statistical; rather, it relies appealingly on a key financial economic
consideration, the absence of arbitrage. In particular, we use no-arbitrage conditions to express covariances in
terms of variances, which may then be estimated by standard range-based methods.

2. Range-Based Variance and Covariance Estimation

Before considering the range-based estimation of covariances, we must set the stage by considering certain
aspects of univariate volatility estimation. Consider a univariate stochastic volatility diffusion for the log of an
asset price pt with instantaneous volatility Ft. Suppose we sample this process discretely at m regular times


1
 The relevant literature includes Garman and Klass (1980), Parkinson (1980), Beckers (1983), Ball and Torous
(1984), Rogers and Satchell (1991), Kunitomo (1992), and Yang and Zhang (2000).
throughout the day, which lasts from time t to t+1, to obtain the intraday returns                               , for
         . Under conditions given in Andersen, Bollerslev and Diebold (2003), the variance of the discrete-time
returns over the one-day interval conditional on the sample path              is



                                                                                                                  (1)


The integrated volatility    thus provides a canonical and natural measure of return volatility, and it features
prominently in the financial economics literature (e.g., Hull and White, 1987). Because the integrated volatility
is inherently unobservable, several estimators have been proposed, including estimators based on daily returns
(e.g., daily squared or absolute returns), high-frequency intraday returns (e.g., the “realized volatility” of
Andersen, Bollerslev, Diebold and Labys, 2003), and the daily range. In particular, Parkinson’s (1980)
celebrated range-based estimator of the daily integrated variance is given by



                                                                                                                  (2)


The univariate range-based volatility estimator has several appealing properties. First, it is of course trivial to
compute. Second it is unbiased and highly efficient relative to competitors such as the squared or absolute daily
return (Andersen and Bollerslev, 1998). Finally, it is robust to certain types of microsrtucture noise, such as
bid-ask bounce (Alizadeh, Brandt and Diebold, 2002).

        Now consider the multivariate case. In parallel with our univariate discussion, consider a stochastic
volatility diffusion for a vector of log asset prices with diffusion matrix   , whose ij-th element we denote        .
Then, again under conditions given in Andersen, Bollerslev and Diebold (2003), the one-day conditional
covariance of the discrete-time returns on assets I and j is just the integrated instantaneous covariance,



                                                                                                                   (3)


The attractive blend of convenience, efficiency and robustness achieved by the range-based estimator in the
univariate estimation of integrated volatility (1) makes one hungry for extension to a range-based estimator of
the integrated covariance (3) in the multivariate case. We now proceed to do so. The basic idea is very simple,
and the implementation varies slightly depending on whether the application is to foreign exchange, bonds or
stocks. We consider each in turn.


                                                         -2-
        First consider foreign exchange. In foreign exchange markets, absence of triangular arbitrage implies a
deterministic relationship between any pair of dollar rates and the corresponding cross rate. Consider two dollar
exchange rates, denoted A/$ and B/$. Then, in the absence of triangular arbitrage, the cross-rate is


                                                                                                            (4)

                 and hence the continuously compounded A/B return is

Taking variances gives


                                                                                                            (5)



and solving for the covariance yields



                                                                                                            (6)


This suggests a natural covariance estimator,



                                                                                                            (7)


where           can in principle be any return variance estimator. Given the desirable properties of range-based
volatility estimation discussed above, we advocate the use of Parkinson’s (1980) range-based estimator in
equation (2). We then assemble the estimated variance-covariance matrix as




                                                                                                            (8)




In higher dimensional cases, we proceed in analogous fashion, estimating each pairwise covariance as above,
and then assembling the results into an estimated covariance matrix.

        Now consider fixed income markets, in which the absence of arbitrage implies a deterministic
relationship among any two zero-coupon bond prices and the corresponding forward contract. Specifically,

                                                       -3-
consider two bonds with maturities T1 and T2 and prices P(T1) and P(T2), with T1 <T2. The price of a forward
contract between times T1 and T2 is                               Taking logs gives                           and
then taking first differences gives                          and finally taking variances gives



                                                                                                               (9)


Hence we can form the covariance estimator,



                                                                                                              (10)


and assemble the estimated variance-covariance matrix precisely as in the foreign exchange case.

        Finally, consider equities. The return on a two-equity portfolio with shares       and    , denoted
                 , has a variance of



                                                                                                              (11)


which suggests the covariance estimator,



                                                                                                              (12)


This method of estimating the covariance via the range of the two-asset portfolio return is generally applicable
to any two assets – not just equities – if data on the portfolio return range are available.

 3. Discussion

 Our no-arbitrage approach to range-based covariance estimation is widely applicable in the foreign exchange
 context because daily ranges of all legs of many currency triangles are available. For example, Datastream
 provides as much as 40 years of historical data on the daily high, low, and closing prices of 37 British pound
 denominated currencies and 14 Swiss franc denominated currencies. The International Monetary Market, a
 subsidy of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, recently introduced futures and options contracts on Euro/British
 pound, Euro/Swiss franc, and Euro/Japanese yen cross rates. Finally, the New York Board of Trade offers
 futures contracts on 14 cross-currencies, including seven Euro denominated contracts.

                                                          -4-
        We hasten to add, however, that the practical applicability of our approach in other contexts is far
more limited. For fixed income, our approach is only directly applicable to select maturities for which liquid
bonds are aligned with liquid forward or futures contracts, such as the three- and six-month Eurodollar deposits
and the three-month Eurodollar futures. For equities, our approach will rarely be applicable, because historical
data on the range of two-asset portfolios are typically not available.2

        Thus far we have said little about the theoretical properties of the range-based covariance estimator.
One obvious point is that the covariance estimator is unbiased under the same conditions that deliver
unbiasedness of Parkinson’s (1980) variance estimator because it is a linear combination of variances.
Conversion to correlation, however, will introduce bias due to the nonlinearity of the transformation.

        A similarly obvious and related point is that        is in general not guaranteed to be positive definite. In
our experience, however, positive definiteness is rarely violated in practice. If desired, positive definiteness
can be imposed by estimating the Cholesky factor P of          , rather than   itself, where P is the unique lower-
triangular matrix defined by          . Note that the elements of P are functions of the elements of       . Hence
we insert our range-based estimators of the relevant variances and covariances into P (computed analytically)
to obtain an estimator of the Cholesky factor     and then form the estimator          of the covariance matrix.
Because the estimated Cholesky factor      will be complex when          is not positive definite, we define    as the
                                                         3
conjugate transpose, which guarantees that        is real.

        Ultimately, however, the interesting questions for financial economists center not on the theoretical
properties of range-based covariance and correlation estimates under abstract conditions surely violated in
practice, but rather on their performance in realistic situations involving small samples, discrete sampling, and
market microstructure noise. As we argued above, we have reason to suspect good performance of the range-
based approach, both because of its high efficiency due to the use of the information in the intraday sample
path, and because of its robustness to microstructure noise. We now turn to a brief Monte Carlo analysis
designed to illuminate precisely those issues.

4. Monte Carlo Exploration

We initially ignore market microstructure issues. We assume that two dollar-denominated exchange rates

the ASX 100, ASX 200, and ASX 300 indices of the Australian stock exchange.

 Other ways to guarantee positive definiteness include the shrinkage approach of Ledoit and Wolf (2001) or the
perturbation methods of Gill, Murray and Wright (1981) and Schnabel and Eskow (1999).

                                                        -5-
and         evolve as driftless diffusions with annualized volatilities F of 15 percent, a covariance of 0.9, and
hence a correlation D of 0.4. We further assume that at each instant the cross-rate           is determined by the
absence of triangular arbitrage as the ratio of the two dollar rates. Starting at                    , we simulate 24
hours worth of           regularly spaced intraday log price observations using:



                                                                                                                     (13)


where                ,        are standard normal innovations with correlation D, and there are 250 trading days per
year. We consider sampling frequencies m ranging from m=18 (one observation every 1 hour and 20 minutes)
to m=1440 (one observation every minute) and use the resulting data to compute the daily range and intraday
returns. We then construct three estimates of the volatilities, covariance, and correlation of the two dollar
rates. Specifically, we construct range-based covariance matrix estimates using Parkinson’s variance estimator
(2) and equation (7), and, for comparison, we compute the realized covariance matrix using two different
approaches. First, in parallel fashion to the range-based estimator, we use the three realized variances
constructed from the sum of squared intraday returns to obtain an estimate of the covariance. Second, we
compute the realized covariance directly using the cross-products of intraday returns. We repeat this
procedure 10,000 times and report the means, standard deviations, and root mean squared errors of the
resulting sampling distributions in Table 1.

            The results for the volatilities are familiar from Alizadeh, Brandt, and Diebold (2002).4 The range-
based estimates are downward biased because the range of the discretely sampled process is strictly less than
the range of the underlying diffusion. The magnitude of the bias decreases as the sampling frequency
increases. But, even in the limit as            , the range is still only a noisy volatility proxy, which means that the
standard deviation and RMSE of the range-based volatility estimator settle down to non-zero values. The
realized volatility behaves quite differently because it converges not only in expectation but also in realization
to the true volatility. The more frequently the underlying diffusion is sampled, the more precise the realized
volatility gets, until, in the limit, the standard deviation and RMSE of the estimator are zero.

            The results for the range-based covariance estimates follow from the properties of the range-based
volatility estimates. The estimator                                                             involves three volatility
estimates, each of which is downward biased by an amount that depends on the level of volatility (the higher
the volatility the more likely that the true extremes are far from the observed extremes). Because the variance

    Since      and       follow the same stochastic process, we analyze only the volatility estimates for     .

                                                             -6-
of    is less than the variance of      and    due to the positive covariance, the covariance estimates are also
downward biased because the downward bias of                              dominates the upward bias of
           . As with the volatility estimates, the bias vanishes as we increase the sampling frequency, and the
standard deviation and RMSE stabilize. The realized covariances, computed either through the no-arbitrage
condition or with return cross-products, yield identical estimates that inherit the outstanding properties of the
realized volatility estimates.

        Finally, the range-based correlation is downward biased, although, by construction, the covariance in
the numerator is less down-ward biased than the product of volatilities in the denominator (the correlation
evaluated at the average covariance and volatilities with             is 0.4336). The source of this bias is the
sampling variation of the covariance and volatility estimates through Jensen’s inequality. Because the
sampling variation does not vanish as          , the range-based correlation estimator remains downward biased
even in the limit. The realized correlation does not suffer from this bias.

        Bid-ask bounce is a well-known reality of financial market data. To examine its effect on the
covariance and correlation estimates, we augment the Monte Carlo experiment with a simple model of bid-ask
bounce and price discreteness taken from Hasbrouck (1999b). Specifically, we take the dollar rates from the
original experiment as the true prices and compute the bid and ask quotes                                         and
                                     , where               and                are functions that round   down or up
to the nearest tick, respectively. For the cross rate, we compute the bid and ask quotes by imposing no-
arbitrage given the bid and ask quotes of the dollar rates. We then take the observed prices as
                         , where                       . To capture the fact that the two base currencies are
denominated in dollars, which means that the sale or purchase of the dollar might involve a simultaneous
purchase or sale of the two currencies, we allow the buy-sell indicators        and      to be correlated with
                  . The indicator        is independent.

        Table 2 presents the results for a bid-ask spread of 0.0005 and a tick size of 0.0001, which are realistic
values for currencies (see Hasbrouck, 1999b). In Panel A the correlation 0 is set to zero and in Panels B the
correlation is 0.5. The effect of bid-ask bounce on the range-based estimates is relatively minor. In contrast,
the effect on the realized volatilities, covariance, and correlation is striking. Consistent with the intuition
outlined above, the realized volatilities are upward biased when the data is sampled more frequently than once
every three hours. By the time the data is sampled every minute, the bias inflates the true volatility by almost
100 percent (an average estimate of 29.7 percent as opposed to a true volatility of 15 percent). The results for
the realized covariance depend on whether we construct the estimator using the no-arbitrage condition or
return cross-products and on the correlation of the bid-ask indicators. If we use the no-arbitrage condition, the

                                                           -7-
realized covariance inherits the biases of the realized volatilities, to the point where for five-minute sampling
the average estimate is negative. In contrast, if we use return cross-products and if the bid-ask indicators are
independent (in Panel A), the realized covariance is unbiased. The reason is that if the bid-ask indicators are
independent, then the expectation of the product of observed returns is equal to the expectation of the product
of true returns. The bid-ask bounce therefore only increases the variability of the estimator. However, if the
bid-ask indicators are correlated (in Panel B), this argument no longer holds and the realized covariance is
severely positively biased because each cross-product of returns contains an upward bias due to the common
component of the bid-ask indicators. Finally, the realized correlation, computed from the biased realized
volatilities and biased covariance, is unreliable, ranging from -0.89 to 0.66.

        Finally, asynchronous trading is another market microstructure effect that is likely to affect differently
the range-based and realized covariance and correlation estimates. With infrequent trading, a security has a
latent true price that is only revealed when a trade occurs. Between trades, the observed price is stale at the
last traded price and therefore does not reflect the true price. In a univariate setting, infrequent trading induces
positive serial-correlation in the intraday returns, which, in turn, causes a downward bias in the realized
volatility. In a bivariate setting, asynchronous infrequent trading, when the trades for the two assets do not
take place at the same time, also creates a misalignment of the return-cross products that may lead to a
downward bias of the realized covariance.

        To capture the effect of asynchronous infrequent trading in our Monte Carlo experiment, we use the
discretization (13) with             (one observation per second) to simulate the latent “true” price processes.
We then assign for each process       trade times randomly throughout the day and construct stale price processes
for which the price is equal to the price at the previous trade time until it is reset to the latent true price at the
next trade time. Hence the true prices look like continuous diffusions while the stale prices look like discrete
steps that occur at different times for the different currencies. Finally, we sample these stale price processes at
a regular frequency      ranging again from four to 1440 and proceed just as in Table 1 (i.e., there is no bid-ask
bounce in this experiment).

        We present the results for             (an average of one trade every minute) in Table 3. The range-based
estimates are slightly downward biased because the infrequent trading magnifies the discretization bias. The
realized volatilities are slightly downward biased due to the positive serial correlation induced by infrequent
trading. Finally, when we compute the realized covariance and correlation using the no-arbitrage condition,
the estimates inherit only the slight bias from infrequent trading, but when we instead use return cross-
products, the estimates are severely downward biased. In particular, the average realized covariance and
correlation computed with return cross-products are close to zero in both panels. This extreme bias is due to

5. Conclusion

We have extended the important idea of range-based volatility estimation to the multivariate case. In
particular, we proposed a range-based covariance estimator motivated by financial economic considerations
(the absence of arbitrage), in addition to statistical considerations. We showed that, unlike other univariate and
multivariate volatility estimators, the range-based estimator is highly efficient yet robust to market
microstructure noise arising from bid-ask bounce and asynchronous trading. Many extensions and applications
of the ideas developed here are possible, and Brunetti and Lildolt (2002) take up several.

        An intriguing application, which to the best of our knowledge has not yet been explored, involves
constructing range-based volatility and covariance bets via a portfolio of lookback options. The payoff of a
lookback straddle (a lookback call plus a lookback put) is equal to the range of the underlying asset over the
life of the option. Therefore, lookback straddles are ideal for placing bets on the range-based volatility of an
asset: their payoffs are high (low) when volatility as measured by the range is high (low). Our no-arbitrage
approach to covariance estimation suggests an analogous way of placing bets on the covariance between two
assets. Consider a portfolio of a long A/$ lookback straddle, a long B/$ lookback straddle, and a short A/B
lookback straddle. Since each of the straddles is a variance bet, the payoffs of this portfolio are high (low)
when covariance between the two dollar rates is high (low) over the life of the option.

Two dollar denominated exchange rates         and     evolve as driftless diffusions with annualized volatility
F of 15 percent, covariance of 0.9, and correlation D of 0.4. At each instant the cross-currency rate     is
given by the absence of triangular arbitrage as the ratio of the two base currencies. Starting at              ,
we simulate 24 hours worth of regularly spaced intraday log prices using
                                    ,        , and                , for k=1,...m, where         and          are
standard-normal innovations with correlation D. The sampling frequency m ranges from 18 (one
observation every hour and 20 minutes) to 1440 (on observation every minute). We use this observed data
to compute the daily range and intraday returns and then construct three estimates of the volatilities,
covariance, and correlation. We construct range-based covariance estimates using Parkinson’s variance
estimator and                                                         . We construct realized covariance
estimates using either the realized variance estimator and the same expression for the covariance or using
the cross-products of intraday returns. We repeat this procedure 10,000 times and report the means,
standard deviations, and root mean squared errors.

tick size is 0.0001. For the cross-currency, we compute the bid and ask quotes by imposing no-arbitrage
given the bid and ask quotes of the base currencies. We then take the observed prices as

              Table 3: Range-Based and Realized Estimates with Asynchronous Trading
We simulate 24 hours worth of                regularly spaced intraday log prices (one price every second) for
three currencies as described in Table 1. We then assign to each log price process n=1440 trade times (an
average of one trade every minute) randomly throughout the day and construct stale price processes for
which the price is equal to the price at the previous trade time until it is reset to the latent true price at the
next trade time. We then sample these stale price processes at a regular frequency m ranging from 18 (one
observation every hour and 20 minutes) to 1440 (one observation every minute). We use this observed data
to compute the daily range and intraday returns and then construct three estimates of the volatilities,
covariance, and correlation. We construct range-based covariance estimates using Parkinson’s variance
estimator and                                                       . We construct realized covariance
estimates using either the realized variance estimator and the same expression for the covariance or using
the cross-products of intraday returns. We repeat this procedure 10,000 times and report the means,
standard deviations, and root mean squared errors.
