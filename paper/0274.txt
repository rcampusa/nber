                    The Dynamics of Youth Unemployment

          This paper analyzes the dynamics of youth unemployment. Three broad

conclusions emerge. First, the problem of youth joblessness extends beyond the

unemployed. We find that over one—half of youth unemployment spells end in

labor force withdrawal. Much of youth non—employment is not picked up in the

official unemployment statistics, because many young people give up the search

for work and leave the labor force. Second, a large part of youth unemployment

is accounted for by a relatively small, hard core group of young people who

experience long spells of unemployment. While most unemployment spells are short,

this is due to the high rates of labor force withdrawal, rather than to job

finding. Among male teenagers out of school, for example, we find that over half

of unemployment was due to those with more than six months of unemployment in the

year. Third, a shortage of attractive jobs is the principle source of long term

non—employment. While instability and frequent turnover are major factors in

determining the overall pattern of teenage unemployment, we find that the lack

of desirable employment opportunities is the crux of the problem for those most

seriously affected by youth unemployment.

Introduction

    At any moment during 1977, close to 1 million teenagers were unemployed, and

another 1/4 million ware out of school and neither working nor looking for work.

Close to 40 percent of young black men were unable to find work. These high

rates of joblessness have been a source of concern to both economists and policy—

makers. Two broad explanations of the cause of high youth unemployment rates

 have emerged. The turnover view emphasizes extremely frequent movements into and

 out of employment as the source of most youth unemployment. A

second view suggests that the real problem is a shortage of jobs. In this

paper, we use the ELS Gross Changes and Work Experience data to examine

these issues. We find that both views accurately describe a part of the youth

population. The vast najority of young people experience lLttlc cerieuz

difficulty in moving in and out of the labor market. Consistent with

 the job instability—turnover view, unemployment among this group arises

 from frequent lavor force exit and entry. A second, much smaller group

has serious difficulty in finding work. They suffer long and

frequent spells of joblessness, punctuated occasionally by a very brief spell

of employment. It is this group with substantial unemployment experience who

suffer most of youth unemployment.

    In Section 1 of the paper, we present the transition probabilities which

underlie the results in the remainder of the paper. After pointing up the

extraordinarily dynamic character of the youth labor market, we examine the

incidence and characteristics of unemployment spells. A key conclusion

which emerges is the concentration of most unemployment among a small subgroup

of the population.

     The second section of the paper studies the
                                                    relationship between schooling,
 seasonal fluctuations and teenage unemployment and employment. We find that

 the dynamic character of youth unemployment cannot be attributed in
                                                                        any large
 part to flows in and out of school. Indeed, it
                                                    appears that summer entrants
 actually have a lower unemployment rate than do other workers.

     In the third section of the paper, we relate differences in steady—state

 employment and unemployment rates to differences in flow
                                                             probabilities. This
 decomposition makes it possible to divide demographic differences in employment

 and unemployment into components due to instability and to difficulty in finding at-

 tractive jobs. We find that while
                                      instability is the dominant cause of high youth non—

employment, most of the racial differential is attributable
                                                               to difficulties in
finding suitable work.

    In Section IV, we support our earlier conclusion that a shortage of attractive
                                                                                   job
opportunities is a principal cause of teenage
                                                 unemployment by demonstrating the
responsiveness of both unemployment and participation to the level of aggregate

demand. Re also show that it is the cyclical
                                                 sensitivity of entry into employ-
ment, and exit from the labor force which gives rise to the
                                                               very pronounced
cyclic pattern of youth employment.

    The fifth and final section of the
                                         paper discusses the implications of the
results for economic policy, and considers the open questions which remain.

                                      I



       In recent years it has become fashionable to view youth unemployment as

 the result of high rates of turnover. On this view, youth unemployment is not

due to a shortage of jobs for young people. Rather, it occurs because young

people, especially teenagers, are unwilling or unable to hold jobs for very

long. Presentations of this "turnover" view of youth unemployment typically

focus on flows between unemployment and employment. Less attention is devoted

to movements into and out of the labor force. This section tries to present a

fuller picture of the youth labor market by examining in a systematic way

movements between all three labor market states (i.e. employment, unemployment,

and not in the labor force (NILF)). Our results indicate that flows into

and out of the labor force are dominant determinants of patterns of youth

employment. After presenting the basic data characterizing the dynamics of

youth labor markets, we focus on the distribution of unemployment by duration,

and the characteristics of unemployment spells.

The Basic Data

      The dynamics of the youth labor market are examined in this section using

the BLS gross changes data. Individuals included in the Current Population

Survey are in the sample for four months, then out for eight months, and then

in the sample for four months before leaving for good. The BLS prepares unpub—-

lished tabulations of gross changes —— two—way tabulations of labor force status

this month by labor force status last month. From these data, it is possible

to find the number of individuals who moved, for example, from unemployment to

employment during the last month. Since there are three possible labor market

states, nine monthly flows may be calculated.
                                             —4—




      We summarize the available information for each month in a 3x3 matrix of

 transition probabilities and a vector of three stocks.     Thus, for each of

several demographic groups we consider the matrix:


                           P        P              P
                               ee       eu             en

                           t'ue     uu             Pun            (1)

       -                   P        P              P
                            tie      nu                nn

where, for example, t'eu represents the proportion of employed workers last

monthwhowere unemployed this month. Since a worker must always he in one of

the three labor force states, the rows of P sum to 1. Therefore if any two

of the transition probabilities out of a state are known, it is easy to compute

the third. In order to calculate aggregate flows between states, we multiply

the transition probabilities by appropriate initial stocks.    This may be

conveniently represented in matrix form as:

where F. represents the flow of workers into state j from state i and

and Sn refer to the stock of workers employed, unemployed and not in the labor

force (NILF) respectively.

      Since much of the emphasis in this study is on labor force transitions,

it will be convenient to define a state L, for labor force, which includes both

E and U. It is clear that:

Transition Patterns

      In Table 1, we present average transition probabilities and flows for

various youth demographic groups and for the total population. A very striking

feature is the enormous magnitude of all the flows. For example, in an average

month, between 1968 and 1976, close to 15 percent or 644 thousand men aged 16—19,

who were in the labor force, withdrew. At the same time about 21 percent of those

outside the labor force or 652 thousand young men entered the labor force.

 Racial differences appear significant. Black youth are   significantly   less likely
 to get a job when unemployed, and to enter the labor force
                                                              successfully. They are
 also almost twice as likely to move from employment to unemployment as other teen-

 agers. More striking is the effect of aging on labor market behavior. Youths

between 20 and 24 are about 60 percent less likely to leave employment in a given

month than are teenagers. They are also much more likely to enter the labor force.

The greater labor force attachment of this group is also evidenced by their much

lower probability of withdrawal from the labor force when unemployed.

      It is clear from Table Li. that observed changes in rates of participation

and unemployment reflect the net of large gross movements in and out of the

labor force. As one would expect, young people,       especially teenagers,

have much higher transition rates in almost all directions. The role of labor

force entrance and exit flows in explaining youth employment and unemploy-

ment is examined in Table L2. The data in line 1 document the importance of

flows from outside the labor force in changes in employment. For most demo—

graphic groups, between 60 and 70 percent of those newly employed come directly
from outside the labor force without experiencing intervening
                                                                unemployment

      These results indicate the artificiality of the not—in—the labor force!

unemployment distinction for young people. Given the frequency of movements

between unemployment and not in the labor force, it is difficult to distinguish

between these two states. Since most of the newly employed come from outside

of the labor force, it appears that most job finding is not the result of active

search by the unemployed. Rather the evidence suggests the possibility that for

many teenagers, job search is a passive process, in which the main element is

 waiting for a job opportunity to be presented.    If so, unemployed and NILF

 teenagers may be functionally almost equivalent. This conclusion is strongly

 supported by the high rates of labor force withdrawal among unemployed
                                                                          teenagers.
 It seems reasonable to conjecture that many of those who withdraw would not have

withdrawn had a job opportunity became available in the month preceeding with-

drawal. It is of course possible that withdrawal also reflects workers who are

simply waiting for job opportunities to come, after a period of active search.

      The patterns of entrance suggest that the availability of jobs is an impor-

tant element in determining movements into and out of the. labor force. At the same

time, the evidence indicating that most teenagers end spells of employment by

withdrawing from the labor force provides some indication that teenage unemployment

arises from turnover. Among unemployed teenagers, the quit rate is about half

the job loss rate. However, it seems reasonable to conjecture that a large pro-

portion of those who withdraw from the labor force following employment are

quitters. If, for example,       it is assumed that 80 percent of this group is

made up of quitters, it follows that about two—thirds of teenage umployment spells

end in quits. For males in the 20—24 age group, about 60 percent of employment

separations end in quits. This illustrative calculation underscores how misleading

sole focus on unemployment can be. Of course, quits may reflect the perceived low

quality of available employment opportunities, as well as variation in the return

from alternative uses of time.

      There is an additional interesting implication of the results in Table 2.

The final row indicates that among young people, a relatively high proportion of

those who enter the labor force become employed directly. Among males 16—19,

about 64 percent of entrances are successful; among men 20—24, the corresponding

figure is 71 percent. Black entrants fare much less well, with less than half

of male teenagers entering successfully. The pattern does not appear to differ

very much by sex. This suggests that at least for white youths attractive jobs

are fairly readily available.

 Spell   Durations

         The results on flows and rates of transition in Tables 1.1 and 1.2 underscore

 the dynamic character of the youth labor market. The tremendous volatility in

 the market behavior of young persons may also be conveyed by examining the mean

 duration of completed spells in each of the states. It should be emphasized that

 the estimates presented below differ from the mean duration of those currently in

 each state. As Kaitz (1970), has shown, the former concept will yield lower es-

 timates than the latter. Table 13 presents estimates of mean duration of completed

 spells in each state. The brevity of mean durations in each of the states is

quite striking. For teenagers between 16 and 19, for example, the average dura-

tion of a spell of employment is only about 6 months, rising to about 15 months

for those between 20 and 24. Black youth typically experience even shorter

spells of employment. For black males between 16 and 19, the average duration

in employment is only about 4.7 months. These short durations are not primarily

the result of summer jobs. When the experiences of youth during the summer are

excluded from the calculation, the average duration of employment rises by only

about 10 percent.

        Given the brevity of employment spells, the typically short tenures inside

the labor force evident in column 2 should not be surprising. For female teen-

agers, the average completed spell inside the labor force is actually shorter

than the typical employment spell. This paradoxical result occurs because some

labor force spells involve only unemployment and are of very short duration.

Below   we present calculations indicating that a significant fraction of female—
teenage unemployment spells both begin and end outside the labor force. It is
these spells which reduce the average duration of completed spells within the
labor force.
        is interesting to compare the very different maturation experience of
        It

black men and women reflected in the duration rates. While black male teenagers

 have significantly shorter employment and labor force spells than does the overall

 group, the   difference evaporates for the 20—24 group. On the other hand, black

 female durations remain significantly below those of white women. Comparison of

 durations also shows that male and female teenagers have very similar experiences.

 However, between the ages of 20 and 24, the differences in labor market attachment

 which characterize adult men and women begin to appear. While male teenage labor

 force spells average only about 20 percent longer than those of women, the dif-

 ference rises to about 40 percent in the 20—24 age group.

      The brevity of spells in the labor force are mirrored by the short duration

of spells outside the labor force. For teenagers, time outside of the labor

market typically amounts to about 5 months, with little difference for the older

age group. It is noteworthy that this figure is much less than would result from

a pattern of participation only during the summer. Racial differences are not as

large as those between the sexes, with 'women and blacks experiencing longer NILF

spells.

      Tablel3 presents two estimates of the mean duration of completed unemployment

spells. The first, DU, measures the mean duration of unemployment actually expe-

rienced.   It is interesting that despite their much higher overall rate of unem-

ployment, teenagers actually have shorter average unemployment spells than do

the entire population. Black teenagers, who have an unemployment rate more than

twice that of white teenagers, experience spells that are only marginally longer.

Nor can the excess of teenage unemployment over that of the 20-24 group be accoun-

ted for by longer teenage spells. The older group experiences spells which are

about 30 percent longer than those of teenagers. These results suggest that vir-

tually all of the differences between group unemployment rates are the result of

changes in the number rather than the length of unemployment spells.

      The very brief spells of teenage unemployment ——   less   than two months on

average —— have been cited to support the proposition that jobs are readily
                                     —14—


 available for those who want them. It should be emphasized that the brevity of

 spells reflects both the ease with which teenagers find work, and the
                                                                         frequency
 with which they withdraw from the labor force. In the last column of the table

 we calculate mean durations for a hypothetical "indomitable" worker who never

 withdraws from the labor force, remaining unemployed until a job is found.

 Given the high rates of labor force withdrawal among the unemployed, it is not

 surprising to discover that this figure is much greater than the standard cal-

culation. For black men 16—19, the "indomitable worker1' duration is 5.3 months

compared to 1.9 months for the duration of all unemployment spells. Since almost

70 percent of unemployment spells among black women 20-24 end outside the labor

force, their "indomitable worker" duration is a shockingly high 9.36 months.

      These figures suggest that the ease with which many unemployed teenagers can

find jobs may have been substantially overstated. Much of the reason for short

durations of teenage unemployment isahigh propensity to withdraw from the labor

force. Of course, the "indomitable worker '   estimates   may be overly pessimistic

regarding the ease of job finding since some of the unemployed probably do not

really want to find work, and hence spuriously reduce the probability of transi-

tion from unemployment to employment.

      The results in Table 13 suggest that differences in mean durations of unem-

ployment spells cannot account for disparities in group unemployment rates. Since

unemployment rates may be represented as the product of average duration, and

spell frequency, the cause of differing group unemployment rates must be differ-

ences in theJfrequency of unemployment spells. Table IA illustrates that this is

in fact the case. Black teenagers who are in the labor force have twice as high

an unemployment rate as other teenagers, and experience about twice as many unem-

ployment spells per year: 1.83 per member of the labor force compared to 1.08

for all teenagers. Alternatively, spell frequency may be expressed per member of the

population. Even on this basis, the number of spells is strikingly high with

        The great frequency of spells of unemployment can easily be misinterpreted.

 First, the fact that there are many short unemployment spells does
                                                                           not imply that
 most unemployment is due to short spells. Second, the welfare and
                                                                           policy implica—
 tionsof the frequency of unemployment spells depend quite critically on whether

 a relatively few individuals have many spells or vice—versa. Third, the way in

 which the spells begin and end is also very relevant. Clark and Summers (1978)

 show that many people experience several spells of unemployment separated only

 by brief periods outside the labor force.

 Characteristics of Unemployment Spells

       En   this subsection we examine in greater depth the characteristics of

 teenage unemployment spells. We noted above that the brevity of most unemploy-

ment spells does not imply that most unemployment is accounted for by short

spells since the few long spells may account for the bulk of total weeks of

unemployment. In order to characterize more fully the distribution of

unemployment by spell length and to examine differences in the duration of

spells which end in employment and labor force withdrawal, we use the hazard

functions technique developed in Clark and Summers (1978 ).          From estimated

hazard functions, it is possible to generate density functions for the duration

of completed spells ending in both unemployment and labor force withdrawal.

      A hazard    function relates the probability of exit from a state to the
duration    in the state. We generalize the notion usually employed in reliability

theory by estimating separate hazard functions for exit to unemployment, and

to out of the labor force. The data come from the BLS gross—change tabulations. They

make available the probability of:ncving from unemployment to employment, and from

unemployment to not in the labor force, within the succeeding month for those unemployed

0-4weeks, 5.6 weeks, 7—10 weeks, U—l4 weeks, 15—26 weeks and 27+weeks.     The aggregate pro-

babilities for 1974 are presented in Table 15. To estimate hazard functions we fit    curves

by associating each range probability with the range midpoint. Various

functional forms were tried with only miniscule effects on the conclusions.

Results with the logarithmic form are presented here, since its performance

was marginally superior. Thus, for each group we estimated a pair of

 equations:


               Pue =a 1 +flnt+u
                          1    1
                                                            (5)

                          2    2

where t indicates the range midpoint.

      Typical regression results for men and women are presented in Table 1.6.

The data quite clearly reject the simple Markov model. In virtually all cases

the transition probabilities are dependent on duration. This could be the

result of two quite different effects. First, it may be that the longer one

is unemployed, the more difficult it becomes to find a job, and the less one

can afford to take time off from job search and leave the labor force. Second,

the observed duration dependence may be the result of heterogeneity. If each

individual has a constant escape probability, those who remain unemployed

longest will on average have the lowest escape probabilities and the observed

escape probability will decline with duration.

      The observed hazard functions are used to create monthly transition

probabilities. This is done by assuming that each monthly transition may be

approximated by the probability at the month's midpoint. Given P and

for each month j, the distributionof completed spells is easily computed. For

example, the proportion of spells ending in labor force withdrawal after t

months is:

The proportion of spells of unemployment lasting more than t periods, and

ending in labor force withdrawalH(t) is:


                     Hun(t) =
                                    t+1

       From the density functions, the mean lengths of completed spells, and

the proportion of unemployment accounted for by spells of a given length may

be computed. For example the mean length of completed spells ending in labor

force withdrawal is:


                               Eh un
                                   (t)t

                               Eh (t)
                              t=l

Similar calculations yield the mean duration of completed spells ending in

employment and of total completed spells.

        The   proportion of all unemployment accounted for by each type of spell
may also be calculated from the density function of completed spells. If the
flow   into unemployment is F, the number of people unemployed at any moment t is:


                      S = pU        un (t)   + EH (t))            (9)
                       U                      0ue

The proportion of unemployment due to, for example, labor force exiters is:


                      (En (t))
              —
          flu —        oun
                                                                  (10)

In   a similar way, the proportion of unemployment accounted for by those with

spells which will exceed k weeks when they are completed can be calculated:


                           + H(t)) + (k)(H(k) + Hue(k))
          =   t=kun1t)                                           (11)

the dynamics of unemployment. For all four groups the vast majority of spells

are short, with significantly less than half ending in under a month.      However

much of the unemployment is concentrated in longer spells. For men 18—19,

the 72% of spells which last less than 1 month accounted for 45% of 1976 unemploy-

ment, while the 6% of spells which lasted 3 or more months accounted for 37%

of the unemployment. This also suggests that a large amount of teenage

unemployment can be attributed to genuine problems in finding suitable work. Again

it should be emphasized that these statistics are bound to underestimate the

importance of long term joblessness, since many of those who cannot find

work withdraw from the labor force. Moreover, they do not reflect the

experience of those who have long spells of joblessness interrupted only by

very brief spells of employment.

Work Experience Survey

      The hazard function calculations suggest that much of the youth unemploy—

meat problem may be the result of fairly long spells of unemployment. As just

emphasized, those results underestimate the magnitude of the long term problem

because of labor force withdrawal and multiple unemployment spells, separated

only briefly by employment experiences. The importance of these issues in

determining the length of spells may be addressed using the work experience

survey conducted in March of each year. In Table 1.8 we present various

features of the distribution of unemployment experiences as reflected in the

March 1977 survey of work experience in 1976.

      The key conclusion which emerges from the table is that a large part

of youth unemployment is concentrated among a relatively small number of

teenagers who suffer fairly long—term unemployment.   The first line of the

table provides average weeks of unemployment for those who experienced unem—

ployment during 1976. Men aged 16—19 who suffered unemployment averaged

three and four months worth, while the typical experience for women was

somewhat shorter, averaging about 2 1/2 months. These figures are much

greater than the mean duration of spells of unemployment, both because of

multiple spells and retrospective underreporting of labor force withdrawal

(Clark and Summers, 1978 ).   Most unemployment is concentrated among those

who experience more than the mean amount. The calculations reported in the

table show that for men 16—19 who are out of school, the 14% of those with

work experience who suffered more than 14 weeks of unemployment accounted

for fully 77% of total group unemployment, while the 7.6% of men who were

unemployed more than 26 weeks suffered 53% of total group unemployment. For

females, the burden of unemployment is somewhat more evenly shared.

      The calculations in lines 1—5 do not take account of those who had no

work experience during the year, or those who withdrew from the labor force

because of inadequate job opportunities. Accordingly, we present in line 6

the distribution of "non—employment" for those with work experience during

the year. The omission of those with no employment during the year obviously

leads to a significant underestimate of the burden of long tern non—employment.

Nonetheless, non—employment is to a large extent concentrated among those

with very little work experience. Among men who are out of school, the group

for whom this calculation is most meaningful, about 75% of non—employment is

concentrated among the group suffering more than 30 weeks of joblessness.

     These results strongly suggest that teenage unemployment problem largely may

be the result of a small hard core's inability to find attractive work. If this is

the case, much of the volatility depicted in this section nay be misleading.

It appears that there are really two quite different groups of young people

in the labor market. Most young people move in and out of employment quite

easily and frequently. A small group who cannot find and hold jobs are the

source of most of the unemployment problem.

                  Seasonality and the Youth Labor Market

      The dynamic character of the youth labor market is often attributed, in

part, to flows into and out of school, particularly during the summer months.

In this section we briefly consider seasonal movements in employment and

unemployment, and the relationship between enrollment status and labor market

behavior. While our results confirm the importance of school entrance and

exit, they make it plain that these flows can account for at most a small part

of movements into and out of the labor force. We find that a large proportion

of those in school work full time, while a similarly sizable percentage of those

not enrolled have no work experience during a typical year. The evidence

suggests that no more than about 20 percent of teenagers follow the traditional

pattern of working only during the summer and withdrawing from the labor force

for the remainder of the year. We are led to conclude that seasonal movements

cannot in any way explain the high youth unemployment rate. Indeed, the

evidence indicates that those who enter the labor market only during the

summer have a lower than average unemployment rate. Augmented to some extent

by public policy, the labor market appears to do a remarkably good job of

accommodating the summer influx of youth.

Seasonal Variation in Labor Market Flows

      In Table 2.1 , we examine the changes over the year in various key

labor market rates for males 16—19. Seasonal patterns do not vary much

among youth groups, and the male 16—19 group is fairly typical. The first

line provides the unemployment rate for the summer months and the remainder

of the year. No significant increase in the unemployment rate occurs during

the surer months. Indeed, the rates in May, July, August and September are

actually lower than the rate over the rest of the year. Of course, the number of

unemployed persons rises substantially because as the second row     shows, the
participation rate soars. The participation rate in July is almost 40% more

than its annual average. As line 3 indicates, a parallel rise in the employed

proportion of the population also takes place. Not surprisingly the vast majority

of this increase in employment is due to summer—only workers. In the fourth

line of the table, we present the proportion of the population who enter the

labor force in each month. In June, almost 21 percent of the male teenage

population enters the labor force. This figure represents close to 50% of

the NILF category. Another 12 percent of the population enter the labor force

in July. Of course a certain amount of labor force entrance occurs in all

months,averaging about 7 percent of the population. Contrasting this figure

with the entry rates for May, June and July one finds that during the summer

months about an extra 20 percent of the population enter the labor force. Note

that this is a substantial underestimate of the extent of the increase in

youths' labor supply, since many teenagers shift from desiring part time to

seeking full time work during the summer months. Comparisons of the seasonality

in teenage labor market behavior with the patterns observed for other demo-

graphic   groups leads us to conclude that about three—quarters of summer
entrances are due to school ending rather than fluctuations in employment
opportunities.
        Not surprisingly the high rates of labor force entrance in June and
July   are mirrored by high rates of labor force exit in August and September.

During   these   months, about 33% of the teenage population exits from the labor

force. Since the rate of withdrawal in a typical month is about 7%, the extra

labor force exits during August and September almost exactly offset the extra

entrances in the early summer months. Thus, both the flow and the stock data

suggest that employment only during the sumfier months characterizes the behavior
                                      —29-.




of about 20% of male teenagers.

        The labor market appears to adapt very well to the surge in those seeking

employment. In June when the inflow is at its peak, about two—thirds of labor

force entrants find jobs. This figure is actually greater by about 5% than
the rate of successful entry during the remainder of the year. Those who do
become unemployed during the summer months fare much better than the unemployed

in other months, as the job finding rate P     in May, June, and July far exceeds

the rate in the non—summer months. The fact that these flow rates are

significantly higher during the summer months suggests that the additional

members of the labor force may have an unemployment rate much lower than that

of full year workers. Clearly, the average unemployment rate over the summer

months is lower than during the rest of the year. This suggests that the

summer influx of teenaaers actually reduces the average annual unemployment

rate, since the additional workers appear to fare substantially better both

as labor force entrants and as unemployed job seekers than do other teenagers.

This quite striking fact bears futher comment.

        Undoubtedly, public employment and training policy affects the behavior

of labor market flows during the summer months. Over the first 6 years of the

period covered in Table 2.1, (1968—1973), the federal government provided an

average of .5 million summer jobs through the Neighborhood Youth Corps. The

NYC was eliminated with the enactment of CETA in 1973, but summer jobs remain

a component of the decentralized employment and training system. In 1976,

for example, just over 820 thousand jobs were provided in the CETA summer

program. The great majority of participants were classed as economically

disadvantaged (95.9 percent), drawn from the unemployed or from outside the

labor force (98.7 percent), and were full time students (87.8 percent). A

comparison of the size of the federal summer program with the average flow
                                    —30—



into the labor force reveals the relative importance of the summer jobs

program. From 1968—1976, an average of 600 thousand summer jobs were provided

through NYC and CETA, while the data in Table 2.1 suggest that about 3 million

teenagers left school and entered the labor market each summer.

     The limited size of the summer jobs program clearly suggests that a

large number of young people are able to find jobs in the private sector. The

ability of the job market to accommodate an a]nost 50% increase in those desiring

work without any increase in the unemployment rate is testament to an impressive

set of institutional and market adaptations. The ability of the labor market to

deal with the large inflow of workers in summertime should lead one to question

demographic explanations of recent increases in youth unemployment. As Table

2.1 shows, •the labor market is able to deal with a three—fold increase

in the proportion of the population newly seeking work, without an

appreciable    increase in individualsT difficulty in finding

employment.   It seems improbab'le that the samelabor market should

be incapable of adapting to the easily forseen, persistent, and much smaller

increase in the labor force due to demographic shifts. Indeed, the problem

should be much simpler because in this case the time frame is much longer

and there is no need to create very temporary jobs. While adaptations such

as replacing vacationing workers and work scheduling are less feasible in

this case, the longer run should permit much greater flexibility.

School Enrollment and Work Experience

      The results presented in Table 2.1 make it clear that the "only works in

the summer1' pattern accurately describes the behavior of only about a fifth

of the teenage population. While it is clear from the table that several lag

transition probabilities differ ir suer and other months, comparison of the

"Rest of Year' and "Annual" columns suggests that the summer months cannot
                                      —31—




 account for much of the high flow rates documented in Section 1. For example,

 the rate of labor force entry NL which may be calculated from Table 2.1)

 averages .0837 on an annual basis and .073 in the non—summer months. The rate

 of labor force exits is .071 on an annual basis compared with .086 during the

 non—summer months. In order to understand the behavior of 80% of young people

 not characterized by the "summer only" pattern, we make use of the 1970 Census

work experience survey.

         For each of the demographic groups shown in Table 2.2, we have estimated

 the proportion possessing various degrees of labor market attachment. The

 in—school groups are divided into five categories: 1) non—workers, defined

as those not in the labor force in March 1970 and without work experience during

 1969; 2) summer only, defined as those not in the labor force in March, who

had 1—13 weeks of employment experience during 1969; 3) part year, no sulmuer,

defined as those in the labor force, but without prior work experience; 4) part

year, defined as those with more than a summer's work experience, but signif i—

cantly   less than a full time work experience during 1969; and 5)   full year,

defined as those in the labor force in March 1970 who worked more than 40

weeks during 1969. The out of school group is divided similarly into

non—workers, part year workers, and near full time workers.

        The statistics in Table 2.2 support the inference from the flows data

that   no more than one—fifth of the teenage population follq the "summer only"
employment pattern. Surprisingly, among all the demographic groups except men
18   and 19, non—work is much more cornon than "sunnuer only" employment.   Among

men 16—19, many more work nearly full time than during the summer. These
two in—school groups, the non—workers and full time workers explain why the
summer flows are not even larger. The racial differences in the experiences

of enrolled youth are quite large. Non—white men 18—19 are about 6O more likely

 to have no   work experience and are about half as likely to work full time as
 the   total group. Not surprisingly the degree of labor force attachment of 18
and 19 year olds is significantly greater than that of younger workers in all
race—sex groups.
        The proportion of those   out of school and their degree of labor force

attachment    differs significantly among the groups. Among men 18—19, close to
a   third of the population is out of school and has a substantial degree of

labor force attachment. While two—thirds of non—white men of the same age

have left school, only about 30% exhibit significant attachment, with another

11 percent who are complete non—workers. Younger persons, 16—17, who have

left school seem to have great difficulty finding employment. In most cases,

the proportion with no work experience at all exceeds the fraction with

significant amounts of employment experience. As in the other results in this

paper, the dismal plight of the thrice disadvantaged group of young black women

stands out. Of those not in school, only a third show a significant attachment

while another third do not work at all.

        In sum, the results in Table 2.2 suggest that the role of schooling in

the teenage labor market can easily be overstated. The nlsummer only" pattern

characterizes only a minority of the teenage population. About 25% of young

people who do not work at all are out of school, while a somewhat higher

proportion of full year workers are enrolled in school. These figures lead

us to conjecture that if gross—changes data were separately available on an

enrolled and non—enrolled basis, the patterns which would emerge for both

groups would not be too different from those depicted in Section I.

           Demographic Differences in Employment and Unemployment

        In this section we attempt to get at the reasons for demographic differences

in unemployment and employment patterns. The basic technique used involves

decomposing differences in group unemployment and employment rates into parts

due to disparities in each of the flow probabilities. liarston (197C) has

presented similar decoraponitionc of unemployment differences using data for a

shorter period. Such a decomposition can shed light on appropriate policies

to coutbat low rates of employment. A finding that high youth unemployment

rates were caused by frequent labor force withdrawal followed by re—entry

would clearly have very different implications from a result suggesting -

that    the main cause was a low rate of transition from unemployment into

employment. After developing the decomposition technique, we apply it to

explain age, race, and sex differences in unemployment and employment rates.



The Method

        In Table 1 of the first section we presented transition probability

matrices for each of the demographic groups examined in this study. The

Basic Theorem of Markov Chains holds that any system characterized by such a

matrix will eventually reach a steady state which is independent of initial

conditions. This steady state proportion of the population in each state may

be found as a function of the entire transition matrix. In showing these
                                                                                               th
relationships we let       represent the proportion of the population in the J.

state   at time t, and P represents the matrix of transition probabilities

discussed in Section 1.

        The relationship between 7i       and              may be written in matrix form as:


                                          =   P'iT
                                 11
                                      t              t—1                     (3.1)
                                            —3 5—




 In a steady state,               and so:


                       (I —   P')ir   = o                        (3.2)

 where It is the steady state value of the vector It. The system (3.2) has an

 infinity of solutions since the fact that the row sums of P are all 1 implies

 the singularity of (I —   F').   We choose a unique solution by imposing the

 natural normalization that Err. =     1.    This system of equations can be solved

 to find expressions for the It's as func:Nons of the transition matrices. Since

 the algebra is somewhat tedious, and the results have no apparent intuitive

appeal, the details are relegated to Appendix 2.

      It should be emphasized that calculations of sample proportions from

changes data are not likely to match exactly rates from the regular survey.

The steady state assumptions which underly the decomposition are not satisfied

in practice. However, it is hoped that the use of 8—year averages will yield

a fairly close approximation. More importantly, the Markov assumption of a

constant transition probability independent of the amount of time spent in a

state is not likely to be satisfied. The consequences of this problem cannot

easily be estimated.

      Using each group's transition probabilities, we calculate the implied

steady state employment and unemployment rates. To evaluate the sources of

differences between two groups, we recalculate the "basic" group's steady state

rates, substituting one at a time, the other group's transition probabilities.

For example, to decompose the difference between Black and Total unemployment

rates, we would first calculate the Black and Total rates inplied by the

respective group transitionprobabilities. We would then recalculate the Black

rate using the Total value for l2' and subtract this from the actual Black

rate. This yields the differential attributable to the differences in P12.

We repeat the process for each of the six transition probabilities.
                                               —36—



       Before turning to the results, it is necessary to discuss a transformation

 which makes the decompositiai exercise more meaningful. Rather than using the

 transition probabilities, "tie and P, we have used P1 and                   the   total
 probability of labor force entrance and the probability of successful
                                                                                   entry,
 respectively. These probabilities may be calculated as


               Pnl p nu+p              tie



                       =         P
              P                   ne
                  ns
                           flu         ne

These probabilities have more meaningful economic interpretations than do the

untransformed variables.

      In analyzing the results, differences in employment and unemployment

rates may be informally divided into two parts ——            those due to instability and
to inability to find work. Roughly, differences due to P               disparities may

be classed as reflecting job instability while those due to P   and P
                                                             ue       ns
differentials may be attributed to inability to find work. These three proba-

bilities account for the bulk of demographic differentials. The remaining

probabilities P              and P

                                       un give much smaller and less easily interpreted
differences. Since most of the P
                                eu flow reflects job loss, rather than
quitting, and labor force entrias respond to available opportunities, it seems

most plausible to attribute differences due to these probabilities to

difficulties in finding work.

      The decomposition of demographic differences in employment and uneinploy—

ment into differences in transition probabilities are presented in tables 3.1

to 3.4.. To provide perspective and to highlight the transition patterns

specific to young people, we first examine the differences between the youth

experience and the experience of the total population. The first 6 columns of
                                      —37—



 3.1 indicate the percentage point difference between the actual youth employ-

ment ratio (unemployment rate) and the actual youth employment ratio
                                                                        (unemploy-
ment rate) and the ratio which would obtain if the particular youth transition

probability were replaced by the value for the total population. Thus, for

example, the number in column 1 for men 16—19 indicates that the employment

ratio of male teenagers would be almost 19 percentage points higher if that

group's probability of leavin& employment and the labor force     en took on
the total population values. A similar interpretation applies to columns 2—6.

Column 7 contains the summation of the first six columns, which we have

labelled "estimated total difference." Because of approximations used in

the calculations, the estimates may differ from the difference measured by the

monthly cps, presented in column S.

      The results for the employment ratio in Table 2.1 underscore the impor-

tance of labor force transitions in the teenage labor market. Irrespective

of the race—sex group, the largest differences between teenagers and the

total population arise in the probability of leaving employment and the

labor force en and in entering the labor force            The effect of

differences in the propensity to move from emploment to unemployment (column 2)

are much smaller.   These results seem consistent with the view   advanced   earlier

that fluctuations in teenage employment are dominated by movements in and out

of the labor force, with movement through the unemployment state playing a

relatively subordinate role. It appears that the difference in the employ-

ment ratio between teenagers and the total population lies not in differences

in the propensity to obtain a job (i.e., rue'       but in the higher rates

of movement out of employment. mong blacks, this conclusion must be

qualified. For black males, and particularly for black female teenagers, dif-

ferences in the probabilities of obtaining employment are much more important

than is the case for the total teenage group. For black men, differences in

ns and "ue account for close to S percentage points of the difference in

employment ratios; for black women the figure is 10.5 points Even among

blacks, however, differences in the probability of leaving employment are

large and important.

      The patterns observed in the comparison of employment ratios are altered

somewhat in the unemployment results. Differences in employment stability

remain important, but the relative importance of differences in the probability

of finding a job increase. This is particularly true of black teenagers. Among

women, for example, differences in the rate of accession to employment, either

from unemployment or from out of the labor force, are equally as important as

greater job instability (i.e., n' "eu in accounting for the large difference

in rates of unemployment between the total population and black female teenagers.

The importance of differential job finding success is also evident in the

results for 20—24 year olds. For black females in that age group, the estimated

difference in the unemployment rate of 15 points is largely accounted for by

differences in the probability of obtaining employment. Job instability

among black females, particularly "en' is clearly much less important for the

older age group. This is also true for the total female 20—24 group. In this

connection it is important to note the evident increase in labor force attachment

of men 20—24. Differences in P   for men 20—24 are miniscule, and much of

the difference in unemployment rates arises from differences in P, which

may reflect both the tendency for less senior people to be laid off first, as

well as quit behavior. In general, the differences between the total population

and those 20—24 suggests that the latter group behaves much more like adults

than like teenagers.


Age Differences

      The differences between teenagers and what might be called young adults

(20—24) are examined in greater detail in Table 3.2. The interpretation

attached to the data is similar to that in Table 3.1, except that here,

probabilities for the 20—24 year old group have been substituted into equations

for teenagers. The entries in the table confirm the impressions developed in

Table 3.1. For virtually all demographic groups employment instability in the

form of P   is the dominant source of age differences in employment ratios and

rates of unemployment. Young adults in all race—sex groups have a much lower

propensity to end spells of employment; greater job attachment is largely due

to a lower probability of leaving employment by leaving the labor force. Dif-

ferences in the rate of movement into employment play a moderate role in

determining age differences in the unemployment rates of blacks and the total

female category. The key job entrance probability is ens' the probability of

successful labor force entry rather than the probability of obtaining a job

if unemployed. The magnitude of the difference due to P5 is much smaller

than the job instability component, but sizeable nonetheless. For black

women, ns accounts for 7 points of the unemployment rate disparity, which

is about the size of the P   effect. Similar relative magnitudes characterize
                          en

other demographic groups.

Sex Differences

        Table 3.3 examines male/female differences in the employment ratio and

unemployment rate. The clearest conclusion to be drawn from the table is the

importance of differences in the propensity to enter the labor force in

determining differences in the employment ratio. This finding emerges in

each group, but is particularly evident in the total 20—24 category. Among

blacks, entrance probability differences are less important. Sex differences

   ns and ue play an important role in the teenage category, while differences

in employment instability (F) rather than labor force entry are the major

factor among black 20—24 year olds.

        Except for black teenagers, unemployment rate differences are

generally quite small. Within the black teenage category, much of the male!

female disparity appears to be due to a greater difficulty in entering the

labor force successfuly, and in obtaining a job if unemployed. Together

with the results in Tables 3.1 and 3.2, the evidence on sex differences under-

scores the disparity between black female teenagers and all other groups.

Black young women seem to suffer substantially, by being handicapped three

ways.


Differences by Race

        The calculations in tables 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3 have suggested substantial

racial differences in the relative importance of job instability and job finding

in determining movements in employment and unemployment. The role of job

finding and instability in racial differences are examined more directly in

Table 3.4. Looking first at results for the employment ratio, the evidence

suggests that racial differences are largely the result of differences in

the probability of obtaining employment. Among teenagers, P      and 1'ue account

for 6.6 points of the difference in the male employment ratio, and 7.8 points

in the female ratio. The job finding probabilities are also important for

the 20—24 age group. The dominance of differential success in finding jobs

should not obscure the importance of job instability, particularly for

teenagers. Although smaller than the effect of the job finding probabilities,

differences in P   and P    are not trivial. For both men and women, movement
                en       eu
from employment out of the labor force is the dominant source of racial

differences in employment arising from job instability. In both cases, 4

points of the employment ratio difference between black and total is due to

differences in P
                eu
      The result that job finding probabilities are a major factor in determining

racial differences in employment is repeated in the unemployment calculations.

Indeed, the dominance of P an P         is even more striking. For male teen—
                          ns      ue

agers, for example, 9.5 points of the black—total unemployment rate differen-

tial is due to differences in the likelihood of entering     employment upon

entering the labor force, or obtaining a job if unemployed. For female

teenagers, differential success in job finding accounts for almost 16 points

of the difference in the black/total unemployment rate. Job finding differ-

ences are also a major factor for the 20—24 age group. In each of the demo-

graphic groups, job finding is on the order of two times as important as job

instability in determining the unemployment differential.

      Two main conclusions arise out of the decompositions presented in this

section. Much of the disparity between youth and total unemployment and

employment rates is due to their much higher rates of labor force exit, only

a small proportion of which can be attributed to schooling. Thus the "insta-

bility" view can -explain much of the youth unemployment problem. On the other

hand, a large part of the disadvantage which some groups of young people

(especially blacks, and to a lesser extent women) suffer, is due to real

          The Cyclical Response of Employment and Unemployment


      The cyclical behavior of employment and unemployment is a dominant feature

of labor markets. The unemployment rates of different demographic groups move

together, though the levels about which they fluctuate differ greatly. Just

as the average levels of unemployment for different groups diverge, the ampli-

tude of their cyclical fluctuations varies substantially. An assessment of

the benefits and costs of tight labor markets requires consideration of which

groups will benefit the most. ih this section we examine the sensitivity of

youth unemployment to business cycle conditions, using stock and flow data.

The results reveal a pronounced cyclical response in both kinds of data. The

evidence thus underscores the strong impact of aggregate demand on the youth

labor market.


Employment, Unemployment and Participation

     The cyclical sensitivity of unemployment is the reflection of two quite

different phenomena. Unemployment can increase either because fewer jobs

are available or because more workers decide to seek the available jobs. These

two sources of unemploymen obviously have quite different welfare implications.

While the former is almost certainly indicative of a worsening of labor market

performance, the latter nay reflect an improvement in conditions. Focus only

on unemployment rates is thus very likely to be misleading. Moreover, the

results in section 1 suggest that NILE—unemployed distinction is quite arbi-

trary. These considerations indicate the importance of examining the cyclical

behavior of employment, unemployment, and participation.

      These three measures summarize the labor market experience of a given

demographic group. They are related by the following identity:


                      =
                          () (ft)                (4.1)
                                     48—



where E is emp].oyment, N is population, L is labor force, and I indexes demo-

graphic groups. Taking logs and differentiating yields:


                  d in fti   d in      + d
                                                  Ni           (4.2)


Thus changes in the employment ratio may   be   decomposed into changes in employ-

ment and participation rates. Since persons in the labor force are eithter

employed or unemployed it is clear that:


                 d ln     = d in (1 — UK). + d in (i).
                                                               (4.3)

where UR is the unemployment rate.

      The results of the decomposition in Table 4.1 show clearly the importance

of fluctuations in participation during the past few years. For young women,

changes in participation are generally much larger than changes in the rate

of unemployment. While movements in participation are less pronounced for

young men, they still account for a significant part of movements in employ-

ment. It is thus clear that serious studies of the youth labor market must

examine both unemployment and participation. This point has been drive home

by recent experience. Over 60 percent of the increase in youth employment

which occurred between 1976 and 1977 was due to increases in employment rather

than reductions in unemployment. For black youth, the situation is even more

striking. The black male unemployment rate has risen, while at the same

time the employment ratio has increased due to the surge in participation.


A Simple Model

      The cyclical responsiveness of the youth labor market is estimated using a

quite simple model. For each group we postuate that the unemployment rate and

participation rate are functions of aggregate demand, seasonal factors, and

where UPRIME is the unemployment rate of men 35—44, T is the time trend, T67
is a second time trend which begins in 1967, and Si are monthly dummies.

      The specification of (4.4) is traditional in analyses of participation.

The prime male unemployment rate is assumed to measure variation in job oppor-

tunities and the ease of job finding. Since workers may respond to changes in

the availability of jobs with a delay, lagged unemployment is also included

in the equation. While equations of this sort have not been extensively

used in studying the cyclical behavior of group unemploument rates, they are

justified by essentially the same arguments.

      The model is not designed to provide the best or most detailed explanation

of the participation (unemployment) rate of each group. Our purpose is to

estimate a common model for each group which captures the response of parti-

cipation (unemployment) to cyclical fluctuations in aggregate demand. Thus

some potential explanatory variables have been excluded precisely because they

vary cyclically. Others have been omitted because they are essentially ortho-

gonal to the variables included.

     The specification appears to be quite robust. The results presented

below are almost completely insensitive to changes in the measure of aggregate

demand, or variations in the entry of the second time trend. We have also
                                     —51—



examined other variables which have been suggested in recent work (e.g. Wachter

1977). Our experimentation suggests that neither demographic variables, infla-

tionary expectations, or measures of household wealth and liquidity have any

systematic effect on participation. Moreover, our results decisively reject

theories of labor supply which emphasize the timing of participation and the

intertemporarl substitution of leisure and work, and which explain unemployment

as a voluntary phenomenon. In any event, these variables have little impact

on the estimate of cyclical effects. We have also experimented with a

minimum wage variable. While it is sometimes significant, it has little impact

on the estimated cyclical effects and so the results are not reported here.

      The interpretation of the coefficients of the model is straightforward.

For example, the cyclical responsiveness of the participation rate of the
                      i
group is measured by TPR =
                             6t—f
                                     A value of
                                                    i
                                                        of 1.0 implies that a 1%

increase in aggregate demand (e.g., UPRUC declines from .06 to .05) produces
                                                       th
a 1 percent increase in the participation rate of the i   group (e.g., .430

to .434). Equations (4.4) and (4.5) have been estimated using both annual

and monthly data for the period (1948—1977) for various demographic groups.

the identity (1) along with the properties of ordinary least squares insures

that the relationship between the employment ratio, aggregate demand and time

is given by:


      ln(EN). =     — a0   + Z(S.                       +     (Bk —

                                                                             (4.6)
               + (S —   1)t +   (62 — 4'2)T67 + £


It follows immeidately that the equations presented here can be used to decom-

pose cyclical movements in the employment ratio into unemployment and parti-

cipation components since:
                            i     i    i
                           'EN = PR — TUR                      (4.7)
                                     —52—



In order to insure that this identity is exactly satisfied we have estimated

all the quations using ordinary least squares without correcting for serial

correlation. The results for individual equations however are not sensitive

to this choice. The estimated equations are shown in Table 4.2.

        The principal conclusion which emerges is the tremendous responsiveness

of youth employment to agegatedemand. For men 16—19, each one point decrease

in the prime male unemployment rate increases the employed proportion of the

population by about 4.5%. About two—thirds of the response comes through

unemployment, with the remainder due to increases in participation. For

women 16—19, the cyclical responsiveness estimates are comparable with

participation somewhat more responsive, and unemployment somewhat less respon-

sive to aggregate demand. In line with the traditional view of disadvantaged

youth   as likely to be "last hired" and "first fired," black youth employment
is   even more cyclically sensitive than the total group. For black men 16—19,

each point reduction in the unemployment rate raises the employment ratio by

close to 6.3%. A comparable figure obtains for black women.

        The substantial cyclic response to changes in aggregate demand suggests

that a shortage of job opportunities characterizes the youth labor market. If

there were not a dearth of acceptable jobs aggregatedemandwouldnot beexpected

to have a significant impact on youth employment. The very strong response

of participation to unemployment confirms the importance of focusing on

employment ratherthan unemployment in assessing labor market conditions.

It also supports the argument of Section I that much of the high rate of labor force

withdrawal among the unemployed is atttibutable to discouragement.

        The strong cyclic response of employment and participation to aggregate

demand reflects the large inflows and outlfows described in the first section.

 aggregate dmeand may be due either to increased inflows or decreased outflows.

 That is, low unemployment may raise employment either by helping workers get

 jobs or by helping them hold jobs. In order to examine this issue we have

 estimated equations describing the time series movements in the monthly flow

probabilities. In addition to trend, cyc4e,- and seasonal varialbes, we also

studied the effects of minimum wage legislation and Federal youth employment

 programs. Since we were unable to isolate a significant effect of either of

these measures on transition probabilities, the results of estimating the

equations in which they were included are not reported here.

         Table 4.3 summarizes the results of the flow probability equations. The

first set of equations describe the probability of employment entrance. For

all groups, especially men, the rate of entrance is very sensitive to demand.

For men, a one point increase in the prime male unemployment rate reduces

the probability of entry by .104, or about 9%     It is changes in entry rather

than exit behavior which are the prime cause of employment fluctuations among

young men. The rate of exit does not appear to exhibit significant cyclical

fluctuations. The reasons for this difference are not clear. One possi-

bility is that women are the first to be laid off in downturns. A more

plausible explanation is that the entrance rate does not fall as unemploy-

ment rises, because more women enter the labor force as their family income

falls.

         The rates of labor force entry and exit also vary cyclically. The rate

of exit falls during recessions largely because the probability of withdrawal

is much greater for the unemployed than it is for those who are employed.

For the male groups the probability of labor force entrance is strongly cyclical.

It is much less cyclical for women because of the added worker behavior noted

above.

      On balance, the flow probability equations bear out the basic conclusions
of this section. They demonstrate that     both labor force entry and employ-

ment entry become significantly easier during peak periods. This is further

evidence that shortages of acceptable jobs account for much of teenage unemployment.

                                   Conclusion



      The results in this paper suggest that the dynamics of teenage unemployment

are to a large extent the result of frequent labor force transitions. We find

that movement between jobs with an intervening spell of unemployment is not the

dominant pattern of labor market behavior among teenagers. The frequency with

which unemployed teenagers leave the labor force, and the extent of flows into

employment from outside the labor force lead us to conclude that much of teenage

non—employment is hidden in non—participation. The large response of teenage

participation rates to aggregate demand supports the view that the youth non—

employment problem is even more serious than the unemployment figures suggest.

Itãppears that many   of   those outside the labor force are functionally indistin-

guishable from the unemployed.

      The frequency of labor force transition among teenagers results in short

spells of unemployment, and has led many to emphasize a turnover or job instabi-

lity view of teenage unemployment. While frequent turnover is clearly an impor-

tant aspect of the process, we find that the youth unemployment problem extends

far beyond teenagers moving frequently between labor force states. Much of the

problem is concentrated among a relatively small, disproportionately black, group

who experience long term unemployment. Over half of youth unemployment is concentrated

among persons who are unemployed for more than half the year. For this group, quite clearly,

there is a problem of a shortage of jobs which they find attractive. The direct

causal   role of the supply of jobs is confirmed by the large cyclical fluctuations
in youth employment and unemployment, and our analysis of black-white differences.
The time series results are consistent with the available cross—section evidence
that young people in areas with low unemployment rates have much higher rates of

employment than youths in depressed areas.

      The evident responsiveness of teenage employment to shifts in demand, and

the apparent difficulty of the long term unemployed in finding attractive jobs

raises a number of questions for further research, with important implications

for public policy. One of the most important issues relates to the nature of

the apparent job shortage, and the design of appropriate policy initiatives.

Our findings underscore the substantial impact of economic expansion on the youth

labor market. Evidence here and elsewhere (Clark and Summers (1978)) suggests

that young people and especially black youth experience relatively substantial

employment gains in tight labor markets, gains which belong in benefit/cost

evaluations of macro—economic policy. Yet the risk of accelerating inflation

places some limit on the viability of expansionary initiatives. In consequence,

a good deal of attention has been focused on structural initiatives designed to

combat youth unemployment directly, without substantially expanding overall demand.

      Evaluation of structural policies designed to raise youth employment must

consider the nature of the apparent job shortage we have discussed. Our findings

have documented that much of teenage unemployment is due to a small group of young

persons who have great difficulty in finding jobs which they regard as suitable.

This finding, however, is consistent with two quite different interpretations.

The failure to find attractive work may reflect an absolute absence of job offers

or possibilities, or unrealistic aspirations on the part of the unemployed. If

the problem is a lack of work opportunities, programs designed to better match

people and jobs, or ease the school—to—work transition will have little effect

unless accompanied by measures to create jobs. The alternative interpretation

of the attractive job shortage focuses on the discrepancy between aspirations and

the characteristics of the available job supply. The problem is not the quantity,

but the quality of the available jobs. This view holds that since at a low enough

price employers ought to be willing to hire almost anybody, there must be an abun-

dance of jobs of some sort. This line of argument supports an emphasis on measures

which upgrade the quality of jobs open to young people.

      We plan to examine in future research the nature and sources of the diffi-

culty some young people have in finding suitable jobs. The existing literature

provides little evidence on these issues. We do know that the vast majority of

unemployed young people (95+ percent) in the May 1976 Job Search survey, reported

having received no job offers in their current spell of unemployment. Further

examination of Job Search data is clearly in order. In addition we plan to study

newly available longitudinal micro—data on individuals from the CPS. Data on

individuals over time make possible analysis of the determinants of the transition

probabilities examined in this study. Examination of the effect of wages, aspira-

tions, and industry or occupational factors should help to illuminate the sources

of the youth unemployment problem.
