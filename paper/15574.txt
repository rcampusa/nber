                                                ABSTRACT

For decades, the US public and private sectors have committed substantial resources towards cancer
research, but the societal payoff has not been well-understood. We quantify the value of recent gains
in cancer survival, and analyze the distribution of value among various stakeholders. Between 1988
and 2000, life expectancy for cancer patients increased by roughly four years, and the average willingness-to-pay
for these survival gains was roughly $322,000. Improvements in cancer survival during this period
created 23 million additional life-years and roughly $1.9 trillion of additional social value, implying
that the average life-year was worth approximately $82,000 to its recipient. Health care providers
and pharmaceutical companies appropriated 5-19% of this total, with the rest accruing to patients.
The share of value flowing to patients has been rising over time. These calculations suggest that from
the patient's point of view, the rate of return to R&D investments against cancer has been substantial.

        "I will also ask for an appropriation of an extra $100 million to launch an

        intensive campaign to find a cure for cancer, and I will ask later for whatever

        additional funds can effectively be used. The time has come in America when the

        same kind of concentrated effort that split the atom and took man to the moon

        should be turned toward conquering this dreaded disease. Let us make a total

        national commitment to achieve this goal."1

              --President Richard M. Nixon, January 1971 State of the Union Address



        Eleven months later, President Nixon formalized the war on cancer with the passage of

the National Cancer Act, an act designed to promote the discovery of new treatments for cancer

and to encourage early detection and prevention of the disease. More than three decades later,

cancer remains an important cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. In 2003

alone, cancer represented the second leading cause of mortality in the US, accounting for nearly

25% of all deaths, or roughly 556,000.2 Today, nearly 1.5 million cases of cancer are diagnosed

in the US annually.

        While cancer continues to claim lives, the last three decades have witnessed tremendous

strides in our understanding and treatment of the disease. Scientists have identified many of the

genes responsible for cancer, discovered new chemotherapeutic and biologic approaches to

treating the disease, and developed new imaging techniques to detect cancer earlier.

Accompanying these scientific advances have been perhaps equally important public health

campaigns which have led to improved screening and earlier detection of the disease.

  Moreover, the number of deaths from cancer has been increasing, owing in large part to advances in technology
that have reduced the probability of dying from heart disease (Honore and Lleras-Muney, 2006).


                                                                                                                  3
       Despite these advances, there is significant debate over whether the war on cancer is being

“won.” Criticisms generally center on two closely related issues. The first is that there has been

little progress in cancer survival, and that the progress that has been made is due to the

development of expensive treatments that marginally prolong life (Epstein, 2005; Faguet, 2005).

Indeed, a large body of work has questioned the cost-effectiveness of recent cancer treatments

(Berenson, 2005; Hillner and Smith, 2007; Kolata and Pollack, 2008; Shih and Halpern, 2008).

This has influenced public opinion among physicians as well. For example, a recent survey of

academic oncologists found that only 25% of those surveyed believe that recently developed

therapies for metastatic colorectal and non-small cell lung cancers offer a good value (Nadler et

al., 2006). Second, some argue that too much effort has been focused on developing such costly

treatments, at the expense of prevention and early detection (Faguet, 2005). In response to both

criticisms, proponents of the war on cancer argue that there have been substantial increases in

cancer survival. For example, the five-year relative survival rate for all cancers diagnosed

between 1996 and 2003 was 66%, up from 50% in the mid-1970s (American Cancer Society,

2008).3 Improvements in survival have been particularly dramatic for breast cancer, colon

cancer, and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, all of which have seen significant advances in therapy,

screening, or both (Breen et al., 2001; Espey et al., 2007; Pulte et al., 2008). Despite this

controversy, there has been little effort to explicitly analyze the benefits and costs of the war on

cancer. The sole exception we are aware of is Lichtenberg (2004), who estimates that newer

cancer drugs developed between 1975 and 1995 increased the life expectancy of a cancer patient

by one year and increased the cost of cancer care by $3,000 per patient.

3
  For cancer survival, epidemiologists often estimate a relative survival rate, which is the survival of cancer patients
compared to a health control group. This measure is useful because it controls for survival gains from other diseases
besides cancer. The absolute survival rate has increased dramatically as well. For example, from 1950 to 1995, the
absolute five-year survival rate increased from: 1% to 4% for pancreatic cancer, 41% to 62% for colon cancer, 60%
to 86% for breast cancer, 72% to 86% for uterine cancer, and 43% to 93% for prostate cancer (Welch et al., 2000).


                                                                                                                      4
      To address this important question, our paper evaluates the costs and benefits of

investments in R&D that began with the War on Cancer. We also evaluate the distribution of net

social gains across patients and firms. Gains in cancer R&D will affect cancer survival through

three mechanisms.     First, R&D advances may prevent the disease altogether, through the

development of vaccines, changes in behavior, and the development of screening tests to identify

pre-malignant disease. Second, technological advances or efforts to increase screening may

result in the detection of malignant disease at earlier stages. This may improve survival, since

cancer is typically easier to treat at earlier stages. Finally, therapeutic advances may improve

survival directly. For example, better treatment for late-stage cancer can improve survival even

if detection remains unchanged.

      In prior work (Sun et al., 2008), we calculated cancer survival gains between 1988 and

2000 and decomposed these into the shares accounted for by treatment and detection

improvements, respectively. Overall, we found that cancer survival increased significantly—for

instance, survival for all cancers combined increased by 3.9 years between 1988 and 2000, while

survival for breast cancer and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma increased by 3.6 and 3.5 years,

respectively.   The majority of these gains were due to improvements in treatment, which

accounted for roughly 80% of survival gains for both breast cancer alone and for all cancers

combined, and for nearly all of the survival gains for non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. In particular,

we found that changes in the probability of early detection were much less quantitatively

significant than improvements in survival at a given stage of the disease.

      The earlier analysis focused on the relative contributions of detection and treatment to

survival. In this study, we compare the social value of these survival gains to their cost, to gain

some insight into the social welfare effects of the war on cancer. Moreover, there continues to be




                                                                                                 5
contention over how much producers and manufacturers earn, and whether this comes at the

expense of consumer surplus for patients. Therefore, we also ask how these social gains (or

costs) were shared between patients and producers. A program that generated gains in social

surplus that flowed exclusively, or primarily, to producers, would be viewed quite differently by

policymakers and the public, compared to one that generated gains for patients.

      We quantify the costs and benefits of cancer R&D, focusing on the benefits of earlier

detection of malignant disease and improved cancer therapies. We begin by calculating the

value of improved cancer survival from 1988 to 2000. We calculate that the average newly

diagnosed cancer patient, earning the average US income, would be willing to pay approximately

$31,000 annually to retain year 2000 survival prospects, as compared with the prospects

available in 1988. This is equal to roughly half of full income. The high rates of mortality

associated with cancer magnify the value of even small absolute survival gains, since greater

value is placed on a given gain in longevity, when an individual has a shorter life expectancy

(Becker et al., 2007). For example, since the value of consumption and wealth are significantly

lower after death, individuals may be willing to pay nearly their entire end-of-life wealth for as

little as a few extra weeks of life. In fact, this is one explanation for the emergence of expensive

biologic treatments for cancer, which increase life-expectancy quite modestly – in some cases,

just weeks -- and yet still face high demand (Goldman et al., 2009). In addition, our results also

suggest that wealthier individuals would be willing to pay a larger share of their income for these

higher survival prospects. In economic parlance, this implies that cancer treatment behaves like

a “luxury good,” in the sense that expenditure shares rise with income.

       Aggregating over patients, we estimate that these improvements in survival generated

approximately 23 million additional life-years, and $1.9 trillion of value for patients. These




                                                                                                  6
numbers imply that cancer patients were willing to pay $86,000 for the average life-year gained.

This is well within the range of conventional estimates for the value of a statistical life-year, as

we note.

       We compare this total benefit of survival gains with the cost of achieving those gains –

defined as aggregate spending on cancer treatment, plus research and development costs. We

count only those benefits that accrue from 1988 to 2000, well after R&D initiated in the early

1970s would come to fruition. Against these benefits, we counted the total cost of (and profits

from) cancer care provided from 1988 to 2000, and all cancer R&D spending from 1970 to 2000.

Using these inputs, we calculate that cancer care providers (drug companies, hospitals, doctors,

and health professionals) earned at most $433 billion in profits over this time period, while the

net surplus to patients was approximately $1.5 trillion.

       We are deliberately conservative in our approach to estimating the rate of return earned

by the war on cancer. First, we do not incorporate the value generated by cancer prevention, and

count only the benefits that accrue to individuals who acquire cancer. Second, while we count

all cancer R&D expenditures from 1970 onwards as the total size of investment, we count net

benefits (gains in survival, less medical costs) from 1988 to 2000 only. We restrict our analysis

partly due to limitations present in data for earlier years, but also to recognize the lags inherent in

the medical R&D cycle. For instance, it would be inappropriate to count benefits that accrue

from therapies developed prior to 1970. Typically, drug development takes 10 to 15 years from

inception to launch (DiMasi et al., 2003); enforcing an 18-year lag thus seems a conservative

assumption. Moreover, we also over-count R&D costs by including some spending – towards

the late 1990s, for instance – whose benefit has not yet been realized or measured.




                                                                                                     7
         This paper is outlined as follows. Section I describes our framework for valuing gains in

cancer survival. Section II explains the data and methods we use to estimate the value of gains

in cancer survival in the US between 1988 and 2000, as well as the methods we use to estimate

the costs of cancer care and R&D during this period. Section III presents our results, and section

IV concludes.



               I. FRAMEWORK FOR EVALUATING THE WAR ON CANCER

Our analysis proceeds in three steps. First, we estimate the value to individuals of gains in

cancer survival. Second, we decompose these gains into those accounted for by improved

treatment and earlier detection. Finally, we estimate the aggregate social value of cancer gains,

compare these to costs, and examine the distribution of gains across patients and producers. This

section describes, in that order, the framework we use to answer each of these questions.

Valuing Gains in Cancer Survival

Our framework for valuing gains in cancer survival is based on the approach utilized by Becker,

Philipson, and Soares (2005).            These authors derive valuation formulas for infra-marginal

changes in longevity.4 It is important to think of cancer survival changes as infra-marginal,

because the alternative to treatment is often rapid mortality, not slight increments in mortality

risk. Indeed, infra-marginal valuation should ideally be the standard approach to estimating the

value of discrete survival gains from any disease. Changes in health-related mortality risk seem

poorly matched to natural experiments that estimate the willingness-to-pay for marginal risk

reduction.



4
 This infra-marginal valuation approach has also been used to value improvements in HIV/AIDS survival
(Philipson and Jena, 2006) and to calculate the general equilibrium effects of large improvements in mortality (Jena,
Mulligan, Philipson, and Sun, 2008).


                                                                                                                    8
        Following Becker, Philipson, and Soares, we consider a hypothetical life-cycle individual

(HLCI) whose disease begins in a given year and who faces that year’s cross-sectional survival

and annual income for the remainder of his or her life. The cross-sectional survival is assumed

to reflect the detection and treatment technologies available at that time. In order to calculate the

individual value of improved cancer survival in that year, we ask how much a HLCI contracting

cancer would be willing to pay to avoid the less favorable survival curves from the earlier year.

This amount represents the patient’s willingness-to-pay for the improved survival probabilities.

We can then do this separately for the increment in survival generated by better treatment and

better detection.

                    { } represent the vector of survival probabilities, based on the available
        Let S t = Si,t j

treatment technology present in year t. Si,t j represents the probability that the patient survives at

least j years after the disease has begun in year t, given that the disease is detected at stage i. For

           1980
example, S early , j is the probability that an individual who gets cancer in 1980 and is diagnosed


                                                            1980
early will live at least j years past 1980. Equivalently, S late , j is the probability that an individual



who gets cancer in 1980 and is ultimately diagnosed late will live at least j years from 1980.

Note that in this example, 1980 is the date of incidence, as opposed to the date of detection. For

notational simplicity, we omit the superscript t where possible, with the understanding that

survival profiles generally vary over time.

        We can capture the salient features of the problem by supposing that an individual’s

survival profile depends on when his disease gets detected, and the survival probabilities of

cancer patients diagnosed at various stages. Define p as the probability of early detection.

Define S as a vector of survival probabilities for various stages of diagnosis. Finally, define




                                                                                                        9
lifetime full-income as Y . The individual’s indirect utility then depends on these three “goods,”

according to v ( p, S , Y ) .

         In a simple environment with a single consumption good, a complete contingent claims

market, and an interest rate equal to the individual’s rate of discount, consumption profiles will

be constant. Therefore, if y represents an individual’s full income in a single period, it will be

the case that consumption c = y in each period. As a result, indirect utility can be represented

as:

                                      V ( p, S , y ) = u( y ) ⋅ ∑ pi A( Si )                        (1)
                                                               i


                  ∞
                           1
Here, A( Si ) = ∑                S , which is the expected value of an annuity paying one unit of
                                j i, j
                 j = 0 (1 + r )



consumption each year to an individual with the survival profile defined by Si , j .

         Once we quantify V ( p, S , y ) , we can define the willingness to pay for arbitrary

increments in survival and detection. In particular, an individual currently enjoying p' and S ' is

willing to pay wtp to avoid having to face p and S , where:

                                   V ( p ' , S ' , y − wtp ) = V ( p, S , y )                       (2)

This equation provides us with the conceptual means to calculate the value to patients of changes

in survival and detection probabilities.



Valuing Improvements in Treatment and Detection

Gains in cancer survival may be driven by advances in both treatment and detection. Advances

in treatment, such as the development of new chemotherapeutic regimens or surgical techniques,

improve survival by delaying progression of the disease or eliminating it outright. Improvements



                                                                                                          10
in detection, which can occur through the development of new technologies and/or public health

efforts to increase screening, improve survival by allowing more patients to be diagnosed, and

therefore treated, earlier.     Given the potential importance of each of these mechanisms in

accounting for overall gains in survival, it is useful to decompose the overall willingness-to-pay

for survival improvements into the portion due to treatment versus detection.

         Equation 2 characterizes the individual’s willingness-to-pay for a bundle of detection and

survival probabilities. Analogous to the well-known Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition in labor

economics (Blinder, 1973; Oaxaca, 1973), we can decompose the total change in value into the

component driven by changes in detection probabilities, holding survival profiles constant, and

the remaining component driven by changes in survival profiles alone. Specifically, we can

write:

                       ΔV = V ( p ' , S ' , y ) − V ( p , S , y )
                       = [V ( p ' , S ' , y ) − V ( p ' , S , y )] + [V ( p ' , S , y ) − V ( p, S , y )]   (3)
                       = ΔVtreat + ΔVdetect

The first term in square brackets is the increase in lifetime indirect utility due to improvements in

treatment: this is defined as changes in the survival profile, holding the probability of early

detection constant. The second is the increase in utility due to improvements in detection:

analogously, this is defined as changes in the probability of early detection, holding survival

profiles constant. If we were quantifying marginal changes in utility, dV , their monetary values

                                         dV
would be approximately equal to                , where λ is the marginal utility of income. Since we are
                                           λ

quantifying infra-marginal changes ΔV , the analogous approach is to divide by the average

utility of income, M . This is defined in terms of the individual’s willingness-to-pay and utility

change, as in:




                                                                                                                  11

Dividing both sides of (3) by (4):

                                                      ΔVdetect ΔVtreat
                                         wtp =                +                                   (5)

The first term is the approximate monetary value of detection gains and the second the

approximate value of treatment gains.            These are approximations, because each change in

lifetime indirect utility is divided by the average utility of income, calculated across the entire

improvement in survival, not just the specific portion due to detection or to treatment.

Estimating Aggregate Consumer Surplus from Improvements in Cancer Survival

Equation (2) allows us to calculate the annual amount an individual is willing to pay for a given

improvement in cancer survival from a baseline year t to year t’.                  We define this annual

willingness to pay as wtpt,t’. The lifetime willingness to pay, WTPt,t’, for the improved survival is

the expected present value of the stream of these annual willingness to pay terms:

                                     WTP t , t ' = wtp t , t ' ⋅ ∑ pi' A( S i' )                  (6)
                                                                  i



The individual’s lifetime consumer surplus from gains in survival equals this lifetime

willingness-to-pay, net of lifetime spending on cancer. Expected lifetime spending for a patient

whose disease begins in year t can be defined as C t , where:

                                                          ∞
                                                                  Sit, j
                                        C t ≡ ∑ pit ∑                      c tj                   (7)
                                                          j = 0 (1 + r )
                                                                         j
                                                  i



In this expression, ctj is the average cost (across all disease stages) j years after cancer strikes.

The net cost of moving to year t ' technology from year t technology is thus C t ' − C t . As a

result, the individual’s lifetime consumer surplus from this movement in technology can be

represented as:


                                                                                                        12
                                      cs t ,t ' = WTPt , t ' − (C t ' − C t )                   (8)

       Using individual consumer surplus values, we can then aggregate up to total consumer

surplus. Since the willingness to pay for survival gains, and therefore consumer surplus, is a

function of income in our model, the total consumer surplus accruing to a cohort of cancer

patients whose disease begins in a given year t ' , CS t ' , can be calculated by integrating over the

income distribution and multiplying by the incidence of cancer in that year, N t ' :

                                     CS t ' = N t ' ∫ cs t , t ' ( y ) f ( y )dy                (9)

In this expression, cs t , t ' ( y ) is the consumer surplus for a patient with income y; f ( y ) is the

distribution of income, and N t ' is the number of patients whose disease begins in the year t ' .

The aggregate consumer surplus across all cohorts ever afflicted with cancer is the present

discounted sum of the consumer surplus accruing to each cohort:

                                                                CS t '
                                            CS = ∑                    t '−t
                                                                                               (10)
                                                     t ' ≥ t (1 + r )




                                    II. DATA AND METHODS

In the previous section, we outlined a theoretical framework for calculating the consumer surplus

arising from gains in cancer survival and estimating the relative contributions of advances in

cancer treatment and detection.         Implementing our approach requires several pieces of

information, including: (1) assumptions about the nature of the utility function, (2) estimates of

stage-conditional survival and detection probabilities, (3) estimates of the income distribution,

and (4) historical estimates of cancer spending. The following sections describe, in this order,

how we incorporate each of these elements into our analysis.




                                                                                                      13
Parameterizing the Willingness to Pay

Following Becker, Philipson, and Soares (2005), we assume that the instantaneous utility

function takes the following form:

                                                                     c1− (1 / γ )
                                                          u(c ) =                 +α                                        (11)
                                                                    1 − (1/ γ )

The parameter α is a normalization factor that determines the level of consumption at which the

individual would be indifferent between life or death (at which point utility equals zero), and γ is

the intertemporal elasticity of substitution. Following these authors, we assume that γ = 1.25

and α = −14.97 .5 Given expressions (2) and (11), it is straightforward to show that the closed-

form solution for the willingness to pay for an improvement in detection and treatment prospects

from year t to t’ is:

                                                                                                               γ /( γ −1)

Estimates of Survival and Detection Probabilities

Our estimates of survival and detection probabilities are drawn from prior work (Sun et al.,

2008), which we briefly summarize here. In that analysis, we use data from the Surveillance,

Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program to estimate changes in cancer survival and

detection between 1988 and 2000. SEER is a database of reports from 17 cancer registries,

maintained by the National Cancer Institute, which has tracked cancer incidence since 1973. We

restricted our focus to tumors from the nine original SEER registries present in 1973, which

cover roughly 10% of the US population. When an individual living in an area covered by a

registry is diagnosed with cancer, a report is sent to SEER describing that individual’s age at


5
    For further justification of these parameter assumptions, please see Becker, Philipson, and Soares (2005).


                                                                                                                                   14
diagnosis, year of diagnosis, and gender. In addition, SEER collects data about the tumor itself,

including its location and stage at diagnosis. Once diagnosed, patients are (generally) actively

followed up until they die or are otherwise lost to follow-up. For each patient, SEER then

reports the number of years for which the patient was known to be alive, as well as the patient’s

status at the end of that time (death or lost to follow-up).

       We focused our analysis on all cancers combined, as well as the following individual

cancers: breast, colorectal, lung, pancreas, and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. SEER data provide

four classifications for stage: in situ, localized, regional metastasis, and distal metastasis.

Because the proportion of patients diagnosed with in situ cancer was relatively small for most of

the cancers we examined, we combined the in-situ and localized stages. We thus modeled

breast, colorectal, lung, and pancreatic cancers as proceeding through three stages: in

situ/localized, regional metastasis, and distal metastasis. For non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and all

cancers combined, differences in coding across cancers and years required us to model disease in

two stages: a late stage comprising of distal metastasis and an early stage consisting of all other

stages combined.

       While further details of the methodology used to estimate survival and detection

probabilities can be found in our complementary analysis, two points should be stressed. First,

we took a period (cross-sectional) approach to estimating survival, rather than a cohort

(longitudinal) approach. Formally, the period probability, in year t of surviving from year 5 to

year 6, is calculated as the fraction of patients acquiring the disease in year t-6 who survived

from year t-1 to year t. The cohort approach, on the other hand, would calculate this probability

as the fraction of people acquiring the disease in year t who survived from year t+5 to year t+6.




                                                                                                15
        We employ the period approach for two reasons. First, it facilitates calculation of long-

term survival probabilities, which are necessary to calculate accurate estimates of life

expectancy.6 Second, the period approach to calculating survival probabilities in year t reflects

the state of year t technology. The cohort-based approach, on the other hand, amalgamates

technology across all years during which the cohort will live. Of course, the period approach

limits the number of years available to us: for instance, to calculate the 1988 probability of

surviving 6 years, we will need to observe patients who entered the registry in 1982. While

SEER data were collected beginning in 1973, reliable data on staging were only available for

many cancers starting in 1982. While we could therefore begin our analysis with cancers starting

in 1983, as mentioned above, the period approach limits the number of years available to us for

earlier years. As a result, we focused our efforts on survival gains between 1988 and 2000; doing

so allows us to estimate survival for patients in 1988 for up to six years using the SEER data

directly. Since about half of cancer patients survived six years in 1988, we viewed this as the

minimum acceptable panel length for our first year of analysis.

        Second, we used all-cause mortality to estimate survival, as opposed to disease-specific

mortality. All-cause mortality is sensitive to gains from treatment of competing risks for cancer,

and it avoids issues associated with cause-of-death misattribution (Moy et al., 2001; Black et al.,

2002). One drawback of using all-cause mortality, however, is the possibility of capturing

secular improvements in mortality that have little to do with improvements in cancer treatment or

detection. As a result, we assessed the sensitivity of our results by re-estimating consumer

surplus values using cancer-specific mortality. Our results are largely unchanged, and perhaps

even suggest larger gains in mortality.

6
 For example, for patients who were diagnosed with cancer in 2000, the probability of surviving 20 years is
estimated using the data from patients who were initially diagnosed in 1980. By contrast, the cohort-based approach
would require following patients whose disease began in 2000 until 2020.


                                                                                                                16
         Important to our analysis, SEER data report survival from the date of diagnosis, not the

date of incidence. This can result in “lead-time bias” in our estimates of survival because

individuals who are detected earlier may appear to live longer, even if earlier detection provides

no therapeutic benefit. If the transition time between stages of the disease is known, survival

from the date of incidence can be estimated as the observed survival from the date of diagnosis at

a given stage plus the average transition time from incidence to that stage. For example, if the

observed post-diagnosis survival for a given cancer is 5 years for individuals with regional

disease, and it is known that it takes two years for the cancer to progress from in situ/local

disease to regional disease, then the estimated survival from date of incidence would be seven

years. Note that for this estimation strategy to deliver reliable estimates of survival after cancer

incidence, the transition times between stages must be calculated in the absence of treatment.

Such transition times may, of course, be difficult to observe in actual practice. To deal with this

issue, we examine the sensitivity of our results to lead time bias by subjecting the estimation to a

range of transition time assumptions, from: (a) for in situ/local patients, the date of diagnosis and

the date of incidence are the same, to (b) for later stage patients, the disease takes on a range of

transition times of up to three years between each stage. For diseases with three stages such as

breast, colon, pancreatic, and lung cancer, this amounted to an assumed six-year transition time

between early and late disease.7 We report baseline results assuming no transition time between

stages, and then show how our results vary with different transition time assumptions. Our

qualitative conclusions for value, net benefit, and the distribution of gains are all quite insensitive

to transition times between stages.

Estimates of Income


7
  As we discuss in the next section, these ranges were chosen because they fit the available literature on transition
times between cancer stages.


                                                                                                                        17
We used the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS), a nationally representative survey of

the US civilian population, to estimate the income distribution for US cancer patients in 2000.8

We dropped respondents with negative or zero personal income. Note that MEPS only reports

earned income, while full income, which reflects the value of leisure time, is the relevant

measure. Following Murphy and Topel (2006), we assume that (full-time employed) individuals

work 2000 hours annually and have 4000 hours available annually for work and leisure, so that

full income is equal to twice earned income. While there are other data sources with higher-

quality income data, MEPS permits us to identify the income distribution for cancer patients

specifically.9 In figure 1 below, we plot the year 2000 cumulative distribution of full income for

cancer patients and the general population, using US Census data to calculate the latter.

Generally, cancer patients are wealthier than the general population; the median full income for a

cancer patient is $54,756 (in year 2006 dollars), compared to $49,842 in the general population.

However, Figure 1 does suggest that the cumulative distribution function (cdf) for the general

population crosses the cdf for the cancer population, so that at the tail end of the distribution,

cancer patients are poorer.




8
   We used the “total person-level” income variable (TTLP00X), which is the sum of all personal income except
taxes and sales income, as a measure of individual income. For retirees, income is the sum of wages, pension
payments, transfer payments, and income from investments.
9
  In sensitivity analyses, we used the Current Population Survey (CPS) income distributions for the entire US
population. As shown in Appendix Table A.2, the results were qualitatively similar.


                                                                                                          18

Estimates of Cancer Spending

In order to estimate consumer surplus, we must estimate Ct, the expected lifetime spending of an

individual     afflicted            with   cancer   whose     disease   begins   in   year   t.    Recall    that

                     S it, j
C t = ∑ p it ∑                     c tj , where ctj is the average cost (across all disease stages) j years after
      i        j   (1 + r )    j




cancer strikes. Because direct estimates of c tj are not available, we estimate lifecycle cancer

spending as follows.

          First, we adopt a cross-sectional approach to estimating spending, so that spending in the

20th year of the disease for patients whose disease began in 2000 is estimated by the year 2000




                                                                                                              19
spending of patients whose disease initially began in 1980.                       In this case, the following

relationship holds:

                                                    E t = ∑ N tj c tj                                   (13)
                                                           j ≤t



Et represents total spending on cancer in year t and N tj is the number of patients whose disease

began j years ago, and who are alive in year t. Finally, ctj is spending by these individuals in

year t. N tj can be estimated using SEER data, which tracks patients over time. Additionally,

Brown et al. (2001) find that historically, national expenditures on cancer equal 5% of total

health expenditures, so we estimate Et to be 5% of national health expenditures.10

           Even with these assumptions, more structure is needed to identify ctj . We assume that

that the share of total lifetime spending that is spent in each year of the disease remains constant

over time, so that spending in any given year of the disease is a fixed multiple of spending in the

initial year of the disease. Mathematically, this implies that:

                                                      c tj = α j cot                                    (14)

where cot is cancer spending in the first year of disease for someone who gets cancer in year t

and α j >1 is the proportion by which spending j years later is greater than initial spending. α j is

assumed to be independent of the year an individual gets cancer. We estimate α j using data

from the Medical Expenditure Panel Surveys (MEPS), which provides data on whether a patient

has ever had cancer, the year the disease began, and medical spending in the current year.

Because MEPS has relatively few cancer patients, we pooled all cancer patients between 1996

and 2004, resulting in a sample of 4,314 individuals who have had cancer for an average of 4.5

years.11 Using this sample, we estimate spending on cancer care for each individual as their

medical spending in a given year minus the average spending for non-cancer patients of the same

age and gender. These estimates of cancer spending, as well as the number of years the

individual reports having cancer, are then used to estimate α j .12 With estimates of α j , Et, and

~
N tj , expressions (13) and (14) can be used to directly solve for the entire sequence of c tj . This,

in turn, allows us to calculate lifetime spending on cancer by year of cancer incidence.

Intuitively, information on incidence, survival, and the relative growth in spending from the date

of incidence, allow us to construct a time-series for medical spending.13

Increases in Cancer Detection and Survival after Treatment

Table 1 shows changes in life expectancy and the probability of early detection between 1988

and 2000 for all cancers combined, as well as the individual tumor types of breast cancer,

colorectal cancer, lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. (Note that the

“all cancers combined” group also includes tumor types not individually reported in the table,

such as prostate cancer.)           For all cancers combined, we find that overall life expectancy

increased by 3.9 years between 1988 and 2002, driven predominantly by increases in life

expectancy for early stage patients (3.7 years). Indeed, nearly all of the cancers we examined

had increases in survival at earlier disease stages, with generally little improvement in survival

11
   MEPS does not contain patients who were institutionalized or hospitalized patients at the time of the survey,
which may cause us to underestimate costs. However, note that we use MEPS to estimate the distribution of costs
over the life cycle, as opposed to the total level of cancer costs, so this omission will only affect us to the degree that
it is not evenly distributed across the cancer lifecycle, and even then, would only affect our estimate of how costs are
distributed across the lifecycle, not the total level of costs.

   In estimating cancer spending, we inflated all dollar values to year 2006 dollars. In addition, we used a sixth
order polynomial regression to smooth out and extrapolate values of     αj.
13
  As a sensitivity analysis, we considered an alternate specification in which we also considered spending in the
year prior to diagnosis, using data from the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey. Our results suggested a smaller
increase in cancer spending (and therefore greater increase in consumer surplus) than the results we report here.


                                                                                                                       21
for patients who were diagnosed at distal metastasis. However, one notable exception is non-

Hodgkin’s lymphoma, where survival gains for distal metastasis (3.4 years) were on the same

order as gains for early stage disease (3.3 years).

           Breast cancer and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma also saw reasonably large increases in the

percentage of patients diagnosed at earlier stages. Between 1988 and 2000, the percentage of

breast cancer patients diagnosed at the in situ/localized stage increased by 8.1%, and the number

of patients diagnosed at an early stage for non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma increased by 4.1%. For all

cancers combined, the percentage of patients diagnosed with early stage disease increased by

5.6%. By contrast, the remaining cancers we studied (colorectal, lung and pancreatic) saw more

modest increases in the percentage of patients diagnosed at earlier stages. Note that, due to

limitations in the staging data for prostate cancer, the SEER data do not admit analysis of

improvements in prostate cancer detection, which is commonly thought to have played a

relatively large role in survival for that disease.14

Individual Value of Cancer Survival Gains

Given our estimates of survival and detection probabilities, we can use the methodology

described earlier to calibrate the value of cancer survival gains between 1988 and 2000. For

each cancer in our analysis and for all cancers combined, Table 2 presents a number of metrics

for the value consumers place on the survival gains observed between 1988 and 2000: (1)

Annual willingness to pay, in each year of their remaining life; (2) Cumulative lifetime

willingness to pay; and (3) The implied value of a statistical life-year, calculated by dividing

cumulative willingness-to-pay for improved survival, by the observed increase in life expectancy

drawn from Table 1.

  NHL                           33,812                         273,649                         78,185

Notes: All Amounts are in Year 2006 dollars, discounted to 1990 at a 3% rate. The annual value of survival gains is
an individual’s annual willingness to pay, in each year of her remaining life, for observed survival improvements.
The lifetime value of survival gains is calculated by multiplying the annual value by the total discounted life
expectancy. The implied value of a life year is calculated by dividing the lifetime value of survival gains by the
increase in life expectancy.



Overall, our results suggest that survival gains between 1988 and 2000 were of tremendous value

to individuals with cancer. For all cancers combined, patients whose disease began in 2000 were

willing to pay an average of $293,319 (or $27,961 annually) in order to avoid the less favorable

survival and detection probabilities of 1988.                 Given the estimated improvement in life

expectancy, this reflects a value of a statistical life year of roughly $75,210. Breast cancer


                                                                                                                23
patients were willing to pay roughly $25,000 annually for survival gains, while colon cancer

patients were willing to pay roughly $18,000 annually. Intriguingly, the largest values were for

lung cancer patients ($34,368), non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma patients ($30,759 annually), and

pancreatic cancer patients ($40,644 annually). For non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, a large value is

not particularly surprising, given that survival increased by at least 3.5 years over this period.

Overall, our estimates suggests that patients’ willingness to pay for cancer survival

improvements between 1988 and 2000 imply a value of a statistical life year of roughly $75,000

for most cancers, although in the case of pancreatic cancer, the implied value of a life year is

roughly $50,000.

       In Table 2, we estimated the value of cancer survival gains using the calibrated model of

lifetime utility discussed in section II. An alternative method for estimating the value of cancer

survival improvements would be to multiply the estimated gains in life expectancy by an

assumed value of a statistical life year. Commonly used values of a statistical life year vary

widely. At the lower end, $50,000 per year is the cost-effectiveness threshold used by many

public (Devlin and Parkin, 2004). Based on a review of the literature, Cutler and Richardson

(1997) estimate a value of $100,000, and using the demand for dialysis, Lee et al. (2009)

estimate the value of a life year at $129,000. At the higher end, Murphy and Topel (2006)

estimate values between $100,000-$350,000 at various points during the life cycle, while in a

review of the literature, Aldy and Viscusi (2007) find values ranging from $300,000 to $1

million. Given this range of values, Table 3 shows the value of 1988-2000 cancer survival gains

assuming a $50,000, $100,000, or $300,000 value of a statistical life year. Using a $100,000

value of a life year leads to lifetime value of cancer survival gains similar to those shown in

Table 2, which is not surprising given the values of statistical life-year implied by our analysis.




                                                                                                24
At $50,000 per life year, our estimated survival gains are worth roughly $195,000 for all cancers

combined, and at $300,000 per life year, they are worth roughly $1 million.

       Given an average annual full income of $66,890 in the MEPS sample, Table 2 implies

that individuals getting cancer in 2000 would be willing to pay a significant fraction of their full

income, nearly 57%, in order to avoid the less favorable technologies of 1988. In Figure 2, we

explore this point further by graphing how the calibrated willingness to pay for the observed

improvements in survival varies with income.




                                                                                                 25
           FIGURE 2 – Willingness to Pay for Survival Gains as a Share of Full Income




Notes: Results shown assume that the transition time between cancer stages is 0 years. The results with a transition
time of 1 year are extremely similar and are available from the authors upon request.



         In line with table 2, our results suggest that individuals with cancer were willing to pay a

large share of their annual income for survival gains since 1988, particularly among those with

the highest levels of full income. Generally speaking, we find that survival gains have been

generally worth around 50-60% of income for all cancers combined and non-Hodgkin’s

lymphoma, with lower levels for breast, lung, and colorectal cancer, and much higher levels for

pancreatic cancer. Indeed, we find that in some cases, individuals with pancreatic cancer would

be willing to pay nearly 80% of their full income for survival gains.

         The high willingness to pay for improved survival as a share of full income for pancreatic

cancer is at odds with the conventional wisdom, for two reasons. First, pancreatic cancer



                                                                                                                  26
survival improved by less than one year. However, theoretical work by Becker, Murphy, and

Philipson (2007) argues that terminally ill patients may place unusually high value on

incremental survival gains. The intuition behind their result relies on a familiar diminishing

returns argument. While healthy people may be willing to pay moderate amounts for modest

survival gains, terminally ill patients, who are endowed with little health, may be willing to pay

far larger amounts for similarly sized gains. Put differently, because the value of wealth at death

is zero or close to it for most individuals, the willingness to pay for even minor improvements in

longevity may be large at the end of life.15 Second, the high value of pancreatic survival may be

surprising given the low quality-of-life for such patients. However, since the value of pancreatic

cancer survival is calculated as the willingness to pay to avoid earlier technologies, the relevant

question is not the absolute quality of life for pancreatic cancer patients, but rather whether

earlier technologies were associated with marked declines in quality of life. While we are

unaware of any literature that has estimated the change in the quality of life for pancreatic cancer

patients over time, Cutler and Richardson (1997) find quality-adjusted life-years (QALY’s) for

cancer patients to be unchanged from 1970 to 1990.

       Our calibrated results suggest that improved longevity may be a “luxury good” in the

sense that persons with higher income are willing to pay a larger share of their income in order to

achieve these gains. These results closely mirror work by Hall and Jones (2007). On the basis of

diminishing returns to consumption and leisure in any given year, they argue that it is more

15
   One prediction of the Becker et al. analysis is that the estimated value of a statistical life year
would be quite large for very small increments in survival, as in pancreatic cancer, but our
estimates suggest that values of a life year do not differ much across cancers. This discrepancy
is largely an artifact of our calibration procedure. In our approach, wealth accumulation in our
model starts at time zero (when cancer first appears), and life expectancy with pancreatic cancer
is low. Thus, while individuals with pancreatic cancer may be willing to spend larger shares of
their remaining wealth for a given unit increase in life expectancy, the overall willingness to pay
per unit will not be higher simply because wealth is lower.

                                                                                                    27
valuable for wealthy people to increase the total number of years in which to enjoy consumption

and leisure, rather than increasing consumption and leisure in a given year. As a result, wealthier

people are likely to place more value on survival gains, causing health to resemble the economic

definition of a “luxury” good.

       Table 4 shows that the value of 1988-2000 survival gains shown in Table 2 and Figure 1

were primarily driven by advances in treatment, rather than advances in detection.

Table 4: Share of Value of Survival Gains due to Advances in Treatment, 1988-2000.

          Pancreatic Cancer                           100


For all cancers combined, the willingness to pay for treatment advances alone comprises 97% of

the total value of cancer gains. Treatment advances have been particularly important in the case

of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and pancreatic cancer, where nearly all of the value of survival

gains is due to treatment advances. For breast and lung cancer, roughly 90% of the value of

survival gains from 1988 to 2000 appears to result from advances in treatment, while for

colorectal cancer, 75-80% of the total value of survival gains is due to the value of treatment

advances. At first glance, it may seem surprising that the gains in treatment account for such a

large percentage of the value of survival gains, given the advances in early detection shown in

Table 1. Our results suggest that the gains in treatment have been even larger. Put differently,

the gains in stage-conditional survival have been larger than the gains in survival due to the

movement of patients into earlier stages at the time of detection.




                                                                                                28
Individual Consumer Surplus arising from Improvements in Cancer Survival

Having calculated an individual patient’s annual willingness to pay for improvements in

survival, we now turn to the issue of lifetime consumer surplus, which requires us to calculate

the lifetime value of survival gains and the increase in expected lifetime costs. Figure 3 presents

our estimates of lifetime spending for cancer patients between 1988 and 2000.

After a sharp increase at the start of our observation period, lifetime cancer spending remained

relatively constant between 1990 and 2000, at roughly $70,000. Overall, our results suggest that

   Using Medicare claims data, Warren et al. (2008) estimate that between 1991 and 2002, the cost of initial cancer
treatment (treatment from two months before to twelve months after diagnosis) increased by $7,319 for lung cancer,
$5,345 for colorectal cancer, and $4,189 for breast cancer, while the cost of initial treatment for prostate cancer fell
by $196. Our estimates of the lifetime cost for all cancers combined appear larger than these findings, and may thus
be overstating the increases in cancer cost, while understating the gains in consumer surplus.


                                                                                                                     30
1989 and 2000, the average lifetime cost of cancer care was roughly $41,000 higher (averaged

across all years) compared to 1988. The lifetime cost of cancer for an individual getting cancer

in 2000 was approximately $37,000 higher. The lifetime value of cancer survival gains vastly

exceeded this increase in cost, and led to substantial consumer surplus. Indeed, we find that

lifetime consumer surplus has been rapidly increasing over time. In 1989, for example, the

average gain in consumer surplus per patient was $25,000, while in 2000, the average gain in

surplus was roughly $256,000; this implies an annual increase of 21%. This rapid increase is

generated by substantial gains in survival, accompanied by relatively little growth in the costs of

cancer care, relative to 1988 levels.

Aggregate Consumer and Producer Surpluses

Given our estimates of individual lifetime consumer surplus gains arising from improvements in

cancer survival, Table 6 presents our estimates of gains in aggregate consumer surplus, which is

simply the number of newly incident cases in a given year multiplied by the individual consumer

surplus gains reported in Table 5.

In the aggregate, we find that patients have received tremendous value from treatment and

detection advances since 1988, with estimated total consumer surplus gained of roughly $1.9

trillion for all cancer patients whose disease began between 1989 and 2000. Table 6 also presents

estimates of gains in producer surplus.

        The ranges for producer surplus represent different means by which costs of care are

translated into profits. We assume that profit margins range from the high margins enjoyed by

producers of on-patent pharmaceuticals, to the lower margins enjoyed by hospitals. For drugs,

Caves et al. (1991), Grabowski and Vernon (1992) and Berndt, Cockburn, and Griliches (1996)

estimate that producer variable costs are 20% of sales. On the other hand, Gaynor and Vogt

(2003) find that hospitals have profit margins of 25%. Consistent with these estimates, we allow

producer profits to range between 20% and 80% of sales. Since health care spending on cancer

is, of course, a combination of drug therapies, as well as physician and hospital compensation,


                                                                                                               32
actual profit margins are likely to fall somewhere between the two bounds we use. Even with the

most generous assumptions on producer surpluses, Table 6 illustrates that while producers have

benefited from increases in cancer surplus, these gains have been small relative to the gains

experienced by cancer patients. We estimate the producer surplus to be $98-393 billion from

1988 to 2000.

       The sum of producer and consumer surpluses arising from improvements in cancer

survival from 1988 to 2000 is $1.9 trillion to $2.2 trillion. In order to calculate the social surplus

arising from these gains in survival, we must deduct the amount spent on cancer R&D. There

are two challenges to estimating this quantity. First, a significant proportion of R&D comes

from pharmaceutical firms, which do not typically report R&D by disease category. Second,

ideally, we would calculate the R&D spending which produced the observed survival gains

between 1988 and 2000. However, given that biomedical research often takes time to be

translated into clinical practice, it is difficult to directly determine which part of R&D in a given

year produced these gains. For example, it is likely that some of the survival gains between 1988

and 2000 were due to research spending in earlier years, while some of the R&D spending

between 1988 and 2000 did not produce the observed survival gains during this time period.

       To address these issues, we construct an upper bound on R&D spending as follows.

First, we calculate the total value of National Cancer Institute spending between 1971 and 2000,

using data on the Institute’s annual appropriations (Appendix Table A.1). After converting each

year’s appropriations to 2006 dollars using the Consumer Price Index and discounting to 1988 at

a 3% interest rate, we find that the total value of cancer R&D spending was roughly $82 billion.

Assuming that NCI spending represents 25% of all cancer R&D spending leads to an upper

bound for cancer R&D of roughly $300 billion. This estimate is likely an upper bound for two




                                                                                                   33
reasons. First, as already discussed, it is unlikely that all spending between 1971 and 2000

contributed to the survival gains between 1988 and 2000. Second, it is likely that NCI spending

accounts for more than 25% of total cancer R&D.           For example, Jaffe (1996) finds that,

generally speaking, the federal government accounts for 35% of R&D spending. Using $300

billion as an upper bound for cancer R&D, we estimate the total social surplus of 1988-2000

survival gains to be roughly $1.6-$1.9 trillion, with 82-95% of this surplus accruing to patients

and 5-19% accruing to producers.

Sensitivity Analyses

       In this section, we describe analyses used to determine the sensitivity of our results to

potential sources of bias. The first we consider is the possibility of lead time bias. Lead time

bias occurs because registry data such as SEER report survival from the date of diagnosis, not

the date of incidence. As a result, improvements in detection lead to the inclusion of patients at

earlier stages of disease. These individuals will have longer remaining life expectancy even in

the absence of any true gains in survival. For example, suppose that all cancer patients die ten

years post-incidence regardless of whether the disease is detected at the “early” (two years post-

incidence) or “late” (eight years post-incidence) stages.       In this case, registry data will

erroneously show that early detection leads to a six year survival improvement. Thus, lead time

bias will tend to overstate the importance of detection improvements. As the example above

shows, lead time bias can be overcome by adding the transition time between stages to the

observed survival for patients whose disease is diagnosed at later stages.          Knowledge of

transition times allows accurate calculation of the actual life expectancy from the date of

incidence, rather than the potentially misleading life expectancy from the date of diagnosis.




                                                                                                34
         Since the transition time between incidence and diagnosis is generally unknown, we

examine the degree to which variability in the transition time impacts our findings. As discussed

earlier, we consider the range of assumptions on transition times, from zero to three years for all

of the cancers we consider except breast cancer, where we consider a transition time of zero to

two years between stages. For cancers with three designated stages, such as colon, pancreatic,

and lung cancer, this amounts to an assumed six year transition time between early and late

disease. There are two major concerns with our approach. The first is the plausibility of a six-

year transition time, in the absence of treatment, from early stage to metastatic disease. While

there are few studies that have assessed the progression of cancer in the absence of treatment, the

extant literature suggests the transition time between early stage and malignant disease is roughly

two years or less. For example, Raz et al. (2007) examined survival among 1,324 California

patients who were untreated for stage I disease due to patient refusal, death prior to surgery, or

contraindications due to risk factors, and found a median survival of 9 months. In the case of

breast cancer, Bloom et al (1962) found the median survival for stage 1, stage 2, and stage 3

breast cancer to be 47.3 months, 39.2 months, and 22 months, respectively. Based on these

numbers, the average time to transition between grades is about one year, although the staging

system used by Bloom, the Manchester system, is a clinical system that differs slightly from the

AJCC system used in SEER.17

         The second issue concerns the limits of our database itself. With a six-year transition

period between early and metastatic disease, individuals whose disease begins in 2000 will not

be diagnosed at the metastatic stage until 2006—however, the last year of observation in our data

is 2003. Therefore, for our sensitivity analysis, we consider how assuming a three-year transition

comparability. SEER reports breast cancer in four stages, while the other tumor types are broken
down into three stages.


         Not surprisingly, survival gains between 1988 and 1997 tend to be smaller than the gain

between 1988 and 2000, although interestingly, the opposite is true for pancreatic cancer. As a

result, the value of 1988-1997 survival gains tends to be smaller than the value of 1988-2000

gains. The three-year transition time generally has modest effects on survival, with the lone

exception of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Our results suggest that taking lead time bias into

account has little effect on the estimated share of gains due to treatment, with the exception of

breast cancer, where taking lead time bias into account increases the share of gains due to

treatment from 68 to 82 percent. Willingness-to-pay also typically does not change by more than

10%, with the exception of lung cancer, where the longer transition time substantially raises the

value of survival gains. In sum, lead time bias likely has quantitatively modest impacts on our



18
   Because breast cancer is modeled as a four stage disease a three year transition time between stages would lead to
nine year transition period between early and late stage disease. Therefore, for breast cancer, we assume a two year
transition time between stages, which amounts to a six year transition from early to metastatic disease.

results; if anything, it causes us to understate the value of survival gains, and the share of

survival accounted for by improved treatment.

       “Length bias” refers to unobserved changes in tumor and/or patient characteristics, which

may lead us to overestimate survival gains, and the share of gains due to treatment.

Improvements in detection will tend to sample slower-growing tumors with more favorable

survival characteristics. This is one way in which length bias may cause a spurious increase in

survival. Changes in patient characteristics over time may also create length bias. For example,

improvements in treating other co-morbid conditions, such as cardiovascular disease, may result

in a healthier patient population over time.      On the other hand, reductions in background

mortality may result in an older, sicker population of incident cases. Overall, secular trends in

mortality and co-morbidity may produce length bias of indeterminate sign.

       While we are unable to deal directly with unobservable changes in tumor and/or patient

characteristics, we assessed the direction and degree of this bias by evaluating changes in the

observable characteristics of cancer patients, between 1992 and 2005, using the Medicare

Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS). The MCBS is a nationally representative data set designed

to ascertain health status, utilization, and expenditures for the Medicare population. The sample

frame consists of aged and disabled beneficiaries enrolled in Medicare Part A and/or Part B,

although we use only the aged in this analysis. The MCBS attempts to interview each person

twelve times over three years, regardless of whether he or she resides in the community, a

facility, or transitions between community and facility settings. The disabled (under 65 years of

age) and the oldest-old (85 years of age or over) are over-sampled. The first round of

interviewing was conducted in 1991. Originally, the survey was a longitudinal sample with

periodic supplements and indefinite periods of participation. In 1996, the MCBS switched to a




                                                                                                  37
rotating panel design with limited periods of participation. Each fall a new panel is introduced,

with a target sample size of 12,000 respondents, and each summer a panel is retired. The MCBS

contains detailed self-reported information, including the prevalence of various conditions.

           Using the MCBS, we calculated regression-adjusted trends in co-morbidity prevalence

among incident and prevalent cancer cases among the 65+ population. We ran separate

regressions for the following conditions: diabetes, heart disease,19 high blood pressure, lung

disease, and stroke. The regressions adjust for age, sex, race, and ethnicity. The results for

incident cancer cases are shown in Table 8.

        The cells in the table report coefficients on year dummies, where 1993 is the excluded

category. Relative to 1993, there are no statistically significant trends for any of these diseases,

but power is an important consideration. The MCBS contains approximately 1000 incident

cancer cases over this entire period, and standard errors around the terminal year (2005) tend to

be in the range of 6 to 9 percentage points. Therefore, while there is little evidence to support

bias in either direction, the ability to reject the existence of bias is limited by sample sizes.

       While the incident population is the ideal choice for this analysis, we also assessed health

trends for the prevalent population, in an effort to conserve power. It is important to note that

this analysis combines the health of the entering population, with trends in the health of cancer

patients who continue to live with the disease. With that caveat, Table 9 presents the analogous

trends for the prevalent population, clustered by individual.

         Among the prevalent population, there is no significant change in heart disease, lung

disease, or stroke, but there are statistically significant (and somewhat meaningful) increases in

the prevalence of diabetes and hypertension. These likely owe themselves to background growth

in these conditions over the period of analysis, due to rising obesity (Mokdad et al., 2003). We

may conclude that the population of cancer patients is becoming slightly sicker, due to higher

diabetes and hypertension.           This would lead us to understate both the size and value of

improvements in survival. However, it is important to reiterate the caveat that we cannot draw

firm conclusions for the incident population.

                                              IV. CONCLUSION

         Despite the abundant research documenting gains in cancer survival, there have been few

attempts to characterize the value of cancer R&D. We provide some evidence relevant to this

issue, by measuring the value of cancer R&D, relative to its costs. We also calculate how the

social gains from R&D have been distributed between patients and producers, and the size of the

respective roles played by improved treatment and earlier detection. Our findings suggest that

cancer R&D has led to significant gains in cancer survival, which have been large relative to the

costs incurred in their pursuit. And while some cancers have experienced larger reductions in

morbidity and mortality than others, today’s cancer patients can expect to live longer and

healthier lives than their counterparts from earlier decades; these longevity increases far

outweigh the costs of achieving them.

         Across all cancers, the gains in survival have been worth around half of full income, and

even those in the bottom 10% of the income distribution would be willing to pay around 40% of

their income for the observed gains in cancer survival.20 In the aggregate, we find the value of


20
  In line with work by Hall and Jones (2007), our results also suggest that cancer is a “luxury good,” in the sense
that wealthier patients are willing to devote larger shares of their income to pay for gains in cancer survival.


                                                                                                                      41
gains in cancer survival to be $1.9 trillion to date, of which 5% to 19% has been appropriated by

producers in the form of profits. To provide some context for this number, we estimate that from

1988 to 2000, cancer afflicted roughly 9.5 million Americans. Across the newly diagnosed

individuals in all these cohorts, we estimate that life expectancy increased by an average of 3.9

years per patient, compared to its 1988 level. This implies the creation of 23 million life-years.

As a result, the average life-year created was worth approximately $86,000 to its recipient.

Moreover, we find that, at most, $300 billion has been spent on cancer research, implying that

private and federal R&D efforts have enjoyed very large average returns. Our results are

consistent with earlier research valuing survival gains for other diseases experiencing substantial

improvements in mortality. For example, Philipson and Jena (2006) find that in the case of

AIDS, producers were able to appropriate approximately 5% of the social surplus arising from

innovations in HIV/AIDS medications. By comparison, we find that producers have been able to

appropriate 5-19% of the social surplus generated by cancer survival gains from 1988 to 2000.

       Our analysis has focused on the average return to cancer research. This is distinct from

the return on the marginal cancer research dollar. Naturally, marginal returns will be lower than

average returns. High average returns do not imply that marginal returns exceed marginal cost.

The value of the marginal dollar on cancer research is still an open question, and one that is

worth further investigation. While the War on Cancer has, on average, paid dividends, it may be

true that the size of cancer R&D spending is too large or too small, on the margin.

       It is important to note that our estimates of the aggregate value of cancer gains exclude

several significant sources of value. First, we do not account for the value of gains for patients

whose cancer occurs after 2000. Even in the absence of any further technological progress in

cancer, these patients would still benefit from technologies discovered to date; therefore, our




                                                                                                42
estimates will understate the total social value by excluding this group. Second, our analysis

assumes that there are no technology improvements for individuals whose cancer begins in a

given year. For example, we assume that individuals whose cancer began in 1995 face the 1995

technology for the entire course of their disease. Third, our analysis does not take into account

the potential gains from cancer prevention, whether from changes in behavior or from detection

of premalignant lesions as occurs with cervical and colorectal cancer.

       Our results should be interpreted as a first effort to investigate the value of gains in

cancer survival. Future research can extend it in several directions. First, as discussed, progress

needs to be made on estimating the marginal return to cancer R&D. Second, our definition of

early-stage cancer is very broad, as it includes all individuals for whom the cancer has not

metastasized. While this limitation was driven by the data, future analyses could examine how

finer definitions of stage affect the results. Third, our limited approach towards modeling the

transition time between cancer stages could be replaced by more detailed and clinically specific

estimates. In addition, with more years of data, one could examine the sensitivity of our results

to assuming longer transition times between stages. Finally, more refined estimates of cancer

spending and R&D are useful and could impact our results, particularly if there have been trends

in the percentage of health care dollars devoted to cancer.

Notes: All Amounts are in Year 2006 dollars, discounted to 1990 at a 3% rate. The annual value of survival gains is
an individual’s annual willingness to pay, in each year of her remaining life, for observed survival improvements.
The lifetime value of survival gains is calculated by multiplying the annual value by the total discounted life
expectancy. The implied value of a life year is calculated by dividing the lifetime value of survival gains by the
increase in life expectancy.
