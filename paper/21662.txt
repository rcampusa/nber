Exchange Market Pressure in OECD and Emerging Economies:¸˛Domestic vs. External Factors
and Capital Flows in the Old and New Normal

                                              ABSTRACT

We study the ways domestic and external global factors (such as risk appetite, global liquidity, U.S.
monetary policy, and commodity prices) affected the exchange market pressure before and after the
global financial crisis as well as the role of these factors during the Federal Reserve’s tapering episode.
Utilizing a comprehensive database on capital controls, we investigate whether control measures have
a significant impact on mitigating exchange market pressure associated with capital flows [net and
gross]. Using quarterly data over the 2000–2014 period and a dynamic panel model estimation, we
find that external factors played a significant role in driving exchange market pressure for both OECD
countries and emerging market countries, with a larger impact on the latter. While the effect of net
capital flows on exchange market pressure is muted, short-term gross portfolio inflows and outflows
comprise important factors that account for exchange market pressure. Short-term portfolio flows and
long-term foreign direct investment flows have a significant impact on exchange market pressure for
emerging market economies and no significant effect for OECD countries. Capital controls seem to
significantly reduce the exchange market pressure although the economic size of this impact is highly
dependent on the institutional quality.

1. Introduction

      Over the last three decades, global financial integration has created major opportunities
and challenges for policymakers in both advanced and emerging market economies. The
financial integration trend, however, has faced several disruptive crises in emerging markets
including the Mexican, the Russian, and the East Asian crises in the 1990s. The last and major
disruption in financial markets, the global financial crisis [GFC], originated in the U.S. and
was driven by problems in the subprime mortgage market as well as related securitization and
investment activities across the globe. The highly accommodative monetary policies in
advanced economies following the GFC—and more recently the policy actions and
perspectives with regard to exiting from such accommodative policies—have created further
challenges and instabilities particularly in emerging markets. The fact that global interest rates
and asset prices have become increasingly correlated during the recent period of
unconventional monetary policies has also magnified the challenges facing the worldwide
financial system (Mohanty, 2014).

      With increasing financial integration and resulting international spillovers, the
identification and implications of channels of spillover have become important for appropriate
policy designs and actions. Takats and Vela (2014), Mohanty (2014), and Caruana (2012)
have distinguished and discussed five stylized spillover channels that include (i) the exchange
rate, (ii) the policy interest rate, (iii) long-term interest rates, (iv) international bank lending,
and (v) portfolio flows. Among these, the first and the most obvious channel of external
economic conditions and domestic macroeconomic factors is the exchange rate—the focus of
this paper.

      The role of the exchange rate in the international spillovers depend on the exchange rate
regime and related management policies. For instance, from 2010 to 2012, following the
global financial crisis period, countries aiming at an export-led recovery opted to undertake
devaluations/depreciations as a way to improve their competitiveness. A heated debate then
ensued, dubbed the “Currency War.” In the aftermath of the GFC, the weaker parts of the
Euro region experienced severe debt crises that raised concerns regarding the sustainability
and stability of the Eurozone. The growing asymmetry between the expansionary policies of
the FED and the deflationary trends in the Eurozone as well as the growing financial
instability of Euro’s periphery have magnified the euro/dollar exchange rate volatility and
contributed to the large euro depreciation during 2014–2015Q1.


                                                   2
      Given the large fluctuations of key exchange rates and their importance as an
international-spillover channel, understanding the role of domestic and external factors,
international capital flows, and capital controls in determining the exchange market pressure
have been understudied in recent years. This paper aims to fill this gap, analyzing the degree
to which domestic factors and external global factors (risk appetite, global liquidity, U.S.
monetary policy, commodity prices, and the like) have affected exchange market pressure
before and after the GFC. Utilizing a recent comprehensive database on capital controls, we
also explore whether net and gross capital flows and capital control measures have a
significant impact on exchange market pressure. In addition, this research complements the
studies on the transmission of U.S. tapering talk during 2013 to emerging market economics
(Eichengreen and Gupta, 2014; Aizenman et al., 2014) by focusing on the exchange market
pressure before and after the GFC.

      Large fluctuations of the exchange rate are an important issue in policy considerations
for countries concerned with the sustainability of external imbalances as well as for export-
oriented economies. Exchange rate fluctuations may have a substantial effect on financial
stability via numerous macro channels, including destabilizing balance sheet effects. Indeed,
currency substitution and currency mismatches at the aggregate level have been linked with
banking and debt crises in emerging markets (e.g., Chile in the 1980s and Mexico in the
1990s (BIS, 2008)). Capital flow composition has become more important for exchange rate
fluctuations as short-term flows are more prone to sudden reversals (Ahmed and Zlate, 2014,
and the references therein). During the GFC, unconventional monetary policies put forth by
advanced economies’ central banks led to large flows of capital into emerging economies and
encouraged carry trade activities. The recent wave of capital outflows from emerging markets
has been mainly in the form of portfolio investments - which includes equity and debt flows -
as the uncertain international economic outlook has also impacted the flow of foreign direct
investment (FDI) to emerging market economies (EME). Figures 1 and 2 show the total net
capital flows as well as gross inflows and outflows of a sub-group of the OECD and emerging
market countries.

      Using a dynamic panel estimation and quarterly data for 50 OECD and emerging
market countries from early 2000 to 2014Q3 period, we find that external factors (such as
market risk appetite, market liquidity, and U.S. monetary policy actions) play a significant
role in driving the exchange market pressure in both the OECD and emerging market
countries, with a larger impact on the latter. We also find that capital flow composition is

                                                3
important in driving the exchange market pressure. While the impact of net flows is muted,
short-term gross portfolio inflows and outflows are important factors in determining the
exchange market pressure. Capital controls seem to significantly reduce the exchange market
pressure, yet the impact is largely dependent on the institutional quality.

      The rest of this paper is organized as follows. The next section gives a brief literature
review. Section 2 presents the data and methodology of the study. Section 3 presents the main
results and extensions of the basic models and Section 4 concludes.

2. Literature

      The literature on exchange market pressure (EMP) goes back to Girton and Roper
(1977), who introduced a monetary model of such pressure and applied it to the post-war
Canadian dollar. Weymark (1995) then further formalized the model. She proposed a model-
independent definition such as “exchange market pressure measures the total excess demand
for a currency in international markets as the exchange rate change that would have been
required to remove this excess demand in the absence of exchange market intervention, given
the expectations generated by the exchange rate policy actually implemented” (p. 278). This
definition implies a direct observable measure of the pressure in cases in which the domestic
currency is freely floating. However, since intermediate exchange-rate regimes are adopted by
most countries, counterfactual measures include other policy actions such as FX market
interventions and interest rate adjustments to ward off the pressure on the exchange rate.
Thus, EMP is often measured as a weighted sum of exchange rate depreciation and
international reserve loss (including interest rate differentials in some cases) and is frequently
applied to the analysis of emerging market currencies and crisis identification.

      Despite an extensive literature on the topic, research on EMP during and after the GFC
is limited. Rose and Spiegel (2009) and Frankel and Saravelos (2010) focused on the degree
to which leading indicators of financial crises have been useful in assessing country
vulnerability, while Aizenman et al. (2010) investigated the extent to which crises caused
EMP in emerging markets. 1 These authors also addressed the question of whether absorption


1
 Another study that looks at EMP during the recent financial crisis is by Feldkircher et al. (2014) in
which the authors examined whether pre-crisis leading indicators helped explain pressures on the
exchange rate during the global financial crisis. They used a wide data set covering 149 countries and
58 indicators as well as a Bayesian model averaging approach to deal with model uncertainty. The
research highlights the role of price stability as a major determinant of exchange rate pressures.


                                                   4
of the shock was mainly through exchange rate depreciation or the loss of international
reserves. Similarly, Aizenman and Hutchison (2012) evaluated how the global financial crisis
emanating from the U.S. moved into emerging markets by using EMP as one of the
indicators. Controlling for a variety of factors associated with EMP, they found that emerging
markets with higher total foreign liabilities (such as short- and long-term debt, equities, FDI,
and derivative products) had greater exposure and were much more vulnerable in the financial
crisis. 2 The current paper adds to the benchmark literature in several ways. First, it covers a
large sample of countries, both OECD and emerging economies, before and after the global
financial crisis. Second, it addresses the role of capital gross, net capital flows, and capital
controls. Third, it examines the most recent tapering episode in which after the global
financial crisis, tapering by the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank and the subsequent expectation of
monetary policy normalization led to heightened turbulences in foreign exchange markets in
emerging as well as in advanced economies.

      The more direct link between the compositing of capital flows and nominal and real
exchange rate movements has been recognized in the literature. Capital flows associated with
the rebalancing of portfolios may initiate foreign-exchange order flows, which, in turn, induce
exchange rate movements and potentially account for exchange rate movements at higher
frequencies. Indeed, several recent empirical studies have found significant effects of
portfolio flows on real exchange rates. For instance, Brooks et al. (2001) and Bakardzhieva et
al. (2010) have reported that portfolio investment flows, foreign borrowing, and aid and
income flows are found to significantly affect the real exchange rate, while flows related to
foreign direct investment were not found to influence the real exchange rate significantly.

      Combesa et al. (2012) also analyzed the impact of capital inflows on the real effective
exchange rate for emerging and developing countries and show that both public and private
inflows are associated with an appreciation of the real effective exchange rate. Among private
inflows, portfolio investments display the biggest impact on appreciation. Jongwanich and
Kohpaiboonb (2013) reached similar results. Additionally, addressing the nexus of the real
exchange rate (RER) and capital inflows through a comparative analysis of emerging market
economies in Asia and Latin America, Athukorala and Rajapatirana (2003) found that the


2
  Despite the remarkable buildup of international reserves by emerging markets before and during the
financial crisis, the EME reaction was mainly through exchange rate depreciation rather than reserve
loss in absorbing most of the exchange market pressure. This finding is in line with the view that at
times of deflationary pressure, countries may opt for depreciation to gain competitiveness, as the
downside risk of higher inflation is of lesser concern.

                                                  5
degree of appreciation in the RER associated with capital inflow is uniformly much higher in
Latin American countries compared with their Asian counterparts despite the fact that the
latter has experienced far greater foreign capital inflows relative to the size of their
economies. While several studies provide evidence on the role of capital flows and the
compositional effects on the exchange rate, the role of external (“push”) and domestic (“pull”)
factors and capital controls in explaining the exchange market pressure before and after the
global financial crisis has been under-investigated. 3

3. Data and Methodology

      We collect quarterly data on OECD and EME countries from 2000 Q1 through 2014
Q3. The list of countries is shown in Table A1 in the Appendix. 4 Data on the foreign
exchange rate, international reserves (minus gold), money market rates, population, GDP, CPI
inflation, base money (or M1, if not available), trade balance, domestic credit, domestic stock
market indices, portfolio, and FDI flows are obtained from the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) International Financial Statistics (IFS) database. In cases in which the IFS database
does not provide data on relevant range and frequency, we utilize national data sources. The
IMF Quarterly External Debt Statistics (QEDS) database provides the gross short-term
external debt data. The country-specific commodity terms of trade index is constructed
following Ricci et al. (2008), Spatafora and Tytell (2009), and Aizenman et al. (2012), using
data sources therein. For the U.S. market variables such as the TED spread, the VIX, U.S.
bond yields, and Federal fund rates, we mainly use data from the Federal Reserve Economic
Data (FRED) provided by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.

      We also use the most recent data set on capital controls by Fernandez et al. (2015). This
new data set includes capital control restrictions on both inflows and outflows of 10 asset
categories for 100 countries over the 1995 to 2013 period based primarily on the analysis of
the IMF’s Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions. Fernandez
et al. (2010) argue that the new data set could offer a detailed analysis of capital controls such


3
  Eichengreen and Gupta (2014), Ahmed and Zlate (2014), Aizenman et al. (2014), and Fratzscher et
al. (2013) looked at quantitative easing, the most recent tapering polices, and the effect on emerging
financial markets.

  Some of the countries in our sample are OECD members and also considered emerging market
economies according to the Morgan Stanley Capital Index. As Table A1 lists, these countries include
Poland, Turkey, and Korea, among others. In the case of country grouping overlap, we include them in
the emerging market group, which gives us 22 OECD and 28 EME in the sample.


                                                  6
as the co-movements of controls on different types of assets and inflows-outflows, “as well as
the construction of aggregate measures of controls that are well targeted to the specific nature
of the topic being studied. Variations of such aggregate measures across time serve as one
indicator of the intensity of the application of restrictions on international capital movements”
(p. 4). Since various channels of spillovers that include portfolio, international bank lending
and other flows could potentially affect exchange rate fluctuations, a capital control index that
covers various sources of international capital movement is needed to assess the impact on
EMP. 5 Thus, with this data set, we can investigate the impact of aggregate and disaggregate
controls on capital inflows and outflows as well as on different asset categories. Capital
controls could be particularly important in investigating EMP since one of the reasons for the
imposition of capital controls is due to the concern over the impact of large exchange-rate
movements. Since substantial appreciation or depreciation of the currency could have a
detrimental impact on the real and financial economy, it is anticipated that various forms of
capital controls could help offset the EMP. 6

      Another important variable is capital flows. As discussed in the literature review, capital
flows could lead to significant fluctuations in asset prices. Furthermore, capital flows are
another significant channel of international spillover and have been one of the most important
elements of financial stability concerns particularly in emerging economies. A related debate
over capital flows centers on the relevance of gross versus net flows. For instance, Borio and
Disyatat (2011) and Broner et al. (2013) stress the importance of measuring gross rather than
net cross-border financial positions in assessing systemic risks as well as the role of gross
flows particularly during the recent financial crisis. This is partially due to a distinguishing
feature of the recent period in which the rapid increase in gross flows does not always show
up in the net capital flow statistics. On the other hand, the short-run dynamics of different

5
  Recently, more granular data sets on capital controls have been constructed. For instance, Pasricha et
al. (2015) complement IMF’s AREAER with data points regarding each change in a capital account
regulation including policy changes and announcements using regulators’ websites and news sources.
While this data set has a higher frequency regarding the timing of changes, it is only available for 18
EMEs. Another comprehensive data source in the context of macroprudential policies is due to a
recent study by Bruno et al. (2015) in which an assessment of the effectiveness of macroprudential
policies in 12 Asia-Pacific economies is provided. Using domestic macroprudential measures and
capital controls, the study focuses on the impact of such policies on the banking sector and bond
markets. The capital controls measure used in our study already includes these sub-categories.
6
  For further discussion on the imposition of capital controls, see Dooley (1996) in which he argued
that “capital controls are imposed for a number of reasons but all are based on the desire to insulate the
domestic economy from some form of international capital flow.”


                                                    7
asset classes in net terms could be a more relevant measure for financial stress, which
includes EMP (Aizenman et al., 2012). Against this background, we investigate both net and
gross capital flows for exchange market pressure 7 with disaggregation of long-term FDI flows
and short-term portfolio flows. 8

      We estimate the following dynamic panel model for exchange market pressure:

                    𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛽𝛽0 + 𝛽𝛽1 𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖−1 + 𝛽𝛽2 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽3 𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽4 𝑍𝑍𝑡𝑡 + 𝜇𝜇𝑖𝑖 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ,   (1)

where 𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is the exchange market pressure for country i at time t; and 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 includes
domestic factors such as change in real GDP per capita, CPI inflation, change in domestic
credit/GDP, trade balance/GDP, short-term external debt/GDP, and stock market returns. 𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖
includes capital flows (net or gross) as share of GDP, capital controls, and commodity terms
of trade; 𝑍𝑍𝑡𝑡 includes external factors such as global liquidity indicators including the TED
spread, the VIX, the change in effective federal funds rate, the slope of the U.S. yield curve
(the difference between 10-year long term and 3-month short-term yields); and 𝜇𝜇𝑖𝑖 indicates
country fixed effects.

      Following the literature as discussed in Aizenman et al. (2012), we construct three
alternative measures of EMP. The standard EMP measure is the difference between the
percentage change in exchange rate and foreign exchange reserves, which is defined as:
                                               𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑡 −𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑡−1       𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 −𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡−1
                                  𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑡 =                  −                      ,                           (2)
                                                 𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑡−1               𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡−1


where 𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑡 is exchange rates (local currency per U.S. dollar) and 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 is the foreign exchange
reserve (minus gold). Thus, the EMP measure here gives a quarterly relative change in
exchange rate and foreign exchange reserves. We modify this measure by adding domestic
and foreign interest-rate differentials aimed at shoring up the exchange rate pressure in




7
  Our net measure is constructed as the difference between, for instance, changes of FDI assets and
liability. Thus, net capital flows indicate net outflows (inflows) when these changes are positive
(negative). For the capital inflows and outflows, we use net assets and liability measures as indicators
of outflows and inflows while treating, for instance, negative (positive) net asset (liability) as capital
inflows (outflows). During the amassing of the sample in our paper, the IMF released the sixth edition
of its Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Manual (BPM6) in 2009, replacing
the fifth edition (BPM5). Thus, since 2005, we used capital flows data from BPM6, and merged from
2000–2004 accordingly.
8
  While we are able to further disaggregate portfolio inflows into debt and equity flows, neither of
these components were available for all of the countries in our sample. Therefore, we opted to use
only aggregate portfolio flow measures in the empirical analysis.

                                                                  8
addition to foreign exchange intervention when constructing the counterfactual (Klaassen and
Jager, 2011):

                                           𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑡 −𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑡−1                                 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 −𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡−1
                            𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑡 =                    − (𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 − 𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡∗ ) −                              ,           (3)
                                             𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑡−1                                         𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡−1


where 𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 and 𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡∗ are the money market rate for home and base country (the U.S.). 9 Another
measure of EMP is the difference between exchange rate depreciation/appreciation and
foreign exchange reserves deflated by base money and considered as the monetary model-
based EMP, constructed as follows:
                                                𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑡 −𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑡−1                                 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 −𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡−1
                           𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑡𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏 =                    − (𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 − 𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡∗ ) −                               ,   (4)
                                                  𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑡−1                                       𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑡𝑡−1


where 𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑡𝑡−1 is the monetary base converted to the U.S. dollar. In cases in which the
monetary base is not available, we use M1 as a monetary aggregate. Given that both measures
above are unweighted, a third measure of EMP is constructed by a standardized difference
between the exchange rate and foreign reserve changes and shown as:
                                                      ∆𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑡 −𝜇𝜇𝑒𝑒         ∇𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 −𝜇𝜇𝑖𝑖       ∆𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 −𝜇𝜇𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖
                         𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑡𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 =                 −                   −                      ,       (5)
                                                          𝜎𝜎𝑒𝑒               𝜎𝜎𝑖𝑖               𝜎𝜎𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖


where ∆𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑡 and ∆𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 are the quarterly percentage in the exchange rate and international
reserves, ∇𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 is interest rate differential, and 𝜇𝜇 and 𝜎𝜎 are the mean and standard deviation of
respective variables. While monetary base or volatility are the most potential weighting
schemes for foreign exchange reserves, other measures such as the FX market turnover could
also be used to incorporate FX market transactions relative to FX reserves. For instance,
Ehlers and Packer (2013) use a BIS triennial central bank survey to document growing FX
market turnover in emerging markets with an increasing role of “other financial institutions”
9
  Following the earlier work of Girton and Roper (1977) on EMP, all studies include the exchange rate
change and change in reserves and at times scaled by narrow money supply. Regarding the use of the
interest rate component, those studies differ as some leave out the interest rate, others include it by
taking the first difference of the domestic rate, while the rest use the interest rate differential between
the domestic and the reference country. Klaassen and Jager (2011) review these different approaches
and offer a definition-consistent measure of exchange market pressure that includes the interest rate in
the level form and relative to the interest rate chosen if the country had no exchange rate objective.
From an operational point of view, they offer a simplified proposal of using nominal interest rate
differentials between the home country and the reference country. In addition to using interest rates in
level, another feature of the definition-consistent measure of Klaassen and Jager (2011) is that the
interest rate differential term inters into the EMP with a negative sign, for which they argue that it is a
consequence of using a flexible price monetary model. Thus, while we report the baseline and
extended results for EMP estimations using the approach outlined above only, we have compared the
complete results by not including interest rate components and by including it following, for instance,
Eichengreen et al. (1996) for the robustness check. These alternatives are giving qualitatively similar
results in terms of the role of domestic macro versus international market fundamentals in explaining
the EMP. All estimation results are available from the authors upon request.

                                                                      9
and offshore trading and find that the trading of emerging market currencies is positively
related to the size of cross-border financial flows. Despite the broad time coverage (1998
through 2013), the triennial frequency of such a data set is a natural limitation such that we
are not able to use it as an alternate weighting scheme in the construction of the EMP
measure.

      Although we use these measures for the baseline estimations, we mainly use the first
measure because it is easy to interpret. Figures 3a–3c give the cross-sectional average of the
three measures of EMP with a breakdown of the OECD and emerging economies. All
measures for both country groups indicate a slight downward trend prior to the GFC and a
heightened volatility during and after the crisis.

      As a final note, the external indicators of the VIX, the TED spread, and the local stock
market return could be closely correlated and in a sub-period analysis, in particular, could
lead to a problem of multicollinearity and thus bias in the estimated parameter. Therefore, we
reduce this potential problem by orthogonalizing some of the variables. For instance, the VIX
is regressed on the TED spread and the residual from this regression is used as a pure measure
of risk. By the same approach, domestic equity returns are regressed on the S&P 500 returns
and the residuals used as the measure of pure domestic returns (see Fratzscher, 2012, for the
same approach).

      For estimation methodology, we use the typical dynamic panel method to deal with the
inconsistency in parameter estimates as well as to capture the dynamic adjustment and
persistency of EMP. The actual change in exchange rates is known to exhibit weak serial
correlation and even show random walk behavior. Hence, for floating exchange rates, the
EMP is expected to be equal to a change in exchange rate and thus the pressure is not
persistent. However, there could be regime-dependent persistence in the monetary model (see,
for instance, Klaassen, 2012, for further theoretical discussion and an empirical test on the
persistence of EMP). Therefore, to capture the persistence in EMP, the lagged value of the
dependent variable is included as the right-hand-side variable. To remove the inconsistency in
parameter estimates, we use the generalized method of moments (GMM) of Arellano and
Bond (AB, 1991), which was later extended by Arellano and Bover (1995) and subsequently
to system estimation by Blundell and Bond (1998).

      Given the endogeneity problem introduced by the lagged dependent variable, further
lags of the dependent variable are used as instruments. However, the AB estimation also


                                                10
allows treating other variables endogenously, such as capital flows, among the variables of
interest. One potential problem in implementing the GMM estimation of the AB type is that
the number of instruments explodes with T. This implies that such instrument proliferation
may over-fit the endogenous variable, which may introduce bias in estimates and weaken the
power of the Hansen test. Roodman (2009a) discusses the potential pitfalls of instrument
proliferation and suggests limiting the number to certain lags or collapsing the instruments by
having separate moments for each lag (instead of a moment for each lag in a time period). We
follow these guidelines to satisfy the condition of using the number of instruments equal to or
less than the number of countries. Additionally, given the structure of our sample, we use a
one-step GMM system in the estimations to lower the bias and improve efficiency. Along
with the regression results, we report the diagnostic tests including the first- and second-order
autocorrelation, the Hansen J-test statistic for over-identifying restrictions, and the Hansen C-
test statistic (difference-in-Hansen test statistic) to validate the IV-style instruments. 10

4. Empirical Results

        Estimation results for model (1) with three alternative EMP measures are reported in
Table 2 and in the following tables with various extensions and robustness tests. We take
several venues in terms of reporting baseline results with complete samples of countries and
time periods. We also provide a comparison across sub-groups of OECD versus emerging
countries. Moreover, over the period of analysis, we observe large swings in the exchange
rate driven by the global financial crisis, which was preceded by the relatively stable period of
the Great Moderation, and a post-crisis period of valuation due to expansionary U.S.
monetary policy that was coupled with a large flow of foreign capital into emerging
economies. During the post-crisis period, a heated debate ensued over exchange rate
fluctuations, which was later dubbed the Currency War in late 2010 when countries chose to
competitively devalue as a way to move the economic recovery though their external
balances. In the aftermath of the crisis, the Euro area was sliding into a severe debt crisis that
raised concerns about the sustainability of the Eurozone and led to a fluctuation in dollar/euro
rates as well as to other countries’ currencies that had close trade ties or was anchored to the
euro.

        For emerging economies, the last phase of currency fluctuations was driven by scaling
back asset purchases through a policy known as quantitative easing. The FED’s tapering

                                                  11
issues came to the fore in 2013 with a major debate among policymakers and market
participants about an exit strategy from the massive monetary stimulus. A milestone for
financial markets around the world was on May 22, 2013, when then-Federal Reserve
Chairman Bernanke raised the possibility of tapering in his Congressional testimony. The
actual tapering process started on December 18, 2013, when the Fed decided at the FOMC
meeting to taper its asset purchases by $10 billion per month to $75 billion as a gradual
reduction over the following months. Therefore, we consider all of these episodes of policy
changes and present a sub-period analysis with alternative market variables that are relevant
to the exchange market pressure.

      Table 2 reports our baseline estimation results for alternative EMP measures and a sub-
sample of country groups by regressing them on a vector of domestic macro, financial
variables, and external factors. Estimation results for the first measure of EMP are presented
in specifications (1) to (3) for the full sample of countries, OECD, and emerging countries,
respectively. The full sample results for the entire period indicate that a lower GDP per capital
growth and a lower stock return as well as market risk and risk appetite with a higher Federal
Reserve policy rate are all significantly associated with higher EMP. Comparing the OECD
and emerging countries, in specifications (2) and (3), we observe that financial/market
indicators—both domestic and external factors—have more important explanatory power for
EME than the OECD sample. With regard to cross-border capital flows—one of the important
channels of international transmission—both short-term portfolio flows and long-term FDI
flows have a significant impact on exchange market pressure for EME and no significant
effect for OECD countries. This marked difference between the coefficient of net capital
flows for merging versus OECD countries is indicative of the increasing role of financial
integration of emerging economies during the Great Moderation and afterwards. At the same
time, this result also highlights the importance of deep money and capital markets that lessen
the consequences of surge and reversal in capital flows.

      Estimation results for Table 2 show that along with highly significant financial
indicators and capital flows, for other EMP measures, trade balance and domestic credit seem
to have a marginally significant association for EME with market pressure. For instance, a
negative trade balance coefficient indicates the net export of goods and services and implies
lower EMP while a higher domestic credit GDP ratio, which is a proxy for looser monetary
policy, is indicative of higher EMP for emerging economies (and a counter effect for OECD).



                                               12
      As discussed in the data section, besides the unweighted sum of exchange rate
depreciation, interest rate differentials and a loss of foreign reserves, two other measures are
also reported in the literature. Hence, we run our baseline model with both alternative
measures and show results in specifications (4) through (9) in Table 2. To a large extent,
results are comparable to the first EMP measures in terms of persistence and the significance
of macro/financial indicators as well as domestic versus external factors and country group
comparison. Therefore, with both the base and standardized measures of EMP, we observe
larger explanatory powers of financial domestic and external factors compared with macro
and trade factors. For easy interpretation, coherence of results presentation, and related
discussion, we choose to use the first EMP measure in the following sections.

Capital Inflows and Outflows, and Capital Controls

      We provide further results on the role of capital flows and controls in Tables 3 and 4.
First, given the differing role of net and gross flows during tranquil versus turbulent times, we
break down net capital flows into inflows and outflows across two asset categories. Due to the
high correlation between inflows and outflows, we present results for FDI and portfolio
inflows and outflows in alternative specifications for the full sample and country groups. As
discussed in the literature review section, Brooks et al. (2001) and Bakardzhieva et al. (2010),
for example, found that portfolio investment flows, foreign borrowing, aid and income flows
are generally found to significantly affect the (real) exchange rate, while flows related to
foreign direct investment are not found to influence the (real) exchange rate significantly.
Controlling for the same set of domestic and external trade and finance factors as in Table 2,
the estimation results for EME give very similar results for EMP. In other words, both
portfolio inflows and outflows have a significant association with EMP while FDI inflows
and outflows are not found to have a significant effect. Therefore, compared with the results
in Table 2, while both net FDI and portfolio flows have significant explanatory power, the
direction of gross flows may yield different implications for EMP. Similarly, the direction of
flows does not have significant explanatory power for OECD countries, which also becomes
dominant when estimating the full sample of countries as in specifications (1) and (2).

      Regarding the effectiveness of capital controls, we present baseline results for the full
sample and country groups in specifications (1) through (3) in Table 4a. Due to a possible
simultaneity issue of capital controls and flows, we include the aggregate capital controls
index of Fernandez et al. (2015) in the first set of results.



                                                 13
      We find significant evidence of an aggregate capital control measure in reducing EMP
for OECD countries and no effect for the EME sample. The results are in contrast with a
recent survey of the literature by Magud and Reinhart (2007) on the effectiveness of capital
controls in which they argue that studies to date “are not very informative regarding the
effectiveness of controls in reducing the volume of capital flows and reducing real exchange
rate pressures’’ (p. 650). Although the exchange rate pressure they refer to is not necessarily
the same measure as EMP, for the OECD countries with minimal exchange market
intervention and thus a change in foreign exchange reserves, EMP boils down to change in the
exchange rate itself.

      In specifications (4) to (6), we estimate the baseline model with net capital flows and
controls and investigate whether capital controls have a significant effect controlling for
capital flows. The aggregate capital control measure still stands significant for OECD
countries with no effect for EME. These results are in line with Binici et al. (2010), who
investigate the effectiveness of capital controls on capital inflows and “highlight certain
asymmetries, namely, that capital controls appear more effective in advanced countries than
in less developed and emerging-market economies. This may be associated with better
institutional ability to enforce controls” (p. 681).

      The novelty of the Fernandez et al. (2015) data set is that their capital control measures
are disaggregated by asset class and by inflows/outflows for a large sample of countries
through 2013. Hence, we utilize this data set to investigate whether any asymmetry exists in
term of inflow and outflow controls. Table 4b offers these tests. For the full sample
estimation, capital inflow and outflow controls have a similar impact in terms of size and
significance on reducing EMP. With the country-group breakdown, while both inflow and
outflow controls are statistically significant, inflow controls seem to have larger effect in
reducing EMP for OECD countries while neither control has an effect on EME. In sum,
despite a differential effect across country group and inflows and outflows, we are able to
offer some evidence that capital controls are effective in reducing the EMP depending on the
institutional quality of enforcing such measurements.

Sub-Period Analysis

      We divide the complete sample into four sub-periods that are relevant for exchange
market pressure and the determining factors. As discussed earlier, the first sub-period is the
Great Moderation that is covered from 2000 through 2007 Q1, the global financial crisis over


                                                 14
2007 Q2–2009 Q2, the post-crisis period of 2009 Q3–2013 Q1, and finally the tapering period
that became highly relevant for the world capital market starting in 2013 Q2. Sub-period
results are presented in Table 5a–5c. The full sample results including OECD and EMEs in
Table 5a indicate that before the crisis, some of the macroeconomic variables such as GDP
per capita growth and inflation had explanatory power for the EMP, however, the financial
and external indicators began to play a more dominant role during the crisis and in the
aftermath.

      The sub-period analysis for OECD and EME countries in Tables 5b and 5c reveals more
marked differences. For instance, the explanatory power of factors included in the model for
the OECD countries, in general, seems to have more power during the crisis period, which is
probably due to a larger variation in the exchange market pressure as well as other factors.
Compared with the EME, the inflation rate significantly affects the EMP except during the
crisis period. Since the inflation rate during the crisis in most of the OECD countries stayed
very low and there was a lack of concern for the monetary policy decisions, markets did not
pay much attention to inflation developments. However, in other periods, current and
expected inflation could be an important indicator for the monetary policy stance and thus
important in deriving the interest rate differential and ultimately, exchange rate movements.
In this regard, Feldkircher et al. (2014) highlight the role of price stability as a major
determinant of exchange rate pressure in their extensive study of EMP that covered the post-
crisis period through 2011.

      Table 5c indicates the increasing role of financial and external indicators during and
after the global financial crisis for EME compared with the Great Moderation period. As the
earlier discussion and Figures 1–2 show, capital reversals and surges became the main source
of international spillover for EME. Therefore, domestic and external financial factors such as
domestic equity returns, the VIX, the TED spread, and the slope of the U.S. yield curve are all
consistently significant during and after the crisis. 11 In addition, the magnitudes of the
portfolio inflow and outflow coefficients during and after the crisis are larger than the pre-
crisis period, which indicates the increasing role of EME financial integration with the world
financial markets.

11
  Note that for a complete period analysis, we have included the U.S. federal fund rate. During and
after the crisis, the effective federal fund rate approached the zero lower bound and quarterly changes
were negligible. The yield curve slope, on the other hand, has shown some variations and is
considered to have captured the market expectation regarding economic activity and future monetary
policy actions. Therefore, for the sub-period analysis, we consider the yield curve slope as a policy
indicator for the U.S.

                                                   15
Tapering Period and Emerging Market Economies

      The last sub-period of our analysis that became particularly important for the financial
markets, especially in EME, is the tapering period that came to the fore in 2013. The concerns
over the impact of scaling back security purchases heightened on May 22, 2013, when
Chairman Bernanke raised the possibility of tapering in his Congressional testimony. Since
the impact of tapering was largely observed in EME, in addition to comparing the sub-periods
in Table 5, we offer more evidence on how financial factors affect the EMP in Table 6. The
tapering sub-period is relatively short because our sample ends in the third quarter of 2014.
Therefore, the financial factors including the VIX, the TED spread, and the yield curve are
closely correlated, which leads to a multicollinearity problem. This explains why we include
macroeconomic factors and capital inflows and outflows in the Table 5 baseline specifications
but show other financial variables individually. When we compare financial factors between
the crisis and the post-crisis period, a more significant and larger effect on EMP exists during
the tapering. This effect implies that emerging market currencies became more sensitive to the
Federal Reserve policy actions, which was coupled with capital reversal from EME with the
expectation of less carry trade activity. As the transmission channel of policy expectation was
short-term capital outflows, Table 6b indicates a larger and significant coefficient of portfolio
outflows, which is consistent across all specifications. 12

5. Conclusions
        The debate regarding the importance of exchange rate adjustment in the post-global
financial crisis era is not over. Rey (2013) concluded that the economic center’s monetary
policy influences other countries’ national monetary policies mostly through capital flows,
credit growth, and bank leverages, making the types of exchange rate regimes of the Non-
Center countries irrelevant. Accordingly, all of the peripheral countries are sensitive to a
“global financial cycle” irrespective of their exchange rate regimes. Therefore, the “trilemma”
is reduced to an “irreconcilable duo” of monetary independence and capital mobility.
Consequently, restricting capital mobility may be the only way for non-EC countries to retain
monetary autonomy. However, news about the irrelevance of exchange rate changes may
have been exaggerated. Gourinchas and Rey (2014) noted that valuation effects, which are


12
  We investigated the effectiveness of capital controls on the exchange market pressure for the
tapering period. However, since the capital control data is only available for 2013 and repeats across
quarters, we could not find any significant evidence of the effectiveness of capital controls in a small
sample of cross-sectional regressions over each quarter.

                                                    16
capital gains and losses on gross external assets and liabilities (including exchange rate
changes), account for an important and increasing part of the dynamics of countries’ net
foreign asset positions.
       Our paper suggests that there may be no simple solutions for emerging market
economies’ exposure to policies and market pressures propagated from the core. While capital
controls may mitigate the exposure, the efficacy of this mitigation depends on the quality of
institutions and may be greater for OECD countries than for more vulnerable EME. Our
results are also in line with Aizenman et al. (2015), who find that the arrangement of open
macro policies such as the exchange rate regime and financial openness has a direct influence
on the sensitivity of the center economies. We leave studying the impact of exchange market
adjustment and capital controls on economic performance to future research.
