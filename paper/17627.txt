                                             ABSTRACT

This paper reviews the empirical evidence on firm heterogeneity in international trade. A first wave
of empirical findings from micro data on plants and firms proposed challenges for existing models
of international trade and inspired the development of new theories emphasizing firm heterogeneity.
Subsequent empirical research has examined additional predictions of these theories and explored
other dimensions of the data not originally captured by them. These other dimensions include multi-product
firms, offshoring, intra-firm trade and firm export market dynamics.

1      Introduction

Research in international trade has changed dramatically over the past fteen years as its focus has shifted


from industries and countries to rms and products. This transformation was instigated by the emergence


of a wide range of micro-datasets exhibiting sharp variation in rm outcomes and attributes, even within


narrow industries. Models developed in reaction to this challenge both rationalize this heterogeneity and oer


new insight into the ways in which economies respond to international trade. For example, the well-known


gravity equation relationship between aggregate trade and distance is largely accounted for by the extensive


margin of the number of heterogeneous rms and products participating in trade rather than the intensive


margin of the amount traded per rm and product.


     One of the most striking features of the microdata is that rm participation in international trade is


exceedingly rare. Researchers nd that exporters and importers represent just a tiny fraction of producers


across many developed and developing economies. This participation is far from random. Indeed, the same


studies nd that exporters and importers are larger, more productive, more skill- and capital-intensive, and


pay higher wages prior to their entry into international markets than non-trading rms. These facts suggest


self-selection: exporters are more productive, not necessarily as a result of exporting, but because only the


most productive rms are able to overcome the costs of entering export markets. The most successful model


of such selection is the seminal Melitz (2003) model, which has dominated recent research in the eld. The key


insight of that model is that micro-heterogeneity inuences aggregate outcomes. When trade policy barriers


or transportation costs fall, high-productivity exporting rms survive and expand while lower-productivity


non-exporting rms shrink or exit.             This reallocation of economic activity across rms raises aggregate


productivity, an eect of globalization that was largely neglected in previous theories of international trade


based on comparative advantage and consumer love of variety.


     Much of recent theoretical research in international trade has focused on generalizing or elaborating on


this basic model of selection.          Studies have explored the interaction between comparative advantage and


heterogeneous rms (Bernard et al. 2007a), variable mark-ups and market size (Melitz & Ottaviano 2008),


country asymmetries (Arkolakis et al. 2008), multi-product rms (Bernard et al. 2011, Eckel & Neary 2010,


Mayer et al. 2011), the decision whether to organize production activities within or beyond the boundaries of


the rm (AntrÃ s & Helpman 2004, 2008), managerial hierarchies within the rm (Caliendo & Rossi-Hansberg


2011), labor market frictions (Amiti & Davis 2011, Egger & Kreickemeier 2009, Helpman and Itskhoki 2010,


and Helpman et al. 2011), and nancial constraints (Chaney 2005, Manova 2011), among other issues.
                                                                                                                            1

     We begin by reviewing the empirical challenges to traditional theories of international trade that emerged


from micro data on plants and rms (Section 2).                We next briey discuss the development of theories of


heterogeneous rms that have shaped much subsequent empirical research (Section 3). More recently, the

                                                                 2
availability of microdata on individual trade transactions within the rm has stimulated empirical research


on a whole host of new topics, including the extensive and intensive margins of trade (Section 4), multi-


product rms (Section 5), rm importing (Section 6), product quality (Section 7), intermediaries (Section


8), foreign direct investment (Section 9), intra-rm trade (Section 10), labor markets (Section 11), and rm


export market dynamics (Section 12).



2     Empirical Challenges to Existing Trade Theories

Traditional (or old ) theories of international trade emphasize comparative advantage - that is variation


in opportunity costs of production across countries and industries - as the basis for international trade. In


these theories, international commerce takes the form of   inter-industry trade, where countries export goods
in one set of industries and import goods in another set of industries. More recent (or new) theories of


international trade instead focus on increasing returns to scale and consumer love of variety as the basis for


international trade, as in Krugman (1980), Helpman (1981) and Ethier (1982).         These theories provide a


natural explanation for   intra-industry trade, where countries both export and import goods within the same
industry. The two theories were combined within the integrated equilibrium approach of Helpman & Krugman


(1985). When suitably augmented to allow for technology dierences and cross-country variation in factor


prices, they provided a relatively successful explanation for patterns of trade across countries and industries,


as reviewed in Helpman (1999).      A key simplication in this theoretical literature was the assumption of


a representative rm within each industry. With the increased availability of micro datasets on rms and


plants from the late 1980s and 1990s onwards, it became clear that there was in fact vast heterogeneity across


producers within industries, in terms of size, productivity, capital and skill-intensity, and wages. Furthermore


an emerging empirical literature began to explore the idea that this heterogeneity was systematically related


to trade participation in ways that could be inuential for aggregate outcomes.



2.1    Export Participation


Bernard & Jensen (1995) present evidence for U.S. manufacturing showing that typically a minority of plants


within an industry export. As illustrated in Table 1, which is taken from Bernard et al. (2007b) and uses


data from the 2002 U.S. Census of Manufactures, the overall share of U.S. manufacturing rms that export is


relatively small at 18 percent (column 3). But there is considerable variation in export market participation


rates across industries within manufacturing: the share of exporters ranges from 38 percent in Computer and


Electronic Products to only 8 percent in Apparel. These exporting rms also ship a relatively small share of


their total shipments abroad. As shown in column 4, the average share of shipments exported is 14 percent


for the manufacturing sector as a whole. But again there is substantial variation across industries: from 21


percent in Computers to 7 percent in Beverages. While the results here use U.S. data, similar ndings have




                                                       3
emerged for a wide range of other countries, as summarized for example in Mayer & Ottaviano (2007) and


World Trade Organization (2008).



2.2    Exporter Characteristics


The rst wave of microdata research demonstrated that not only is exporting rare but exporters are system-


atically dierent from non-exporters. Bernard & Jensen (1995) show that among U.S. manufacturing plants,


exporters are larger, more skill intensive, more capital intensive, and more productive. Table 2, also from


Bernard et al. (2007b), highlights these dierences for manufacturing rms. Each row of the table summarizes


the average percent dierence between exporters and non-exporters for a particular characteristic.


   As shown in the rst column, there are substantial mean dierences between exporters and non-exporters.


On average, exporting rms are larger in employment and sales, more productive, and use a dierent input


mix. Since export participation is correlated with industry characteristics, the inclusion of industry eects


in the second column typically reduces the magnitude of these coecients. But exporters remain dierent


from non-exporters even within the same disaggregated industry: they are 97 percent larger in employment


and 108 per cent larger in shipments; they are more productive by 11 per cent for value-added per worker


and 3 per cent for total factor productivity; they also pay higher wages by around 6 percent.                     Finally,


exporters are relatively more capital- and skill-intensive than non-exporters by approximately 12 and 11


percent, respectively.


   While the correlation between rm size and exporting accounts for some of the dierences between


exporters and non-exporters, they remain even after controlling for log employment, as shown in the third


column. Qualitatively similar results have been found for many other countries and time periods.
                                                                                                              2

   The nding that U.S. exporters are more capital- and skill-intensive is consistent with old trade theory


forces of comparative advantage being at work within industries. If a rm's factor intensity reects the nature


of the products it supplies, then rms which are more capital- and skill-intensive are supplying products that


are more consistent with U.S. comparative advantage (Bernard et al. 2006b).


   More dicult to square with old trade theory concepts of comparative advantage are empirical ndings


that exporters are also more capital- and skill-intensive in developing countries, which are plausibly abundant


in unskilled labor (Alvarez & Lopez, 2005). If exporting rms in these countries were supplying products


consistent with comparative advantage, they would be labor-intensive rather than capital- and skill-intensive.


Potential explanations for ndings that exporters are more capital- and skill-intensive in both developed


and developing countries include technology-skill complementarity, as explored in Burstein & Vogel (2010),


Harrigan & Reshe (2011) and Sampson (2011), and sorting by product quality within industries as in

  2 Similar   dierences in performance are observed between rms shipping to remote versus proximate locations within the
U.S., as shown in Holmes & Stevens (2010).

                      3


2.3       Sunk Costs and Selection into Exporting


The nding that exporters are more productive than non-exporters raises the question of the direction of


causality:   does high productivity induce rms to self-select into export markets or does exporting cause


productivity growth through learning by exporting. An extensive body of research for many industries and


countries conrms that high productivity precedes entry into export markets. These ndings are suggestive


of sunk costs of entry into export markets that only the most productive rms nd it protable to incur,


as emphasized in Roberts & Tybout (1997).                  Whether there is also learning by exporting is less clear.


Early studies by Clerides et al.           (1998) using data for Mexico, Colombia and Morocco and Bernard &


Jensen (1999) using U.S. data found no evidence of dierences in productivity growth between exporters


and non-exporters.        Most research conrms these ndings, however, some studies have found evidence of


productivity improvements following export market entry, such as Van Biesebroeck (2005) and de Loecker


(2007).    Other recent research has provided evidence that export market entry may increase the return


to other complementary investments such as technology adoption, as examined theoretically in Atkeson &


Burstein (2010), Burstein & Melitz (2011), Constantini and Melitz (2008) and shown empirically in Bustos


(2011), Lileeva & Treer (2010) and Aw et al. (2011).



2.4       Trade Liberalization, Reallocation, and Productivity Growth


Empirical analyses using microdata on plants and rms reveal new channels through which trade liberaliza-


tion can aect the aggregate economy. Beyond the eects of the expansion in the range of product varieties


available to consumers, there exists the potential for within-industry productivity growth arising from de-


creasing trade costs. Trade liberalization reforms are typically accompanied by the contraction and exit of


low-productivity rms and the expansion and entry into export markets of high-productivity rms.                              This


reallocation of resources within industries raises average industry productivity.


   Additionally, trade liberalization can have a pro-competitive eect in reducing mark-ups of price over


marginal cost, so that trade liberalization reduces average prices through both lower average costs and lower


average mark-ups. These reductions in average prices in turn provide sources of welfare gain.


   In the context of the Chilean trade liberalization, Pavcnik (2002) nds that roughly two-thirds of the


19 percent increase in aggregate productivity is due to the relatively greater survival and growth of high-


productivity plants. A similar pattern of results is found in a large number of studies of trade liberalization


reforms in developing countries, as surveyed in Tybout (2003). Within-industry reallocations of resources in


these studies typically dominate cross-industry reallocations of resources.

  3 More   broadly, for a theoretical analysis of the idea that international trade is inherently more skill-intensive than domestic
production, see Matsuyama (2007).




                                                                 5
     One concern is that trade liberalization often occurs as part of a wider package of reforms. However, similar


patterns of productivity gains from the expansion of high-productivity exporting rms have been found in


response to reductions in trade barriers in both Canada (Treer, 2004) and the United States (Bernard et


al. 2006a). For example, Treer (2004) nds eects of Canadian tari reductions on industry productivity


that are roughly twice as large as those on plant productivity, implying market share reallocations favoring


high-productivity plants.


     Another source of aggregate productivity growth following trade liberalization is improvements in produc-


tivity within plants or rms. In Pavcnik (2002), around one-third of the increase in aggregate productivity


following the Chilean liberalization was due to within-plant productivity gains. Similarly, in Treer (2004),


the Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement is found to raise the labor productivity of Canadian manufacturing


plants by 7.4 percent or by an annual compound growth rate of 0.93 percent. These improvements in plant


or rm productivity may be themselves the result of reallocations across disparate economic activities within


the plant or rm, as discussed further below.



3      Heterogeneous Firm Theories

The empirical challenges to old and new trade theory from microdata have led to the development of recent


theories of rm heterogeneity and international trade. These theories not only account for the features of


disaggregated trade data noted above, but also yield additional predictions that have been the subject of


further empirical work. The seminal study of Melitz (2003) introduces rm heterogeneity into Krugman's


(1980) model of intra-industry trade to yield a tractable and exible framework that has become a standard


platform for analyzing a host of issues in international trade.
                                                                           4

     In Melitz (2003), there is a competitive fringe of potential rms who can enter an industry by paying


a xed entry cost which is thereafter sunk.               Potential entrants face     ex ante   uncertainty concerning their


productivity. Once the sunk entry cost is paid, a rm draws its productivity from a xed distribution and


productivity remains xed thereafter. Firms produce horizontally dierentiated varieties within the industry


under conditions of monopolistic competition. The existence of a xed production cost implies that rms


drawing a productivity level below the zero-prot productivity cuto  would make negative prots and


therefore exit the industry. Fixed and variable costs of exporting ensure that only those active rms that


draw a productivity above a higher export productivity cuto  nd it protable to export.
                                                                                                               5

     In this model, a symmetric reduction in trade barriers between all countries has a number of implications


for industry equilibrium.          High-productivity exporting rms experience increased revenue through greater

    4 An    alternative framework for modeling rm heterogeneity is Bernard et al. (2003), which considers Bertrand competition in
the stochastic multi-country Ricardian model of trade of Eaton & Kortum (2002). Another approach is pursued in Yeaple (2005),
in which rms are ex ante identical, but rm heterogeneity emerges ex post through the endogenous allocation of heterogeneous
workers across rms.
    5 For   empirical evidence of sunk costs of exporting, see Roberts & Tybout (1997), Bernard & Jensen (2004), and Das et al.
(2007).




                                                                  6
export market sales.    The most productive non-exporters now nd it protable to enter export markets,


thereby increasing the fraction of exporting rms.    In contrast, low productivity rms exit and there is a


contraction in the revenues of surviving rms that only serve the domestic market. Each of these responses


reallocates resources towards high-productivity rms and raises aggregate productivity through a change in


industry composition.


    This theoretical framework addresses a number of the empirical challenges from microdata.        Together


rm heterogeneity and xed exporting costs imply that only some rms export and these exporters are more


productive than non-exporters.    The productivity advantage of exporting rms reects self-selection into


export markets rather than learning by exporting.     Finally, the self-selection of rms into export markets


ensures that trade liberalization has uneven eects on low and high-productivity rms and hence raises


aggregate productivity through a change in industry composition.


    While the assumption of constant elasticity of substitution (CES) preferences in Melitz (2003) ensures con-


stant rm mark-ups of price over marginal cost, Bernard et al. (2003) and Melitz & Ottaviano (2008) develop


models of rm heterogeneity in which rm mark-ups are endogenous. In such settings, trade liberalization


can have a pro-competitive eect in reducing the price charged by a given rm through a lower mark-up


of price over marginal cost.   In models with variable mark-ups, a rm with a given productivity can also


charge dierent mark-ups in the domestic and export markets. Using Slovenian data, De Loecker & Warzyn-


ski (2011) provides empirical evidence of dierences in mark-ups between exporters and non-exporters and


discusses the implications of such variable mark-ups for estimated productivity dierences between exporters


and non-exporters.


    In Bernard et al. (2007a), heterogeneous rms are integrated into the standard trade paradigm of Helpman


& Krugman (1985). The resulting framework simultaneously explains why some countries export more in


certain industries than in others (endowment-driven comparative advantage), why two-way trade is observed


within industries (rm-level horizontal product dierentiation combined with increasing returns to scale), and


why, within industries, some rms export and others do not (self-selection driven by trade costs). Consistent


with the empirical ndings reported in Table 1, the fraction of exporting rms and the share of exports in


rm shipments vary systematically with comparative advantage.



4     Gravity and the Extensive and Intensive Margins

One of the most successful empirical relationships in economics is the gravity equation, which relates the


value of total bilateral trade between countries to their economic size and the variable trade costs between


them. Under the assumption that rm productivity is Pareto distributed, the Melitz (2003) model yields a




                                                       7
gravity equation for total bilateral trade ows, as shown in Chaney (2008) and Arkolakis et al. (2008).
                                                                                                                          6 One

remarkable feature of this gravity equation is that the elasticity of trade ows with respect to variable trade


costs depends not on the elasticity of substitution between rm varieties but rather on the shape parameter


of the Pareto distribution for productivity.


      The intuition for this result can be garnered by noting that aggregate bilateral trade between any two


countries (Xij ) can be decomposed into the             extensive margin           of the number of exporting rms (Mij ) and


the   intensive margin of average rm exports conditional on exporting (Xij /Mij ):
                                                                              
                                                                         Xij
                                                      Xij = Mij                    .                                          (1)
                                                                         Mij

      In the Melitz model, an increase in variable trade costs has two osetting eects on the intensive margin.
                                                                                                                                7

On the one hand, higher variable trade costs reduce the value of exports of a given exporter, which                      reduces
average rm exports. On the other hand, higher variable trade costs imply that some exporters who were


previously close to the productivity threshold for exporting can no longer generate sucient variable prots


to cover the xed costs of exporting and exit the export market. Since these exiting exporters have smaller


export values than surviving exporters, this          raises average rm exports through a change in composition. In
the special case of a Pareto distribution, these two eects exactly oset one another, leaving the intensive


margin independent of variable trade costs.               As a result, variable trade costs only aect bilateral trade


through the extensive margin, and the elasticity of this extensive margin with respect to variable trade costs


is determined by the shape parameter of the Pareto distribution for productivity.


      The special case of the Melitz (2003) model with a Pareto distribution for productivity lies within the


class of theoretical models considered by Arkolakis et al. (2011a), in which a country's share of trade with


itself is a sucient statistic for the welfare gains from opening the closed economy to trade. While empirical


studies have sought to quantify the contributions of particular sources of welfare gains, such as product


variety in Broda & Weinstein (2006), this theoretical analysis implies that the various sources of welfare


gains are related to one another in general equilibrium and that the overall eect of trade on welfare can


be determined simply from a country's share of trade with itself. See also Atkeson and Burstein (2010) for


a theoretical analysis of the relationship between the various possible sources of welfare gains from trade in


heterogeneous rm models.


      A key implication of the Melitz (2003) model is that the extensive margin of the number of exporting


rms should vary systematically with export market size, since in larger markets rms of lower productivity


can generate sucient variable prots to cover the xed costs of exporting. Using French export data by

   6 For   empirical evidence that the Pareto distribution provides a reasonable approximation to the observed distribution of rm
sizes, see for example Axtell (2001).
   7 We    dene the intensive margin as average rm exports conditional on exporting because it facilitates the decomposition of
average exports in (1) and has a straightforward empirical implementation. Chaney (2008) instead denes the intensive margin
as exports of a given rm to a given destination, in which case the intensive margin is unaected by composition.




                                                                 8
rm and destination market, Eaton et al.      (2004, 2011a) establish this and a number of other empirical


regularities. First, the number of French rms selling to a market (relative to French market share) increases


with market size according to an approximately log linear relationship. Second, this pattern of rm export


market participation exhibits an imperfect hierarchy, where rms selling to less popular markets are more


likely to sell to more popular markets, but do not always do so.         Third, export sales distributions are


remarkably similar across markets of very dierent size and extent of French participation. While the upper


tail of these distributions is approximately Pareto distributed, there are departures from a Pareto distribution


in the lower tail where small export shipments are observed. Fourth, average sales in France are higher for


rms selling to less popular foreign markets and to more foreign markets.


   To explain these empirical regularities, Eaton et al. (2011a) consider an augmented version of the Melitz


model with a Pareto productivity distribution. To generate departures from a Pareto distribution of export


sales in the lower tail where small export shipments are observed, the xed costs of entering each export


market are allowed to vary endogenously with a rm's choice of the fraction of consumers within that market


to serve, as in the marketing costs formulation of Arkolakis (2010). To incorporate imperfect hierarchies of


markets, the xed costs of entering export markets are assumed to be subject to an idiosyncratic shock for


each rm and destination market. To allow for idiosyncratic variation in export sales conditional on entering


a given export market for rms with a given productivity, demand is also subject to an idiosyncratic shock for


each rm and destination market. While a rm's decision to enter an export market depends on a composite


of the market entry and demand shocks, a rm with a given productivity can enter a market because of a


low entry shock and yet still have low sales in that market because of a low demand shock.


   The properties of the model depend on ve key parameters: (i) a composite parameter that includes


both the elasticity of substitution and the Pareto shape parameter, (ii) the convexity of marketing costs, (iii)


the variance of demand shocks, (iv) the variance of entry shocks, and (v) the correlation between demand


and entry shocks.   Eaton et al.   (2011a) use simulated method of moments to estimate these parameters


using moments of the French export data by rm and destination market. The ve parameters are precisely


estimated and the parameterized model is shown to provide a good t to the observed data. For the estimated


parameter values, rm productivity accounts for around half of the observed variation across rms in export


market participation, but explains substantially less of the variation in exports conditional on entering a


market.


   Given the estimated parameter values, the model can be used to examine counterfactuals, such as a 10


percent reduction in bilateral trade barriers for all French rms. In this counterfactual, total sales by French


rms rise by around $16 million, with most of this increase accounted for by a rise in sales of the top decile of


rms of around $23 million. In contrast, every other decile of rms experiences a decline in sales, with around


half of the rms in the bottom decile exiting. Taken together, these results suggest that the intra-industry




                                                       9
reallocations emphasized by theories of heterogeneous rms and trade can be quantitatively large, even for


empirically reasonable changes in trade frictions.
                                                             8

     Heterogeneous rm theories also shed light on the prevalence of zeros in bilateral trade ows. Using data


on trade between 158 countries from 1970-97, Helpman et al. (2008) nd that around one half of the country


pairs do not trade with one another. Motivated by this feature of the data, they develop a multi-country


version of the Melitz (2003) model, in which rm productivity is drawn from a truncated Pareto distribution.


In this framework, no rm exports between a pair of countries if the productivity threshold for exporting


exceeds the upper limit of the productivity distribution in each country.                      Estimating a gravity equation


derived from the model, they show that controlling for both the non-random selection of positive trade ows


and the extensive margin of exporting rms has quantitatively important implications for estimates of the


eects of standard trade frictions on trade ows.                Of these two corrections, controlling for the extensive


margin of the number of heterogeneous rms that export is quantitatively more important than controlling


for the non-random selection of positive trade ows.
                                                                 9

     Although most research on heterogeneous rms and trade assumes a continuum of rms, Eaton et al.


(2011b) argue that the existence of a nite number of rms provides an alternative potential explanation for


zero bilateral trade ows. Even if the productivity distribution is unbounded from above, the existence of a


nite number of rms implies that there is a positive probability that no rm draws a productivity above the


threshold for exporting between a pair of countries. Using data on bilateral trade in manufactures among 91


countries, they show that the model accounts for the pattern of zero trade ows while maintaining the good


t of the standard gravity equation among country pairs with positive trade ows.



5      Multi-product Firms

One of the striking features of international trade data is the extent to which international trade is concen-


trated in the hands of a few rms. As reported in Bernard et al. (2009a), the top 1 percent of rms account


for around 90 percent of the value of U.S. trade, even though they account for only around 15 percent of


employment. Similar levels of concentration are observed in other countries, as summarized in World Trade


Organization (2008).


     One reason why international trade is so concentrated is that larger exporters not only export more


of a given product to a given destination than smaller exporters, but also export more products to more


destinations. Table 3, from Bernard et al. (2007b), reports the distribution of exporters, export value and


employment by the number of products and export destinations. Around 40 percent of exporting rms export

    8 Other   quantitative analyses of models of rm heterogeneity and trade include the study of trade integration in Corcos et al.
(2010), the analysis of the impact of China's productivity growth on world welfare in Hsieh & Ossa (2010), and the investigation
of patterns of trade in Bangladesh's apparel sector in Cherkashin et al. (2010).
    9 Santos   Silva and Tenreyro (2006) consider an alternative approach to zero trade ows that uses the Poisson xed eects
estimator.




                                                                  10
a single product to a single destinations (panel A), but these rms account for less than 1 percent of export


value (panel B). In contrast, the 12 percent of rms that export more than ve products to more than ve


destinations account for more than 90 percent of export value.


   To make sense of rms' decisions over the extensive margins of products and destinations, Bernard et al.


(2011) develop a model of multi-product, multi-destination rms that is a generalization of Melitz's (2003)


framework. In order to enter, rms incur a sunk entry cost, which reveals their ability. Firms then choose


among a continuum of products and many export markets. Firm protability depends upon the interaction


of rm ability, which is common across products, and rm-product attributes, which are idiosyncratic across


products and possibly also across export destinations. Firms face xed costs in serving each market and in


supplying each product to each market. Higher ability rms can generate sucient variable prots to cover


the product xed cost at a lower value of product attributes and hence supply a wider range of products to


each market. For suciently low values of rm ability, the excess of variable prots over product xed costs


in the small range of protable products does not cover the xed cost of serving the market and therefore


the rm does not supply the market. The lowest-ability rms exit, intermediate-ability rms serve only the


domestic market and the highest ability rms export. Within exporters, products with the worst attributes


are supplied only to the domestic market, while products with the best attributes are exported to the largest


number of markets.


   While the standard heterogeneous-rm model emphasizes selection                              across rms, this model also empha-
sizes selection    within     rms.   Selection within rms provides a potential rationale for the eects of trade


liberalization on within-rm productivity found in the empirical studies discussed above, since trade liberal-


ization induces rms to drop their least successful products with low revenue productivity. Using data from


the Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement (CUSFTA), Bernard et al. (2011) and Baldwin & Gu (2009) provide


empirical evidence of product rationalization following trade liberalization.


   The extensive margins highlighted by models of multi-product rms have important implications for


the mechanisms underlying aggregate economic relationships.                       Aggregate bilateral trade between any two


countries (Xij ) can be decomposed into the    extensive margin of the number of rm-product observations
with positive exports (Oij ) and the intensive margin of average rm-product exports conditional on positive


trade (xÌ„ij   = Xij /Oij ):
                                                                                       
                                                                                  Xij
                                             Xij = Oij xÌ„ij ,        xÌ„ij â‰¡                 ,                                   (2)

where the number of rm-product observations with positive trade can be decomposed in turn into the


extensive margins of the number of exporting rms (Mij ), the number of exported products (Nij ) and a


density term (Dij     = Oij / (Mij Nij ))   that captures the extent to which each rm exports each product:

                                                                11
   Table 4 reports the results of estimating gravity equations for aggregate U.S. exports and each of the


extensive and intensive margins in (2) and (3). The table is taken from Bernard et al. (2011) and destination


market size and variable trade costs are proxied using destination market GDP and geographical distance


respectively. The well-known negative eect of distance on aggregate bilateral trade (column 1) is entirely


accounted for by the extensive margin of the number of rm-product observations with positive trade (column


3). In contrast, distance has a positive but statistically insignicant eect on the intensive margin of average


exports per rm-product conditional on positive trade (column 2). The extensive margins of the number of


exporting rms and the number of exported products both decline with distance (columns 4 and 5). The


opposite is true of density, because each rm is active in a limited subset of products, which implies that the


number of rm-product observations with positive trade (Oij ) increases less than proportionately than the


number of rms times the number of products (Mij Nij ).


   The theoretical model discussed above provides a natural explanation for these empirical ndings.          A


reduction in variable trade costs lowers product prices in each export market which increases revenue and


variable prots.     Reductions in variable trade costs raise aggregate exports through the share of products


exported to a given country by incumbent exporters (within-rm product extensive margin), an increase in


the average number of countries to which a given product is supplied by incumbent rms (within-rm country


extensive margin), and the entry of lower-ability rms that previously only served the domestic market into


export markets (the across-rm extensive margin). In contrast, selection within rms implies that reductions


in variable trade costs have ambiguous eects on the intensive margin of average exports per rm-product,


because they increase exports of a given rm and product, but induce entry into export markets of rms and


products with smaller export values.


   A growing theoretical and empirical literature in international trade has investigated a variety of im-


plications of multi-product, multi-destination rms. While early contributions such as Ottaviano & Thisse


(1999) and Allanson & Montagna (2005) modeled rms and products symmetrically, more recent research


has explored the idea that rms have core competences. Eckel & Neary (2010) consider a model of exible


manufacturing where each rm faces rising marginal costs in producing products further from its core com-


petence. Firms are large relative to the market and hence face a cannibalization eect, where introducing


additional products diminishes the demand for the rm's existing products.
                                                                             10 Javorcik et al. (2010) consider

an augmented version of this model, in which rms can make endogenous investments in the quality of each


product and in their overall brand. Using Mexican trade transaction data, they provide empirical evidence


in support of the model's key predictions for the relationship between product prices and sales rank within


the rm.


   Other recent research has concentrated on monopolistically-competitive models of multiple-product rms

 10 See   also Feenstra & Ma (2008) and Dhingra (2010).




                                                          12
without cannibalization eects.        In Mayer et al.      (2011), rms face a product ladder, where productiv-


ity/quality declines discretely for each additional variety produced. Together with variable mark-ups, this


generates the prediction that rm sales are more skewed towards core competences in more competitive


markets. French export data provide strong empirical support for this prediction of the model. In Arkolakis


& Muendler (2010), rms face declining productivity for each additional variety supplied to a market and


market entry costs that are increasing in the number of varieties supplied to a market. Using Brazilian trade


transaction data, they present evidence in support of the model's prediction of a positive relationship be-


tween the number of products that a rm exports to a market and average exports per product. In contrast,


in Nocke and Yeaple (2006), rms with higher organizational capability produce more products and have


higher marginal costs for all products, which generates a negative relationship between rms' extensive and


intensive margins.


    While most of the above research concentrates on the determinants of the products and destinations


supplied by multi-product rms at a given point time, there is evidence that product market entry and exit


within surviving rms is inuential for rm, industry and aggregate dynamics over time. Using U.S. Census


of Manufactures data, Bernard et al. (2010a) nd that around one half of surviving U.S. rms add and/or


drop products from their existing range every ve years, and the contribution of these added and dropped


products to aggregate output is of around the same magnitude as the contribution of rm entry and exit.
                                                                                                                               11

Consistent with a natural generalization of models of industry dynamics to incorporate selection with rms,


the probability that a product is dropped within a surviving rm exhibits the same pattern of age and scale


dependence as the probability that a rm exits. Taken together, these ndings suggest that reallocation may


be even more important than hitherto thought, in so far as it occurs across products within rms as well as


across rms.



6     Firm Importing

The early empirical literature on rm heterogeneity in international trade concentrated almost exclusively on


rm export behavior, since only exporting information was recorded in censuses of domestic production or


manufacturing. More recent work using rm-level trade transaction data has begun to examine heterogeneity


in rm import behavior.


    Firm importing displays many of the same features as rm exporting. Bernard et al. (2007b) nd that,


for U.S. manufacturing rms, importing is somewhat rarer than exporting and there is substantial variation


across industries. The shares of exporting and importing rms are signicantly positively correlated (0.87)


across industries. Around 41 percent of exporters also import while 79 percent of importers also export. The

  11 The   production of multiple products complicates the measurement of rm productivity when separate data on outputs,
inputs and prices are not available at the rm-product level, as considered in Bernard et al. (2009c) and De Loecker (2011).




                                                             13
share of export-only rms is positively and signicantly correlated with industry skill intensity, while the


share of import-only rms is negatively but not signicantly correlated with industry skill intensity.


   Importers exhibit a number of the same performance dierences as exporters.           As reported in Table 5


from Bernard et al. (2007b), importers are bigger, more productive, pay higher wages and are more skill-


and capital-intensive than non-importers. From a comparison of the rst and second columns with the third


column, the performance dierences between rms that participate in international trade and those that do


not are partly driven by rms that both import and export, which exhibit the largest performance dierences


from domestic rms. These ndings suggest that trade liberalization is likely to benet the largest, most


productive, most skill- and capital-intensive rms within industries, not only through enhanced access to


export markets, but also through improved availability of imported intermediate inputs.


   While empirical studies of the impact of trade liberalization on productivity have typically focused on


reductions in taris in output markets, more recent evidence suggests that reductions in taris on imported


intermediate inputs may be a prominent source of productivity gains. Amiti & Konings (2007) use manufac-


turing census data from Indonesia, which contains plant-level information on imported intermediate inputs,


to construct separate measures of input and output taris. Following the trade liberalization that occurred in


the 1990s, they nd that reductions in input taris are associated with an increase in productivity of around


12 percent for rms that import their inputs, which is around twice as large as the eect for reductions in


output taris.


   Input taris may aect productivity through a number of potential channels, including learning about


foreign technologies, expansion in the variety of intermediate inputs available for production, and access to


higher-quality intermediate inputs. Following India's trade liberalization in the early 1990s, Goldberg et al.


(2010) nd that around two thirds of the growth in imports of intermediate inputs is accounted for by the


extensive margin of newly imported products. In industries that experienced greater tari reductions, there


is a larger increase in total value, a greater reduction in prices and a larger expansion in variety of imported


intermediate inputs. Consistent with the idea that the availability of new intermediate inputs expanded the


technological possibilities of rms, industries that saw greater increases in the variety of imported intermediate


inputs also experienced greater increases the range of products produced by Indian rms.


   More generally, the presence of both importing and exporting within rms suggests the relevance of


theories of the fragmentation of production, such as Dixit & Grossman (1982) and Grossman & Rossi-


Hansberg (2008). In these models, rms can organize stages of production across national borders. Using


input-output tables for 10 OECD and four emerging-market countries, Hummels et al. (2001) estimate that


such vertical specialization accounts for around 20 percent of countries' exports and grew by around 30


percent between 1970 and 1990. As shown in Yi (2003), when stages of production are spread across national


boundaries in this way, changes in trade costs can have a magnied impact on trade ows, because they are




                                                       14
incurred each time the good is traded back and forth between countries.
                                                                                        12



7    Product Quality

Even within narrowly-dened product categories, such as the 8,000+ products of the ten-digit Harmonized


System (HS) classication, there is tremendous variation in unit values across trade partners.                     A growing


literature in international trade argues that this variation in prices reects dierences in product quality


across trade partners, as in Schott (2004) and Hummels & Klenow (2005).
                                                                                             13 Furthermore, this variation in

prices is strongly related to country endowments, with more capital and skill-abundant countries supplying


varieties with higher prices within narrow product categories.                  According to this view, capital and skill-


abundant countries use their endowments to supply products of higher quality, and this higher product


quality is reected in a higher price.


    Many papers use microdata to study the relationship between price variation and trade patterns at the


rm level. For instance, Manova and Zhang (2011) use Chinese trade transaction data to highlight a number


of systematic features of exports and imports by rm, product and destination that are consistent with


heterogeneity in product quality.
                                          14   For example, across rms selling a given product, rms that charge


higher export prices earn greater revenues in each destination, have bigger worldwide sales, and export to


more markets. Across destinations within a rm-product, rms set higher prices in richer, larger, bilaterally


more distant and overall less remote countries. Finally, rms that export pay a wider range of input prices


and source inputs from more countries.              Taken together these features of the data are consistent with a


heterogeneous rm model where more successful exporters use higher-quality inputs to produce higher-quality


goods and rms vary the quality of their products across destinations.


    Using Colombian census of manufactures data, Kugler & Verhoogen (2011) provide evidence of dierences


in product quality and highlight the relationship between rm export and import decisions. Within narrowly


dened industries, larger rms charge more for their outputs and pay more for their inputs than smaller


rms, and similar dierences exist between exporters and non-exporters. This pattern of results is consistent


with an extension of Melitz (2003), in which rms endogenously choose both input and output quality and


there is a complementarity between the quality of inputs and outputs.


    In Melitz (2003), the assumptions of constant elasticity of substitution (CES) preferences and monopo-


listic competition imply that rm productivity and product quality are isomorphic in the sense that they


enter equilibrium rm revenue in exactly the same way. An empirical literature has sought to distinguish


productivity and product quality by exploiting variation in prices across rms on the grounds that higher

Economist (2011).

                                                                 15
productivity implies lower prices whereas higher product quality can lead to higher prices, as explored in


Baldwin & Harrigan (2011) and Johnson (2010).


    One empirical challenge facing this literature is that rms supply horizontally dierentiated varieties in


Melitz (2003) and the specication of consumer preferences in which all varieties enter utility symmetrically


implicitly imposes a choice of units in which to measure the quantity of each variety. There is no necessary


relationship between this normalization and the units in which physical quantities of output are measured for


each rm in the data. As a result, data on physical quantities of output cannot be directly compared across


rms in the presence of horizontal product dierentiation, which complicates the interpretation of variation


in unit values across rms.


    Using unit values to make inferences about the role of product quality in determining export patterns


can be misleading because many factors other than quality aect prices. For instance, holding quality xed,


more ecient rms may nd it optimal to charge lower prices for their products.                         Instead, recent papers


obtain a proxy for product quality from demand residuals. Because consumers decide how much to purchase


of each good by comparing quality-adjusted prices, two rms that charge the same price but have dierent


market shares must sell varieties of dierent quality. In particular, rms that sell large quantities of physical


output conditional on price are classied as high quality producers. Khandelwal (2011) applies this method


to estimate quality for a broad sample of countries using aggregate trade data.                         He nds that markets


characterized by relatively small scope for quality dierentiation are associated with larger employment and


output declines resulting from low-wage competition. Similarly, Hallak & Schott (2011) estimate quality for a


panel of 43 countries between 1989 and 2003. They nd that export quality is correlated with the exporter's


income per capita, but they also nd that during this period quality levels are converging whereas income


per capita is not.     Finally, Gervais (2011) uses US Census data to estimate quality at the plant-level and


decomposes cross-plant variation in price and export status into quality and eciency margins. Prices are


found to be increasing in quality and decreasing in eciency, but, selection into exporting is driven mainly


by quality.



8     Intermediaries

While in many models of international trade consumers purchase imports directly from foreign producers, the


prevalence of rm importing has stimulated recent research on the role of intermediaries, such as wholesalers


and retailers, in the process of international trade. Bernard et al. (2010c) examine the dierences between


wholesalers, retailers and other categories of U.S. trading rms using data from the U.S. Linked/Longitudinal


Firm Trade Transaction Database (LFTTD).
                                                       15 While wholesale rms comprise 35 percent of exporters and

  15 As   in most international trade datasets, rms that trade directly in LFTTD cannot be compared to those that trade
indirectly via wholesalers or retailers, since the latter's sales or purchases within the U.S. are not observed.




                                                                16
42 percent of importers, they account for only 8 percent of export value and 15 percent of import value.


Retailers are less prevalent and smaller than wholesalers, accounting for 9 percent of exporters and 13


percent of importers but only 1 percent of export and import value. In contrast, rms with operations that


span wholesale or retail and other sectors (typically large rms) comprise around only 5 percent of exporters


and importers, but account for more than 60 percent of export value and more than 50 percent of import


value. Therefore the vast majority of trade is undertaken by a relatively small number of large traders that


vertically integrate wholesale/retail activities within rm boundaries. Using Italian trade transaction data,


Bernard et al. (2010d) nd that the share of exports mediated by wholesalers is positively correlated with


proxies for country-specic xed costs, including the World Bank's Doing Business measures of the number


of documents for importing, cost of importing and time to import.


   Using Chinese trade transaction data, Ahn et al. (2011) consider a dierent denition of intermediaries


based on rms having the English-equivalent meaning of importer, exporter, and/or trading in their


name. Such intermediary rms account for around $168 billion of China's exports or around 22 percent of the


total. The paper develops a model in which intermediaries are used by relatively small rms that do not nd


it protable to incur the xed costs of directly exporting to foreign markets by themselves.
                                                                                                          16 Consistent with

intermediaries handling the products of other rms, they export relatively more products per destination


market than other trading rms. In line with the idea that the xed costs of direct exporting are more likely


to be prohibitive in a small and remote foreign markets, intermediaries account for larger export shares in


smaller markets and markets with higher trade costs.


   Blum et al. (2011) provide further indirect evidence on intermediation using matched importer-exporter


transaction data for Chile and Colombia. Consistent with the concentration of U.S. trade discussed above,


the distributions of bilateral exports and imports between Chile and Columbia are highly skewed across


rms. More than half of exporters sell to only one importer, whereas the 99th percentile exporter sells to 19


importers. Similarly, more than half of importers deal with only one exporter, whereas the 99th percentile


importers deals with 9 exporters. More generally, while one party to a transaction can be small and engage


with few other traders, the other party to the transaction is typically large and deals with many other traders.


This pattern of results is consistent with the idea that ecient trades involve large trade volumes, which


can be achieved either by small importers matching with large exporters or small exporters matching with


large importers. Motivated by these ndings, the paper develops a theoretical model in which rms choose


whether to access markets directly or indirectly via intermediaries. Since the direct exporting technology is


characterized by increasing returns to scale, it is used by large exporters selling directly to many importers. In


contrast, the intermediation technology is employed by large importers that spread the costs of intermediation


over many small exporters.

 16 Other   models of intermediation with similar patterns of selection of rms into intermediation and direct exporting include
Akerman (2010) and Felbermayr & Jung (2008).




                                                               17
    More broadly, a key challenge in international trade is opening the black box of trade costs. Theories of


heterogeneous rms and international trade posit the existence of xed and variable trade cost parameters,


but there is still little understanding of what these parameters capture. The literature on intermediaries in


international trade takes some rst steps towards understanding the chains of decisions involved in conduct-


ing goods from production to nal consumption. Recent empirical research suggests that these trade and


distribution networks may be important for a variety of issues in international trade, such as the border eect,


exchange rate pass-through and the relationship between nominal and real exchange rates, as in Burstein


et al. (2005) and Li et al. (2011). Other micro evidence on the potential importance of rm distribution


networks comes from empirical ndings of Carry-Along Trade (CAT) in Bernard et al. (2010e), where more


than three quarters of the exported products and more than one quarter of export value from Belgian man-


ufacturers are in goods that are not produced by rms. Recent theoretical research on search, networks and


intermediation in international trade (e.g. Rauch & Trinidade 2003, Petropoulou 2007, AntrÃ s & Costinot


2011) provides further guidance for future empirical work.



9     Foreign Direct Investment

Multinational rms play a central role in the global economy, with U.S.-based multinationals mediating more


than 90 percent of U.S. trade in Bernard et al. (2009a). Indeed, for countries whose rms have large networks


of overseas subsidiaries, the sales of these subsidiaries can dwarf international trade ows.


    While Melitz (2003) focuses on exports, Helpman et al.        (2004) generalize the analysis to incorporate


horizontal foreign direct investment (FDI), allowing rms to choose between incurring a xed cost of exporting


or a xed cost of establishing an overseas aliate. If the xed costs of FDI are suciently high relative to


the xed costs of exporting, the most productive rms serve the foreign market through FDI; rms with an


intermediate range of productivities export; rms with a lower range of productivities only serve the domestic


market.   With a Pareto productivity distribution, the importance of FDI relative to exporting as a mode


for serving the foreign market is decreasing in the shape parameter of the Pareto productivity distribution


(increasing in rm productivity dispersion). Consistent with this prediction, Helpman et al. (2004) show


that the share of total foreign market sales accounted for by the sales of foreign aliates is larger in industries


with smaller estimated shape parameters for the distribution of rm sales (which in the model is directly


related to the distribution of rm productivity).


    Using Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) microdata on U.S. rms and their overseas aliates, Yeaple


(2009) provides further evidence in support of theories of heterogeneous rms and FDI. Consistent with rm


selection, more productive U.S. rms own aliates in a larger number of countries and these aliates generate


greater revenue from sales in their host countries. Consistent with country selection, as a country becomes


more attractive to U.S. multinationals, it attracts progressively smaller and less productive rms. While the




                                                        18
model accounts for many features of the data, there are others that are less well explained. The dispersion in


the number of foreign countries entered is smaller than predicted by the model given the observed dispersion


in U.S. market shares: large rms invest in too few foreign locations and small rms invest in too many, with


the largest rms underrepresented among the least attractive locations.


    Using Norwegian data, Irarrazabal et al. (2010) show that patterns of multinational activity by rm and


destination market exhibit a number of similarities with the patterns of trade by rm and destination market


in Eaton et al. (2011a). In particular, while total aliate sales and the number of foreign aliates are less


sensitive to distance than exports, they both decline with distance.                    This gravity-equation relationship is


inconsistent with a simple model of horizontal FDI, in which FDI should become more attractive as a mode


for serving the foreign market as trade costs increase.
                                                                    17 To explain these ndings, Irarrazabal et al. (2010)

extend the model of rm heterogeneity and FDI of Helpman et al. (2004) to incorporate traded intermediate


inputs and nd empirical support for the extended model. To analyze the joint determination of patterns


of trade and FDI, Ramondo and Rodriguez-Clare (2010) develop an extension of Eaton and Kortum (2002)


that incorporates both of these modes of serving foreign markets. Within this framework, the welfare gains


from trade can be more than twice as large as in a model with only trade, while the gains from multinational


production are slightly lower than in a model with only multinational production.



10          Intra-Firm Trade

Multinational rms not only dominate international trade ows but also undertake a substantial proportion


of their trade within the boundaries of the rm. Such trade between related parties accounts for around one


half of U.S. imports.
                           18 While many of the models of FDI discussed above assume that overseas production

is organized within the boundaries of the rm, more recent research has sought to explicitly model this


choice of rm organization. When overseas production is organized within the boundaries of the rm, foreign


aliates may either specialize in dierent stages of production from the parent rm (vertical FDI) or may


undertake the same production activities in a dierent location (horizontal FDI). To the extent that stages


of production are traded across national borders, vertical FDI involves intra-rm trade.


    As well as dominating U.S. imports, intra-rm trade is concentrated in capital-intensive industries and


between capital-abundant countries.              To explain these features of the data, AntrÃ s (2003) models a nal


goods producer who decides whether to outsource foreign production of an intermediate input to a stan-


dalone supplier or to engage in foreign direct investment (FDI) in which case the overseas production of the


intermediate input is vertically integrated within the rm. The nal goods producer and the intermediate

  17 In   principle, the gravity equation relationship for aliate sales and the number of aliates can be reconciled with a model
of horizontal FDI if there there are costs of operating foreign aliates that increase with distance. See, for example, Keller &
Yeaple (2011) and Arkolakis et al. (2011b).
  18 U.S.   import partners are dened as being related if either party owns, directly or indirectly, 6 percent or more of the other
party.




                                                                  19
input supplier make relationship-specic investments in capital and labor respectively. Contracts are incom-


plete because neither the quality of the intermediate input nor the amount of investments in capital and labor


can be veried by a third party and contracts cannot be written on sales revenues. The only contractibles are


therefore the allocation of residual rights of control and an   ex ante transfer between the nal goods supplier
and intermediate input producer. Since the nal goods producer's investment in capital is relatively more


important in a capital-intensive industry, vertical integration is more likely in the capital-intensive industry,


matching the empirical ndings for U.S. imports discussed above.         Furthermore, the model is also consis-


tent with the empirical nding of a higher share of intra-rm trade in U.S. imports from capital-abundant


countries, because there is greater intra-industry trade in the capital-intensive industry with these countries.


   AntrÃ s & Helpman (2004) augment this analysis to incorporate rm heterogeneity. Since the xed costs of


producing abroad are lower when outsourcing to a foreign supplier than when using foreign direct investment,


only the most productive rms can generate sucient variable prots to oset the large xed costs of vertical


integration. As a result, the share of U.S. imports that are intra-rm is predicted to increase not only in the


share of relationship-specic investments undertaken by the headquarters rm but also in the dispersion of


rm productivity. To examine these predictions, Nunn & Treer (2008) use U.S. data on related-party and


arms-length trade by disaggregated HS 6-digit product and on capital and skill-intensity for more aggregated


industries.   Consistent with the predictions of the model, the share of intra-rm trade in U.S. imports is


increasing in industry capital and skill-intensity (as proxies for the importance of headquarters investments),


in the dispersion of U.S. exports within each 6-digit product (as a proxy for the dispersion of productivity),


and in interactions between these two variables.


   AntrÃ s & Helpman (2008) generalize the theoretical analysis to allow inputs to be partially contractible.


In this framework, an improvement in foreign property rights has two osetting eects on the share of


intra-rm trade through the two productivity cutos which separate domestic production (low productivity),


foreign outsourcing (intermediate productivity) and foreign vertical integration (high productivity). On the


one hand, an improvement in foreign property rights reduces the productivity cuto for outsourcing, as some


inputs that were previously produced domestically are now outsourced abroad, which reduces the share of


intra-rm trade. On the other hand, as foreign property rights improve, the intermediate input supplier's


share of non-contractible inputs falls, which implies that the party whose investments require relatively more


incentives is the headquarters rm. As a result, the productivity cuto for vertical integration falls, as some


inputs that were previously outsourced abroad are now vertically integrated abroad, which increases the


share of intra-rm trade.   For a range of parameter values, the second eect can dominate, which yields


the surprising prediction that an improvement in foreign property rights can      increase the extent of vertical
integration. Consistent with this prediction, Nunn & Treer (2008) nd that the share of intra-rm trade


is positively related to interactions between capital and skill-intensity (as proxies for the importance of




                                                       20
headquarters investments) and an empirical measure of the rule of law (as a proxy for the quality of foreign


property rights).
                   19

    Additional empirical support for the above theoretical predictions is provided by Yeaple (2006), which


uses Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) data on the value of imports by U.S. parent rms from their foreign


aliates as a measure of intra-rm trade. Consistent with the theoretical predictions of AntrÃ s & Helpman


(2004), the share of intra-rm trade in U.S. imports is increasing in both industry capital-intensity and


research and development (R&D) intensity (as proxies for the importance of headquarters investments) and


the dispersion of sales across establishments within industries (as a proxy for the dispersion of productivity).


These estimated eects vary with U.S. trade partners' levels of development, with the largest and most


precisely estimated coecients found for the least-developed and newly-developing countries.
                                                                                                               20

    To further examine the determinants of intra-rm trade, Bernard et al. (2010b) use the trade-transaction


and establishment-employment data in LFTTD to construct a new measure of products' revealed con-


tractibility, which is based on the idea that contracting is likely to be easier for products passing through


intermediaries such as wholesalers. Intra-rm trade exhibits a non-linear relationship with country and indus-


try characteristics. On the one hand, higher quality property rights are associated with a higher probability


of related-party trade taking place. On the other hand, conditional on positive related-party trade occurring,


higher quality property rights are correlated with a lower share of related-party trade, which is consistent


with the idea that higher quality property rights facilitate arms-length transactions.



11      Labor Markets

A key implication of the Melitz (2003) model is that rms are unevenly aected by trade liberalization: low-


productivity rms exit, intermediate-productivity domestic rms contract, and high-productivity exporting


rms expand.      In contrast, workers are symmetrically aected by trade liberalization, since workers are


identical and the labor market is frictionless, so that all workers are employed for a common wage. These labor


market implications sit awkwardly with the large empirical literature on the employer-size wage premium


(see, for example, the survey by Oi & Idson 1999) and empirical ndings of wage dierences between exporters


and non-exporters even after controlling for rm size (see, in particular, Bernard & Jensen 1995, 1997).


    More recently, the theoretical literature on heterogeneous rms and trade has highlighted two sets of


reasons why wages can vary with revenue across rms.                  One line of research assumes competitive labor


markets, so that all workers with the same characteristics are paid the same wage, but wages vary across


rms as a result of dierences in workforce composition (see for example Bustos 2007, Verhoogen 2008 and

  19 For more general evidence on the role of property rights in determining the pattern of trade, see Nunn (2007).
  20 Corcos et al. (2010) and Defever & Toubal (2010) examine the determinants of intra-rm trade using French trade transaction
data. While Defever & Toubal (2010) explore the implications of dierent assumptions about the relative magnitude of the xed
costs of outsourcing and vertical integration, Corcos et al. (2010) emphasize the distinction between the extensive and intensive
margins. See Kohler & Smolka (2011) for evidence using Spanish data.




                                                               21
Yeaple 2005).      Another line of research introduces labor market frictions, so that workers with the same


characteristics can be paid dierent wages by dierent rms. One source of labor market imperfections is


search and matching frictions, where bargaining over the surplus from production can potentially induce


wages to vary with revenue across rms (see for example Davidson et al.                    2008, Cosar et al.     2011, and


Helpman et al. 2010). Another source of labor market imperfections is eciency or fair wages, where the


wage that induces eort or is perceived to be fair varies with revenue across rms (see for example Amiti &


Davis 2011, Davis & Harrigan 2011, and Egger & Kreickemeier 2009).


   This class of theoretical models highlights a new mechanism for trade to aect wage inequality based on


wage variation across rms and the selection of rms into international markets.
                                                                                                21 Helpman et al. (2011)

provide evidence on the quantitative importance of this new mechanism for understanding the relationship


between wage inequality and trade using Brazilian employer-employee and trade transaction data. Consistent


with the class of theoretical models discussed above, wage inequality between rms within sector-occupations


accounts for a substantial proportion of the level and growth of overall wage inequality, and this between-


rm wage inequality remains important after controlling for observable worker characteristics. To the extent


that existing empirical studies inspired by neoclassical trade theory focus on changes in relative wages be-


tween dierent sectors and types of workers, they abstract from an important channel through which trade


liberalization can aect wage inequality.


   A number of recent empirical studies have used matched employer-employee data to try to determine


whether wage dierences between exporters and non-exporters (as found by Bernard & Jensen 1995, 1997)


are the result of dierences in the composition of workers across rms or wage premia for workers with the


same characteristics. Following Abowd et al. (1999, 2001), this literature typically estimates worker and rm


xed eects under the strong identifying assumptions that switches of workers between rms are random


conditional on the covariates and that each worker's wage is a log linear function of their ability and does


not depend directly on the ability of their co-workers. Empirical studies within this literature generally nd


contributions from both dierences in workforce composition and wage premia, with the relative magnitude


of these contributions varying across studies. Using Mexican data, FrÃ­as et al. (2009) nd that approximately


two-thirds of the higher level of wages in larger, more productive plants is explained by higher levels of wage


premia and that nearly all of the dierential changes in wages across plants as a result of the shock of the


peso devaluation are explained by changes in wage premia. Using German data, Schank et al. (2007) nd


that wage dierences between exporters and non-exporters become smaller but do not completely vanish once


observable and unobservable characteristics of workers are controlled for. For other evidence using Brazilian


and Swedish employer-employee data, see Krishna et al. (2010) and Davidson et al. (2010) respectively.


   Amiti & Davis (2011) examine the separate impacts of input and output taris on rm wages. Extending

 21 In   the presence of labor market frictions, trade may also aect income inequality through changes in unemployment, as in
Felbermayr et al. (2011) and Helpman & Itskhoki (2010).




                                                              22
the Melitz (2003) model to incorporate rm importing, they show that a fall in output taris lowers wages at


import-competing rms, but boosts wages at exporting rms. Additionally, a fall in input taris raises wages


at import-using rms relative to those at rms that only source inputs locally. Using Indonesian rm-level


census of manufactures data, they nd strong empirical support for both predictions.
                                                                                               22

    In parallel to this research on labor market frictions, another line of related work has considered capital


market imperfections.        Manova (2011) develops a heterogeneous-rm model, in which countries vary in


nancial development and sectors dier in nancial vulnerability, and provides empirical evidence on the


model's predictions.       Using disaggregated trade data by country and product, more nancially-advanced


countries are found to be more likely to enter any given destination market and to export more conditional


on trading. These eects are statistically signicantly stronger in sectors with greater requirements for outside


nance or with fewer collateralizable assets.



12         Firm Export Market Dynamics

Much of the theoretical and empirical literature on heterogeneous rms and trade focuses on the cross-section


distribution of trade across rms, products and countries. More recent research has begun to explore the


dynamics of rms' decisions to enter export markets and its implications for the impact of trade liberalization.


    Using transaction-level customs data for Colombia for the period 1996-2005, Eaton et al. (2008) establish


a number of key features of rm export dynamics. In a typical year, nearly one half of all Colombian exporters


were not exporters in the previous year. These new exporters are small as a share of total exports and most


do not continue exporting in the following year. Total exports are instead dominated by a small number of


large and stable exporters. Nonetheless, out of each cohort of new exporters, a fraction of rms go on to


rapidly expand exports, and over a period of less than one decade, these successful new exporters account


for almost half of total export growth. Firms typically begin exporting in a single foreign market and, if they


survive, gradually expand into additional destinations. The geographic pattern of their expansion paths, and


their likelihood of survival as exporters, depend on their initial destination market.


    One line of research has sought to explain these export dynamics in terms of learning, as in Eaton et al.


(2011c), Akhmetova (2011), Albornoz et al. (2011) and Segura-Cayuela and Vilarrubia (2008). According


to this view, rms update their priors about protability in export markets based upon their sales, and


hence either exit or expand their penetration of export markets over time. Albornoz et al. (2011) consider a


setting in which export market protability is uncertain but correlated across export markets. As a result, a


rm may enter an export market even if the expected prots from entering that market alone are negative,


because of the option value of expanding to additional export markets if successful. An implication of this

(2011).

framework is that rm export market growth should be particularly rapid in the rst year of exporting, which


receives empirical support in Argentinian trade transaction data.
                                                                             23

    Another line of research tries to explain these export dynamics through stochastic shocks to productivity,


as in Arkolakis (2011) and Ruhl and Willis (2011). As productivity evolves over time, rms decide whether


to enter or exit individual export markets and whether or not to continue production. In Arkolakis (2011),


these stochastic shocks to productivity are combined with a model of endogenous market penetration.                           A


rm enters a market if it is protable to incur the marginal cost to reach the rst consumer and pays an


increasing market penetration cost to reach additional consumers. The model is calibrated using data on the


cross-section of rms and their sales across markets as well as the rate of incumbent rm exit. The calibrated


model is shown to be quantitatively successful in predicting rm exit, growth, and the resulting rm-size


distribution in U.S. manufacturing data.


    Bernard et al. (2009b) use U.S. transaction-level data to compare the role of the extensive and intensive


margins in accounting for cross-section and time-series patterns of trade.                  The extensive margins of the


number of rms and products explain the majority of the variation in trade ows across countries.                             In


contrast, year-on-year changes in trade are driven by the intensive margin of trade within continuing rm-


product-country trade relationships. One reason for the relative small contributions of the extensive margins


over short time intervals is that entering and exiting exporters, as well as recently added and about-to-


be-dropped rm-product-country trade relationships, are on average relatively small compared to continuing


rm-product-country trade relationships. Conversely, conditional on survival, entering exporters and recently


added rm-product-country trade relationships grow more rapidly than incumbent exporters and continuing


rm-product-country trade relationships. Analysis of the Asian crisis in the late 1990s conrms these time-


series results: while there are substantial changes in the extensive margin of the number of exporters, the


majority of the change in the dollar value of trade around the Asian crisis is driven by the intensive margin.


Notably, the extensive and intensive margins behave dierently for arms-length and related-party trade,


suggesting that the global production networks of multinational corporations play a role in inuencing the


response of the macroeconomy to shocks.



13         Conclusion

Empirical ndings from microdata on plants and rms have presented challenges to traditional theories


of international trade and stimulated the development of recent models of heterogeneous rms and trade.


These recent theories explain empirical ndings that only some rms export, exporters are larger and more

  23 In   the presence of learning and imperfect contract enforcement, Araujo et al.   (2011) argue that institutions may aect
export dynamics. Other things equal, exporters have higher initial exports and remain as exporters for longer in countries with
better contracting institutions. However, conditional on survival, the growth rate of a rm's exports to a country decreases with
the quality of the country's institutions.




                                                               24
productive than non-exporters, and trade liberalization raises average productivity through reallocations of


resources across rms within industries.


   These new theories highlight additional mechanisms through which the aggregate economy is aected by


the opening of trade and have stimulated further empirical research exploring these mechanisms. Aggregate


economic relationships such as the gravity equation are largely driven by the extensive margins of rms


and products rather than the intensive margin of average exports per rm-product.         Reductions in trade


costs induce endogenous changes in internal rm organization as rms adjust their range of products, their


decisions about whether to serve foreign markets through trade or overseas production, and their choices


about whether to organize foreign production within or beyond the boundaries of the rm. To the extent


that wages vary with rm revenue and only some rms export, rm heterogeneity provides a new mechanism


for trade to aect wage inequality.


   While early empirical studies examined export behavior using plant or rm-level data, the more recent


availability of customs data on individual trade transactions has enhanced our ability to look inside the black


box of the rm and led to an explosion of research across a broad range of areas.        These include multi-


product rms, intra-rm trade, intermediation, and the dynamics of rm entry into export markets. There


remain many fundamental issues ahead, such as the microfoundations of trade costs, further exploration of


the boundaries of the rm, and further consideration of the relationship between ndings from disaggregated


data and the economy's aggregate response to trade.

Notes: Data are for 2002 and are from the U.S. Census of Manufactures. All results
are from bivariate OLS regressions of firm characteristic in first column on a
dummy variable indicating firm's export status. Columns two and three include
industry fixed effects and industry fixed effects plus log firm employment,
respectively, as additional controls. Total factor productivity (TFP) is computed as
in Caves et al (1982). Capital and skill per worker are capital stock and non-
production workers per total employment, respectively. All results are significant at
the 1 percent level.

Notes: Data are for 1997 and are for firms that appear in both the U.S. Census of
Manufacturers and the LFTTD. All results are from bivariate OLS regressions of
firm characteristic in first column on dummy variable noted at the top of each
column as well as industry fixed effects and firm employment as additional controls.
Employment regressions omit firm employment as a covariate. Total factor
productivity (TFP) is computed as in Caves et al (1982). Capital and skill per
worker are capital stock and non-production workers per total employment,
respectively. All results are significant at the 1 percent level.
