                                         ABSTRACT

China’s four-trillion-yuan stimulus package fueled by bank loans in 2009 has led to the rapid
growth of shadow banking activities after 2012. Local governments financed the stimulus through
bank loans in 2009, and resorted to non-bank debt financing after 2012 given the rollover
pressure from bank debt coming due, a manifestation of the stimulus-loan-hangover effect. Cross-
sectionally, provinces with greater bank loan growth in 2009 experienced more Municipal
Corporate Bonds issuance during 2012-2015, together with more shadow banking activities
including Entrusted loans and Wealth Management Products. We highlight the market forces
behind the regulation changes on local government debt post 2012.

1    Introduction

    Right after the 2007/08 global financial crisis hit the export-driven Chinese economy
heavily, the State Council of China announced the four-trillion-yuan plan in November
2008 to stimulate China’s economy to maintain its “usual” above-9% annual growth rate.
Bai et al. (2016) document that most of the stimulus package was implemented through
China’s local governments that finance the infrastructure investment by bank loans via
the off-balance-sheet local government financing vehicles (LGFVs thereafter). Although
this aggressive plan helped bolster the slumping Chinese economy, the resulting swelling
local government debt in China caught the wide attention of scholars and practitioners
all over the world. About five years later, more and more studies had emerged on the
unintended consequences of the 2009 stimulus package on the growth of China’s economy
post 2009.
    We argue that one of these unintended consequences is the unprecedented rapid
growth of shadow banking activities in China after 2012. The origination of shadow
banking in China around 2008 can be attributed to other reasons (e.g., Hachem and Song
(2017a,b)). However, China’s shadow banking activities have experienced unprecedented
accelerated growth after 2012; for instance, Wealth Management Products (WMPs), a
widely used tool to attract off-balance-sheet deposits by commercial banks in China,
grew by a total of RMB 3.5 trillion during the three-year period from 2008 to 2011 but
increased by RMB 2.5 (3.1) trillion in a single year in 2012 (2013).
    By focusing on the composition shift of the liability side of China’s local governments
since 2009, this paper shows the stimulus-loan-hangover effect pushed them toward non-
bank debt financing after 2012. The stimulus-loan-hangover effects include the financing
demand to continue the long-term infrastructure projects started in 2009, as well as the
rollover pressure of maturing bank loans that were taken on by LGFVs at that time.
These forces fostered the rapid growth of shadow banking activities after 2012, and most
of these non-bank debt financing sources are related to Trust loans and/or WMPs, two
off-balance-sheet items that are often regarded as the barometers of the shadow banking
activities in China.
    We started by explaining the background of the 2009 four-trillion-yuan stimulus
package and its connections to local governments in China. Due to the public-goods
nature of the infrastructure-centric stimulus package, local governments carried out the
four-trillion-yuan expansion in 2009. However, according to the 1994 budget law, local
governments are not allowed to borrow. To facilitate and expedite the stimulus plan,
Beijing explicitly encouraged municipals to borrow from banks through their LGFVs, an

                                            1
important group of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in China. As planned, bank loans
and investment soared in 2009, but municipals were left with mounting bank debt.
    Facing the rising warnings of local government debt, starting in the second half of
2010, Beijing reverted its ultra-expansive credit policy back to its normal level, and the
National Audit Office (NAO) conducted two comprehensive surveys on local government
debt. These two official reports, dated December 2010 and June 2013, are the most
authoritative documents that shape all discussions on this topic. Based on the mid-2013
report, we focus on four different categories of debt that are sitting on the liability side
of local governments: Bank loans, Munibonds, Municipal Corporate Bonds, and Trust
loans, with the latter three types being non-bank debts.
    Our paper focuses on the third type of debt, namely, Municipal Corporate Bonds
(MCBs hereafter).1 These bonds are issued by LGFVs, and hence are corporate bonds
legally; but of course they have implicit guarantees from corresponding local govern-
ments, and hence enjoy the extra safety of municipal bonds. These bail-out expectations,
especially for LGFVs that are both SOEs and backed by local governments, are widely
spread and particularly relevant in China.2
    We highlight that our study treats the corporate bonds sector as an integrated part
of the shadow banking system in China.3 Although corporate bonds, which include
MCBs issued by LGFVs, are commonly viewed as standard and transparent financial
market instruments in China, they were heavily purchased by WMPs, which are the most
important component of Chinese shadow banking activities. Put simply, a majority of
the Chinese corproate bond sector is funded by shadow banking. According to recent
studies based on regulatory data (Ehlers et al. (2018); Lei et al. (2018)), around 40% of
   1
     It is “Cheng-Tou-Zhai” in Chinese, or “city investment bonds” by a literal word-for-word transla-
tion. We adopt “Municipal Corporate Bond” from the English translation the “Cheng-Tou-Zhai” index
provided by the China Securities Index Company Limited (CSI), which is the leading index provider
in China (e.g., CSI300 index) and is jointly owned by the Shenzhen Stock Exchange and the Shanghai
Stock Exchange. In the literature, papers have been using different translations; for instance, local gov-
ernment bonds by Huang et al. (2016) , Chengtou bonds by Ang et al. (2017), and urban construction
and investment bonds by Gao et al. (2018). Some practitioners’ articles also use the term LGFV bond.
   2
     Up to August 2017, no single case of MCB default has occurred yet. On the other hand, Chinese
investors have started to embrace the default risk on corporate bonds. Because of the slowdown of
the Chinese economy in the last five years, firms–whether privately owned or state owned–started to
default sporadically in 2014, and in 2016 34 firms defaulted on their bonds in China’s corporate bond
market. However, local governments are still heavily involved in bankruptcy resolutions, because many
defaulting enterprises have strong ties to local governments.
   3
     The literature typically classifies trust loans (Allen et al. (2017)), entrusted loans (Allen et al. (2018);
Chen et al. (2018b); He et al. (2018)), and undiscounted bank acceptance bills (An and Yu (2018)) as
shadow banking actitivies as surveyed by Hachem (2018). WMPs are widely referred to as shadow
banking activities, but they are not the ultimate users of funds (e.g., WMPs can be invested in trust
loans).



                                                       2
corporate bond funding was being channelled by WMPs during 2014, and this number
is even higher for MCBs (about 60%). The linkage between LGFV-issued MCBs and
shadow banking activities is widely accpeted among industry practitioners in the Chinese
financial market (see Section 4.5.4 for more details with recent regulation changes).4
    Consistent with the hypothesis of the stimulus-loan-hangover effect, we observe a
robust pattern of the composition change of local government debt, that is, a shift from
bank loans to non-bank debt obligations over the period of 2008-2016. Our analysis high-
lights the rollover channel particularly:5 following the back-to-normal credit policy after
2009, local governments needed to refinance/rollover their three-to-five-year-maturity
bank loans coming due, by non-bank debt sources that include Trust loans and MCBs.
Our view of the “stimulus-loan-hangover effect” is also confirmed with the post-2013
rapid growth of Trust loans as reported in “Aggregate Financing to the Real Economy”
by China’s central bank.
    The hypothesis of the stimulus-loan-hangover effect has the following cross-sectional
prediction: the areas with more bank-loan-fueled stimulus in 2009, whether demand-
driven or supply-driven, should have more MCB issuances several years later as the
after-effect of the stimulus package. This prediction is confirmed in the data, a result
that is robust at both regional and provincial levels, and with relevant controls (e.g.,
controlling provincial GDP growth in later years). Section 4.3 further introduces an
instrumental variable (IV), namely, whether a provincial governor was in his/her early
official term as of 2009, that captures the exogenous “demand” shock to the abnormal
stimulus bank loans in 2009. The results of IV estimation provides consistent evidence
for the stimulus-loan-hangover causal relation. On the other hand, this hangover effect
is alleviated for provinces with more policy-bank loans in 2009, consistent with the fact
that policy banks are on average issuing longer-term loans. We further decompose the
MCB issuance by purpose, and find that only the repaying-bank-loans component is
related to the 2009-stimulus bank loans cross-sectionally, after controlling the provincial
economic activities (e.g., GDP growth). In terms of economic magnitude, one more
dollar of bank loans in 2009 leads to about 15 cents more MCB issuance to repay bank
loans in later years. This estimate implies a loan maturity of about 3.5 years, consistent
with Gao et al. (2018) who report that the average LGFV loan maturity is 4.1 years for
   4
     Interestingly, when regulatory rules on WMPs were tightened after 2017, the corporate bond market
also slowed down significantly: the net aggregate social financing from corporate bonds dropped to RMB
0.45 trillion in 2017, in contrast to RMB 3.04 trillion in 2016). See the handbook chapter of Amstad
and He (2018) for more details.
   5
     The rollover risk emanating from refinancing maturing debt is an active research area in corpo-
rate finance, especially after the 2007/08 financial crisis; e.g., Diamond (1991); He and Xiong (2012);
Diamond and He (2014).


                                                  3
all loans issued by the largest 19 banks to large LGFVs with an annual credit line of at
least RMB 50 million.6
    Section 4.5 provides evidence linking our findings to China’s overall shadow banking
activities after 2012. The non-bank local government debt has become increasingly sig-
nificant relative to shadow banking activities in the overall Chinese economy, rising from
1.5% in 2008 to 48% in 2016. Cross-sectionally, provinces with more bank-loan-fueled
stimulus in 2009 experienced more entrusted loan growth during later years. Finally,
from publicly available data, by the end of 2016, 62% (or RMB 4.2 trillion) of MCBs
were purchased by WMPs.7 We also discuss the connection between Chinese corporate
bond markets and shadow banking.
    This paper paints a broad picture that links the 2007/08 financial crisis in the U.S.,
the 2009 four-trillion-yuan stimulus expansion in China, and the surging shadow banking
activities in China after 2012. Although both WMPs and Trust loans existed in China’s
financial markets before 2008, and increased slightly during the period of the 2009 stim-
ulus plan, our perspective helps us understand why these shadow banking activities
experienced “barbarous growth” after 2012. In short, the inelastic demand for contin-
uing the long-term infrastructure projects started in 2009, together with the mounting
rollover pressure of LGFVs that needed to repay maturing bank loans about four or five
years later, played an important role in driving the surging shadow banking activities in
China at that time.
    We are not saying the stimulus-loan-hangover effect is the only mechanism that ex-
plains the rapid development of the Chinese financial market post 2012. In general,
China’s growth is too sophisticated to be explained by one single force (see literature
review for several alternative views). In Concluding Remarks, we argue the stimulus-
loan hangover has affected the way the government regulated the financial markets in
China. For instance, in 2010, the strict enforcement of regulations on LGFV successfully
restrained the MCB issuance. But in 2014, facing the mounting rollover pressure, (var-
ious) regulators started proposing conflicting rule changes that intentionally facilitated
the LGFVs’ ability to borrow from the MCB market. This market force, which funda-
mentally is about how to place traditional banking in a market economy, is perhaps also
responsible for the rapid growth of China’s interbank market and the expedited process
of interest rate liberalization after 2012.
   6
     Kroeber (2016) also documents that China’s localities often take three- to five-year loans to fund
decade-long infrastructure projects.
   7
     Due to its shortcoming of statistical criteria (e.g., not including WMP investment in some special-
purpose vehicles that can in turn purchase MCBs), this number is bound to be an underestimate; one
estimate from an anecdotal but trustworthy source is about 70%.

     Literature review. This paper belongs to several different yet connected strands of
literatures in the recent development of Chinese economy and financial markets. First,
our paper analyzes one of the unintended consequences of China’s four-trillion-yuan
stimulus package in 2009. Bai et al. (2016) offer a comprehensive account of this un-
precedented fiscal stimulus package. In contrast to our paper, which focuses on the
liability side of the stimulus plan, Bai et al. (2016) emphasize the asset side and its
resulting inefficiency. According to Bai et al. (2016), local government may have fa-
cilitated access to capital for favored firms and hence worsened the overall efficiency
of capital allocation, with a potential permanent decline in the growth rate of China’s
aggregate productivity and GDP growth. Deng et al. (2015) emphasize the feature of
“state control” of the 2009 stimulus package, with state-owned banks extending credit
to SOEs and real estate in a massive way. Similarly, based on firm-level data, Cong
et al. (2018) document that following the 2009 credit expansion in China, new credit
was allocated disproportionately more toward state-owned, low-productivity firms than
toward privately owned, high-productivity firms. This finding represents a reversal of the
trend observed before 2008 during which capital allocations improved over time (Song
et al. (2011)).
     Second, the major evidence this paper relies on is MCBs, the corporate bonds issued
by LGFVs. Amstad and He (2018) provide an up-to-date overview for the Chinese
corporate bond markets. Zhang and Barnett (2014) offer a detailed description of local
government debts, especially those taken by LGFVs. Ambrose et al. (2015) study the
unique local government financing channel in China by investigating LGFVs’ borrowing
backed by land sales. Ang et al. (2017) examine the cross-sectional pricing properties
of MCBs, emphasizing the role of real estate dependence of the local economy and local
political risk associated with the post-2012 anti-corruption campaign. In contrast to Ang
et al. (2017), our paper focuses on the quantity of MCBs, and relates its unprecedented
growth to the 2009 stimulus plan.8
     A burgeoning literature studies China’s fast-growing shadow banking activities, in-
cluding both WMPs and entrusted loans. Hachem and Song (2017a) highlight the dif-
   8
     Liu et al. (2017) find that implicit government gurantee plays an important role in MCB pricing:
the local government debt-to-GDP ratio, not LGFV’s financial conditions, determines the MCB yield
spread. Huang et al. (2016) observe a crowd-out effect of massive public debt issuance on private
firms’ investment post the four-trillion-yuan stimulus. They argue that such a negative impact is
especially severe for firms more dependent on external funding, suggesting the stimulus-driven public
debt weakened long-term growth in China. Lastly, Gao et al. (2018) study how the political nexus
between local politicians and policy bank officials affects local governments’ default decisions on bank
loans. Chen et al. (2018a) study the pledgeability effect on asset pricing based on a policy shock on
Chinese corporate bond markets.

ferent reactions of the Big-Four banks and their relatively smaller peers facing stricter
liquidity regulation rules after 2009, and explain how small and medium-sized banks’
regulatory arbitrage triggered by regulation change on liquidity requirement results in
shadow banking, tighter interbank markets, and credit growth as unintended conse-
quences. Acharya et al. (2017) show that the stimulus package in 2009 also boosted
China’s shadow banking activities by analyzing a panel data on WMPs issued by each
bank.9

2       Institutional Background
We briefly describe the background of China’s four-trillion-yuan stimulus package in
2009, and its connections to local governments and their financing vehicles. We then
move on to document the evolution of the debt assumed by the local governments after
2009.


2.1     China’s Four-Trillion-Yuan Stimulus Plan in 2009
In the fall of 2008, China’s export-driven economy experienced a head-on blow by the
2007/08 financial crisis, which dragged the US economy into the Great Recession. Panel
A in Figure 1 shows that China’s annualized GDP growth rate dropped from 9.5% in
2008Q3 to 6.4% in 2009Q1, as the total export almost more than halved from September
2008 to February 2009.10
     In response, in November 2008, the Chinese premier Wen Jiabao announced to great
fanfare a four-trillion-yuan fiscal stimulus to be spent by 2010, with about RMB 1.5
trillion to be spent on railway, road, airport, water conservancy, and urban power grids;
1 trillion on post-disaster reconstruction (Wenchuan earthquake occurred in May 2008);
1.14 trillion on indemnificatory and comfortable housing, rural livelihood, and infrastruc-
ture; and 0.36 trillion on environmental protection and education. As shown in Panel
    9
     Entrusted loans, referring to the loans between two non-bank parties (e.g., industrial firms) using
a bank as an intermediate, are another form of shadow banking that grew rapidly after the 2009 bank-
loan-fueled stimulus. A couple of recent papers use entrusted loans as the platform to study China’s
shadow banking system. Chen et al. (2018b) document commercial banks’ engagement in intermediating
entrusted loans and the various incentives of small and large banks in providing such service. Allen
et al. (2018) focus more on the pricing side of entrusted loans and find that entrusted loans between two
parties without any relationship charge higher interest rates, potentially to compensate for fundamental
and informational risks. Finally, Wang et al. (2016) propose a theoretical framework to understand
these shadow banking activities as a part of the “dual-track” interest rate reform, in which WMPs and
trust/entrusted loans are ways to channel funds toward more efficient privately-owned firms, but at a
higher interest rate than the bank rate offered to state-owned enterprises.
  10
     According to the General Administration of Customs of People’s Republic of China, the total export
drops from 136.7 billion USD in September 2008 to 64.86 billion USD in February 2009.


                                                   6
A of Figure 1, the massive stimulus led to an immediate acceleration in China’s GDP
growth, which recovered to 11.9% in 2009Q4 but later slowly landed at 6.7% in 2016.
    Right after the announcement in November 2008, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the then
managing director of the International Monetary Fund, stated that “it will have an
influence not only on the world economy in supporting demand but also a lot of influence
on the Chinese economy itself, and I think it is good news for correcting imbalances.”11
Indeed, in the short run, many prominent researchers and policymakers believed China’s
massive fiscal stimulus helped prevent the world recession from deteriorating.12 However,
less than a decade later, more and more studies have shown the unintended consequences
of this vast stimulus package. One of these consequences is the massive debt burden
assumed by local governments, which is the focus of our paper.

2.1.1     Local governments and their financial vehicles

The stimulus package and the mounting debt burden of local governments in China are
just two sides of the same coin. Because the major component of the stimulus package
is infrastructure projects, including urban and rural, almost all investment spending is
naturally implemented and financed through local governments. Only about 1 trillion out
of the 4 trillion comes out of the budget of the central government, implying a financing
gap of 3 trillion.13 What is more, given the institutional background of national budget
law explained below, local governments were not allowed to borrow by themselves at
that time, and hence were forced to finance their investment spending via the so-called
LGFVs.
    Several excellent papers explain the history and peculiarity of the financing of local
governments in China. Here, we briefly mention the related institutional details on the
regulations faced by local governments and their counter-measures when they are in
need of financing. Bai et al. (2016) offer a greater recount of these legal details, and the
following exposition is based on their paper.
    Before 1994, local governments in China enjoyed considerable freedom in the alloca-
tion of local tax revenues. The “tax sharing reform” in 1994 overhauled the budget law
and removed control of local governments over local tax revenues. As a result, the tax
  11
      New York Times, November 9, 2008, “China plans $586 billion economic stimulus.”
  12
      Paul Krugman wrote that China responded by “much more aggressive stimulus than any Western
nation – and it has worked out well.” See http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/07/24/keynes-in-
asia/.
   13
      Still, this inference begs the question of whether China successfully carried out the four-trillion-yuan
stimulus package in full over the two years in 2009 and 2010. Numerous articles and sources suggest
so; for instance, Bai et al. (2016) show that the gross abnormal investment amount in 2009 and 2010
roughly matches the planned stimulus.


                                                      7
share of local governments fell from about 80% to 40% to 50% in 1994. Not surprisingly,
local governments responded by looking for other sources of revenues. One prominent
and controversial channel is land sales, i.e., the seizure by local governments of land
from farmers and urban residents and the resale/lease of the land to, say, developers
(Zhang and Barnett (2014); Ambrose et al. (2015)). Nevertheless, land sales, which can-
not be elevated immediately, are not the major financing source for local governments
in implementing the 2009 stimulus package within such a short time.
    The 1994 budget law also pushed the LGFVs onto the stage. Although the 1994
budget law made it illegal for local governments to run budget deficits, municipals can
run implicit deficits by establishing LGFVs and borrowing against them. Legally, an
LGFV is a state-owned enterprise with the corresponding local government as the only or
dominant shareholder, with its shares usually held by the State-owned Assets Supervision
and Administration Committee (SASAC). Prior to 2009, these LGFVs were severely
restricted to limited financing activities.
    Things became quite different starting in 2009. To push the stimulus package, the
central government decided to circumvent the 1994 budget law. Beijing encouraged local
governments to use LGFVs to take on bank loans, which are essentially off-balance-sheet
borrowing of local governments. Somewhat interestingly, the central government orches-
trated the relaxation of regulation from two directions: the Ministry of Finance, which
is in charge of budgetary issues of local governments, and the China Bank Regulation
Committee (CBRC), which is in charge of commercial banks in China. On one hand,
the Ministry of Finance issued a regulation that allowed local government to finance in-
vestment projects using all sources of funds, including budgetary revenue, land revenue,
and funds borrowed by local financing vehicles:

     “Allowing local government to finance the investment projects by essentially
     all sources of funds, including budgetary revenue, land revenue and fund bor-
     rowed by local financing vehicles.” (Document 631, Department of Construc-
     tion, Ministry of Finance, October 12, 2009)

In the meantime, to encourage banks to extend credit, CBRC made the following public
announcement:

     “Encourage local governments to attract and to incentivize banking and fi-
     nancial institutions to increase their lending to the investment projects set

Local governments had been keen to promote local economic growth over the past several
decades (Li and Zhou (2005)). Given these green lights and, to some extent, explicit
encouragement by Beijing, local governments implemented the unprecedented stimulus
package through their LGFVs by taking on a massive amount of loans extended by the
banking system.

2.1.2          Stimulus package in 2009 fueled by bank loans

Bai et al. (2016) estimate that about 90% of local government investment was financed

                                                                                                 9
via bank loans in 2009. Most of the new credit was released by China’s Big-Four state-
owned banks and three policy banks.14 The stimulus package causes a sudden dramatic
increase in newly issued bank loans in 2009, which is visualized in Figure 1.
    Panel A plots the annual new bank loans scaled by GDP of that year together with
the time series of GDP growth, over the period of 2004-2016. Whereas in normal years
new bank loans are about 15% of the GDP in China, this number clearly stands out in
2009 (27.5%) and 2010 (19.2%). To address the concern that the unusually high ratio
of new bank loans to GDP in 2009 might be driven by lower GDP of that year, Panel B
in Figure 1 plots new bank loans each year scaled by 2004 GDP in 2004 fixed price (left
scale), together with GDP levels for later years but in 2004 fixed price (right scale). The
pattern is even more striking: new bank loans in the two years after 2008, especially 2009,
stood out as abnormally high. Finally, Panels C and D show that most of the increase of
new bank loans in 2009 are toward the non-residential sector (instead of the residential
sector, which would be the case after the housing-related credit boom in 2016), consistent
with the stimulus package being predominantly infrastructure-investment oriented.15
    Although this paper focuses on the financing of local governments during and after the
2009 stimulus plan, note that not all additional new bank loans in that year went to local
governments. The easy monetary policy, which Beijing pushed to help local governments
obtain bank financing to implement the fiscal expansion, also led to abnormal bank credit
growth to other sectors in China (see, e.g., in Cong et al. (2018)).16 Figure 2 provides
the breakdown of 2009 abnormal new bank loans to various sectors as a result of the
stimulus package. We estimate that a total of RMB 4.7 trillion extra in new bank
loans was extended to the Chinese economy in 2009. LGFVs obtained roughly RMB
2.3 trillion of extra new bank loans in 2009, among which 2.06 (0.26) trillion came from
commercial (policy) banks. The non-residential sector (excluding LGFVs) received about
1 trillion in extra new bank loans, and the remaining 1.4 trillion went to the residential
sector (mainly in the form of mortgage loans). Appendix A provides details on how the
sector-level abnormal bank loans in 2009 are estimated.
  14
      The Big-Four stated-owned commercial banks are Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, Bank
of China, Construction Bank of China, and Agricultural Bank of China; the three policy banks are
Agricultural Development Bank of China, China Development Bank, and the Export-Import Bank of
China. These banks, especially the latter three policy ones, are in general expected to support the
country’s economic and political agenda besides the usual goal of profit-maximization.
   15
      Heavy infrastructure investment in 2009, which could be considered as part of the long-standing
urbanization plan in China, is consistent with the rising land prices around 2009-2010 (Deng et al.
(2015)), even without heated residential lending (to the household sector).
   16
      As Premier Jiabao Wen stated in the 2009 Davos World Economic Forum, the success of the 2009
stimulus was due to the combination of “the proactive fiscal policy and moderately easy monetary
policy.”

   Several years later, the consequences of mounting debt obligations, to which we turn
next, surfaced.


2.2     Categories of Local Government Debt
Shortly after the successful implementation of the stimulus package via LGFVs in mid
2010, many economists and practitioners raised warnings about the solvency of local
governments, because it may jeopardize the steady growth of Chinese economy. What
is worse, at that time, the central government had no direct statistics to even gauge
the aggregate debt balance of local governments, let alone monitor the potential default
risk of the LGFVs. This situation pushed the NAO to conduct the first nationwide
survey on local government debt on December 2010. The same office published another
somewhat more detailed official report, dated June 2013. These two NAO reports are
the most authoritative documents that shape all discussions on this topic, and they
provide detailed breakdown of China’s local government debt in these two snapshots.
We reproduce this information in Table 1.

2.2.1    Categories of debt obligations

We investigate the composition shift of four debt obligations reflected in the 2013 report:
Bank loans, Municipal corporate bonds (MCBs), Munibonds, and Trust.17 As we explain
  17
     Several liability items are significant but excluded from our later analysis. “Accounts receivable”
is excluded due to its nature of working capital (not debt). “Built-to-transfer” is the usual source of
financing in the Public-Private-Partnership (PPP); it is in the same nature as “Borrowing from entities
& individuals,” which involves private entities and local government. We, unfortunately, have no data


                                                         11
later in this section, all of them are in the form of debt with implicit bail-out expectations
from government, either local or central, and all of them are under the “shadow” of the
traditional banking business in one way or another.
    MCBs are public bonds issued by LGFVs (including corporate bonds, mid-term notes,
and short-term bills in the mid-2013 report; see Table 1) that have implicit government
guarantee (Liu et al. (2017)). We will turn to MCB in more detail in Section 3.1.
A conservative estimate in Section 4.5 shows that in 2016, about 62% of MCBs were
invested by WMPs, which are sold through commercial banks and considered the most
important form of shadow banking in China (e.g., Acharya et al. (2017); Hachem and
Song (2017a)).
    Munibonds stand for municipal bonds issued by local governments. As explained, the
1994 Budget Law prohibited local governments in China from borrowing by themselves
directly, but they may issue munibonds via the Ministry of Finance. In October 2014,
the Ministry of Finance released its authority fully back to several municipalities, which
were then allowed to issue and repay munibonds by themselves. As we argue shortly,
this reform is likely a response to the stimulus-hangover effect, and starting in 2015, we
observe a rapid growth of munibonds under the so-called local government bond-swap
program (i.e., issuing munibonds to repay existing due debt) overseen by the Ministry
of Finance. We will discuss this bond-swap program in the Conclusion.
    Finally, Trust debt includes both trust loans (individuals to firms) and entrusted
loans (firms to firms); both help channel funds to the non-financial sector outside the
traditional commercial banking sector. Section 4.5 explains that traditional commercial
banks play an important intermediating role in channeling both forms of loans, and hence
they are widely considered the barometer of shadow banking activities in China. Starting
from 2010, given the surging financing demand of LGFVs backed by local governments,
one particular form of trust loans, termed trust-municipality cooperation, became pop-
ular.

2.2.2    Contingency of debt obligations

The NAO reports contain another dimension of the breakdown of local government debt:
“fully guaranteed,” “contingent obligation,” or “contingent bailout obligation.” The mere
existence of these categories reflects the uncertainty toward the nature of debts assumed
by LGFVs. Are they municipality debt? Or just corporate debt? In China, the rules and
regulations are in flux, and the extent to which local governments are liable for the debt
source on this item. Finally, “Fiscal on-lending” captures borrowing from higher authorities (such as
the Ministry of Finance).


                                                 12
assumed by LGFVs is unclear. Given that LGFVs are enticed to implement the stimulus
plan pushed forward by Beijing, which is the ultimate rule maker, investors naturally
expect some forms of bail-out from local or central governments in case LGFVs default.
    In response to this widespread perception, the State Council of China issued the 43th
Document, “Opinions of the State Council on Strengthening the Administration of Local
Government Debts,” in September 2014. The “No. 43 Document” and the following
regulatory rules banned local governments from providing guarantee to LGFVs’ bond
offerings, prohibited local governments from raising debt via LGFVs, and ordered local
governments to restructure and substitute existing debt with munibonds. However, how
strictly these rules are implemented is unclear. As explained in Section 5, some other
new orders were coming out from other regulatory bodies to counter this strict ruling,
and the government’s implicit bailing-out on MCB and related debt was still widely
expected among Chinese investors. As a result, although the net MCB issuance dropped
to 1.1 trillion RMB in 2015 from the peak of 1.7 trillion in 2014, the number jumped
back to around 1.5 trillion in 2016.


3       Bank Loan Wanes and Shadow Banking Waxes
After describing our data sources, this section shows the time-series pattern that the
debt liability of local governments in China has slowly shifted from mostly bank loans
in 2009 to a significant fraction of non-bank debt after 2012. We then present evidence
from various dimensions that is consistent with the stimulus-loan-hangover effect.


3.1     Data Sources
Our data come from various sources. Details of variable constructions can be found in
Appendix B.

3.1.1    Municipal corporate bond data

LGFVs issue MCBs in five forms including exchange-traded corporate bond, enter-
prise bond, medium-term note, short-term financing bill, and private placement note.
Throughout the paper, we use the term “corporate bonds” to refer to all of the above
bonds, which are publicly traded in either exchanges or the interbank market. For each
MCB issuance, WIND provides the bond-specific information, including actual issuing
amount, issuing date, maturity date, issuer’s province, bond rating, issuer’s rating, and
the purpose of raised funds.

                                           13
    Mainland China has 31 provincial-level administrative divisions that have MCBs
issued by LGFVs. We drop Xizang because it only has one MCB ever issued in our
sample, leading to 30 provinces in our final sample. Following common practice, we
also classify these 30 provinces of mainland China into seven geographic regions: North
China, East China, South China, Center China, Northeast, Northwest, and Southwest.
    For all MCBs except the private placement notes, the bond issuance prospectus pro-
vides information on the purpose of issuance proceeds. We manually read the prospectus
and classify the issuance purpose into three categories: repayment of existing bank loan,
investment in projects such as rebuilding shanty areas or constructing infrastructure,
and others (including replenishing working capital, financing for other entities through
entrusted loan structure, and undisclosed purpose).18

3.1.2   Bank loans and other data

Country and province bank loan data are from the People’s Bank of China (PBoC),
whereas trust and entrusted loan data are from the Aggregate Financing to the Real
Economy released by the PBoC since 2011. The National Bureau of Statistics provides
data on GDP (both country and province levels), provincial fiscal deficit measured as the
fiscal expense minus the fiscal revenue, fixed-asset investment, and local government’s
land sale RMB value.
    The structure of local government debt is estimated from 2008 to 2016, with details
provided in Appendix B. Recall that the NAO provides two official auditing reports on
local government debt that we recreate in Table 1. Annual Municipality-Trust coop-
eration data are reported officially by the China Trustee Association and are available
on WIND. Data on bank loan balance of LGFVs before 2012 are from various validated
news sources and are collected by WIND. Individual munibonds and MCBs are from
WIND.
    The aggregate WMP balance and the year-end balance of credit bonds by ratings
are from WIND. We get the WMPs’ holding in credit bonds by ratings from China
Commercial Bank Wealth Management Products Annual Reports issued by the China
Banking Wealth Management Registration System.

value over the 2004-2008 average. Each year, on average, a province issued MCBs worth
2.2% of its GDP over the period of 2012-2015. The number is quite similar (2.1%) if we
subtract the average of the 2004-2008 MCB/GDP, suggesting LGFVs issued few MCBs
in early years. The cross-provincial average 2009 bank loan (BL)/GDP is 27.5% with an
abnormal BL/GDP of 16.4%, which is an increase of around 1.5 times from the 2004-
2008 average of 11.1%. By contrast, we do not see much of an increase in the 2008Q1-Q3
BL/GDP.


3.2     Evolution of Debt Obligations of Local Governments
3.2.1    Credit policy tightening and rollover pressure

Witnessing the wild surge of bank credit in 2009, Beijing realized that the policy-driven
credit boom may grow out of control, with potential distortions and liquidity overhang
being devastating to the economy. As early as January 10, 2010, a Financial Times
article titled “Beijing Seeks to Curtail Bank Lending ’Binge’ ” reported that banks were
expecting the government to tighten the monetary policy in the following months.19 In
Figure 1, we observe that the ratio of new bank loans to GDP, following the unprece-
dented, high level of 27.2% in 2009, dropped to 19.2% in 2010 (which still exceeded the
normal level); the credit policy reverted to its normal level afterwards. The somewhat
unexpected credit tightening following 2009 pushed local governments to explore other
sources of financing for their on-going investments. Our paper highlights another more
distinct channel. These stimulus loans were backed by infrastructure projects whose cash
inflows likely occur in the remote future. Kroeber (2016) explains this classic “maturity
mis-match” of Chinese local governments by writing “Localities often used three- to five-
year bank loans to finance infrastructure projects whose economic benefits (and revenue
streams, if any) would only materialize over two or three decades.” More precisely, Gao
et al. (2018) report in their Table 1 that the average loan maturity is 4.1 years for all
loans borrowed by large LGFVs with an annual credit line of at least RMB 50 million
from the largest 19 banks. Naturally, LGFVs faced unprecedented heavy pressure to roll
over the loans coming due about three to five years later.20
  19
     The report writes “the authorities (CBRC) had ordered some Chinese banks temporarily to
halt lending altogether after the sector extended a total of 1.1 trillion RMB in new loans in
just the first two weeks of January.” URL: http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/320cf850-0a1a-11df-8b23-

     Chen and Gu (2012) analyze in length the situation of local government debt after the 2009 stimulus
plan, together with its potential impact on the commercial banking system in China. In that paper,
according to an internal report by CBRC, standing at November 2010, the bank-loan-due schedules for
LGFVs are RMB 0.8 trillion due in one year, 2.2 trillion due after one year but before three years, 3.5

Figure 3: Local Government Debt-Due Schedule as of June 30, 2013. The total out-
standing local government debts are classified into three categories: full obligation, guaranteed
liability, and contingent bailout liability. We assume the debt due at the first half of 2013 is the
same as the debt due at the second half of 2013. Data source: local government debt auditing
report in 2013 issued by the NAO.


    Figure 3 gives the detailed debt-due schedules standing on June 30, 2013. Because
June 2013 is the mid of that year, we simply double the debt due in the second half of
2013 to proxy for the debt due that year (indicated by the hatched area). The magnitude
of rollover pressure starting from 2013 was enormous. Local governments needed to pay
back about RMB 3.25 trillion of debt in the second half of 2013 (so about RMB 6.5 trillion
in the whole year of 2013), and about RMB 3.5 trillion in 2014. To put these numbers
into perspective, they account for about 45% of local government debt obligations, and
most of these soon-to-be-due debt obligations are bank loans. This mounting rollover
pressure is why at that time, leading economists in many institutions were concerned
about the debt situation of China’s local government debt.

3.2.2    Bank loans down, non-bank debt up

Facing tightening/normal credit policy, local governments responded by resorting to the
non-bank debt mentioned above, either to refinance part of maturing bank loans or
finance their continuation investments. For LGFVs with the full flexibility to choose
whom to borrow and/or refinance from, the easiness and the rate at which they can
obtain financing is what matters. The trade-off has slowly leaned toward non-bank
sources since 2012; for instance, from loan pricing terms, tapping credit from MCBs
trillion after three years but before 10 years, and 2.6 trillion after 10 years (see their Figure 12).

rather than bank loans has become more attractive.21
    As the main result of this section, Figure 4 depicts the evolution of total local gov-
ernment debt balance and the composition of each category (Panel A) and the evolution
of the percentage for each category (Panel B). We indicate the NAO (i.e., National Au-
dit Office) on December 2010 and June 2013 to highlight that these two snapshots are
authoritative numbers from national auditing reports. We have tried our best (as ex-
plained below) to fill in the entire time series for each category from 2008 to 2016; for
details, see Appendix B. The data of total local government debt are from the two NAO
auditing reports (2008, 2009, 2010, 2012), interpolation (2011, 2013), and public news
releases (2014, 2015, 2016) from regulators. WIND provides the accurate issuance data
for munibonds and MCBs. The evolution of Trust loans is estimated by combining the
snapshot of the total Trust loans to local government in the mid-2013 NAO auditing re-
port, together with the annual outstanding balances of Municipality-Trust cooperation;
see Appendix B.5 for details.
    For bank debt, the president of CBRC (Fulin Shang) regularly reveals the aggregate
exposure of the banking system to local governments via the official website of CBRC
(and WIND recorded this information over time) before June 2013. Afterwards, this
information seems to have started to become sensitive and hence is no longer available on
the CBRC website. Instead, we resort to the annual reports of listed commercial banks,
hoping some banks keep reporting their loan exposures to local governments. Only one
of the Big-Four banks (Construction Bank of China) reported this information, based on
which we construct the outstanding bank loans to local governments of the entire banking
sector after June 2013. We acknowledge it is much less accurate than the numbers before
June 2013, and hence indicate them with dashed line in both panels of Figure 4.
    Figure 4 serves two purposes. The first is more for fact-recording, because we have
produced perhaps the most reliable estimates (based on public information only) for local
government debt and its various compositions. The second is our main point: starting
in 2012, besides the fast growth of the total debt balance of Chinese local governments
(from RMB 5.6 trillion in 2008, 17.4% of GDP, to RMB 26.8 trillion in 2016, 36.0% of
GDP), we also see a steady and noticeable composition shift from bank loans to non-
bank debt. In fact, this point is already quite evident based on the two NAO reports
only. Bank loans were about 80% of total local government debt at the end of 2010,
which dropped to below 60% in the mid-2013 report. By contrast, the fraction of bonds
  21
    According to practitioners, the loan rate that LGFVs can obtain from banks is about 110%~115%
of the benchmark lending rate set by the PBoC. In 2012, based on the information of the prevailing
benchmark lending rate and MCB rate, we find the LGFV bank borrowing rate exceeds the MCB rate
by about 2 percentage points.

3.3     Direct Evidence from MCB Prospectuses
We now present the first evidence on MCB that supports the stimulus-loan-hangover
effect. Figure 5 Panel A plots the evolution of the MCB-issuance activities over the
period of 2004 to 2016, with new bank loans over GDP in the background. The solid
line depicts how the total gross MCB issuance evolves over time. We start observing
a steady growth of MCB issuance only starting 2009, with two notable jumps in 2012
and 2014. The dashed line plots the net MCB issuance (gross issuance minus those
matured in that year). The difference between solid and dashed lines is negligible before
2015, indicating the rollover pressure from maturing MCB is not much of a concern
until 2015. As explained in the data section 3.1.1, because most MCBs (except private
placement note) is a public offering, every LGFV that is issuing MCB has to provide a
prospectus, in which the bond issuer reveals the purpose of issuance. We group various
issuance purposes into three categories: investment, repaying bank loans, or others (e.g.,
replenishing working capital, financing for other entities, undisclosed purpose, etc.); for
details, see Section 3.1.1. Panel B in Figure 5 plots the time series of each category over
the period from 2008 to 2016. We observe that in the first two years right after stimulus
(2009 and 2010), almost all MCB issuance was for investment, which is likely to be a
continuation of those long-term infrastructure projects started in 2009. But repayment-
driven MCB issuance has picked up its pace since 2011; it reached about a quarter of
total MCB issuance in 2013, and experienced a blasting growth afterwards. In 2015,
more than half of MCB-issuance deals are for repaying maturing bank loans.
    Although a noticeable magnitude difference appears to exist between bank loan over
GDP (left scale) and MCB issuance over GDP (right scale) in Figure 5, note that quan-
titatively our story matches with the data fairly well. Recall Section 2.1.2 explains that
of the total RMB 4.7 trillion abnormal bank loans, RMB 2.3 trillion went to LGFVs.
Since the 2009 stimulus loans occurred one time only, our mechanism implies that the
cumulative issuance of non-bank debt instruments (e.g., MCB and Trust) for debt re-
payment during 2012-2015 should roughly match with this RMB 2.3 trillion number. In
the data, the cumulative issuance amount is RMB 2.1 trillion by the end of 2015, with
1.4 trillion from M CBrepay and 0.7 trillion from trust financing.22
  22
    The cumulative LGFV trust debt increase is RMB 1.9 trillion from 2012 to 2015. We do not have
information to obtain the loan-repayment part of the LGFV trust issuance. However, the China Trust
Association provides the number on the fraction of the quarterly loan-type trust balance. We use this
number to estimate the cumulative trust issuance for loan repayment to be RMB 0.7 trillion.

4     Cross-Sectional Evidence and Links to Shadow Bank-
      ing
Taking the stock of time-series evidence so far, we have painted the following picture:
in 2009, China’s local governments took on massive stimulus bank loans, and about
three to five years later they resorted to non-banking financing to either continue their
ongoing long-term investment or roll over their maturing bank loans. Based on the
municipal-level MCB data, this section explores the cross-sectional implication of the
stimulus-loan-hangover mechanism, which predicts that the more bank loans an area
was taking on in 2009, the more MCBs in that area would be issued in the years after
2012. In Section 4.5, we connect the shift toward non-bank debt with shadow banking
activities in China, which has experienced “barbarian growth” since 2012.
    Note one additional advantage offered by MCB that is important for our empirical
test. In general, for cross-sectional analysis, researchers need to be careful in distin-
guishing between the source of funds and the use of funds, especially when studying
shadow banking. Wealthy individuals in developed coastal cities (e.g., Shanghai) often
buy WMPs that are backed by trust products investing in some projects from under-
developed inner land cities (e.g., Qinghai). Consider the alternative of collecting data
on individual trust products that are also available on WIND. Although the prospec-
tus of a typical trust product also identifies perfectly where the funds get raised, only
extremely vague information—often nothing at all—is available on where the funds are
used. By contrast, because MCBs are issued for the infrastructure projects in particular
regions, we know the use of funds, i.e., where the funds go to. This is clearly what our
cross-sectional prediction is about.


4.1    Main Hypothesis
The stimulus-loan-hangover mechanism discussed above has the following hypothesis
with a straightforward cross-sectional prediction.
    Hypothesis. If a region/province was more aggressive in taking on bank loans in 2009,
this region/province will issue more MCBs several years later.
    To test this hypothesis, for each province/region, we first construct the “abnormal”
bank loan over GDP at 2009, which is defined as the 2009 value minus its average in the
past five years (here, BL stands for bank loans and “i” indicates province/region):

    (2009 Abnormal BL/GDP)i =(2009 BL/GDP)i – (Average BL/GDP 2004~08)i .             (1)


                                           21
Similarly, we construct the provincial/regional “abnormal” MCB over GDP in each future
year from 2012 to 2015:

 (201t Abnormal MCB/GDP)i =(201t MCB/GDP)i – (Average MCB/GDP 2004~08)i ,

for t = 2, 3, 4, 5. Our regressions treat (2009 Abnormal BL/GDP) as the independent
variable, whereas (201t Abnormal MCB/GDP) as the dependent variable, i.e.,

  (201t Abnormal MCB/GDP)i,t =αt +βt (2009 Abnormal BL/GDP)i + Controlsi,t +i,t .
                                                                                          (2)
Later, we also run a panel regression in which we pool together observations from different
years (2012-2015) (so that αt and βt no longer depend on t), and report standard errors
robust to two-way clustering at the province-year level.
    To address the potential concern of a significant cross-region disparity in financial de-
velopment in China, we have taken out the past-five-years average of BL/GDP for each
province when constructing the key independent variable (i.e., 2009 Abnormal BL/GDP)
in (1). In other words, 2009 Abnormal BL/GDP captures the heterogeneous devia-
tions—here, the aggressiveness in credit expansion—in response to the stimulus plan
away from the province-dependent steady state. This treatment is particularly attrac-
tive in light of Panel B in Figure 1, which shows a steady pattern between new bank
loans and GDP in China.
    We emphasize that it matters little whether the variation in 2009 Abnormal BL/GDP
was driven by demand-side shocks (e.g., LGFVs in some provinces were aggressive in
launching infrastructure projects in 2009) or supply-side shocks (e.g., banks in some
provinces were pushed by Beijing to lower their lending standards). Either way, the
rollover channel says that bank loans taken in 2009 need to be repaid when these bank
loans become due, giving rise to heterogeneous rollover pressures in later years across
provinces.
    What raises concerns of βt in (2) to be biased is that, at the province level, 201t
Abnormal MCB/GDP in later years—which may be neither for loan repayment nor
for continuing phases of 2009 infrastructure projects—is correlated with 2009 Abnormal
BL/GDP given regional disparity in China. We have two approaches to address this
problem. First, in regression (2), we include province-level economic variables, for exam-
ple, province GDP growth, that the prior literature has found to be relevant for MCB
issuances. These results are reported in Section 4.2. Second, in Section 4.3, we introduce
an instrumental variable that exploits the timing of the terms of local governors; this


                                             22
variable captures heterogeneous demand-side shocks to 2009 abnormal bank loans but
are arguably orthogonal to the future MCB/GDP growth across provinces.


4.2     Cross-Sectional Evidence: MCB Issuance
Panel A in Figure 6 gives the regional scatter plot between the 2009 abnormal bank loan
and MCB issuance for each year from 2012 to 2015. The “Southwest” region, where
the Wenchuan earthquake in May 2008 occurred, had the largest abnormal bank loan
growth in 2009 for post-disaster reconstruction. Consistent with our hypothesis, this
region ranked top in its abnormal MCB issuance in three out of four later years. Panel
B then zooms in further to present the provincial scatter plot.
    Table 3 conducts the formal regression analysis for each year. Panel B says that cross-
sectionally, the 2009 abnormal bank loan growth positively predicts the abnormal MCB
issuance in that province, with a 1% level of significance in both 2013 and 2014, and
magnitude-wise, we obtain similar coefficients over years. The statistical insignificance in
2012 but significance in later years is reasonable; according to Figure 5, the stimulus-loan-
hangover intensified after 2012. For 2015, munibonds issuance due to the new Budget
Law passed in late 2014 relieved part of the rollover pressure of local governments.
    Panel C of Table 3 presents the results of provincial regressions with economic con-
trols. We follow Bai et al. (2016) to include abnormal fiscal deficit over GDP, abnor-
mal fixed-asset investment over GDP, abnormal land sale over fiscal revenue, and GDP
growth, all in the same year and the same province as the abnormal MCB issuance.23
We also include the “corruption index” developed by Ang et al. (2017) as a control. This
index is a political-rank-weighted number of corrupted officials, capturing the severity of
provincial political risk. The 2009 abnormal bank loan growth positively predicts the ab-
normal MCB issuance in years 2013 to 2015. The coefficient in front of the province GDP
growth is always significantly positive across different specifications, reflecting the me-
chanical relation between economic activities (GDP) and investment (financed by MCB).
The corruption index has a positive coefficient and is marginally significant (significant
at the 5% level for 2013), suggesting provinces with loose governance were issuing more
MCB during 2012-2015.

    Throughout the paper, “abnormal” means we take the year t observation and subtract its average
between 2004 and 2008 except where specified.

                                                                                                        24
4.3     The IV Approach
Whereas from the accounting perspective, local governments have to repay matured
stimulus loans, as economists, we are still interested in whether the variation in the 2009
abnormal bank loan was driven by demand-side or supply-side shocks. In addition, a
carefully designed IV helps us guard against the concern that the results in Section 4.2
are merely correlation rather than causality.

4.3.1    The IV: Is the governor in his/her early term?

We first construct the provincial-level dummy variable EarlyT ermi,09 , which takes a
value of 1 if the governor of a province i was in his/her first two years of the official term
as of 2009, and 0 otherwise.
    The IV EarlyT ermi,09 aims to capture the demand-side shock to stimulus bank loans
in 2009.24 In China, an official term of a provincial governor is typycal five years. After
this term, he or she can get promoted, stay in the same official rank, or retire. The
incentive to comply with Beijing will be stronger in later years in a governor’s term, and
newly appointed governors may need time to become familiar with their provinces before
they launch new investment projects.
    As a result, when the stimulus policy shock hit in 2009, we expect more aggresive
bank lending in provinces with governors in their third year or later, because those
governors were more motivated to follow Beijing’s order. On the other hand, provinces
with new governors were relatively less sensitive to the 2009 stimulus plan as these
governors were less likely to get promoted anyway. Therefore, the 2009 cross-province
variation in governor’s official term, EarlyT ermi,09 , serves as a candidate IV for the 2009
stimulus loan.25
  24
     We have also tried another instrument based on the supply-side story. Borrowing the idea from
Acharya et al. (2017), for each province, we construct BOCexpoi as the average branch fraction of Bank
of China (BOC) over 2004 to 2008, because the president of BOC in 2009 was Gang Xiao, who strongly
supported the central government relative to his peers by aggressively lowering lending standards and
extending stimulus loans in 2009. However, this instrument turns out to be quite weak (insignificant in
the first stage).
  25
     This IV has been used in the literature. Li and Zhou (2005) show that the most important deter-
minant in the promotion decision is the local economic growth relative to other provinces. Tan and
Zhou (2015) find that both bank loans and fixed-asset investments at the provincial level peak in the
third and fourth year of a provincial governor’s term. On the other hand, Ru (2018) finds that city-level
China Development Bank loans increase most in the first two years of a city official’s term. This finding
implies an opposite relationship between bank loans and government officials’ first-two-year term at the
provincial and city levels. Our personal discussion with Ru attributes this discrepancy to a much faster
turnover for city-level officials and hence stronger incentives to boost local economic growth right after
the appointment.



                                                   25
    Finally, the exclusive restriction requires that other than the rollover channel, EarlyT ermi,09
is uncorrelated with other disturbances to 201t Abnormal MCB/GDP for t ranges from
2012 to 2015. The rollover channel is likely there. Beijing reverted back to the normal
monetary policy after 2010 and imposed strict restrictions on new LGFV loans in the
following years. Those governors who were in their first two-year term as of 2009 would
be in their late term years, and hence would have a strong incentive to comply with
Beijing (by turning to other refinancing sources such as MCBs) for promotion.
    The chosen IV EarlyT ermi,09 may violate the exclusive restriction if those governors
who turned from their early terms in 2009 to their late terms in 2012-2013 and therefore
somehow became aggresive in seeking GDP growth then. We have three answers. First,
though a valid concern, especially for the Chinese economy in its early growth phase
(e.g., Li and Zhou (2005)), this force is greatly attenuated in our sample period after Xi
Jinping took power in 2012 and vowed to address this problem.26 Recent research empha-
sizes the multi-dimensional performance measures for the political tournament among
Chinese local governors (Jia et al. (2017)). Second, our strongest result is in 2014, when
EarlyT ermi,14 has almost zero correlation (0.5%) with EarlyT ermi,09 . Last but not
the least, in our panel regressions, any periodic variation caused by the local governor’s
five-year term will be smoothed over the four-year period 2012-2015, greatly alleviating
the concern of cross-province variations caused by our instrument EarlyT ermi,09 .

4.3.2    Results of IV estimation

Panel A of Table 4 presents the results of the first-stage IV estimation. Consistent with
the demand-side interpretation, provinces with newly appointed governors had fewer
stimulus loans in 2009.27 In the second stage, Panel B reports that the instrumented 2009
abnormal bank loan predicts future province-level MCB issuance in the cross section,
year by year. The coefficients are similar in economic magnitude to those OLS estimates
in Panel A of Table 3 with statistical significance at 5%, indicating little endogeneity
concerns for our main OLS results. The panel regression of the second-stage estimation is
reported in Panel C of Table 4, with similar findings. Overall, the exogeneous variation
captured by the demand-side IV confirms the causal relation between stimulus bank
   26
      See a link in People’s Daily (Beijing’s mouthpiece; http://renshi.people.com.cn/n/2013/1210/c139617-
23793408.html), which delivers a notice from the Party’s organization department that multiple factors
other than economic growth would be taken into consideration for government officials’ promo-
tions. In addition, environmental protection is emphasized when assessing officials’ performance
(http://time.com/3848171/china-environment-promotions/).
   27
      Due to the small-sample-size problem (only 30 provincial-level data points are in the first stage), the
F -test value only clears the Stock-Yogo weak IV test at the 20% level. We acknowledge this potential
issue in interpreting our IV results.

loans in 2009 and MCB issuance in later years.


4.4     Robustness and Further Evidence
We provide further validating evidence for our stimulus-loan-hangover mechanism, and
discuss the economic magnitude of our estimated coefficients.

4.4.1   Placebo test of 2008 bank loan growth

Table 5 presents the placebo test, which considers the 2008Q1-Q3 abnormal bank loans
for each province as the explanatory variable; we focus on the first three quarters of 2008
because the stimulus plan started in November 2008. Similar to the construction of 2009
abnormal bank loans, 2008Q1-Q3 abnormal bank loans in each province are defined as
the 2008 first-three-quarters new bank loans over the GDP of that period, minus their
average over the past four years (2004-2007). The concern about seasonality is minimal
because we are exploiting the cross-province variations in the bank loan growth in the
first three quarters.
    According to our mechanism, the cross-province pattern of 2008Q1-Q3 abnormal
bank loans cannot explain the cross-province pattern of future MCB issuance in 2012-
2015, and this test also helps rule out the standard concern that some pre-trend exists
for the cross-province distribution of 2009 abnormal bank loans. Panel A in Table 5
first replaces the independent variable with the 2008Q1-Q3 abnormal bank loans. As
expected, none of the coefficients in front of the new explanatory variable are significant
for years 2012-2015. Panel B further combines both 2008Q1-Q3 and 2009 abnormal bank
loans in the regression, and provides a formal statistical test for the hypothesis of equal
coefficients in front of two abnormal bank loans. The F -statistics reported in Panel B
reject this hypothesis at the 10% level for 2012 and 2013, the 1% level for 2014, and the
5% level for 2015.

4.4.2   Panel regression results

Table 6 reports the panel regression results when we group togher the MCB-issuance
observations for years 2012-15, with province-level controls that are relevant for the
MCB issuance by local governments. The first column has no controls, whereas in the
second column we include the same control variables as in Panel C of Table 3; both give
a statistically significant coefficient in front of 2009 Abnormal BL/GDP. We include the
year fixed effect in the regression, and report t-statistics double-clustered at province
and year levels (so errors can be correlated for the same province or the same year).

                                            27
    Comparing our panel regression result in Table 6 with those separate regressions in
Table 3, we note that the coefficient for 2009 Abnormal BL/GDP, which is about 0.15,
is relatively stable across all specifications, either panel or year-by-year regression, with
controls or without. This observation lends further support for the robustness of our
result.

4.4.3    MCB issuance by purposes

Recall that we have information on why LGFVs are issuing MCB, because about 80%
of MCB issuances publish prospectuses revealing their issuance purposes (except private
placement notes; see Section 3.3). The MCB sample with prospectus information is
representative of our entire MCB sample.28
   We repeat the same cross-sectional analysis for three different kinds of usage: in-
vestment (M CBinv ), bank loan repayment (M CBrepay ), and others (M CBothers ). We
present the results in the next three columns in Table 6. In our framework, the stimulus-
loan-hangover effect is reflected in M CBrepay and part of M CBinv , as the latter includes
the MCB issuance for continuing investment started in 2009. However, we expect only
M CBrepay to be significant in our regression, a prediction confirmed in Column 3 in
Table 6, because we have controlled local economic activities (e.g., local GDP growth),
which should have absorbed the effect of continuing investment in that region.

4.4.4    China Development Bank and the effect of loan maturity

Provinces with longer maturity loans received in 2009 are likely to face less rollover
pressure in later years. Unfortunately, we do not have provincial-level loan-maturity
data. In the literature, Gao et al. (2018) use loan-level data from the largest 19 banks
(including 18 commercial banks and China Development Bank, hereafter CDB) during
2007-2013H1 for LGFVs with an annual credit line over RMB 50 million.29 According
  28
      The fraction of MCB with prospectus information, i.e., issuances excluding private placement notes,
is 81.6% in RMB value and 79.7% in number of bonds, indicating no systemic size bias in the sample with
prospectus information. And we should find little concern about whether LGFVs use private placement
notes to avoid releasing the loan rollover information, because this type of information is required to be
revealed to private investors anyway even in private placement notes.
   29
      Note that our main explanatory variable, 2009 Abnormal BL/GDP, includes both abnormal LGFV
loans and non-LGFV loans. We could have used the proprietary data from Gao et al. (2018) to construct
2009 Abnormal LGFVBL/GDP. We are grateful to Gao et al. (2018) to share part of the data to construct
this variable, and indeed we obtain similar results reported in Appendix D. However, we decide not to use
the LGFVBL/GDP variable for a few reasons. First, the LGFV dataset in Gao et al. (2018) only covers
loan information of large LGFVs with an annual credit line greater than RMB 50 million. This approach
may introduce bias for the coverage across provinces, because the distribution of LGFV size could be
different for economically developed and under-developed provinces. Second, the dataset includes loan


                                                   28
to their data, the average maturity of 2009 newly issued LGFV loans is 4.1 years for
commercial banks and 7.2 years for CDB. The longer maturity of CDB loans is due
to the different objective of CDB compared to profit-seeking commercial banks: as the
largest one among the three policy banks in China, CDB is established to promote
China’s economic development and improve social welfare, and thus usually provides
longer maturity loans to support local governments’ long-term infrastructure investment.
    This interesting observation implies provinces that received more longer-term CDB
LGFV loans in 2009 should issue fewer MCBs during 2012-2015, conditional on the same
amount of 2009 abnormal bank loans. To test this hypothesis, we include the interaction
between 2009 Abnormal BL/GDP and the fraction of CDB-issued LGFV loans over total
LGFV loans in 2009 in our benchmark regression. As shown in Table 7, the coefficients
of this interaction term are negative and significant for all regressions except for 2012.
This finding supports our story that the hangover effect of 2009 stimulus bank loan is
less severe for local governments with longer-maturity CDB stimulus loans.

4.4.5    Economic magnitude

The last column in Table 6 provides the economic interpretation of our regression co-
efficient. In a crude sense, the coefficient in front of 2009 Abnormal BL/GDP in the
regression of M CBrepay reflects the annual bank loan repayment, which corresponds to
the inverse of loan maturity. To facilitate this interpretation, we make two crucial ad-
justments to our regression. First, for each province, we scale future MCB issuance by
its 2009 GDP, which is the same scaling as the explanatory variable (2009 Abnormal
BL/GDP). Second, ideally, the regression coefficient should be identified from different
bank loans taken by different provinces in 2009, rather than the cross-sectional diver-
gences in provincial GDP levels. To mitigate the GDP-driven divergence of observed ab-
normal BL/GDP, we sort provinces based on their 2009 GDP and take the 10 provinces
that have the most similar level of GDP in 2009.30
    The resulting coefficient for 2009 abnormal bank loans, when explaining the MCB
issuance for bank loan repayment, is 0.15. Taking into account that about half of the
information from the largest 19 banks, but LGFVs in some provinces may prefer borrowing from local
small banks than do LGFVs in other provinces. Third, the LGFV dataset has a short coverage period
from 2007 to 2013H1, which results in less accurate estimates of normal-period loan-to-GDP ratios.
   30
      These 10 provinces are Yunnan, Chongqing, Jilin, Shanxi, Tianjin, Jiangxi, Guangxi, Shan_xi,
Heilongjiang, and Neimenggu. To select the 10 provinces with the most similar level of GDP in 2009,
we first rank all 30 provinces according to their 2009 GDP values. We then examine groups containing
10 sequentially sorted provinces, i.e., group one contains province 1 (highest GDP value) to province
10, group two contains province 2 to province 11, and so on. The selected group has the smallest
“divergence” ratio, which is defined as the difference between the top and the bottom GDP divided by
the mean GDP.

                                                 29
abnormal bank loans go to LGFVs (see Figure 2), this coefficient implies that if an LGFV
borrows an extra dollar in 2009, then after 2012, this LGFV needs to issue 30 cents more
MCB each year to pay back bank loans. This estimate implies an average maturity of
3.5 years, which squares well with the average maturity of 4.1 years of 2009 loans issued
by the largest 19 banks to large LGFVs documented in Gao et al. (2018), as well as the
reported three- to five-year bank loan maturity by Kroeber (2016).

4.4.6    What about MCB pricing?

We have so far focused on the quantity of MCBs, because we are mainly interested in
studying the composition shift of local government debt. A natural question to ask is
whether the extra MCB issuance from provinces with aggressive bank credit in 2009
affects the prices these provinces receive, above and beyond the risk profile of individual
MCBs. However, MCBs are issued and traded in a national-level corporate bond market
(either the interbank market or exchanges), implying little province-level investor seg-
mentation in these markets in China (e.g., WMPs are an important investor for MCBs).
Hence, the standard asset pricing argument suggests that only the risk profiles of indi-
vidual bonds–but not relative quantities of bonds–matter, as they share the same pricing
kernel determined by the aggregate institutional investors in China. Of course, the 2009
Abnormal BL/GDP may help explain the cross-sectional variation of MCB spreads, if it
captures some additional information about the MCB’s default risk beyond those controls
widely used in the existing literature.
    Table 8 investigates this question. In Column 1, we first pool together all observations
in 2012-2015 and regress the amount-weighted issuing yield spread of MCB over CDB
bond yield with similar maturity at year and province level on various risk profiles, i.e.,
credit rating and bond maturity. We also include other variables from Ang et al. (2017)
that potentially capture the repayment ability of local governments. We observe that
credit rating stands out as the most significant driver of MCB yield spreads.31 Column
2 then includes the 2009 Abnormal BL/GDP as an extra explanatory variable, which
is insignificant, with no effect on adjusted R-square. Columns 3 to 6 repeat the same
  31
     Two points are worth highlighting. First, in China, the risk-free benchmark with the same maturity
is the bond yield offered by CDB (rather than that of Treasury bond due to differential tax treatment).
Second, credit rating stands out as the most important and significant variable that explains MCB-
issuance yield spread in Table 8, which is perhaps a result of some peculiar institutional practice in
China. Starting in June 2010, the National Association of Financial Market Institutional Investors (the
self-regulatory body of the interbank market) publishes the “guidance curve” for corporate bond yield
as a function of bond rating, which is closely followed by LGFVs that are issuing MCBs in the interbank
market. This anchoring explains the almost perfect one-to-one relationship between MCB ratings and
their issuance yields. In unreported results, we find that rating along generates an adjusted R2 of 73%
in the panel pricing regression.

                                                  30
exercise for each year and reach the same conclusion. This null result even holds for
secondary market MCB spreads.32
    What do we learn from this exercise? As we emphasized, if ratings and other charac-
teristics of MCBs already fully capture their default risk, we indeed should expect a null
result for our 2009 Abnormal BL/GDP variable. This null result also suggests the supply
side might play a significant role during the 2009 stimulus expansion, as higher 2009 Ab-
normal BL/GDP does not seem to hurt the municipal’s repayment ability (conditional
on other measures of local government fiscal conditions.)


4.5     Link to Shadow Banking in China
This section attempts to connect the non-bank debts on the liability side of local gov-
ernments to the recent surging shadow banking activities in China. We approach this
link from the following two angles.
    The first is the off-balance-sheet Trust loans (including entrusted and trust loans).
Often, these deals are arranged via banks to move the resulting loans out of their balance
sheets. Since 2011, the Statistics and Analysis Department at the PBoC has started
releasing the quarterly statistics of Aggregate Financing to the Real Economy, which
measures the total amount of financing the real economy receives from the financial
system in a given period. This measure is divided into four categories: on-balance-sheet
financing (e.g., bank loans), off-balance-sheet financing (e.g., trust and entrusted loans),
direct financing (e.g., bond and equity issuance), and others. Historical statistics dating
back to 2002 became available in 2012, and more importantly, the PBoC started releasing
these statistics at the province level in 2013.
    The second angle is the so-called WMPs (i.e., Wealth Management Products), which
are often sold by China’s commercial banks to unsophisticated household investors at a
rate higher than the deposit rate. Banks then turn around to lend the proceeds to firms,
or invest them in corporate bonds or other assets, including WMPs themselves. This
activity is widely recognized as a form of regulatory arbitrage, because these transactions
are considered to be off-balance sheet and hence face much less regulatory restrictions
than traditional banks (e.g., Acharya et al. (2017); Hachem and Song (2017a)). Another
reason WMPs are considered the symbol of China’s shadow banking activities is their
potentially sophisticated structure, especially when financial institutions develop WMPs
  32
     Results are not reported here but are available upon request. The sample for the regression with
secondary market prices is much smaller (about 37% of sample with issuing spreads), as we need to drop
MCBs without any transaction due to poor secondary market liquidity, and MCBs with special terms.

together with Trust or other financial innovations.33
    Trust loans and WMPs, which overlap each other to a great extent, are the largest
two components of China’s shadow banking sector. According to the PBoC, the notional
outstanding of trust loans and WMPs accout for 73% of the shadow banking sector
in China.34 Therefore, understanding the role played of Trust loans and WMPs in
local government financing activities, including the issuance of MCBs, is crucial for
understanding the fast growth of China’s shadow banking sector after 2012.

4.5.1    Shadow banking activities and local government non-bank debt

Panel A of Figure 7 plots the new Trust loans and increase of WMPs over 2004-2016,
together with new bank loans, all scaled by GDP. Both Trust loans and WMPs are
growing much faster than the GDP growth starting in 2012, a pattern consistent with
the mechanism proposed by this paper. At the end of 2015, the magnitude of these two
shadow banking activities becomes comparable to the traditional on-balance-sheet credit
extended by banks.35
   Connecting China’s shadow banking activities back to local government debt, Panel
B of Figure 7 plots the fraction of local government non-bank debt, which is the sum of
MCB, munibond, and Trust in Figure 4, relative to the sum of three items in the Aggre-
gate Financing to the Real Economy that proxy for shadow banking activities in China:
Trust loans (trust and entrusted loans) as mentioned above, undiscounted bankers’ ac-
ceptances, and corporate bonds.36 We observe a steady growth of local government
non-bank debt as a fraction of the shadow banking balance in China, starting from a
  33
      See “Four Fresh Worries About China’s Shadow Banking System” by Bloomberg, September 7,
2016. Note that because WMPs do not represent the ultimate financing received by the real sector, it
is not one of the items of the Aggregate Financing to the Real Economy mentioned above.
   34
      As of the end of 2017, the off-balance-sheet non-guaranteed WMP outstanding was RMB 22.2
trillion, the trust loan outstanding was RMB 21.9 trillion, and the notional outstanding of asset
management plans from securities companies and mutual fund subsidaries was RMB 16.4 trillion
(http://www.scio.gov.cn/xwfbh/gbwxwfbh/xwfbh/rmyh/Document/1628765/1628765.htm). Another
estimate by Moody’s attributes 74% of China’s shadow banking to trust loans (34%) and WMPs (40%);
see “China Takes ’More Flexible Way’ on Wealth Products Rule Changes” by Bloomberg, July 23, 2018.
   35
      After 2013, we observe some sharp decline of new Trust loans but a rapid rise of new WMPs. This is a
result of substitution from Trust loans toward WMPs after the China Banking Regulatory Commission
tightened the regulation on trust products in 2014 (the 99th Document “Directive Opinions on the
Regulation of Trust Companies’ Risk Management,” May 8, 2014, by the CBRC), and it is interesting
to see the similar magnitude between the decline of Trust and the rise of WMPs in Panel A post 2014.
   36
      Undiscounted bankers’ acceptances, which are only about 2.5% of Aggregate Financing to the Real
Economy (5.2% of GDP) in 2016, represent contingent credit to the real sector, in the sense that firms
can use bankers’ acceptances as collateral to obtain loans from banks (which then will be recorded as
on-balance bank loans). We also include aggregate outstanding corporate bonds in our calculation,
which are about 11.5% of Aggregate Financing to the Real Economy (24.1% of GDP) in 2016, as MCBs
in local government debt are counted as part of corporate bonds.

Figure 7: Shadow Banking Activities and Local Government Non-bank Debt.
Panel A plots new trust loans (entrusted and trust loans) and change in WMPs over GDP
from 2004 to 2016. The aggregate new bank loans over GDP is also plotted for comparison.
Panel B plots local government non-bank debt balance as a fraction of China’s shadow banking
balance from 2008 to 2016. Local government non-bank debt is the sum of MCBs, munibonds,
and local government trust balance. Shadow banking balance is proxied by three items in
Aggregate Financing to the Real Economy, including trust loans (trust and entrusted loans),
undiscounted bank’s acceptable bills, and corporate bonds. The annual WMP balance data
are from China Commercial Banks’ Wealth Management Products Annual Report issued by
China Banking Wealth Management Registration System. The Aggregate Financing to the
Real Economy by category data are from the PBoC.

negligible 1.5% in 2008 to 22% in 2014 and 48% in 2016. This finding suggests that local
government non-bank debt is crucial to understand the recent surge of shadow banking
activities in China.

4.5.2    Bank loan wanes and trust loans waxes

Panel A in Figure 7 presents the similar time-series pattern of “bank loan down and
shadow banking up” when stepping outside the box of local governments. We further
perform a cross-sectional test in this subsection, following the same idea as in Section
4 but replacing MCB issuance by new entrusted loans at the corresponding province
(which might go to LGFVs). Because we do not have provincial information for entrusted
loans before 2013, and because entrusted loans were tiny before 2008 anyway, we take
the entrusted loans in future years (2013-2015) as “abnormal” and scale them by the
corresponding provincial GDP directly as the dependent variables.
     Table 9 shows that the stimulus-loan-hangover effect holds for entrusted loans, both
each year and over the period of 2013-2015, implying that areas with more stimulus
bank loans in 2009 ended up engaging with more entrusted loans in later years. The
magnitude identified from this regression is greater, suggesting entrusted loans are more
important than MCBs as financing tools at the economy-wide level. Column 6 further
provides a placebo test, which shows that the 2009 Abnormal BL/GDP cannot explain
the cross-sectional pattern of new bank loans in later years. This finding is consistent
with the premise of our paper, which says that China’s credit policy reverted back to
normal in later years and induced shadow banking to fill the gap.
     We perform the cross-sectional test for entrusted loans, not trust loans. Magnitude-
wise, over the past decade, each year more new entrusted loans than new trust loans
are extended. At the end of 2016, the newly issued entrusted loans are about RMB 2.3
trillion (3.1% of GDP), compared to trust loans being RMB 0.9 trillion (1.2% of GDP).
But we pick entrusted loans for our cross-sectional test for a deeper economic reason. As
we discussed at the beginning of Section 4, the way these statistics are reported is that
the region of a trust loan is where the trust gets financed (i.e., location of source), not
where the trust funds go (i.e., location of use).37 Our mechanism relies on identifying
the location of fund use, and hence this source-use mismatch of locations is devastating
for our purpose. Entrusted loans suffer the same problem, but it is much less severe,
  37
     For trust data from Aggregate Financing to the Real Economy, we checked with the Statistics and
Analysis Department at the PBoC and found that they collected the data from the reporting of local
CBRCs, which receive the trust prospectus information from trust companies that are geographically
located in a province. As a result, the provincial trust data only reflect the fund-raising location instead
of the fund-using location.


                                                    34
because entrusted loans are firm-to-firm credit, and these firms tend to be intermediated
by the same bank. Given that banks typically finance local firms only (easier monitoring,
less information asymmetry), the location of source should be more correlated with the
location of use. Indeed, Allen et al. (2018) find that entrusted loans tend to be provided
to firms within the same area in China.

4.5.3   WMPs invested in MCB via interbank market

MCBs, as one type of corporate bond, are mostly traded by qualified financial institutions
(including banks, mutual funds, insurance companies, etc.) in China’s interbank market.
We now give a brief institutional background on this financial market, which has grown
rapidly in recent years and had become the third largest in the world by May 2016,
behind only the U.S. and Japan (Borst (2016)).
    Two major classes of bonds are traded in China’s interbank market. Government
bonds and bonds issued by policy banks are considered riskless and are often called
“interest rate bonds,” whereas corporate bonds issued by non-financial firms are called
“credit bonds” for their potential credit risk. MCBs become interesting because they sit
between these two categories. From their name, they have the feature of being “interest
rate bonds,” which enjoy the implicit backing of the corresponding local government (thus
the word municipal), but in a strict legal sense, they are issued by the LGFV entities,
which are just corporations like other credit-bond issuers (thus the word corporate).
What is more, MCBs represent a significant fraction of credit bonds in China: they
accounted for 36.3% of total credit bonds at the end of 2016. This fraction has been
rising dramatically over the past several years, from only 12.8% at the end of 2008. The
fast growth of MCBs is likely to be explained by the stimulus-loan-hangover effect.
    WMPs, sold by commercial banks in China, are widely reported to be aggressively
investing in MCBs. Thanks to the hide-and-seek games between the regulators and
financial institutions (outside and inside the interbank market), the list of qualified
participants in China’s bond market has been in flux over the past few years. In February
2014, in response to the rapidly growing demand of investment in the interbank market,
the PBoC opened the interbank market access to 16 large commercial banks for their own
WMPs. But unqualified smaller banks can easily circumvent this regulation by engaging
with the “counterpart” business with qualified large banks. Two years later in May 2016,
facing more and more complicated financing structures created to channel WMPs into the
interbank market, the PBoC removed the previous restrictions and allowed all qualified
institutional investors, including WMPs and trust companies, to participate directly in
the interbank market and invest in corporate bonds. This deregulation propelled another

round of expansion of WMPs and “innovative” trading strategies, as WMPs started Repo
transactions with embedded leverage for high returns.38 This investment behavior soon
caught the attention of many economists and regulators, triggering another round of
regulation by the PBoC to include the off-balance-sheet WMPs in its Macro Prudential
Assessment (MPA) system in early 2017.
    Gauging the risk exposure of shadow banking activities is always a challenge, and
there is no difference for measuring risk exposure of WMPs, which in principal could
invest in everything, including other WMPs. Fortunately, since 2014, the China Banking
Wealth Management Registration System has started issuing annual official statistics on
WMPs. Combining these annual reports together with the rating information of MCB,
we estimate the MCB holdings by WMPs, which are plotted in Figure 8 together with
the corresponding MCB outstanding balance.
    Figure 8 shows that WMPs are mainly investing in high-quality MCBs, as almost all
of them are above AA-rating. The official reports suggest that about 40% of MCBs were
held by WMPs by the end of 2014; this fraction rose to more than 60% by the end of
2016. Nevertheless, these numbers are quite likely to represent an underestimation of the

banking-system.



                                                                   36
extent to which WMPs are investing in MCB, because before the May 2016 deregulation,
managers of WMPs (raised by some small banks) commonly invested these funds in
some Trusts, which lend the money to another bigger bank that then eventually invests
in MCB. From reading the way the statistics are reported, the Annual Report ignores
this indirect exposure of WMPs in MCB (hence introducing a downward bias of our
estimate). One estimate from an anecdotal but trustworthy source is that about 70% of
MCBs are invested by WMPs.

4.5.4   Corporate bond and shadow banking in China

Corporate bonds are commonly viewed as transparent financial market instruments, and
financing through corporate bonds is not classified as shadow banking activity. However,
it is not the case in China. WMPs, the most important component of the shadow banking
sector, are not the ultimate user of funds and thus are not included in the PBoC’s
Aggregate Social Financing to the Real Economy. Instead, WMPs channel a significant
amount of funds into China’s bond market. Lei et al. (2018) find that RMB 7 trillion,
or 38%, out of the RMB 18 trillion outstanding balance of corporate bonds is funded by
WMPs at the end of 2017; this number was 40% in 2016. More importantly, as explained
toward the end of the previous section, these numbers are likely to be biased downward.
     The trend of the increasing share of bond market funding being channelled through
WMPs and thus the fast growth of China’s bond market after 2012 was initially encour-
aged by regulators. Worried about WMPs’ increasing investments in non-standard debt
assets that were essentially a disguised form of on-the-balance-sheet loans of the WMP
issuing bank, the CBRC issued the “Document 8” in March 2013 restricting WMPs’
investment in non-standard debt assets, which pushed WMPs to allocate more funds
toward standard debt assets such as corporate bonds. A few years later, the asset man-
agement industry, mainly composed of WMPs and trust loans, grew into a giant with
sophisticated multi-layer structures, essentially working as shadow intermediaries that
channel funds from capital markets to the real economy.
     However, the growing complexity of the shadow banking sector and the increased
number of corporate bond defaults in 2015 and 2016 raised a red flag for their potential
systemic risk and resulting instability of the economy. Starting in 2017, the central gov-
ernment made regulatory changes in the asset management industry, including delever-
aging and tight restriction on WMP issuance. Specifically, the new asset management
regulatory framework was taken into discussion in February 2017, and the “Guidance
Opinions Concerning Standardization of Asset Management Operations by Financial In-
stitutions” was released to solicit public opinion in November of that year. Finally, on

                                           37
April 27, 2018, the new set of regulations on the asset management industry was officially
launched, aiming to discipline the shadow banking sector by the end of 2020.
     The policy change has a profound impact on China’s shadow banking sector. The
outstanding WMP is RMB 29.54 trillion as of the end of 2017, which is similar to 29.05
trillion in 2016 (by contrast, the WMP balance was 23.67 trillion at the end of 2015).
Consistent with WMPs as the major funding channel of corporate bonds, during the
same period, the Chinese corporate bonds sector shrank dramatically in 2017: the net
aggregate social financing from corporate bonds was RMB 0.45 trillion in 2017 compared
to RMB 3.04 trillion in 2016. We see a smiliar pattern for the MCB market: the
percentage of MCBs held by WMPs dropped to 59.4% in 2017 from 61.5% in 2016, and
the RMB value of WMPs’ holding in MCBs only increased slightly to 4.23 trillion from
4.19 trillion. Overall, the regulatory restriction on China’s shadow banking activities
(especially WMPs) has a direct effect on the corporate bond market, supporting the
perspective that the relatively transparent corporate bond sector is indeed an integrated
part of the shadow banking system in China.39


5      Discussions and Concluding Remarks
This paper paints a broad picture that connects the 2007/08 financial crisis in the US, the
2009 four-trillion-yuan stimulus loans in China, and the surging shadow banking activi-
ties in China after 2012. Although both WMPs and Trust loans existed in China’s finan-
cial markets before 2008, and increased slightly during the period of the 2009 stimulus
plan, our perspective highlighting the stimulus-loan-hangover effect helps us understand
why these activities experienced “barbarous growth” after 2012.
    We conclude this paper by providing discussions on the potential systemic risk of
local government debt, some interesting political economics on the marketization of the
financial system, and the process of interest rate liberalization in China.
    Systemic risk of local governments debt. The potential systemic risk of China’s
local-government debt is an extremely important question of broad interest, but it is not
the focus of this paper. Local governments have been relying heavily on land sales to
balance their budget (e.g., Zhang and Barnett (2014); Ambrose et al. (2015)), which is
unlikely to be sustainable in the long run. Of course, the issue is more than the simple
default risk. These debts are backed by governments at different authority levels, explic-
  39
    Bian et al. (2018) find that even the more transparent stock market is affected by the shadow
banking sector, consistent with the observation in Ehlers et al. (2018) that funds raised by WMPs and
trust loans are channelled to the equity market to some extent.



                                                 38
itly or implicitly. The market participants, whether those naive WMP investors who do
not even know what they are buying or sophisticated bond fund managers who study the
default risk of LGFVs extensively, all have “bail-out” expectations, implying that either
banks (which sold WMPs) or local governments (which sold MCBs) are bearing the loss
ultimately. In 2015, the Ministry of Finance started the “swap program” that allows
local governments to issue munibonds to replace their maturing “qualified” debt, which
largely excludes the “contingent bailout liability” in Table 1. The widespread under-
standing is that these munibonds are ultimately fully backed by the central government,
which have plenty of resources to absorb the losses. This significantly reduces, though
far from eliminates, the uncertainty of the local governments’ repayment ability and the
default risk of MCBs.40
    On the other hand, the potential default risk of local governments could be systemic
because, as explained, China’s local government debts are either hidden on the banks’
off-balance sheets, such as MCBs through WMPs, or even directly sitting on their on-
balance sheets. Intriguingly, about 87% of munibonds with full government guarantees
were directly held by banks as of 2016. Gao et al. (2018) provide direct evidence of
LGFVs defaulted on their bank loans before 2014. The situation is likely to be worse
after 2014, as the “swap program” mentioned above has severed certain MCBs from
explicit government guarantees, and it is widely believed that unprofitable LGFVs will
experience difficulties in repaying their maturing MCBs in the near term. This is exactly
why market participants and regulators are keeping a close eye on the recent development
of the local government debt in China.
    The political economics of regulation and market forces. Over the past 40
years, China has undoubtedly made tremendous progress in building a market-based
economy. Unfortunately, due to the history of being an economy with central planning,
almost all economic activities, including LGFVs and MCBs, are linked back to certain
regulations and/or the intentions of regulators.
    We emphasize that regulations themselves are endogenous, and mostly are responses
to the underlying market forces. Consider the evolution of regulations and the actual
implementations when dealing with the explosive growth of debt taken by LGFVs af-
ter 2009. In June 2010, the State Council issued the No. 19 Document on LGFVs,
underscoring the importance of regulating and monitoring the mounting debt raised by
LGFVs. The market responded by little MCB issuance during 2010-11, as shown in
  40
     One upper-bound estimate of the default risk is from the “contingent bailout liability,” which consists
of about 24% of total debt standing at mid-2013 (Table 1). The “bail-out” expectation can be fulfilled as
long as local governments themselves are able to cover the potential losses of these “contingent bailout
liability,” which is unqualified for the “swap program” of munibonds.


                                                    39
Figure 5. But MCBs grew even faster starting in 2014. Why? It is not because the
regulators deemed the LGFVs to be safer after 2014. In fact, as mentioned in Section
2.2.2, the State Council-issued No. 43 Document in September 2014 prohibited local
governments from raising debt via LGFVs, and ordered local governments to swap exist-
ing debt with more transparent munibonds. Implementing the swap program has been
far from smooth. The budget of munibonds for 2015 was preapproved at the end of 2014,
and in 2015, it became apparent that the preapproved amount was not enough to absorb
all the refinancing needs of LGFVs. Beijing in turn issued other “conflicting” regulation
changes that aimed to enable the LGFVs to borrow via MCBs.41
    Our paper delivers a fresh view on why regulators successfully suppressed MCB
growth around 2010 but somehow failed to do so after 2013: LGFVs had to roll over
their bank loans due around 2013 and 2014, a market force that demanded full respect
and had to be released one way or another. Putting these debts back into the banks’
balance sheets and finding support from non-bank (or even shadow banking) financing
sources requires some trade-off, and Beijing seems to have picked the latter.
    Interest rate liberalization. Our paper offers a perspective on understanding the
pace of interest rate liberalization in China. China’s interest rate liberalization can be
traced back to the establishment of the interbank market in 1996, which in early 2007
launched Shanghai Interbank Offered Rate (Shibor), serving as the benchmark rate in
China’s capital market. Banks’ lending rates started a slow reform around 1998-99,
and experienced several aggressive deregulating steps thanks to China joining WTO in
2001. Similar to other developed countries such as the U.S. and Japan, deposit rate
liberalization is the last step of the marketization of interest rates in China. Although
the lower limit of the deposit rate was removed in 2004, the upper limit was tightly
controlled until 2012, when banks were allowed to raise their deposit rates up to 1.1
times the base rate set by the PBoC. The upper limit was further raised to 1.2 times in
2014 and 1.5 times in 2015, and fully removed in October 2015. Beijing also established
the deposit insurance scheme in May 2015, aiming to provide the same level-playing field
for small- and medium-sized banks against their Big-Four peers.
    We highlight that the pace of the liberalization process has taken up tremendously
since 2012, especially for the deposit rate liberalization. From the perspective of our
paper, such acceleration in liberalization can be thought of an unintended (but good)
  41
    For instance, the interbank market relaxed the restrictions on eligible LGFVs to issue MCB in early
2015; similar relaxations were reflected in a series of documents released by the National Development
and Reform Commission (the regulatory body of MCBs traded in the interbank market) and Ministry
of Finance. For a complete list of regulations and documents released after 2014, see “MCB Regulation,
Review, and Outlook” by Qiming Liu in PengYuan Research, February 2016.

consequence of the 2009 stimulus plan. The resulting growth of WMPs starting 2012
offered households an attractive savings vehicle, with market-based interest rates that are
much higher than those offered by bank deposits. This imposes an unprecedented threat
to the traditional banking sector, which has been heavily subsidized by cheap deposits
for more than half a decade. Facing heavy legacy regulations, individual banks competed
with each other by selling WMPs to households in order to expand their off-balance-sheet
activities.42 On the positive side, this process benefits not only households, but also those
small and medium-sized banks that are now able to compete with the Big Four banks
in China. However, these off-balance-sheet activities seem to be overly aggressive, and
regulators realize that the market force has unleashed itself fully so that it is the right
timing to expedite the process of interest rate liberalization.

    Acharya et al. (2017) and Hachem and Song (2017a) offer interesting studies on competition within
the banking sector as well as its implications on WMPs issuance before and around 2009. For later
years, see a Financial Times article “China takes step to financial reform” by Anderlini and Hook, dated
July 19, 2013.

Table 3: The Effects of 2009 Abnormal Bank Loan on Future Municipal Cor-
porate Bond Issuance, Year-by-Year Regressions
This table reports the year-by-year regressions of 2012-2015 provincial municipal corpo-
rate bond (MCB) issuance on 2009 bank loan. The dependent variable is the abnormal
MCB issuance scaled by GDP in years 2012-2015 compared to the average value between
2004 and 2008. Annual MCB issuance at the provincial/regional level are aggregated over
individual MCB bonds. The independent variable is the abnormal new bank loan scaled
by GDP in 2009 compared to the average value between 2004 and 2008. Panels A and B
report the cross-regional and the cross-provincial results, respectively. Panel C reports
the cross-provincial results with control variables, including abnormal fiscal deficit (FD)
scaled by GDP, abnormal fixed-asset investment (FAI) scaled by GDP, abnormal local
government land sale income (LS) scaled by fiscal revenue (FR), GDP growth, and the
corruption index constructed by Ang et al. (2016). Data about bank loans are obtained
from the PBoC, data about MCBs are obtained from WIND, and data about control
variables are obtained from the National Bureau of Statistics of China. Heteroscedastic-
ity consistent t-statistics are reported in parentheses. ***, **, and * indicate significance
at the 1%, 5%, and 10% levels, respectively.

                                 Table 4: IV Estimation
This table reports the results of IV regressions. EarlyT erm09 is used as the instrumental
variable for the 2009 abnormal new bank loan scaled by GDP. EarlyT erm09 equals 1
if a province governor was in the first two years of his governor tenure as of 2009,
and 0 otherwise. Panel A reports the results of the first-stage estimation. Panels B
and C report the results of the year-by-year and panel second-stage estimations. For
panel regressions, control variables include abnormal fiscal deficit (FD) scaled by GDP,
abnormal fixed asset investment (FAI) scaled by GDP, abnormal local government land
sale income (LS) scaled by fiscal revenue (FR), GDP growth, and the corruption index
constructed by Ang et al. (2017). Heteroscedasticity-consistent t-statistics are reported
in parentheses for Panels A and B. Heteroscedasticity-consistent t-statistics clustered
by province and year are reported in parentheses for Panel C. ***, **, and * indicate
significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% levels, respectively.

Table 5: The Effects of 2009 Abnormal Bank Loan on Future Municipal Cor-
porate Bond Issuance, Placebo Tests
This table reports the year-by-year regressions of 2012-2015 provincial municipal cor-
porate bond (MCB) issuance in 2008 first-to-third-quarter bank loans. The dependent
variable is the abnormal MCB issuance scaled by GDP in years 2012-2015 compared
to the average value between 2004 and 2008. Annual MCB issuances at the provin-
cial/regional level are aggregated over individual MCB bonds. The independent variable
is the abnormal new bank loan scaled by GDP in 2008 Q1-Q3 compared to the aver-
age value between 2004 and 2007. Panel A reports the cross-provincial results of 2008
Q1-Q3 abnormal bank loan. Panel B reports the cross-provincial results of both 2009
and 2008 Q1-Q3 abnormal bank loans, where the F -stat and the associated p-values
for the hypothesis of equal coefficients of 2009 bank loan and 2008Q1-Q3 bank loan
are also reported. Data about bank loan are obtained from the PBoC and data about
MCBs are obtained from WIND. Heteroscedasticity-consistent t-statistics are reported
in parentheses. ***, **, and * indicate significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% levels,
respectively.

Table 6: The Effects of 2009 Abnormal Bank Loan on Future Municipal Cor-
porate Bond Issuance, Panel Regressions
This table reports the panel regressions of 2012-2015 provincial municipal corporate
bond (MCB) issuance on 2009 bank loan. The dependent variable is the abnormal MCB
issuance scaled by GDP in years 2012-2015 compared to the average value between 2004
and 2008. Annual MCB issuances at the provincial level are aggregated over individual
MCB bonds. The independent variable is the abnormal new bank loan scaled by GDP
in 2009 compared to the average value between 2004 and 2008. Control variables include
abnormal fiscal deficit (FD) scaled by GDP, abnormal fixed-asset investment (FAI) scaled
by GDP, abnormal local government land sale income (LS) scaled by fiscal revenue (FR),
GDP growth, and the corruption index constructed by Ang et al. (2016). MCBrepay
indicates the proceeds of MCB that are used to pay back bank loans. MCBinv indicates
the proceeds of MCB that are used for investment. MCBother indicates the proceeds
of MCB that are used for other purposes. MCB10    repay includes those ten provinces with
the most similar value of GDP in 2009, including Yunnan, Chongqing, Jilin, Shanxi,
Tianjin, Jiangxi, Guangxi, Shan Xi, Heilongjiang, and Neimenggu. The denominator to
scale MCB10repay in 2012-2015 is the 2009 GDP in each of those 10 provinces. Data about
bank loan are obtained from the PBoC, data about MCBs are obtained from WIND,
and data about control variables are obtained from the National Bureau of Statistics of
China. Year fixed effects are included. Heteroscedasticity-consistent t-statistics clustered
by province and year are reported in parentheses. ***, **, and * indicate significance at
the 1%, 5%, and 10% levels, respectively.

Table 7: The Effects of 2009 Loan Maturity on Future Municipal Corporate
Bond Issuance
This table reports the year-by-year and panel regressions of 2012-2015 provincial munic-
ipal corporate bond (MCB) issuance on 2009 bank loan and the cross-term with LGFV
loan fraction of China Development Bank (CDB). The dependent variable is the abnor-
mal MCB issuance scaled by GDP in years 2012-2015 compared to the average value
between 2004 and 2008. Annual MCB issuances at the provincial level are aggregated
over individual MCB bonds. The independent variable is the abnormal new bank loan
scaled by GDP in 2009 compared to the average value between 2004 and 2008, the frac-
tion of the LGFV loan from CDB in 2009, and the cross-term of the two variables. Data
about bank loans are obtained from the PBoC, data about MCBs are obtained from
WIND, and the data about the CDB LGFV loan fraction are from Gao et al. (2018).
Heteroscedasticity-consistent t-statistics are reported in parentheses for regressions (1)
and (4). Heteroscedasticity-consistent t-statistics clustered by province and year are re-
ported in parentheses for regression (5). ***, **, and * indicate significance at the 1%,
5%, and 10% levels, respectively.

Table 8: The Effects of 2009 Abnormal Bank Loan on Municipal Corporate
Bond Excess Yield Spread
This table reports the regressions of 2012-2015 municipal corporate bond (MCB) excess
issuing spread on 2009 bank loan. The dependent variable is the amount-weighted spread
of the MCB-issuance rate over the yield of China Development Bank bond with the
same maturity for each year and province. The independent variable is the abnormal
new bank loan scaled by GDP in 2009 compared to the average value between 2004
and 2008. Control variables include bond rating, bond maturity, abnormal fiscal deficit
(FD) scaled by GDP, abnormal fixed-asset investment (FAI) scaled by GDP, abnormal
local government land sale income (LS) scaled by fiscal revenue (FR), and GDP growth.
Data about bank loan are obtained from the the PBoC, data about MCBs are obtained
from WIND, and data about control variables are obtained from the National Bureau of

          For Online Publication: Appendix
   This Internet Appendix consists of four sections. In Section A, we describe how
we estimate the sector-level abnormal bank loans extended in 2009. In Section B, we
provide data-construction details of total local government debt balance and its four
major components. In Section C, we describe how we estimate the investment of wealth
management products in municipal corporate bonds. In Section D, additional results are
presented.


A     Estimates of Sector-Level Abnormal Bank Loans
      in 2009
We estimate that the 2009 stimulus caused RMB 4.7 trillion extra bank loans to the
entire Chinese economy, among which, about 2.3 trillion went to LGFVs, about RMB
1 trillion went to the non-residential sector (but excluding LGFVs), and the remaining
RMB 1.4 trillion went to the residential sector. Note that the estimated abnormal LGFV
bank loans (i.e., 2.3 trillion) square well with Gao et al. (2018), who have detailed loan-
level information for LGFVs from the largest 19 banks (18 commercial banks and China
Development Bank) in 2009. Finally, with the help of the data in Gao et al. (2018), we
estimate that for the RMB 2.3 trillion in bank loans to LGFVs, RMB 2.06 trillion came
from commercial banks and RMB 0.24 trillion came from policy banks.
     The detailed steps to construct the above estimates are as follows. First, the total
abnormal new bank loans (RMB 4.7 trillion) is the difference between the actual 2009
new bank loan (9.6 trillion) and the estimated 2009 normal new bank loans (RMB
4.9 trillion, based on the average BL/GDP ratio in 2004-2008). Following the same
approach, the 2009 abnormal new non-residential bank loan is estimated at RMB 3.3
trillion, implying an abnormal residential new bank loan of RMB 1.4 trillion (4.7-3.3).
Second, we decompose this RMB 3.3 trillion number further into LGFVs and the rest.
To this end, we estimate the 2009 normal new bank loan to LGFVs to be RMB 0.75
trillion (the ratio of LGFV new bank loan over new bank loan in 2008 multiplied by
the estimated 2009 normal new bank loan; the 2008 LGFV new bank loan is based on
the 2010 national audit report and WIND). Taking this number out of the 2009 actual
LGFV bank loan 3.05 trillion (Bai et al. (2016), p.14), we estimate the 2009 abnormal


                                            56
LGFV bank loan to be RMB 2.3 trillion (3.05-0.75), which then leaves the 2009 abnormal
non-residential (excluding LGFV) new bank loan to be 1 trillion (3.3-2.3).


B      Construction of Local Government Debt Balance

B.1      Total local government debt balance
    1. The numbers as of the end of 2010, 2012, and 2013H1 are provided by two auditing
       reports (2011 and 2013) on local government debt issued by the National Audit
       Office (NAO).

    2. The numbers as of the end of 2008 and 2009 are calculated according to local
       government debt growth given in Figure 2 of the 2011 NAO report.

    3. The number as of the end of 2014 is from the proposal to the State of Council
       submitted by the Ministry of Finance (MOF), which says that by the end of 2014,
       the local governments’ full obligation was RMB 15.4 trillion and the total local
       government guaranteed/contingent liability was RMB 8.6 trillion.

    4. The numbers as of the end of 2015/2016 are calculated according to the 2015/2016
       local government full obligation of RMB 16/17.1 trillion and the 2014 fraction of
       the local governments’ full obligation as the total local government debt.

    5. The numbers as of the end of 2011 and 2013 are interpolated assuming the growth
       rate of local government debt to be constant between 2010 and 2012, and between
       2012 and 2014.


B.2      Local government bank loan balance
    1. The numbers as of the end of 2010 and June 2013 are from the two NAO reports.

    2. The numbers as of the end of 2008, 2009, 2011, and 2012 are adjusted from the
       local government financing vehicle (LGFV) bank loan balance data available from
       WIND.

       (a) The ratio between the average 2010 and June 2013 local government bank
           loan balance from the NAO reports, and the average 2010 and June 2013
           LGFV bank loan balance is used as the adjustment factor.



                                           57
      (b) LGFV bank loan balance data are from WIND as of the end of 2008, 2009,
          and 2012.
      (c) The LGFV bank loan balance as of the end of 2011 is interpolated, assuming
          the growth rate between 2010 and 2012 to be constant.

  3. The numbers as of the end of 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016 are adjusted from the
     LGFV bank loan balance estimated using China Construction Bank’s (CCB) LGFV
     balance.

      (a) The country-wide LGFV bank loan balance in the commercial bank measure-
          ment as of the end of 2013-2016 is estimated using CCB’s LGFV bank loan
          balance and CCB’s bank loan balance share as of all commercial banks.
      (b) The growth rates of the country-wide LGFV bank loan balance in the com-
          mercial bank measurement are used to estimate the LGFV bank loan balance
          in the WIND measurement from 2013 to 2016.
      (c) The numbers of the local government bank loan balance as of the end of 2013-
          2016 are estimated from section 3(b) LGFV bank loan balance adjusted by
          section 2(a) adjustment factor.


B.3    Municipal corporate bond balance
  1. Individual municipal corporate bonds, both outstanding and matured, are aggre-
     gated over their corresponding outstanding periods to calculate the MCB balance
     as of the end of each year.


B.4    Municipal bond balance
  1. Individual municipal bonds, both outstanding and matured, are aggregated over
     their corresponding outstanding periods to calculate the municipal bond balance
     as of the end of each year.


B.5    Local government trust financing balance
Municipality-Trust cooperation balance data are reported officially by China Trustee
Association. We assume that the fraction of Municipality-Trust cooperation over total
Trust loans remains constant over years.

  1. Quarterly Municipality-Trust cooperation balance data are available since 2010.

                                         58
    2. As of June 30, 2013, the NAO report shows that the total local government trust
       financing balance is RMB 1.43 trillion and the Municipality-Trust cooperation
       balance is RMB 0.8 trillion. The adjustment factor is therefore 1.43/0.8 = 1.77.

    3. The numbers of Municipality-Trust cooperation balance as of the end of 2010-2016
       are multiplied by 1.77 to reflect the total local government trust financing balance.


C      Construction of Wealth Management Product In-
       vestment in Municipal Corporate Bonds
    1. Total MCB balance by rating (AAA, AA+, AA, and ≤AA) is aggregated from
       individual MCBs using bonds rating at issuance. If a bond does not have rating
       information at issuance, we use its issuer’s rating at issuance as a proxy. Only 1.57%
       of MCB in terms of RMB issuance value do not have any rating information.

    2. Total credit bond balance by rating (AAA, AA+, AA, and ≤AA) is from China
       Central Depository and Clearing Corporation, downloaded from WIND.

    3. Credit bond balance by rating (AAA, AA+, AA, and ≤AA) held by WMPs is from
       China Commercial Bank Wealth Management Products Annual Reports issued by
       China Banking Wealth Management Registration System.

    4. Fractions of credit bond balance held by WMPs by rating are calculated from
       numbers in 2 and 3.

    5. Assuming that WMPs hold MCBs with the same percentage as WMPs hold all
       credit bonds, we estimate the MCB balance held by WMPs from numbers in 1 and
       4.

     Table A.1: Summary Statistics of Municipal Corporate Bond Issuance
 This table reports the summary statistics of municipal corporate bond (MCB) issuance.
Panels A and B report MCB issuance number, issuance amount (billion RMB), and
issuance amount by purpose (repayment of existing bank loan, investment, and other)
for 7 regions and 30 provinces, respectively. Total issuance amount is greater than the
sum of three purposes because only about 80% of MCBs are with disclosure.

  Table A.2: The Effects of 2009 Abnormal Bank Loan on Future Municipal
            Corporate Bonds Net Issuance, Year-by-Year Regressions
This table reports the year-by-year regressions of 2012-2015 MCB issuance on 2009 bank
loan. The dependent variable is the abnormal MCB issuance scaled by GDP in years
2012-2015 compared to the average value between 2004 and 2008. Annual MCB issuance
at the regional and provincial levels is aggregated over individual MCB bonds. The
independent variable is the abnormal new bank loan scaled by GDP in 2009 compared
to the average value between 2004 and 2008. Panel A and Panel B report the regional and
provincial results, respectively. Data about bank loans are obtained from the PBoC and
data about MCBs are obtained from WIND. Heteroscedasticity-consistent t-statistics are
reported in parentheses. ***, **, and * indicate significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10%
levels, respectively.

                    Corporate Bond Issuance, Panel Regressions
This table reports the panel regressions of 2012-2015 provincial municipal corporate bond
(MCB) issuance on 2009 LGFV loan. The dependent variable is the abnormal MCB
issuance scaled by GDP in years 2012-2015 compared to the average value between 2004
and 2008. Annual MCB issuances at the provincial level are aggregated over individual
MCB bonds. The independent variable is the abnormal new LGFV bank loans scaled by
GDP in 2009 compared to the average value between 2007 and 2008. Control variables
include abnormal fiscal deficit (FD) scaled by GDP, abnormal fixed-asset investment
(FAI) scaled by GDP, abnormal local government land sale income (LS) scaled by fiscal
revenue (FR), GDP growth, and the corruption index constructed by Ang et al. (2017).
MCBrepay indicates the proceeds of MCBs that are used to pay back bank loans. MCBinv
indicates the proceeds of MCBs that are used for investment. MCBother indicates the
proceeds of MCBs that are used for other purposes. MCB10  repay includes those 10 provinces
with the most similar value of GDP in 2009, including Yunnan, Chongqing, Jilin, Shanxi,
Tianjin, Jiangxi, Guangxi, Shan Xi, Heilongjiang, and Neimenggu. The denominator to
scale MCB10repay in 2012-2015 is the 2009 GDP in each of those 10 provinces. Data about
LGFV bank loans are from Gao et al. (2018), data about MCBs are obtained from WIND,
and data about control variables are obtained from the National Bureau of Statistics of
China. Year fixed effects are included. Heteroscedasticity-consistent t-statistics clustered
by province and year are reported in parentheses. ***, **, and * indicate significance at
the 1%, 5%, and 10% levels, respectively.
