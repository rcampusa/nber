                                           ABSTRACT

This study examines the "cost burden" of child care, defined as day care expenses divided by after-
tax income. Data are from the wave 10 core and child care topical modules to the 1996 Survey of
Income and Program Participation. We estimate that the average child under six years of age lives
in a family that spends 4.9 percent of after-tax income on day care. However, this conceals wide
variation: 63 percent of such children reside in families with no child care expenses and 10 percent
are in families where the cost burden exceeds 16 percent. The burden is typically greater in single-
parent than married-couple families but is not systematically related to a measure of socioeconomic
status that we construct. One reason for this is that disadvantaged families use lower cost modes and
pay less per hour for given types of care. The cost burden would be much less equal without low cost
(presumably subsidized) formal care focused on needy families, as well as government tax and
transfer policies that redistribute income towards them.

                                 The Cost of Caring for Young Children

         How much of their income do parents spend on day care for their young children? To

our knowledge, this study provides the first comprehensive study of this seemingly simple

question.1 There are two main reasons why we know so little about what we call the “cost

burden of child care”, defined as child care expenses divided by family incomes. First, it is

difficult to compile data that simultaneously provides accurate information on day care expenses

and family incomes. Second, conceptualizing the cost burden is surprisingly complex, since

parental employment and child care use are closely linked (Hofferth et al., 1991 and Smith,

2002), with the result that parents (particularly mothers) who work typically utilize more non-

parental care than those who do not.2 One implication is that employment often raises both the

numerator (expenses) and the denominator (family incomes) in the child burden equation. The

positive relationship between child care spending and family income is even stronger for female-

headed households, where labor supply is a greater determinant of total family income and child

care use. Other complicating issues include the measurement of income (e.g. gross versus

disposable income, family versus household), permanent versus transitory components of income

and expenses, and possible changes in family composition over time.

         Our analysis addresses five specific questions. First, what is the average cost burden of

caring for children under six years of age? Second, how does this burden differ across types of

families? Third, do child care costs increase or lower measured income inequality? Fourth, how

would inequality in the cost burden change if the modes or costs of care became more similar

1
  Some indication of child care expenses relative to income has previously been provided by Hofferth et al. (1991),
Anderson and Levine (2000), and Smith (2002). Giannarelli and Barsimantov’s (2002) research is most closely
related to this analysis but is limited to families where the primary caregiver is working.
2
  Child care expenses also influence parental employment. Anderson and Levine (2000) and Meyers et al. (2004)
review the related research and conclude that most estimates of the elasticity of maternal employment with respect
to child care expenses cluster around -0.3 or -0.4.

across groups than they currently are. Finally, do government tax and transfer policies and child

care subsidies exacerbate or mitigate differences in the cost burden of child care?

       This analysis utilizes the 1996 panel of the Survey of Income and Program Participation

(SIPP), which contains detailed data on both child care expenses and income. Our information

on child care comes from the wave 10 topical module covering the period March through June

1999; that on income is from the wave 10 core survey providing information on average incomes

in the preceding four months. We also use data from the March Current Population Survey

(CPS) to construct a measure of socioeconomic status (SES) that is based on predicted income

percentiles and use the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) TAXSIM program to

estimate taxes for our SIPP families.

       We estimate that the average child under the age of six lives in a family that spends 4.9

percent of their after-tax income on child care. This conceals a wide variation: 63 percent of

such children reside in families with no (non-immediate family) day care expenses and 10

percent are in families where the cost burden exceeds 16 percent. A large portion of differences

in the cost burden are related to family characteristics. For example, children living with married

parents are in families where the average cost burden is 3.9 percent, compared to an average cost

burden of 7.4 percent for families with an absent spouse or never married parent.

       Income inequality is somewhat greater when measured net of child care expenses than

when these costs are not taken into account (the Gini coefficient rises from 0.398 to 0.406).

However, the child care cost burden is not systematically related to SES, as proxied by predicted

incomes. The reason for this is that disadvantaged families use lower cost modes and pay less

per hour for given types of child care. Equalizing costs per hour (and presumably differences in

the quality of care received) would dramatically increase the cost burden of disadvantaged



                                               Page 2
families. Finally, our evidence suggests that government policies operate to reduce inequality of

the child care cost burden. This primarily reflects the redistributed effects of tax policies and the

role of the Earned Income Tax Credit. Transfer payments have smaller effects.

                         1. Previous Evidence on the Cost Burden of Child Care

           Previous research provides some information on the cost burden of child care. Using the

1990 National Child Care Survey, Hofferth et al. (1991) report that child care expenses, for

families with children under five and who pay for care, are 10 percent when the mother is

employed and 6 percent when she is not. They also provide evidence that cost burdens decline

with income. However, as shown below, there is an important role for care that is provided free

of charge, making it difficult to use these statistics to determine the cost burden for all families,

not just those paying for care.3

           Anderson and Levine (2000) and Casper (1995) report cost burdens computed from the

1993 (and earlier) panels of the SIPP but are limited because these data refer only to families

with caregivers who are working or in school.4 Anderson and Levine estimate that child care

expenses are 7 percent of income, for families with children under six and employed mothers

paying for care; Casper (1995) obtains a corresponding cost burden of 7.6 percent for families

with children under five years of age. However, neither study accounts for free child care or

families with nonworking mothers. These exclusions are important – accounting for 68 percent

of all children in the sample we analyze.

           Giannarelli and Barsimantov (2000) provide the most comprehensive previous study of

the cost burden of child care. Using the 1997 National Survey of American Families (NSAF),

they find that families with children under 13 pay 9.2 percent of their income for child care.

3
    Meyers et al. (2004) attempt to do so by combining findings from a number of tables in Hofferth et al. (1991).
4
    Hofferth (1996) and Blau (2001) provide additional analyses of the statistics reported by Casper.


                                                          Page 3
However, the analysis is again limited to paid care and to families with an employed caregiver.

Also, the NSAF does not break down child care costs by mode.

       The “Who’s Minding the Kids?” reports by the U.S. Census Bureau (Smith, 2002) used

the 1996 SIPP panel to examine how the cost burden varies by group. Smith reports that child

care expenses are 6.6 percent of income, for families making payments, and is considerably

higher for low-income families that pay for care. But once again, describing the cost burden is

not the primary focus and it is extremely difficult to ascertain how the cost burden differs across

all families. To reiterate, free care is important and studies neglecting to consider it miss out on

one of the primary determinants of differences in the cost of care.

       The analysis below improves on the previous literature in five ways. First, we calculate

the cost burden for all families with young children, not just those with employed parents.

Second, we carefully consider the role of both paid and free child care. Third, we examine

difference in modes and costs per mode of care. Fourth, we consider child care expenses as a

fraction of disposable rather than gross income (removing taxes and adding in transfer

payments). Fifth, we emphasize the distribution of the cost burden, not just the average value.

                                              2. Data

       The Survey of Income and Program Participation is is a multistage-stratified sample of

the U.S. civilian noninstitutionalized population, sponsored by the U.S. Census Bureau, that

provides extensive available information on both child care use and expenditures and income.

SIPP households are interviewed every four months (each interview is a wave) for periods of up

to four years. The survey is built around detailed monthly “core” questions on labor force

activity, program participation and sources of income. These are supplemented by wave-specific




                                                Page 4
“topical modules”.5 We use a recent topical SIPP module on child care use, wave 10 of the 1996

panel, covering the period from March 1999 through June 1999.6 Our sample contains 4,524

families with 5,777 children under the age of six.7 A primary caregiver (typically the mother) is

designated for each family.8

           The focus of this paper is calculating the “child care cost burden,” defined as

expenditures on child care (obtained from non-immediate family members) divided by after-tax

income. The SIPP topical module contains extremely detailed questions on child care costs.9

Variables for usual weekly child care costs are separately provided for each of the five youngest

children (under six) and for each of seven non-immediate family child care arrangements

(grandparent, other relative, family day care, day care center, pre-school/nursery school, Head

Start, and other non-relative).10 Data for both the working and non-working caregivers is

collected in the 1996 SIPP.

           Income data come from the core questionnaire and are measured as a monthly average

over the four months prior to the survey.11 Total family income includes earnings, government

  Similar child care data are collected in wave 4 of the 1996 SIPP panel. Earlier SIPP panels also collect child care
information that, as previously mentioned, is limited to caregivers who are working or in school. The SIPP also
collects data on children aged 6 to 14 which (because our focus is on young children) is not used in this analysis.
7
  These are obtained from the full 1996 SIPP panel of 36,700 households (most of whom do not have children or
children in the designated age range).
8
  This is the mother in married-couple families and the sole parent in single parent families. Grandparents and other
relatives can also be designated as the primary caregiver.
9
  The extreme level of detail may have hindered the efforts of previous researcher to compute child care costs using
the 1996 panel of the SIPP. For example it is necessary to read in 105 variables in order to compute: the total cost of
child care (for children five years and younger), total child care hours per week, and total child care hours per week
when the primary caregiver is working.
10
  Also included are hours of care, hours of care while the caregiver was working, and place of care, as well as
similar variables for care by immediate family members including the other parent and older siblings.
11
     We use a four-month average in order to minimize the effects of transitory fluctuations.

                                                          Page 5
transfers (Temporary Assistance to Needy Families, Unemployment Compensation, and Social

Security), non-government transfers (e.g. alimony and child support payments), and unearned

income (dividends, property income, and pensions).12

           We also estimate the taxes paid by each family, using TAXSIM which has been

developed by the National Bureau of Economic Research.13 In doing so, we break families into

tax-filing units (single, head of household, married filing jointly), compute income (federal and

state) and payroll (Social Security and Medicare) taxes for each tax-filing unit, and sum these to

get total taxes. TAXSIM is sophisticated in its treatment of different types of income (e.g.

earned versus Social Security income), and in allowing child care expenses to be included in

child care credit calculations.14

           When calculating the child care cost burden, we assume a minimum after-tax family

income of $314 per month (corresponding to the 5th percentile in our sample) and cap the cost

burden at a maximum of 50 percent. We make these adjustments for several reasons. First,

since incomes are averaged over only a four month period, very low (and zero) measured

incomes will often represent transitory reductions (e.g. during periods of temporarily reduced

employment). Second, families with incomes below the 5th percentile may be able to afford




12
  In SIPP, all household members are part of the primary family, except for married couples or single caregivers
and their nonadult children, where neither spouse (or the single caregiver) is the household head.
13
     For more information on TAXSIM, see Feenberg and Coutts (1993) and TAXSIM (2003).
14
  Data limitations require that we make several simplifying assumptions. Most importantly, lacking good
information on itemized deductions, we assume that all tax-filing units take the standard deduction. We also assume
that only child care expenses for family day care, day care centers, pre-school/nursery schools, and Head Start are
claimed for tax purposes. To compute annual income and child care expenses, we multiply our monthly averages
incomes by twelve and weekly child care expenses by 52. Maine and Vermont are combined into one state group, in
the SIPP, as are North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wyoming. To compute state income taxes for these states, we
constructed a population-weighted average for families residing in the specified group of (two or three) states.

child care because they reside in households with income support provided by other adults.15

Although a full investigation of the distinction between family and household incomes is beyond

the scope of this analysis, we provide some information on this issue below. Third, the cost

burden is capped because it seems unlikely that many families would be able to spend more than

half of their income on child care expenses for extended periods of time.

           We often compare results for families with different predicted incomes, using the latter as

a proxy for socio-economic status (SES). When doing so, predicted income is estimated using

data from the 1998 through 2002 March Current Population Survey (CPS) and controlling for

gender, age, education, race/ethnicity, and state of residence of the primary caregiver, as well as

all second-level interactions between these variables.16 Children in the SIPP are ranked by

predicted family incomes, based upon characteristics of their primary caregiver and the CPS

model estimates, and then grouped into six categories representing the: 0-10, 10-25, 25-50, 50-

75, 75-90, and 90-100 predicted income percentiles.17 Compared to grouping children by a

single characteristic (e.g. the education of their mother), this method but has the advantage of

simultaneously accounting for a large number of determinants of SES.

           For ease of exposition, we use several conventions throughout the paper. First, we

sometimes refer to caregivers (who are occasionally grandparents or other guardians) as

“parents” but in all cases are talking about all caregivers. Second, we split the sample into three
15
     The average family with monthly income less than $314 lives in a household with a monthly income of $1,670.
16
  The age groups include <20, 20-24, 25-29, 30-34, 35-39, 40-44, 45-49 and 50+ individually and <28, 28-34, and
35+ for the interactions. The educational groups include high school dropout, high school graduate, some college
but no bachelor’s degree, bachelor’s degree, and master’s degree or higher. The last two educational groups are
combined for the interactions. The race/ethnicity groups are white non-Hispanic, black non-Hispanic, other non-
Hispanic, and Hispanic. Each state, except those grouped in the SIPP, are entered individually, but the states are
grouped into five regions for the interactions. The CPS income variable is equivalent to that used in the SIPP, prior
to deducting taxes.
17
  Children with predicted incomes at the dividing point between categories are placed into the lower group (e.g.
children at the 10th percentile are placed in the 0-10th and not the 10-25th percentile).


                                                        Page 7
marital status groups – married with spouse present, spouse absent (married with spouse absent,

widowed, divorced, or separated), and never married – and refer to the latter two groups as

“single parents,” even though it is possible that these caregivers cohabit. Third, our results

provide nationally representative estimates for children aged 0 through 5.18 While we

occasionally we discuss findings for “caregivers” or “families,” these technically refer to

children under the age of six in those families. Fourth, except where noted, reported child care

hours and costs are for arrangements outside of the immediate family (the other parent and

siblings). Fifth, all child care costs and incomes are measured as monthly, while child care hours

generally are reported as weekly. To compute monthly child care costs, we multiply our weekly

child care costs by 52 weeks and divide by 12 months.

                                         3. Use and Cost of Child Care

           Care of young children by persons outside the immediate family is common but not

universal. As detailed in Table 1, children under six years of age reside in families where an

average of 25 hours of day care per week is supplied outside the immediate family (other than

parents and siblings) at a cost of $135 per month, with external care used by roughly three-fifths

of families. This care costs an average of $1.24 per hour, which is sharply divided between that

generally provided very cheaply by grandparents or other relatives (averaging $0.31 per hour)

and that that supplied at an average cost of around $2 per hour in day care centers, pre-schools,

or other less formal settings (with the exception of the virtually free care supplied by Head Start).

These differences explain why two-fifths of child care is provided free of charge, including

three-quarters of that by grandparents or other relatives, versus around one-fifth of hours by non-




18
     These are obtained by multiplying SIPP person weights by the number of children for the given caregiver.


                                                         Page 8
relatives in informal settings and only one-tenth to one-eighth of care in family day care

facilities, centers, and preschools.19

         Approximately 40 percent of the 25 hours of average weekly non-immediate family child

care is provided by grandparents or other relatives; 8 hours weekly occurs in day care centers or

pre-schools; 7 hours per week in family day care centers or by non-relatives in informal settings;

and less than 1 hour through the federal Head Start program (although this is probably an

undercount).20 In addition, an average of six hours per week of supervision is provided by the

parents other than the designated caregiver and less than one hour weekly by siblings.21 The

remainder of our analysis focuses exclusively on care by non-immediate family members and the

related discussion refers only to these sources of care.

         The amount and costs of child care vary substantially across types of families. For

instance, single parent families use 50 percent more child care than those with married parents

(33 vs. 22 hours per week) but utilize much cheaper sources ($0.80 vs. $1.50 per hour) and, as a

result, spend 20 percent less per week ($114 vs. $143). Similarly, families where the caregiver is

a non-Hispanic white use slightly fewer hours of day care than minorities (24 vs. 27 hours per

week) but pay more both per hour ($1.49 vs. $0.87) and per month ($155 vs. $100) for these

19
  These figures represent lower-bounds on the percentage of free child care because no free care is assigned in cases
where families receiving some hours at no charge and pay for other hours of care within a given mode (e.g. if a
grandparent provides some portion of care for free and is paid for the rest). We suspect that the resulting
understatement is small.
20
   In Table 1 we are estimating that approximately 200,000 children are in Head Start in a given month. In the 1999
fiscal year, there were 826,016 children enrolled in Head Start at a cost of $4.7 billion (U.S. Department of Health
and Human Services, 2000). Part of this undercount is due to our time period stretching into the summer months,
when Head Start programs are not in session. However, we suspect that a more important reason is because most
Head Start children may be counted in some of the other modes of care. For example, we estimate that there are
nearly 600,000 three and four year-old children in families with incomes less than the median income (about $2,500
per month) receiving free or less than a dollar per hour care in day care centers, pre-schools, or nursery schools.
Many of these children may be Head Start children.
21
 For immediate family members (siblings and the other parent), only hours of care while the primary caregiver is
working or in school are counted in the SIPP.


                                                       Page 9
services. By contrast, more educated parents use both large amounts and expensive sources of

care, and so have relatively high expenditures.

            The child care burden depends on the type and cost of care, as well as on the family

incomes. Thus, it represents a complicated interaction of a variety of factors that often move in

different directions. Groups using smaller amounts of care often utilize more expensive sources

and so have greater total expenditures. These same groups (e.g. married couple families) also

often have relatively high family incomes so that it is not obvious, a priori, which types of

families have the highest cost burdens. As mentioned, this issue is even more complicated

because employment and child care use are jointly determined and because there are likely to be

substantial within-group differences in all of these factors. We explore these issues below.

                                   4. What is the Cost Burden of Child Care?

            As shown on the first row of Table 2, the average 0-5 year old child is in a family paying

4.9 percent of their disposable income on day care.22 This average, however, conceals enormous

diversity in the child care burden. Fully 63 percent of children live in families with no expenses,

implying that the median cost burden is 0 percent. Conversely, the average child care burden for

families in the upper 10 percent of the distribution is nearly 30 percent of disposable income.23

As noted above, the absence of child care costs does not imply that no day care is used – 23

percent of children are in families that utilize only free sources of care. Note, also, that the

average burden rises to 13.0 percent if the sample is limited to the 32 percent of the sample with

working caregivers who pay for care, as is done in most previous analyses (Smith, 2002;

22
  Calculation of the average cost burden is somewhat sensitive to the treatment of the small number of children in
families with very high burdens, usually occurring because of low average incomes over the four month period over
which these are calculated. Fewer than 2 percent of children are affected by the 50 percent maximum we use in
calculating the cost burden. If this maximum were raised to 75 percent (100 percent) the average burden would
increase to 5.2 (5.3) percent. There is no effect on the lower 98 percent of the cost burden distribution.
23
     The 75th, 90th, and 95th percentiles of the cost burden distribution are 5.9, 16.3, and 25.3 percent.


                                                            Page 10
Anderson and Levine, 2000; and Giannarelli and Barsimantov, 2000).24 Limiting the sample to

this sub-group ignores much of the variation in the burden across families.

        Perhaps the most noteworthy finding in Table 2 is the remarkable concentration of the

child care burden. Families in the upper 10 percent of the distribution pay an average $624 per

month for care, versus $80 per month for the other 90 percent of families. Yet, these high cost

burden families have disposable incomes of just $2,268 per month, lower than the $3,150 for the

other 90 percent. Part of the reason for this difference is that 40 percent (versus 15 percent) of

the high cost burden caregivers are working single parents.

        The cost burden of child care, and its components, differs substantially and in mostly

predictable ways with the demographic characteristics of the primary caregiver. Table 3

stratifies the sample by race/ethnicity, marital status, education, geographic location, the number

of children, and age of the youngest child. As mentioned, the cost burden is lower in married-

couple families (3.9 percent) than in those where the caregiver has never been married (7.0

percent) or where the spouse no longer lives with the child (7.9 percent). The average cost

burden is also relatively high for black families (6.0 percent), but not for other types of

minorities, and for those with multiple young children (5.9 percent). Interestingly, the cost

burden rises monotonically with education, from 3.9 percent for high school dropouts to 5.4

percent for college graduates. This reflects the somewhat higher child care hours and much

greater costs of the most educated group, and occurs despite their high family incomes. By

24
  Smith (2002), using wave 4 of the 1996 SIPP, reports that among families with at least one child under five who
pay for care, the average child care payment over the average pre-tax income is 8.9 percent. In our sample, the
analogous statistic is 7.5 percent (but our figure excludes families with 6-14 year old year old but no younger
children). Anderson and Levine (2000), using SIPP panels from the early 1990s, report an average child care burden
of 7.7 percent of pre-tax income among working caregiver families with at least one child under six who pay for
care; However, this includes costs of only primary and secondary arrangements, with a cap of $140 per week for
each. Using 1997 NSAF data, Giannarelli and Barsimantov (2000) report an average child care burden of 9.2
percent of pre-tax income among working caregiver families who pay for care. Their measure is for families with
children under 13, a group likely to have lower expenses than for families that all include a child under six.


                                                     Page 11
contrast, the high cost burdens of single parent households reflect low incomes, with particularly

long hours being offset by the use of cheap sources of day care.

        There is also substantial variation in the distribution of the child care cost burden within

groups (see Table 4). For instance, almost four-fifths of children with a high school dropout

parent are in families with no child care costs, compared to under half of those where the

caregiver is a college graduate; however, the cost burden at the 90th percentile is similar (15.0

percent versus 15.9 percent). Conversely, the relatively high average cost burdens for children

with black caregivers or in single parent families result from increased costs at the top of the

distribution (as indicated by the 75th and 90th percentiles), with little difference in the fraction of

such families experiencing positive child care costs.

        Many of the differences in child care cost burdens, highlighted in Tables 3 and 4 reflect

the common influences of factors that vary in similar ways across sub-samples. For instance,

since black children have relatively high probabilities of being raised in single parent families,

some of the racial differences could result from disparities in marital status rather than other race

effects. With this in mind, Table 5 presents partial correlations between demographic factors and

the cost burden, remaining after controlling for other observable characteristics. The dependent

variable in the first column is the average cost burden and the equation is estimated by OLS.

The second and third columns present estimated marginal effects from binary probit models

(with other covariates evaluated at the sample means) for dichotomous dependent variables

indicating if the child’s family has any child care costs and if the cost burden exceeds the 90th

percentile (16.3 percent). Robust standard errors are also displayed, calculated assuming

independence for children across but not within families.




                                                 Page 12
        The econometric estimates confirm many of the previously described patterns. Single

parent families have relatively high cost burdens, as do those with highly educated parents and

large numbers of young children. Interestingly, single parents appear to be particularly

concentrated among those with cost burdens above the 90th percentile, even accounting for other

demographic characteristics – a finding hinted at in many of the earlier tables. Characteristics

associated with high average cost burdens are usually positively related to the probability of

having positive expenses or being above the 90th percentile of the distribution. There are,

however, some exceptions (e.g. Hispanic children are especially likely to live in families with no

costs but also marginally more likely to live in those with cost burdens above the 90th percentile).

A noteworthy finding is that the previously observed substantial differences between white and

black children largely disappear with the inclusion of controls for other covariates.

                             5. Do Child Care Costs Increase Inequality?

        The issue of income inequality has received a great deal of attention in recent years, in

part because of its sharp rise during the 1980s and early 1990s after several decades of decline.25

The growth of income inequality can be traced, in large part, to increasing wage inequality (Katz

and Autor, 1999) but also to growth in single motherhood, particularly among less-skilled

women (Ellwood and Jencks, 2004). The consequences of the changing wage structure have

been partially offset by increases in women’s labor force participation (U.S. Bureau of the

Census, 2001; and Mishel, Bernstein, and Schmidt, 2001), raising the question of whether child

care costs mitigate or exacerbate inequality.

        We address this question by comparing inequality in family income with and without

accounting for child care costs. The results of this exercise, presented in Table 6, suggest that

25
  Jones and Weinberg (2000) report that between 1975 and 1993, households in the 90th percentile saw their
incomes rise by 21.8 percent, while those in 10th percentile experienced decreases of 2.3 percent.


                                                     Page 13
income inequality modestly increases when child care expenses are subtracted from disposable

income. For example, the Gini coefficient rises from 0.398 to 0.406 and the ratio of incomes at

the 90th and 10th percentiles of the distribution (the 90/10 ratio) increases from 7.78 to 8.52.

Similarly, the 50/25 and 25/10 ratios grow from 1.67 and 2.08 to 1.71 and 2.23. The top panel of

the table reveals that the increase in inequality occurs primarily because of disproportionately

large reductions in net incomes at the bottom of the distribution (e.g. 13 percent at the 10th

percentile versus less than 5 percent at the 90th percentile), while median incomes are relatively

unaffected (falling just 4 percent) so that there is little change in the 90/50 or 75/50 ratio.

         The results just discussed refer to a sample of families with young children. If these

families have relatively low incomes, as seems likely, the preceding calculations will understate

the rise in inequality resulting from netting out child care expenses.26 On the other hand, our

main income variable removes taxes and transfer payments, and therefore is not directly

comparable to that typically used in prior research. We investigate government tax and transfer

policies below.

        6. How Does the Child Care Cost Burden Differ With Socioeconomic Status?

        The remainder of our analysis examines how child care costs and the cost burden differ

with SES. We are interested in determining whether “disadvantaged” families face the double

problem of low incomes and high child care cost burdens, or if they have lower burdens because

of using less hours or cheaper sources of day care.

        As previously discussed, we sort families into SES groups by: 1) estimating predicted

incomes from CPS data, with controls for age, education and race/ethnicity of the primary

caregiver, as well as many interactions between these variables; 2) ranking SIPP children by

26
 For example, the families in our sample have median annual (pre-tax) incomes of $34,668. The corresponding
median income for all U.S. families, in 1999, was $48,950 (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 2001, Table 668.)


                                                    Page 14
predicted family income, based upon characteristics of their primary parent; 3) grouping them

into into six categories representing the: 0-10, 10-25, 25-50, 50-75, 75-90, and 90-100 predicted

income percentiles. In addition to providing a single summary measure of SES, rather than

relying on multiple correlated indicators, this method has the advantage of removing the effects

of caregiver-specific variation in work hours (that is likely to be correlated with both family

incomes and child care use and costs). However, it should be noted that the effects of between-

group variation in average employment or child care use will not be removed. For instance,

persons with high predicted incomes may have relatively high child care costs because this group

is dominated by educated parents who supply relatively large amounts of market labor.

         Sample characteristics for the six predicted income categories, summarized in Appendix

Table A.1, largely accord with our expectations. Groups with low predicted incomes are

dominated by minorities, single-parent families, and less educated caregivers, whereas whites,

married-couple families, and educated caregivers are disproportionately represented among those

with high expected incomes. For example, the primary parent of 48 percent of children in the 0-

10th percentile is nonwhite, 34 percent are Hispanic, 67 percent have no spouse present, and 69

percent are high school dropouts; the corresponding percentages for children in the 90-100th

percentile are 6 percent, 3 percent, 5 percent, and 0 percent.27 Parents of the latter group work

many more hours (68 versus 29 hours), largely due to the presence of the spouse in the family.

Conversely, there is much more likely to be a non-parent working adult in the household for the

0-10th than the 90-100th percentile (41 versus 3 percent), with the result that the family provides a



27
  We also calculated predicted income percentiles using an equation that add controls for marital status and the
number of children (and selected interactions) to the set of explanatory variables. The patterns are generally similar
to those obtained without these additional variables, although (not surprisingly) with an even larger representation of
single-parent families in the lower SES groups and slightly less delineation by educational attainment. The results
discussed below are also fairly similar when using this alternative predicting equation.


                                                        Page 15
much lower share of total household income for the lower SES group (68 versus 99 percent).28

One implication is that calculating the cost burden as the ratio of child care costs to household

(rather than family) income might result in a considerably lower figure at the bottom of the

predicted income distribution but would have little effect for high SES individuals.29 This

represents an important subject for future research.

         Table 7 details how the cost burden of child care and its components varies with both

actual income and with SES as proxied by predicted family income. The burden falls

monotonically with actual incomes because increases in the latter more than offset the rising

hours and cost of care. For instance, day care use care is almost twice as large for families in the

90-100th than for those in the 0-10th percentiles (30.5 vs. 16.4 hours per week) and their monthly

child care costs are more than six times higher ($313 vs. $47) but these differences are dwarfed

by an almost 30-fold difference in average incomes ($8,534 vs. $288). However, a significant

portion of these differences are due to the endogeneity between employment and child care use –

those working more have both higher incomes and greater child care expenses. This can be seen

in the lower panel of the table, where the link between predicted incomes and child care use and

costs is much less pronounced.

         The most striking finding is the absence of any consistent pattern between predicted

income and the cost burden. The burden for the 0-10th, 25-50th, and 90-100th percentiles are


28
  A complication with measuring the cost burden at the family-level is the treatment of multi-generation
households. Family definitions in the SIPP and CPS result in differences in the treatment of other adults in the
household (such as grandparents). In particular, when the family head is not the household head, other adults
generally will not count in family income calculations, whereas if the family and household head are the same they
will not.
29
  However, it is also possible that other adults in the household have young children of their own, in which case the
cost burden for the entire household might not fall. Moreover, without a full understanding of intra-household
income transfers it is somewhat difficult to know how to interpret a cost burden measure that is based upon
household incomes.


                                                       Page 16
virtually identical (5.5 or 5.6 percent) and substantially lower for the 25-50th, 50-75th and 75-90th

percentiles (4.7, 4.1 and 4.2 percent). The lack of a monotonic relationship results from

offsetting increases in actual incomes and child care costs when moving up the predicted income

distribution. For instance, families in the 90-100th percentile spend 1.3 times as much on day

care as those in the 25-50th percentile and have incomes that are 1.4 times as high.

        The other remarkable feature is the similarity in child care hours across predicted income

groups. Although the categories with the highest average cost burdens (the 0-10th, 25-50th, and

90-100th percentiles) also use the most child care, these differences are dwarfed by disparities in

the costs of care. For example, the 90-100th percentile obtain 20 percent more hours of child care

per week than the 50-75th percentile (27.9 vs. 23.2 hours) but pays over twice as much for it

($269 vs. $129 per month).

        Table 8 provides information on differences in the use and cost of specific modes of child

care across SES categories. Notice that the similarity in total hours of care, just discussed, masks

substantial variation in the choice of modes. Families at the bottom of the predicted income

distribution obtain a large proportion of total care from relatives, whereas those at the top get

most care from centers, preschools, or family day care facilities. Specifically, the 0-10th

percentile obtains almost half of total care hours from grandparents or other relatives compared

to less than a fifth of hours for the 90-100th percentile. Conversely, the former group gets 31 (7)

percent of care from centers and preschools (family day care) compared to 43 (19) percent for

the latter.

        The distribution of monthly child care spending is detailed in the bottom panel of Table

8. The bulk of child care expenditures are devoted to paying for formal care in centers,

preschools, and family day care facilities – these three modes account for 63 percent of the



                                                Page 17
monthly child care spending for the 0-10th predicted income percentiles, 56 percent for the 10-

50th percentiles and 73 to 76 percent for the 50-100th percentiles.

          Families with high predicted incomes not only use more expensive types of care but also

pay more for any given mode. As shown in the top panel of Table 9, the 90-100th percentile

spends 133 percent more per hour for center/pre-school care than the 0-10th percentile ($2.75 vs.

$1.18), 81 percent extra for family day care ($2.39 vs. $1.32), 66 percent more for informal non-

relative care ($2.42 vs. $1.46), and over twice as much for supervision by relatives ($0.63 vs.

$0.23).

          It seems likely that the extra spending by families with high predicted incomes purchases

higher quality care. However, costs for the bottom of the distribution are probably being reduced

by day care subsidies offered by the government, employers, or others. The middle panel of the

table, which investigates the frequency with which child care is provided without cost to the

family, supplied evidence in support of this. In particular, the use of free care provided by non-

relatives is much more common at the bottom of the predicted income distribution than at the

top, as expected if subsidies are targeted to disadvantaged families,. Thus, 19 percent of the

center-based care is supplied to the 0-10th percentile without charge, compared to 7 percent for

the 90-100th percentile. Free care is also much more likely to be provided to low SES families

by non-relatives. Conversely, almost all hours in family day care settings are paid for, whereas

care by relatives is usually free.

          Families at the bottom of the predicted income distribution are also much less likely to

pay more than $1 per hour for center-based care (see the bottom panel of Table 9), providing a

further indication that they receive a disproportionate share of subsidized care. For example, the

0-10th and 10-25th percentiles spend over $1 for 44 and 53 percent of center/pre-school hours,



                                                 Page 18
compared to over 85 percent for families in the top two predicted income categories.

Consequently, children in families in the 0-10th percentile spend about 20 percent of their 26

hours per week in free or low cost ($1 per hour or less) center-based care (including Head Start),

44 percent in free or low cost care with relatives, and only 31 percent in care costing more than a

dollar per hour. Children in the 10-25th percentile spend 11 (51) percent of their 25 hours per

week in free or low cost center-based care (relative care) and only about 28 percent in care

costing more than a dollar per hour. On the other hand, children in the 90-100th percentile spend

76 percent of their 28 hours per week in care costing more than a dollar per hour and just 15

percent in free or low cost care with relatives.

                   7. Household Accommodations and Government Policies

       The section examines how government policies and household accommodations affect

the cost burden of child care. Table 10 focuses on how tax and transfer policies that cause net

and gross incomes to differ. As shown in the first three rows of the table, earnings are by far the

largest source of total incomes for all SES categories, with those of the caregiver being far more

important at the bottom than the top of the distribution. The caregiver provides 51 percent of

earnings for the 0-10th percentile and 41 percent for the 10th-25th percentile, compared to just 28

and 30 percent among the 75-90th and 90-100th percentiles. This largely reflects the high share of

single parent families among the low SES categories.

       Government transfers result in a modest redistribution towards disadvantaged families:

such payments account for 18 percent of net incomes among the bottom 10 percent (60 percent

due to welfare) and less than one percent for the top decile. Although such transfers are large

enough to more than pay for the child care expenditures of the bottom half of the distribution, if




                                                   Page 19
they were targeted to families with high child care expenses, most of the payments are actually

received by those with no child care costs.30

         Income and payroll taxes have much larger effects on disposable income. We estimate

that taxes reduce the net incomes of the top two SES groups by 25 and 28 percent, compared to

less than 8 and 4 percent for the bottom two. The modest reductions in incomes for

disadvantaged families occur even though payroll taxes (for Social Security and Medicare) are

approximately proportional to incomes. The most important reason is that federal income taxes

are particularly low for these families, in large part due to the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC),

which creates strong employment incentives and rapidly phases out at higher incomes (Meyer

and Rosenbaum, 2001).31 Finally, federal child tax credits and federal and state child care credits

have modest effects on net incomes for all groups. However, the EITC and Child Care Credit

are more targeted towards families with high day care expenses than are transfer payments.32

         The first row of the Table 11 repeats the information from Table 7, showing that the cost

burden of child care remains relatively constant across predicted income categories. The

remainder of the table estimates of how the cost burden would change under several scenarios.

These counterfactuals assume that families use the same amount of family day care as in the base

case, and examine the effects of government tax/transfer policies (which affect net incomes) or

30
   We calculate that families in the bottom half of the predicted income distribution could pay for just 14 percent of
their child care costs with their transfer payments; in the bottom decile this percentage rises to 22 percent.
31
  Our calculations assume that all families take the standard income tax deduction. Since high income families are
more likely to itemize, we are overstating income taxes (by a larger amount) for high SES families and therefore
also overestimating the redistribution due to the tax system. Using data from the SIPP, we estimate that this
overstatement is sizable, but that it has very little effect on our cost burden measure. Allowing for itemized
deductions would likely result in 0.9, 1.2, 2.3, 3.9, 3.6 and 7.4 increases the after-tax income 0-10th, 10-25th, 25-50th,
50-75th and 90-100th percentiles of the predicted income distribution. Overall, this would lower the cost burden by
about 0.11 percentage points (4.86 to 4.75 percent) with families in the 90-100th percentile experiencing about a 0.23
percentage point decrease, and the rest of the distribution experiencing between a 0.06 and 0.16 percentage point
decrease in the cost burden.
32
  We calculate that families in the bottom half of the predicted income distribution could pay for 29 percent of their
child care costs with the Earned Income Tax and Child Care Credits; in the bottom decile this rises to 36 percent.

                                                         Page 20
changes in the type or cost per hour of the care utilized (which affect expenditures). The

simulations do not account for the substitution towards cheaper types or fewer hours of care that

might occur when costs per hour increase. Nor do they account for the changes in modes that

would accompany different government tax/transfer policies.

        As mentioned, transfer policies have little effect on the child care cost burden. The

second row shows that removing this source of income would increase the child care burden for

the bottom decile of the predicted income distribution from 5.6 to 6.1 percent, while having

smaller effects on the 10th-75th percentiles and none at all for the top quartile. By contrast,

eliminating taxes would have no effect on the bottom 25 percent but (by increasing disposable

incomes) would sharply reduce the cost burden of the top half of the distribution. For instance,

the burden of the 75-90th and 90-100th percentiles would fall from 4.2 to 3.4 percent and 5.5 to

4.3 percent (see the third row of the table).33

        The SIPP does not provide complete information on subsidized sources of care. To

estimate the effects of eliminating such subsidies (whether they come from government or

private sources) we assume that any day care provided in centers, pre-schools or family day care

facilities at a cost of less than $1 per hour is subsidized. We then calculate the expenses of non-

subsidized care by replacing the actual hourly costs of subsidized care with the sample average

hourly cost for unsubsidized hours of care from these sources.34 The results of this exercise,

shown in the fourth row of the table, indicate that the removal of subsidies would dramatically

increase the cost burden of low SES families (e.g. from 5.6 and 4.7 percent to 8.9 and 6.6 percent


33
  These are all partial equilibrium effects because we assume that income and payroll taxes would be eliminated
without replacing them by any offsetting source of government revenue.
34
  The average cost of care costing more than $1 per hour in centers, preschools, and family day care facilities is
$2.47 per hour. Our calculations will understate the effects of removing subsidies if some care costing more than $1
per hour is subsidized.


                                                      Page 21
for the 0-10th and 10-25th percentiles) and result in a substantial rise through the 75th percentile of

the predicted income distribution, while having smaller effects for the top quartile. These results

further emphasize the importance of free and low cost sources of care in holding down the child

care cost burden.

       Since low SES families use cheaper types of child care and also pay less within modes,

making patterns of day care use more similar along either of these dimensions would

dramatically increase inequality in the cost burden of child care. As illustrated in the fifth row,

equalization of the cost per hour within (but not across) modes of care, combined with existing

patterns of use, would cause the average cost burden to rise from 5.6 to 9.6 percent for the 0-10th

percentile and from 4.7 to 6.9 percent for the 10-25th percentile, whereas the burden would fall

from 4.2 to 3.7 percent for the 75-90th percentile and from 5.5 to 4.2 percent for the 90-100th

percentile. If the cost per hour of child care was equalized for all families (across as well as

within modes), the average cost burden would be 12.6, 9.8, 3.5, and 3.3 percent for the 0-10, 10-

25, 75-90, and 90-100th percentiles (see row six).

       The last row of Table 11 demonstrates the average cost burden if hours of day care were

unchanged, taxes and transfer payments were eliminated, and all families paid the sample

average amount for each hour of care. In this case, the burden of child care would be over twice

as high as that actually observed for the 0-10th percentiles (14.2 vs. 5.6 percent) and 10-25th

percentiles (11.3 vs. 4.7 percent), while declining by almost one-third for the 75-90th percentile

(from 4.2 to 2.9 percent) and by more than half for the highest decile (from 5.5 to 2.6 percent).

Moreover, the families in the 0-10th (10-25th) percentiles would expect to spend over five (four)

times as much of their income on child care as the top decile.

                                           8. Discussion



                                                Page 22
         Children under the age of six (in 1999) live in families spending an average of $135

month on day care and with disposable incomes averaging $3,060 per month. Dividing the first

number by the second suggests that 4.4 percent of income is devoted to child care. This simple

calculation provides a misleading indication of the child care burden for two reasons. First, it

overweights higher income families. We calculate that the child care burden for the average

family is a somewhat higher 4.9 percent.35

         More importantly, any calculation of the average cost burden conceals tremendous

variation in child care spending. Perhaps most striking is that 63 percent of young children live

in families that have no child care expenses. In roughly two-thirds of cases this is because no

non-immediate family day care is used. However, the remainding families do use child care but

pay nothing for it. The majority of free (or very low cost) care is provided by relatives (such as

grandparents), although subsidized care in more formal settings is received by a substantial

fraction of families.

         Another noteworthy result is that average hours and cost burdens of child care are

relatively constant across SES groups, as measured by predicted family income. For instance,

the 0-10th percentile average 26.3 hours of day care weekly and pay 5.6 percent of their income

for it; the 90-100th percentile use 27.9 hours per week and spend 5.5 percent of income on it.

The similarity of cost burdens, despite much higher incomes at the top of the distribution, occurs

because disadvantaged families make far more extensive use of cheaper types of care and pay

less for any given mode. One likely implication is that at least some of the efforts made by


35
  Consider a sample of three families with child care costs of $79, $98, and $313 and incomes of $1,152, $1,990,
and $8,534 (corresponding to the sample averages for families in the 10-25th, 25-50th, and 90-100th percentiles of the
actual income distribution). Total spending on child care is $490 and total incomes are $11,676 implying that 4.2
percent of income is spent on day care. Conversely, the three families devote 6.9 percent, 4.9 percent, and 3.7
percent of their incomes to day care, imply that the average across families is 5.2 percent. The first procedure
provides a smaller number because it weights the expenditures of high income families (who have smaller cost
burdens) more heavily, whereas the second gives each family an equal weight in calculating the average.

                                                       Page 23
disadvantaged families to minimize the burden of child care come at the cost of accepting lower

quality services.36 Our evidence also suggests that accounting for child care expenses would

raise the extent of measured income inequality, providing further evidence of the difficult

situation of the least advantaged families.

         These results notwithstanding, the cost burden of child care (and the quality of services

received) would probably be much more unequal were it not for the efforts of low SES families

to minimize expenses, of government tax and transfer policies that redistribute resources towards

needy families, and of low cost (presumably subsidized) formal care that is focused on them.

For instance, if all families paid the same amount for each hour of day care but did not change

the amount used, the cost burden for the 0-10th and 10-25th percentiles would rise from 5.6 and

4.7 percent to 12.6 and 9.8 percent, while those of the 75-90th and 90-100th percentiles would

decline from 4.2 and 5.5 percent to 3.5 and 3.3 percent. Eliminating taxes and transfer payments

would further raise cost burdens of the bottom two groups, to 14.2 and 11.3 percent, while

lowering those of the top two to 2.9 and 2.6 percent. These comparisons ignore the behavioral

responses that would accompany such changes (e.g. shifting to cheaper modes or reducing total

child care hours by low SES families), but nevertheless suggest that the current policy

environment provides at least some assistance to disadvantaged families.

         Our results should be viewed with caution for several reasons. As mentioned, we have

looked at the cost of care and make some inferences about quality but do not have direct

information on the latter. Similarly, we use the presence of extremely low-cost formal care as

36
   There is also direct evidence that higher income families use higher quality care within modes (e.g. Galinsky, et
al., 1994) and that more formal modes tend to offer higher quality of care (see Meyers et al., 2004 for a detailed
discussion). Evidence that reductions in the cost of care cause parents to substitute market forms for less formal
arrangements is provided by Michalopoulos and Robins 2002; Micholopoulos, Robins and Garfinkel 1992;
Cleveland et al 1996; and Powell 1997. In his comprehensive study of child care choices, Blau (2001) concludes
that “parents feel most ‘priced out’ of center and family day care and would prefer these types over other
nonparental care and parental care if they were equally as cheap” (p. 74).

evidence of subsidies, in the absence of direct data on these. Child care and family income will

also sometimes be reported with error, particularly given the short period of time to which the

data refer. This could be important since estimates of the average cost burden (but not most

other distributional measures) are somewhat sensitive to the treatment of outliers. Another

potential issue is the use of family rather than household incomes. Although the distinction is

generally not important, since the family and household are usually one and the same,

disadvantaged families relatively often reside in households containing other adults which,

depending on the nature of within-household income transfers, has the potential for reducing

child care cost burdens when measured as a percentage of family incomes.37

         Much exciting research remains to be done.




37
  Using household rather than family incomes reduces the average cost burden from 4.9 to 4.4 percent and from 5.6
to 4.6 percent for the 0-10th percentile, 4.7 to 3.9 percent for the 10-25th percentile, 5.6 to 4.9 percent for the 25-50th
percentile, 4.1 to 3.8 percent for the 50-75th percentile, 4.2 to 4.2 percent for the 75-90th percentile, and 5.5 to 5.4
percent for the 90-100th percentile of the predicted income distribution.

Source: Data are from wave 10 of the 1996 panel of the SIPP.
Note: Estimation is by OLS in the first column and binary probit in the next two. Observations are
 weighted using SIPP child weights (described in Table 1). The coefficient estimates give the predicted
 effect of a marginal change in the explanatory variable (with other regressors evaluated at their variable
 means for the probit models). Robust standard errors, estimated assuming that observations are
 independent across but not within families, are shown in parentheses. See Tables 1 and 2 and the text

  the specified percentiles based upon the specified family income variable and sample means are
  calculated weighting observations by SIPP child weights (described in Table 1). See Tables 1 and 2 and

  transfers plus income/payroll taxes plus other non-tax/non-transfer income. Welfare income includes
  Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF), General Assistance (GA), and Food Stamps. Non-
  welfare transfer income includes Social Security, Unemployment Compensation, Workers’
  Compensation, Supplemental Security Income (SSI), Veteran’s Benefits, and other small government
  programs. Payroll taxes include the employee half of Social Security and Medicare payroll taxes. See
  Table 1 and the text for additional details.

 Compensation, Workers’ Compensation, SSI, Veteran’s Benefits, and other small government
 programs. Taxes included federal and state income taxes and the employee half of Social Security and
 Medicare payroll taxes. “Burden Without Subsidized Formal Care” assumes that all free or less than a
 dollar per hour care in centers, preschools/nursery schools, family day care, and Head Start cost $2.47
 per hour, the mean cost for unsubsidized formal care. “Burden With Equal Hourly Costs by Mode”
 assumes that hourly costs by mode are the same for all families in the sample, but hours and mode
 choices differ across families. “Burden With Equal Hourly Child Care Costs” assumes that hourly costs
 are the same for all families, but hours differ across families. See Tables 1 and 2 and the text for
