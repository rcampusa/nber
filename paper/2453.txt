             Symmetric Pass-Through of Tariffs and Exchange Rates

                Under Imperfect Competition: An Empirical Test




                                     ABSTRACT


      This paper examines the effect of tariffs and exchange rates on U.S.

prices   of Japanese cars, trucks and motorcycles. In particular, we test
whether the long run pass—through of tariffs and exchange rates are identical
the   symmetry hypothesis. We find that this hypothesis is easily accepted in

our sample. We also find that the pass-through relation varies across

products, ranging from about 0.6 for trucks to unity for motorcycles.    These

coefficients have very different implications for trade policy. We explain

the results based on demand, cost and institutional conditions in each

industry. We also find weak evidence that the pass-through of exchange rates

has   fallen in more recent years.

1.   Introduction


     The appreciation of the dollar during 1979—85 has led to renewed interest

in the "passthrough1' relationship between exchange rates and traded goods

prices. A number of recent studies, including Woo (1984), Mann (1986),

Dornbusch (1987), Giovannini (1987), and Krugman and Baldwin (1987), have

analyzed the extent to which U.S. import prices failed to fall by as much as

the value of foreign currencies. These authors generally appeal to some model

of imperfect competition, whereby foreign producers increased their profit

margins during the 1979-85 period. In contrast, after 1985 import prices have

not risen by as much as the dollar depreciation, and foreign profit margins

are being squeezed.

     Concurrent with these studies, a body of literature has grown on the

effects of trade policy under imperfect competition.1 Katrak (1977), De Meza

(1979), Svedberg (1979) and Brander and Spencer (1984) analyze how a foreign

monopolist faced with a tariff will optimally change its producer price.     If

the producer price is lowered then the tariff is less than fully passed

through in consumer prices, and the importing country experiences a terms of

trade and welfare gain.   In this case there is a Hterms of trade argument for

import protection, but it is due to imperfect competition abroad rather than

the traditional large country model.

     In section 2 we demonstrate that a permanent change in exchange rates or

ad valorem tariffs have identical effects on the consumer price of imports,

with a foreign oligopolistic supplier. The purpose of our paper is to test

this hypothesis using data for Japanese car, truck and motorcycle imports. A
                                      —2—

test of the symmetry hypothesis is of particular interest because there is

abundant evidence that exchange rates are less than fully passed through in

some markets.2 If this result also holds for tariffs in our sample, we can

appeal to symmetry to suggest that the result may hold for trade policy in

other markets. This is a significant step towards establishing the empirical

validity of the "terms of trade" argument for tariffs, under imperfect

competition.
     Our empirical specification is outlined in section 3 and results are

presented in section 4. We find that the symmetry hypothesis is easily

accepted for the tariff changes which occurred in truck and heavy cycle

imports. For trucks the pass-through coefficient which applies to either a

permanent change in exchange rates or the tariff is estimated as 0.582

(standard error of 0,062). In contrast, for heavy cycles we obtain a

pass—through of unity or even higher. For cars the tariff did not change over

the sample period, and the pass-through of exchange rates is 0.725. Thus,

while we are able to accept the symmetry hypothesis, we observe a wide range

of pass—through coefficients in our sample (this result is also found by

Krugman, 1987 using German data). These coefficients have very different

implications for trade policy, since a tariff coefficient which is less than

(equal to) unity implies a nationally optimal tariff which is positive (zero).

Some reasons for this variation in our results across industries are offered

in section 4. We also examine whether the pass—through of exchange rates has

fallen in more recent years, as suggested by Mann (1986) and Baldwin (1987),

and find weak evidence to support this hypothesis. Conclusions are given in

section 5.

2.   Pricing Under Imperfect Competition


     We consider a variant of the model used by Brander and Spencer (1984).

The home currency price of the imported and domestic varieties of a good are

denoted by p and q, respectively.3 Import demand is x(p,q,I) where I denotes

income. The foreign firm maximizes expected profits in its own currency,

treating q as exogenous.4 We shall assume that its pricing decision must be

made before the exchange rate is known with certainty. As discussed by

McKinnon (1979, chap. 4), Baron (1976) and Giovannini (1987), the foreign firm

then faces a decision as to which currency to use in announcing its price. We

shall not analyse this problem, but rely on the fact that 82 percent of

Japanese auto sales to the U.S. are invoiced in dollars (Hamada and Horiuchi,

1987, Table 7.6). Since our empirical work deals with this market, we shall

simply assume that the foreign firm sets its price in the domestic currency,

i.e., chooses p.

     Denote the foreign spot price of the domestic currency by s, which is

random. Costs in the foreign currency are given by C(x,w*), where w denotes

an aggregate of foreign factor prices, and is treated as a scalar. Assuming

that costs are homogeneous of degree one in factor prices, they can be written

as C(x,w*) =    (x)w*,   where •'   > o (< 0)   indicates rising (falling) marginal

costs. The foreign firm's profit maximization problem can then be stated as,


        max
               E{spx(p,q,I) —   (x)w*},                                           (1)



where E denotes expected value. We assume that variables other than the

exchange rate are nonrandom.5 Letting e = E(s) denote the expected exchange

rate, (1) can be rewritten as,
                                              -4-

          max {epx(p,q,I) —                                                          (1')
This certainty—equivalent structure to the firm's problem would not arise if

the import prices were set in the foreign currency; see Baron (1976) and

Giovannini (1987).

     The first order condition for (1') is,


                          =   p[1-(l/n)]   r(p,q,I),                                   (2)



where r = _XpP/x denotes the (positive) elasticity of demand and r(p,q,I)

denotes marginal revenue. Assuming that ["xp(w*/e) —             rp]   0,   we can invert

(2) to obtain the pricing equation,


          p =   r(w,q,I),                                                              (3)



where w =   w*/e denotes foreign factor prices in the domestic currency.
     Equation (3) shall be estimated in the following sections.              Our purpose

here is to show how the elasticities of r depend on the underlying demand and

cost functions. A general property of r          is    that it is homogeneous of degree

one in its arguments. That is, increasing w, q and I by the same proportion

would increase the optimal import price by that proportion. To see this, note

that the demand function x(p,q,I) must be homogeneous of degree zero in its

arguments. It follows that the first derivative x(p,q,I) is homogeneous of

degree negative one. Then it is readily seen that if (p,w,q,I) satisfies the

first order condition (2), then x(p,w,q,I) also satisifies this equation, for

any x >   0.    Thus, ,   is   homogeneous of degree one and this property can be

empirically tested.

2.1 Changes in the Exchange Rate, Domestic Price, and Income


     Totally differentiating (2), we obtain


        (dpldw)(wlp) =                  1/[('x/)         +
                                                             (rpp/r)].                                   (4)


Recalling that w =            w*/e,         this elasticity gives the change in the import price

due to a change in the expected exchange rate or foreign factor prices. The

second order condition for profit maximization implies that (4) is positive.6

Its magnitude, however, depends on the underlying form of demand and costs.

     The term (rpp/r) is the elasticity of marginal revenue with respect to

price, which can be written from (2) as,


                                  +
        (rpp/r) =         1
                                       (pIr)(npIii2)
          1 as                    0.                                                                     (5)


Along a linear demand curve flp > 0 so that (rpp/r) >                          1, but the case   <   0    is

certainly possible. The term ("x/) is the elasticity of marginal cost with

respect to output, and its sign is the same as that of ".

     Summarizing results, the following sufficient conditions establish the

magnitude of (4):


           >   0,             >    0 => 0      <   (dp/dw)(wlp)       <   1,                         (6a)


           <   0,   cf'
                              <0       =>    (dp/dw)(w/p)    >   1.                                  (6b)


(6a) is the "normal case where a change in the expected exchange rate (or

foreign factor prices) is less than fully passed through in import price. It

occurs, for example, when demand is close to linear and marginal costs are
                                                       —6-

increasing.7 However, the unusual case where a change in the expected

exchange rate is more than fully passed through cannot be ruled out

theoretically. It occurs, for instance, when the elasticity of demand is

constant or decreasing in price, and marginal costs are declining.

      Turning to the effect of a change in income, from (2) we calculate


          (dp/dI)(I/p) =    [("xI')m — (r1IIr)]                   I [('xI') +      (rpp/r)],              (7)


where m =    x11/x is the income elasticity of demand for the import. The
denominator in (7) is the same as in (4), which is positive. To sign the

numerator, consider the case where m is positive and constant for all prices.

This implies that demand is of the general form mx =                         lnf(p,q)   +   mlnl,   or

x(p,q,I) =     f(p,q)Im.   Calculating the elasticity of demand we obtain

  =            which is independent of income. Thus, marginal revenue does not
      -fop/f
depend on income and r1 =           0.       The sign of (7) then depends on whether marginal

costs are increasing or decreasing:


         m > 0 constant,             >   0 =>     (dp/dI)(I/p)      >   0,                               (8a)


         m > 0 constant, f" < 0 =>                (dp/dI)(I/p)      <   0.                               (8b)


      Lastly, we consider the elasticity of p with respect to the price of the

domestic variety q. Since                in (3) is homogeneous of degree one its

elasticities must sum to unity, and so


         (dp/dq)(q/p) =     1   —
                                     (dp/dw)(w/p)      -
                                                           (dp/dI)(I/p)
               =
                   [("x/')(-m)           +
                                              (pnpln2)(p/r)    +    (rjl/r)1
                                             ,/   [(x/4)      +
                                                                   (rpp/r)].                             (9)
                                               —7—

using (4), (5) and (7). The magnitude of (9) can be inferred from our earlier

results. For example, if (8a) holds then the first equality in (9)

immediately implies that (dp/dq)(q/p) <         1,   so an increase in the domestic

price is less than fully matched in the import price. If (6a) and (8a) both

hold and       > in, then the second equality in (9) implies that (dp/dq)(q/p) >        0.
By also examining the converse case, we obtain the following results:


           (6a), (8a) and      in => 0   <   (dp!dq)(q!p)       <   1,                (lOa)


           (6b), (8b) and      in =>   (dp/dq)(q/p)    <   0.                         (lOb)


In (lOa) a rise in the domestic price is less than fully matched by an

increase in the import price. In contrast, under (lob) the import price would

fall. This occurs, for example, when prices are a constant markup over

marginal costs (r = 0) and the latter are declining as imports rise (c < 0

with r      in).


     Note that in the analysis above we have treated the domestic price q as a

parameter. It would not difficult to treat q as endogenous by adding a

condition analogous to (2) for the domestic price. Then the effects of

changing the expected exchange rate or factor prices would be obtained by

comparative statistics on the two equation system. We do not report these

results here, since our empirical specification will focus directly on the

pricing equation (3), the properties of which we have characterized above.

2.2 Changes in the Ad Valorem Tariff


       Suppose that an ad valorem tariff of r is applied to imports. Let p

denote the consumer price of imports, so the foreign firm receives p/(1+r).

With e still denoting the expected exchange rate, the foreign profit

maximization problem can be stated as,


          max
                {e[p/(1+t)]x(p,q,I) —     (x)w*}
                          max
          =   [e/(1+T)]         {px(p,q,I) —   •(x)[w*(1+T)/e]}.              (2')



       The structure of (2') makes it clear that a change in the tariff (1+T)

has the same effect on the consumer price p as a change in (w*/e). This point

is also seen by writing the first order condition for (2') as

=
    r(p,q,I),   and inverting to obtain


          p =   ,r[w(1+t),q,I],                                               (3')


where w =     w*/e as before. Any changes in the tariff or expected exchange rate
which have the same effect on (1+r)/e will have identical pass—through on the

consumer price of imports: this is the symmetry hypothesis.

      Because of symmetry, the elasticity of the consumer import price with

respect to (1+T) is given by (4) and (6). From (6a), if the elasticity of

demand is increasing in price (as with linear demand) and marginal costs are

rising, then the tariff is less than fully passed through in the import price.

This means that p/(1+T), which is the foreign producer price, is reduced.

This rise in the terms of trade corresponds to an increase in welfare for the
                                           —9 -

domestic country (Katrak, 1977; Svedberg, 1979; Brander and Spencer, 1984).

Thus, under conditions (6a) there is a "terms of trade" argument for import

protection, due to oligopolistic pricing abroad.

     If (6b) holds then nationally optimal intervention instead takes the form

of an import subsidy (DeMeza, 1979; Brander and Spencer, 1984). The negative

value of T   is   more than fully passed through in the import price, so p/(1+T)

is reduced. This again corresponds to a rise in the terms of trade and

increase in welfare for the importing country.

     Note that the welfare results stated above apply when q is held constant

and profits of the domestic firm are not affected by the tariff. If instead q

is endogenous and profits change, then the welfare analysis is more complex.

First, we must consider the impact of the tariff on profits of domestic firms,

which depends on the assumed market structure, i.e., on the conjectural

variations and possibility of entry (Brander and Spencer, 1981; Eaton and

Grossman, 1986; Horstmann and Markusen, 1986). Second, we should recognize

that a tariff which increases domestic output can reduce the divergence

between marginal cost and marginal utility of the domestic variety (Eaton and

Grossman, 1986). Third, we could consider the effect of the tariff on the

number of varieties produced by domestic and foreign firms (Feenstra and Judd,

1982; Feenstra, 1988b). These various effects could be combined in a

computable model, as done by Dixit (1988) for the U.S. auto industry. Our

goal in this paper is more limited, however, and we shall just evaluate the

"terms of trade' effect by estimating the pass-through of tariffs and the

exchange rate, using the pricing equation (3').
                                                            - 10    -



3.   Regression Specification and Data


     We shall use a log—linear specification for (3'):



        lflpt =     ct   +
                             czln(w/et)
                                                  +   lfl(1+tt)    +    ylnq   +   tSlflIt   +          (11)



where ct =                   +              is a time trend and                is a random error. To
              C0 + c1t           c2t2
estimate (11) we must specify how the expected exchange rate is determined.

We shall suppose that the expected rate in each quarter is a log—linear

function of the current and past quarterly-average spot rates:


                    k
        lne =        z e.lns
                    i=0
                             1
                                        ..
                                        1
                                                                                                        (12)



The coefficients ei in (12) would depend on the time-series properties of

exchange rates. For example, if the spot rates follow a random walk then

rational expectations would be formed with e = 1 and 0j = 0 for I                                1.    Other

cases are considered by Frankel and Froot (1987). Including the current

quarterly—average exchange rate s in (12) is meant to reflect information

received by firms within a quarter which is then immediately reflected in

prices. If our units of time were smaller, such as monthly or weekly, then

omitting the current spot rate would be appropriate.8

     Substituting (12) into (11), we shall estimate the pricing equation (3')

as follows:



                                                           +
        1np c +              i0                                ln(1+Tt)

                                                                 — 11 —

inaccurate measurement of prices (see below) or price presetting for periods

exceeding one quarter (see Giovannini, 1987). When estimating (13) we shall

check for autocorrelation in ci. Quarterly dummies are also used when

needed.

       Our primary reason for estimating (13) is to test for symmetric

pass-through of tariffs and a permanent change in exchange rates. This

symmetry hypothesis is stated as


                         k
                    =    z   .,                                                                   (14a)
                        i=O 1


which is a linear constraint on the coefficients in (13). We also wish to

test that the pricing equation is homogeneous of degree one, which can be

stated as


                k
                        .+
                        1
                                  +     =       1.                                                (14b)
               1=0


This homogeneity test is a check for the overall specification of the pricing

equation, and is analogous to testing that a conventional demand system is

homogeneous of degree zero in prices and income. It will be of particular

interest to test (14a) and (14b) simultaneously.

      Of secondary interest in (13) is the time pattern of the coefficients j,

which indicate the rate at which exchange rate changes are passed though in

import prices. To reduce erratic behavior of the coefficient estimates, we

shall use a second—order polynomial lag on j, so that j = a + bi + ci2. For

k =   4,   as we shall use, we can readily calculate that

         z    8   = 5a   + lOb +   30c.                                      (15)
        i=0


Substituting (15) into (14) shows how symmetry and homogeneity can be tested

when using the polynomial lag.

     We shall estimate the pricing equation separately for U.S. imports of

Japanese cars, compact trucks and heavy motorcycles (greater than 700 cc).

The sample period lies between 1974:1 and 1987:1, depending on data

availability. Japanese trucks experienced an increase in their tariff from 4

to 25 percent, effective August 21, 1980. Heavy motorcycles had a tariff of

45 percent imposed on April 16, 1983, falling annually to 35, 20, 15 and 10

percent, and ending in October 1987. The ad valorem tariff on Japanese cars

did not change during the sample period, so this regression is estimated to

observe the pass-through of exchange rates without testing symmetry.

     The most important features of the data are summarized here. The import

prices are either wholesale (c.i.f.) unit—values inclusive of duty, or Divisia

indexes of several dissaggregate wholesale unit—values. They are obtained

from U.S. Bureau of the Census (1974-1987). In addition to the well known

problems with using unit-values, these data series suffer from not correcting

for quality change. The most pronounced quality change occurred in Japanese

cars (Feenstra 1984, 1988a), which were subject to a uvoluntary export

restraint's since April 1981. This restraint changes the nature of the optimal

pricing decision for importing firms, so (3') no longer applies. For this

reason we omit the period of the trade restraint when estimating the car

regression. Other upgrading which may have occurred in any of the products

can be reflected in the time trend c and random error ct in (13).
                                       — 13 —

     Among the independent variables, the spot exchange rate (measured as a

quarterly average) shows great fluctuation, ranging between 300 and 150

yen/dollar during the sample period. The factor price aggregates w are

measured as the Japanese domestic wholesale prices for each product, available

from the Bank of Japan (1974—1986). They are very stable over time. For cars

and trucks a quarterly price deflator for U.S. absorption (qt), and total U.S.

expenditure on each product ('t) are available from the U.S. Dept. of

Commerce (1974-1987). For cars we also included the unit—value of Geran

imports (from U.S. Bureau of the Census) as another competing price. Since

the variables q and I are endogenous, all the car, truck and cycle

regressions were estimated with instrumental variables.10

     For heavy cycle imports, we had two sources of unit—value data. The

first was interview data reported by the U.S. International Trade Commission

(1983, Table 8, and 1983-1984). The advantage of this data is that it gives

the unit-value of imports for consumption, inclusive of duty, for the major

Japanese importers (Honda, Suzuki and Yamaha). However, the disadvantage is

that the data ends in 1984:4, and it includes German heavy cycles (imported by

BMW) within the reported unit—value.11 A second source was unpublished data

from the U.S. Dept. of Commerce giving the unit—value of import shipments,

distinguishing Japanese and German heavy cycles up to 1987:1.12 The

disadvantage of this data is that import shipments include sales to

inventories, which are very erratic in quantity and to a lesser extent in

unit—value. These data had to be adjusted to include the tariff.13 We shall

use both sources of import price data when estimating the heavy cycle

regression. Finally, data on the price of U.S. heavy cycles was not

available, so the U.S. price of steel was used as a proxy.

4.   Estimation Results


     To determine the appropriate lag length for the exchange rate, we first

estimated (13) with 2, 3, 4 and 5 unconstrained lags. The sum of the

estimated coefficients j from this exercise are reported in Table 1. These

estimates measure the total pass—through of the exchange rate on import

prices. The coefficients for cars are significantly less than unity, while in

contrast,   the coefficients for heavy cycles are close to   one. For trucks and

cycles   the   pass-through estimates reach a maximum with k = 4 quarterly lags.

While there is no generally accepted technique for choosing the length for a

polynomial lag (see Judge etal., 1980, Chap. 5), our approach in this paper

is to make a pass—through of less than unity "prove itself" by including too

many lags rather than too few. We experimented with a lag length of 3 and 4

quarters, but since the results were quite similar, we report below only the

results for a second-order polynomial lag with k =    4.   Note that using the

polynomial lag leads to       coefficents which are not significantly different

from the unconstrained estimates.

     In Table 2 we report the estimates of (13) without imposing the symmetry

or homogeneity constraints (14). Quarterly dummies were used in the

motorcycle regressions, but were not needed for cars or trucks since their

t—statistics in those cases were less than unity. The time trend in (13) was

used in each of the regressions, but its coefficients and those of the

quarterly dummies are not reported.14 For heavy cycles the "pooled"

regression in the last column simply stacks the "consumption" and "shipments"

regressions, which differ in their measurement of the import price (see

section 3).
                                       — 15 —




     Considering the results in Table 2, the pass-through coefficients range
from 0.627 for trucks to about unity for cycles. These results differ

slightly from Table 1 since the polynomial lag was not used there. It can be

seen that the pass—through is quite rapid since the j estimates are nearly

zero for the third lag, and also for the second lag except in cars. The

coefficents on the final lag move away from zero in some cases, especially for

cycles (shipments). When a fifth lag is added to the cycle regressions

(without using the polynomial constraint) then the estimates of j for the

fourth lag are still positive and high, but are zero for the fifth lag. Thus,

there is some curious annual effect in the cycle data, whereby the import

price depends on the exchange rate one year ago.

     Turning to other coefficients in Table 2, the elasticity of the import

price with reprect to the tariff is 0.570 for trucks and between 0.949 and

1.388 for cycles. These estimates are within two standard errors of the

pass—through coefficients for the exchange rate, which suggests that the

symmetry hypothesis will be accepted. The coefficients of the U.S. price

differ substantially in magnitude over the products, but are insignificant.

The coefficients of the German price, and income, are all highly

insignificant. Note that the Dut'bin-Watson statistics are surprisingly good.

     We also ran the regressions while separating w from the exchange rate

terms. The coefficents we obtain on w vary substantially in magnitude

(ranging from —1 for cars to 12 for cycles), but in most cases are

insignificantly different from those in Table 2.   If we omit w entirely, the

estimated pass-through of exchange rates are similar to those in Table 2.
                                         — 16 -


4.1   Test of Symmetry and Homogeneity


      In Table 3 we report estimates of (13) when the symmetry and homogeneity

constraints (14) are imposed. For cars and trucks the exchange rate

pass—through changes slightly, while the coefficients of U.S. and German

prices   improve considerably. In contrast, for heavy cycles the coefficients
of U.S. and German prices are erratic and insignificant. The pass-through of
exchange rates and the tariff is between 0.971 and 1.272.
      In Table 4 we report the calculated F—statistics testing whether the

symmetry and homogeneity constraints (14) can be accepted. Note that because

the regressions are estimated with instrumental variables, the F—statistics

need not be positive, as observed for the homogeneity constraint in cars.15

They are asymptotically distributed as x2(R)/R when the constraints hold,

where R is the number of restrictions. Looking down Table 4, we see that the

symmetry and homogeneity constraints are easily accepted for the individual

products. In the second-last test, we report the F—statistic testing whether

the cycle (consumption) and cycle (shipments) data can be pooled. We accept

this hypothesis and, conditional on it, also accept symmetry and homogeneity

in the pooled cycle regression.

      Acceptance of the homogeneity constraint supports the overall

specification of our regressions. Acceptance of the symmetry constraint is

consistent with the model presented in section 2, and supports our prior

beliefs. Applying this results to other markets, it means that the response

of import prices to exchange rates can be used to predict the effect of

changes in tariffs. This result could be quite useful for the analysis of

trade policy. However, our results also show that the pass—through differs
                                         — 17 —


substantially   across industries, and in particular, is not always less than

unity.

     To explain these results, consider first the tariff coefficient for

trucks. In Feenstra (1988b) the price and characteristics of trucks sold by

American and Japanese producers are studied in detail. Prior to the tariff

increase, nearly all compact trucks were produced by Japanese firms, some of

which were marketed through American automobile companies. After the tariff

was raised to 25 percent in August 1980, U.S. producers quickly introduced

their own compact truck models, but with very similar characteristics to

existing Japanese models. In this environment we would expect price competition

to be intense, and Japanese firms would be very reluctant to pass through the

full amount of the tariff. This is consistent with our estimated tariff

coefficient of 0.582.

     In contrast, for heavy cycles we estimate tariff coefficients of unity or

even higher. We offer two explanations for this result. First, the tariff

increase in April 1983 was applied to both imports from Japan and heavy cycles

produced in the U.S. by Honda and Kawasaki. The latter producers operate plants

in foreign trade zones (FTZ) in the mid-west. When a good is sold from a FTZ

into the U.S., the producer can normally pay the U.S. tariff on either the final

product or imported parts, whichever is less. However, for the case of heavy

cycles, Honda and Kawasaki had to pay the final tariff on their U.S. sales from

the FTZ (see U.S. International Trade Commission, 1987, p. A—6 and Appendix E).

With this rise in U.S. prices (except for Harley—Davidson), it is not too

surprising that the Japanese exporters (Honda, Suzuki and Yamaha) would

pass—through much of the tariff.
                                             - 18   -



       A second important feature of this industry is the dramatic drop in

production following the tariff: total production in Japan was cut in half from

1982 to 1984, 1985 or 1986 (U.S. International Trade Commission, 1987, Table

22). The reason is that U.S. exports accounted for about 60% of Japanese

production prior to the tariff, but these exports dropped to about 15% of their

former quantity after the tariff. Note that U.S. consumption of Japanese heavy

cycles did not drop by this much, because many U.S. sales were made from

previously accumulated inventories.

       In order to cover fixed costs with this drop in production, it is quite

possible that Japanese firms would have to raise their prices, which would cause

consumer prices to increase by more than the tariff. From (4), this is a profit

                              =   0, implying that producer prices are a constant
maximizing response when

markup over marginal costs, and        < 0   so that marginal costs rise with the fall

in output. This scenario is consistent with the tariff coefficient exceeding

unity in our cycles (shipments) regression. However, we cannot make a strong

case that the tariff was more than fully passed through, since the estimated

coefficient in any of the cycle regressions is insignificantly different from

one.



4.2 Pass-Through in Various Time Periods


       The large swings in the value of the dollar during the 1980's has led to the

hypothesis that the pass-through of exchange rates to U.S. import prices may have

fallen. For example, if foreign firms believe that the recent depreciation of

the dollar is temporary, they could resist raising their dollar prices too much,

hoping to retain market share. Several models in which this phenomenon can occur
                                          — 19 —


are analysed by Krugman (1987), and empirical evidence supporting the hypothesis
for aggregate U.S. import prices is presented in Mann (1986) and Baldwin (1987).

Without making any strong prior case that this phenomenon might apply to our

sample of industries, we can certainly check whether the pass-through has fallen.

        In Table 5 we report the total pass—through of exchange rates (i.e., sum of

.j    coefficients) for trucks and heavy cycles during various sub—periods. We did
not impose symmetry or homogeneity in these regressions, so the pass-through
coefficients can be compared with Table 2.     We also show in Table 5 the
F—statistics    and critical values for testing whether the observations used there

are drawn from the same population as Table 2 (i.e., whether the pass—through

coefficients in the two tables are insignificantly different).16

        For trucks we obtain a pass—through of 0.576 for the 1977—84 period, before

the dollar began to depreciate. This is slightly lower, but insignificantly

different, than the coefficent of 0.627 for the entire 1977-87 period. However,

if    we instead check for a structural break in the truck regression between
1977—80 and 1981-87, when the dollar began its appreciation, we obtain
coefficents    of 0.679 and 0.434, respectively.   Thus, there is weak evidence that
the   pass-through relationship fell, though the change is not significant by the

F—test. For cycles (shipments) we estimate a pass-through which is

insignificantly higher during 1978—84, and lower during 1981—87, than for the

entire 1978—87 period. In cycles (pooled) we obtain a coefficient of 1.051 over

1978—84, which compares with 0.886 over 1978—87, again giving weak evidence that

the pass-through of exchange rates has fallen.

5.       Conclusions


         In this paper we have used data on U.S. imports of Japanese cars, trucks

and motorcycles to estimate the pass-through of exchange rates and tariffs.

For trucks we have found a pass—through of about 0.6. This means that the

increase in the tariff from 4 to 25 percent in August 1980 raised consumer

prices by an estimated 13 percent, and lowered Japanese producer prices by

about 8 percent. In contrast, for heavy cycles we found a pass-through of

about unity, so the tariff increase in April 1983 and subsequent decreases had

little effect on Japanese producer prices. These results have very different

implications for trade policy. In trucks, the drop in the producer price

corresponds to a terms of trade gain. While there are several other factors

which should be considered before evaluating welfare (see section 2.2), this is

a first step toward establishing a gain for the U.S. For heavy cycles, the

constant producer prices means that the tariff led to a conventional deadweight

1 oss.

         However, our purpose in this paper has not been to judge the efficacy of

trade policy in specific industries. Instead, we have evaluated more generally

a model of imperfect competition and trade, in which foreign firms respond to

tariff and exchange rate changes by adjusting their producer prices. This model

led to the estimating equation (3'), which performed quite well on the industry

data. In particular, we were able to accept the hypothesis of symmetric

pass-through of tariffs and exchange rates. This means that the response of

import prices to exchange rates can be used to predict the effect of changes in

tariffs. But the variation in our results across industries means that

empirical evidence is needed in each case, and that we cannot make general

statements about the extent of pass-through.

Foot notes


1.   In contrast to this paper, much of the literature deals with a "profit

     shifting" motive for import protection. See Brander and Spencer (1981),

     Dixit (1984) and Eaton and Grossman (1986). Horstmann and Markusen

     (1986) argue that the "profit shifting" motive disappears when entry is

     free, but a "terms of trade" motive persists, as analyzed here.

2.   See Dunn (1970), Clark, Logue and Sweeney (1974), Isard (1977), Kravis

     and Lipsey (1977), Richardson (1978), Schembri and Robicheau (1986) and

     the papers mentioned above.

3.   For expositional convenience, we consider only a single variety of each

     imported and domestic good. The case of many varieties of each is

     examined in Feenstra (1986), and the results are basically identical to

     those reported below.

4.   Thus, we are assuming the foreign and domestic firms act as Betrand

     competitors, whereas Brander and Spencer (1984) consider Cournot

     competition. Our results are very similar, which demonstrates that they

     do not depend on the market structure assumed. In contrast, see Eaton

     and Grossman (1986) who analyze how the "profit shifting" motive for

     import protection depends on the market structure.

5.   More general sources of uncertainty are examined in Giovannini (1987).

6.   To see this, differentiate (1') with respect to p obtaining H(p)x/e =        0,
     where H(p) =   r(p,q,I)   —
                                   4'(x)w   as in (2). The second order condition is

     then H'(p)xp/e     H(p)xpp/e < 0. Since Xp < 0 and H(p) = 0 from (2), the

     second order condition reduces to H'(p) > 0, which can be rewritten as

     (4) > 0.

7.   More generally, we can think of      >   0 as specifying the class of demand

     curves which are less convex (more linear) than constant-elasticity

     curves, while    < 0   specifies the class which are more convex.

8. With quarterly data an alternative procedure would have been to include

     the spot rate at the end of the last quarter in (12), but this rate

     suffers from daily random error. We could also have included the forward

     rate in (12), but from the results of Meese and Rogoff (1983) this is not

     a better predictor of the exchange rate than the lagged spot rate.

9. The tariff protection was meant to expire in April 1988, but ended early

     at the request of Harley—Davidson. The reasons for protection in each of

     these industries and background data are provided by Hufbauer, Berliner

     and Elliot (1986).

10. The instrumental variables were the U.S. price of steel (from U.S. Bureau

     of Labor Statistics, Producer Price Indexes), wages in car or truck parts

     and body manufacturing (from U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Employment

     and Earnings), U.S. consumer prices, U.S. private consumption, U.S.

     treasury bill rate, German aggregate wages, German consumer prices, and

     the current and two lags of the quarterly—average mark/dollar exchange

     rate (all from International Monetary Fund, International Financial

     Statistics).

11. More disaggregated data were not reported to preserve business

     confidentiality. Before 1983 German imports are less than five percent

     of Japanese imports (by value or quantity of quarterly shipments), but

     during and after 1983 this figure ranges between 20 and 35 percent.
                                              — 23 —


12.   These data were kindly provied by Juanita Kavalauskas of the U.S.

      International Trade Commission, who also helped with my many questions.

      All data used in this study are available on request.

13. Note that the tariff rates only applied to Japanese imports of heavy

      cycles exceeding certain quotas (ranging from 6,000 to 10,000 units

      depending on the year). Thus, for shipments exceeding the quota, the

      unit-value of imports was multiplied by the appropriate tariff.

14. The time trends did not show any consistent pattern, and were often

      insignificant.

15. The SSR shown in Tables 2 and 3, and used in the F—tests, equals

      (y—Xb)'(y—Xb) where b is the vector of estimated coefficients using

      I   nstrumental van abi es, but X   is the matrix of actual dependent

      variables    before they are regressed on the instruments. This SSR will
      not necessarily rise when constraints are imposed on b.

16. The second test we perform for trucks is a conventional Chow test, where

      the entire sample period is split between two sub—periods. However, in

      other cases we did not have sufficient observations to estimate the

      coefficients in both of the sub—periods. In those cases the SSR in the

      shorter sub—period is zero, with the number of coefficients exactly equal

      to the number of observations. The F—statistic is then calculated as

      described in the notes to Table 5.
