This paper analyzes the effect of Medicaid eligibility expansions on the health insurance coverage
of women giving birth and on the use of prenatal care and infant health, controlling for year and state
effects and state-specific trends that may be correlated with expansions in Medicaid eligibility. We
combine estimates from the two sets of analyses to construct estimates of the effect of health insurance
on use of prenatal care and infant health. We find that the eligibility expansions reduced the proportion
of pregnant women who were uninsured by approximately 10 percent, although this decrease in uninsured
came with the expense of a substantial reduction in private insurance coverage. Changes in Medicaid
eligibility were associated with very small and statistically insignificant changes in prenatal care use,
birth weight, and incidence of low-birth weight.

Introduction:

        The Medicaid income eligibility expansions that began in the latter half of the 1980s were

initially focused on poor, pregnant women and were intended to improve and narrow socioeconomic

disparities in infant health (The National Commission to Prevent Infant Mortality, 1988). From this

somewhat modest beginning, Medicaid has expanded dramatically to the point where today Medicaid

pays for the cost of approximately 40 percent of all births and provides health insurance for nearly 30

percent of all children in the United States.1 Further expansion of Medicaid and its look-alike programs

(e.g., the State Children's Health Insurance Program) form the basis of several state and federal proposals

to expand health insurance coverage.

        Surprisingly, there is little evidence that the expansion of Medicaid has improved infant health, or

narrowed socioeconomic disparities in infant health. For example, simple descriptive statistics on infant

mortality and low-birth weight provide little evidence that Medicaid expansions have coincided with an

improvement in infant health or decreased socioeconomic disparities in infant health. Figure 1 shows a

steady decline in infant mortality from 1980 to 2000 for both white and black infants and there is no

evidence of a narrowing of the racial gap or of changes in the rate of improvement that coincide with

expansions of Medicaid.2 Rates of low birth weight have increased between 1980 and 2000 and there is

no break in trend here either that coincides with the Medicaid expansions. Likewise, it is more the

exception than the rule that more sophisticated research has uncovered a beneficial effect of Medicaid

expansions on infant or child health (Howell 2001; Hadley 2003; Levy and Meltzer 2008).

        The absence of more substantial and consistent evidence demonstrating the health benefits of

Medicaid is notable because an important part of the justification for expanding Medicaid is to improve

population health by preventing illness. Specifically, the initial expansions of Medicaid that were focused

on pregnant women were partly motivated by the 1985 Institute of Medicine Report (IOM 1985) entitled

Preventing Low Birthweight, which concluded that more, and more timely, prenatal care could reduce

                                                                                                            2
infant mortality by preventing low birth weight. The Report of the National Commission to Prevent

Infant Mortality (1988) also linked universal access to prenatal care to the prevention of low birth weight

and infant mortality, and noted the cost-effectiveness of such spending relative to post-birth intervention

to prevent infant mortality.

        The jury is still out on the efficacy of Medicaid in improving infant health because even after

more than 20 years of experience there is simply too little evidence on which to base a conclusion. Part

of the explanation for the absence of more definitive evidence is the absence of suitable data and the

difficulty of conducting non-experimental research. There is relatively little data available that has

information on both insurance coverage and infant health. For example, vital statistics has information on

birth weight and other measures of infant health, but no information on health insurance status. Similarly,

while the National Health Interview Survey has information on health insurance status, it has limited

information on infant health. The lack of information about infant health and insurance coverage in the

same survey makes it difficult to link Medicaid coverage directly to infant health. Because of this, all

previous studies that exploit the natural experiment afforded by the Medicaid expansions have examined

the relationship between Medicaid eligibility and infant health (i.e., reduced form model) and not the

relationship between Medicaid (insurance) participation and infant health (i.e., structural model). While

this approach is reasonable, and will be one of the multiple approaches we take, there may be a weak link

between Medicaid eligibility and the probability that a pregnant woman has health insurance. This is

because most women, even poor women, have private insurance and because of the potential for families

to substitute public for private insurance (i.e., crowd out). Indeed, several studies of children and families

have reported large crowd out effects (Cutler and Gruber 1996; Dubay and Kenney 1997; Lo Sasso and

Buchmueller 2004; Gruber and Simon 2008). However, insurance coverage during pregnancy is the most

relevant for infant health, and there is only one study that we are aware of that has examined the effect of

the Medicaid expansions on health insurance coverage of women who are pregnant (Dubay and Kenney

1997). Thus, it is difficult to assess the credibility of previous studies of the relationship between

Medicaid eligibility and infant health because little is known about the relationship between Medicaid


                                                                                                              3
eligibility and health insurance coverage of pregnant women, which is a critical link in the causal chain of

reasoning that connects Medicaid eligibility to health.

        The second impediment to establishing a credible base of evidence regarding the effect of the

Medicaid expansions on infant health is the difficulty of conducting non-experimental research even in

the context of the natural experiment provided by the Medicaid expansions. Previous studies and the

ongoing debate related to insurance crowd out have demonstrated that there are state-specific trends

correlated with the timing and magnitude of the Medicaid expansions that can significantly affect

estimates (Card and Shore-Sheppard 2004; Gruber and Simon 2008; Shore-Sheppard 2008). In short,

Medicaid expansions are not randomly occurring natural experiments.

        In this paper, we begin to address some of these issues. First, we provide an extensive analysis of

the effect of Medicaid expansions on the health insurance coverage of pregnant women (infants). As

noted, there is only one previous study on this topic even though knowledge of the effects of the Medicaid

expansions on health insurance coverage is essential to its evaluation. Second, we assess the effect of the

Medicaid expansions on infant health and use of medical services associated with deliveries (e.g., prenatal

care). While this is an area with a substantial amount of prior research, we use a new data source, the

National Hospital Discharge Survey, and examine some previously unstudied outcomes. We also pay

particular attention to research design issues and assessing the threats to validity such as the existence of

state-specific trends that may be correlated with expansions in Medicaid eligibility that may explain some

of the disparate findings of previous research. Third, we combine the two reduced form analyses to

construct implied estimates of the effect of health insurance on infant health and use of medical services

associated with deliveries. Here too, we will make a novel contribution as there is no reliable evidence of

the effect of insurance status itself on infant health.



The Effect of Medicaid Expansions on Health Insurance Coverage of Pregnant Women:

        In the sole previous study of the effect of Medicaid expansions on the health insurance coverage

of pregnant women, Dubay and Kenney (1997) provided a simple descriptive analysis of changes in


                                                                                                                4
health insurance coverage of pregnant women using data from the Current Population Study (CPS) from

1989 to 1993 to study health insurance coverage between 1988 and 1992. The analysis consisted of

examining changes in health insurance coverage for pregnant women with incomes less than 185 percent

of the federal poverty level, which is approximately the maximum level of income to retain eligibility for

Medicaid in 1992. The results indicated that for women in this income group, there was an increase in

Medicaid coverage, a decrease in private health insurance coverage and a decrease in the proportion of

pregnant women who are uninsured. Results differed markedly by income. For poor women, defined as

those with incomes under 100 percent of federal poverty, there was a modest increase in both Medicaid

coverage and private insurance coverage and a seven percentage point decrease in the proportion of

women uninsured between 1988 and 1992. For near-poor women with incomes between 100 and 185

percent of federal poverty, there was virtually no change in the proportion uninsured during the same

period; the proportion with Medicaid increased by approximately 15 percentage points and the proportion

with private health insurance decreased by approximately 15 percentage points. Given that private health

insurance coverage was falling generally during this period (for example private insurance coverage for

men declined by seven percentage points) Dubay and Kenney (1997) concluded that the Medicaid

expansions resulted in a net increase in insurance coverage of approximately six percentage points among

near-poor women.

        There are several limitations of this study. Pregnant women in the CPS are identified by women

who have children under the age of one at the time of the survey, and questions about insurance status

refer to the year prior to the survey year. Therefore, responses to health insurance coverage questions

may reflect coverage at the time of the survey, or coverage before or after the birth of the child during the

previous year. In addition, not all children and mothers can be linked in the CPS. Also, Dubay and

Kenney (1997) did not produce an estimate of the relationship between Medicaid eligibility and insurance

coverage. Finally, the use of men as a comparison group was not justified and there are good reasons to

believe that trends in their health insurance coverage would differ from trends in the health insurance

coverage of pregnant women given differences in employment, occupation and family structure.


                                                                                                            5
         Despite the problems with this study, a potentially important finding is that Medicaid expansions

during this period may have affected a relatively small part of the target population. Relatively few poor

women were uninsured prior to the Medicaid expansions; even though the expansions may have had

relatively large effects on the proportion uninsured, the share of the population that changed from

uninsured to insured represents only a small fraction of the total population. For example, if we assume

that the Dubay and Kenney (1997) estimates are accurate, only about six percent of the population of

pregnant women with incomes between 100 and 185 percent of poverty changed insurance status (from

not covered to covered) between 1988 and 1992 even though a substantial majority was made eligible for

Medicaid during this period. In addition, Ellwood and Kenney (1995) and Simon and Handler

(forthcoming) show that many pregnant women who enroll in Medicaid do so after the first trimester.

The small fraction of the population that changed insurance status and the timing of obtaining insurance

suggest that the effect of eligibility on health is likely to be small, and the statistical power to detect

reliably small effects may be limited.

         To summarize, there is only one prior study of the effect of Medicaid expansions on pregnant

women’s health insurance coverage and it is limited in a number of ways. The likely explanation for this

paucity of research is the absence of data on insurance coverage of pregnant women. To address this

shortfall in research, we will use data from the National Hospital Discharge Survey (NHDS) from 1985 to

1996. This data source provides information on the health insurance coverage of a large, nationally

representative sample of pregnant women who deliver in US hospitals. Thus, we will produce the first

comprehensive analysis of the effects of Medicaid expansions on health insurance coverage of pregnant

women.



The Effect of Medicaid Expansions on Infant Health

         Howell (2001) provided an analysis of the effects of the Medicaid expansions on infant health

and concluded that there was little evidence that the Medicaid expansions had an effect on low birth

weight or infant mortality. She summarized the evidence as follows:


                                                                                                              6
         •   “Limited evidence that the rate of low birth weight or prematurity declined for some women
             affected by the expansions. However, a majority of studies that addressed this issue found no
             effect of the expansions.” (Howell 2001, p.20)

         •   “A single study finds an impact of the expansions on infant mortality. Because this study did
             not include controls for socioeconomic status and has findings that are inconsistent with state-
             level studies, it is difficult to draw the conclusion that the Medicaid expansions affected
             infant mortality rates from this single study.” (Howell 2001, pp.20-21)

Hadley (2003) and Levy and Meltzer (2004) provided similar reviews of the literature and concluded that

there is little evidence that Medicaid expansions improved infant health.3 The absence of an effect of

Medicaid on infant health is consistent with clinical evidence that there is a limited scope for medical care

to improve birth outcomes, such as premature births and low birth weight (Strong 2000; Lu et al. 2003;

Behrman and Butler 2006).

         Despite limited evidence, many advocacy groups continue to argue that Medicaid has had a

positive effect on infant health. For example, a report by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities states

the following:

         “Expansions of Medicaid coverage for low-income pregnant women led to an 8.5 percent
         reduction in infant mortality and a 7.8 percent reduction in the incidence of low birth
         weight.” (Ku 2005, p. 4)

The findings repeated in this passage are from Currie and Gruber (1996), which is arguably the most

influential study in this area. It was the first national study, it was comprehensive in terms of the

outcomes it studied, and it used an innovative research design that exploited the legislated changes in

Medicaid. Unfortunately, effect sizes obtained in this study seem implausible if considered in light of

estimates of the effect of Medicaid expansions on insurance status reported in Dubay and Kenney (1997)

and elsewhere (e.g., Cutler and Gruber 1996). According to Dubay and Kenney (1997), it is likely that

approximately 50% of the pregnant women who enrolled in Medicaid during this period were previously

insured. If we use the 34% rate of take-up for Medicaid reported in Currie and Gruber (1996) and assume

that 50% of those were previously uninsured, then a 100% increase in Medicaid eligibility (i.e. making

every pregnant woman eligible for Medicaid) would be associated with a decrease in uninsured pregnant

3
  However, Hadley (2003) puts forth several potential explanations for this general finding that are consistent with a
true benefit of Medicaid on infant health.


                                                                                                                     7
women of 17% (i.e. for every 100 pregnant women, 17 would switch status from uninsured to insured).

Therefore, estimates of the effect of Medicaid eligibility on outcomes reported in Currie and Gruber

(1996) should be multiplied by approximately five to obtain estimates of the effects on those becoming

newly insured, as outcomes are averaged over the entire population while less than 20 percent

experienced a change in insurance status. Making this calculation yields estimates that imply that

switching a woman’s insurance status from uninsured to Medicaid will decrease the probability of infant

mortality by between 150% and 190%, which seem implausible.4 Even if we double the rate of take-up to

68% and reduce the rate of crowd out by half to 25%, estimates of the effects of becoming newly insured

on infant mortality would be between 60% and 75%, which still seem too large to be plausible.

         The implausible magnitude of the estimates in Currie and Gruber (1996) is likely due to the

inadequacy of the underlying natural experiment. The fact that the Medicaid expansions were not a

particularly good “natural” experiment is revealed in the sensitivity analyses conducted by Currie and

Gruber (1996). When state maternal and child health spending are included in the model, the estimate of

the effect of Medicaid eligibility on low birth weight increases by 532%. Similarly, when the number of

neonatal intensive care beds are added to the regression the estimate of the effect of Medicaid eligibility

on low birth weight increases by 160%. Estimates of the effect of Medicaid eligibility on infant mortality

are somewhat less affected, but the addition of the abortion rate to this regression model increases the

estimate of the effect of Medicaid eligibility on infant mortality by 25%. The sensitivity of estimates to

inclusion of additional variables indicates that the timing and magnitude of the Medicaid expansions were

correlated with other changes in states that significantly affected birth weight and infant mortality. It is

likely that some of these factors are confounding estimates of the effect of Medicaid eligibility on infant

health outcomes.



4
 These figures are calculated using estimates of the effects of targeted Medicaid expansions reported in Table 3 of
Currie and Gruber (1996). For example, Currie and Gruber (1996) reported that a 100% increase in Medicaid
eligibility was associated with a decrease of 4.088 in infant deaths (per thousand births). To obtain the effect of
becoming newly insured, we multiply this estimate by five and divide by the mean of 10.66, which yields 1.9174
(191.74%).


                                                                                                                      8
Summary and Contributions

        In sum, there is little evidence to suggest that the Medicaid expansions had a positive effect on

infant health, as measured by birth weight or low birth weight, prematurity, or infant mortality. There are

several possible explanations for this fact: low rates of Medicaid take-up, crowd out of private insurance,

and limited ability of medical care to improve birth outcomes. The apparent lack of success of the

original Medicaid expansions targeted at pregnant women and infants seems inconsistent with the

political support for later expansions such as SCHIP and expansion of Medicaid along the lines recently

enacted by Massachusetts. These later expansions of Medicaid may have little impact on health because

they suffer from the same problems that potentially explain why the earlier expansions targeted at

pregnant women and infants had few health benefits. Take-up rates remain low, crowd out of private

insurance is a continuing issue, and the link between primary care and improved health may be limited to

particular diseases or specific to the health indictors chosen. Therefore, whether or not the initial

expansions were a success in terms of improving infant health is an important research question because

of the policies the initial expansions have spawned. In addition, the absence of sufficient evidence about

the effects of the initial expansions, for example, little study of the extent of take-up and crowd out of

pregnant women, suggests the need for additional study.

        Our work in this paper begins to fill in the gaps. Specifically we provide virtually the first study

of the effects of the initial Medicaid expansions on insurance coverage of pregnant women and infants,

and we provide an additional analysis of the effects of the expansions on prenatal care and infant health,

as measured by birth weight. We also study additional measures of the use of health services (e.g.,

cesarean section, length of stay) not previously examined using the National Hospital Discharge Survey.

In all analyses, we pay special attention to the empirical problems caused by the absence of a true natural

experiment. Finally, we provide estimates of the implied effect of becoming newly insured on infant

health (i.e., instrumental variables estimates).



Research Design


                                                                                                               9
        Our research design initially proceeds as if the Medicaid expansions represented a true natural

experiment. We are interested in the effect of the expansions on insurance coverage, prenatal care, and

infant health as measured by birth weight. We begin the description of the research design with the effect

on insurance coverage. For each type of health insurance category (HI), we estimate the following

regression model:

     HI ijt = α j + β t + δ ELIGkjt + X i Γ + Z jt λ + u ijt
    i = 1,..., N            (persons)
(1) k = 1,2,3               (race)
    j = 1,...,50            (states)
    t = 1985,...,1996        (years)

In equation (1), HI is a specific health insurance category (private, Medicaid, uninsured) for woman i in

state j and year t; ELIG is the fraction of women in group k, which is defined by race, in state j and year t

that are eligible for Medicaid; X are individual characteristics of pregnant women such as age and race;

and Z are the unemployment rate (lag, contemporaneous, and lead) and fraction of single males with

private insurance in state j and year t. Equation (1) also includes state ( α j ) and year ( β t ) effects. In

models in which the sample includes persons of different races, we allow state and year effects to differ

by race. We chose to define our group cells by race, in addition to state and year, because of the large

racial differences that exist in infant outcomes.

        The use of the fraction of women eligible for Medicaid in each state and year to measure

Medicaid eligibility follows the innovation of Currie and Gruber (1996) and Cutler and Gruber (1996).

The key to this measure is that it consists of the fraction of a fixed sample of women in each state who are

Medicaid eligible, avoiding the endogenous relationship between Medicaid eligibility of an individual

mother and the health of that mother or her infant.5 To form the measure, we select a sample of women

aged 18 to 39 from the 1986 to 1997 March CPS surveys (covering data from 1985-1996). We adjust all

5
  Currie and Gruber (1996) and Cutler and Gruber (1996) use a national sample instead of state-specific samples.
However, given that the measure is based on state variation in timing and magnitude of Medicaid expansions, using
state-samples introduces no additional variation that would bias estimates. State samples will produce less
measurement error, which is relevant to correlation between eligibility and insurance.


                                                                                                                 10
financial variables for price changes so that everyone's incomes are deflated (inflated) from the actual

year (e.g., 1985,..,1996) to the policy year (e.g., 1988) for which eligibility will be calculated. Using

these inflation-adjusted state-specific samples and the Medicaid eligibility rules in a state in a specific

year, we assign eligibility to the (fixed) state sample. So eligibility is calculated using the same sample of

women in each year for a given state. We then calculate the proportion of women aged 18 to 39 within a

race-state-year cell that would be eligible for Medicaid if they became pregnant.

        Data for the analysis, which we describe in more detail below, come from hospital discharge

records in the National Hospital Discharge Survey (NHDS). The key aspect of these data is that they

provide information on insurance coverage for pregnant women at the time of delivery. We restrict the

sample to women aged 18 to 39 years. The instrument—the fraction of women that would be eligible for

Medicaid conditional on pregnancy—is merged with the NHDS data by year, state and race.

        We modify this basic model in a number of ways to address specific issues. First, we allow the

eligibility measure (ELIG) to have non-linear effects, which may be likely given that higher levels of

eligibility are affecting persons with increasingly higher rates of private insurance and lower rates of

uninsured (Card and Shore-Sheppard 2004). We do so by including eligibility and eligibility squared in

the regression. Second, in some models we include state-specific trends to adjust for the less than perfect

nature of the natural experiment. State-specific trends adjust for the potential endogeneity of the

Medicaid expansions. Here too, we allow for separate race-specific state and year effects in models that

are estimated using a sample with different races. Third, we restrict the sample to the period 1985 to

1991, which is the period that witnessed the greatest change in Medicaid eligibility. As we show later,

while the fraction of Medicaid-eligible births increased from about seven percent in 1985 to almost 30

percent in 1996, most of the expansions had already taken place by 1991. Finally, we also conduct

separate analyses by race.

        We estimate a similar model related to infant health outcomes: number of prenatal visits, timing

of first prenatal care visit, birth weight for gestational age, low birth weight for gestational age, cesarean




                                                                                                              11
section, place of birth (public hospital versus non-profit or for-profit hospital) and length of stay in

hospital. For these outcomes (represented by BW), the regression model is:
                     ~           ~                ~
      BWijt = α~ j + β t + γ i + δ ELIGijt + Z jt λ + u~ijt
      i = 1,..., N           (group)
(2)
      j = 1,...,50           (states)
      t = 1985,...,1996      (years)

In equation (2), the symbol ~ is used to differentiate parameters from equation (1). Data for this analysis

come from two sources: the National Hospital Discharge Survey for length of stay in hospital, cesarean

section, and place of birth, and vital records for measures of prenatal care and birth weight. Analyses of

vital statistics data are conducted using individual data collapsed into state-year-group (age by race) cells.

The index i in equation (2) reflects this fact and is defined by age and race. Models estimated for birth

weight and low birth weight are adjusted for gestational age, but are otherwise the same as equation (1).

The fraction of women eligible for Medicaid is merged to these cells by year, state and race. Here too, we

alter the model specification to allow for non-linear effects of eligibility and to control for unmeasured,

state-specific time trends. All models are estimated via ordinary least squares, with weights as noted.

          An implicit estimate of the effect of insurance coverage on measures of infant health, for example

birth weight, is provided by the following:
                     ~
                 δ
(3) TOTIV      =
                 δ

We refer to the effect of insurance on birth weight as the treatment on the treated (TOT), or more

appropriately as the local average treatment effect (LATE) because it pertains to women and infants

affected by the Medicaid expansions, who may not represent the typical Medicaid participant. As

equation (3) shows, this estimate can be derived from the ratio of the effect of Medicaid eligibility on

birth weight (BW) to the effect of Medicaid eligibility on insurance (i.e., any insurance) coverage.




                                                                                                              12
Data

           We use three primary data sources for the analysis: the National Hospital Discharge Survey

(NHDS), the National Detailed Natality Files, and the CPS. The CPS is used to calculate the fraction of

women eligible for Medicaid by race, state and year as described in the previous section of the paper. It is

also used to calculate the fraction of never-married men aged 18 to 39 who are privately insured by state

and year, one control for trends in health insurance coverage by state.



National Hospital Discharge Survey

           Our study of the effect of Medicaid expansions on health insurance coverage of mothers and

infants at the time of birth relies on the National Hospital Discharge Survey (NHDS), conducted by the

National Center for Health Statistics. The data are collected from a sample of inpatient records obtained

from a national probability sample of non-Federal, short-stay hospitals (defined as those with average

length-of-stay of less than thirty days) within the 50 U.S. states. The NHDS follows a three-stage sample

design using geographically defined sampling units to select a sample of hospitals and a sample of records

within hospitals. All analyses use sample weights which inflate estimates by reciprocals of the

probabilities of sample selection and adjust for non-response among sampled hospitals.6 The NHDS

contains information on patient age, sex, race, up to three expected sources of payment, and up to seven

patient diagnoses coded according to the International Classification of Diseases- 9th Revision- Clinical

Modification (ICD-9-CM) (Public Health Service, 1998).

           We study the effect of Medicaid eligibility on insurance coverage of mothers at the time of birth

using weighted linear probability models, controlling for mother’s age category (18-24, 25-29, and 30-34,

relative to 35-39), race (black and other race relative to white), state-specific unemployment rate (lag,

contemporaneous, and lead), state-specific private insurance rate for males, year and state effects, and

race-specific year and state effects (in models which pool all races).



6
    Dennison and Pokras (2000) provide additional information about the design of the NHDS.


                                                                                                            13
        We examine the effect of Medicaid expansions on the primary expected source of payment for

delivering mothers, with expected source of payment categorized as Medicaid, private insurance

(including a small number of cases coded as worker’s compensation), and uninsured (cases coded as self

pay or charity). Our initial sample for 1985 to 1996 consists of 299,634 women aged 18 to 39 delivering

a baby (identified in NHDS by primary ICD-9-CM of V27). To put this sample size in perspective, the

CPS has about 5,000 women a year who have had a baby in the last year, and it is not possible to know

for sure when the insurance data pertain to relative to the pregnancy, whereas here we know when

insurance status is coded (at time of delivery). We use the restricted-access version of the NHDS which

contains patient zip code of residence and allows us to infer state of residence. We drop 6,918 (about 2%)

of mothers with missing, invalid or foreign zip codes of residence or who live in Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin

Islands, and two U.S. states where the number of records is too small to estimate state fixed effects. We

have 284,179 observations after dropping 7,547 records with unknown or other primary expected source

of payment and 990 records with primary expected source of payment of Medicare. 7

        In addition to insurance status, we also analyze the effect of Medicaid eligibility on four measures

of the use of health services from the NHDS. First, we consider whether or not the birth took place via

Cesarean section, a relatively rare occurrence for Medicaid patients (Gregory et al., 1999). Second, we

consider whether a mother gives birth in a public hospital (as opposed to a non-profit or for-profit

hospital). Poor and uninsured women are more likely than others to give birth in public hospitals, and

one way that a change in insurance status may affect infant health is by giving mothers access to hospitals

that are more often used by insured mothers and may differ in quality of care (Aizer, Lleras-Muney, and

Stabile, 2005). Finally, we consider whether or not the length-of-stay in the hospital of mother or infant




7
  We impute race for the 52,469 (nearly 19%) mothers in the sample who are missing this information using data
from non-missing observations. For mothers whose race is reported, we use a multinomial logit model to predict
race as a function of the fraction of the population of women aged 18 to 39 who are black or other race in the
mother’s zip code of residence, using information from the 1990 Census. We also control for age and age squared.
We then apply these coefficients to data for those missing race in the NHDS, and assign race based on cut offs that
match the observed race distribution among those not missing race. We have verified, however, that our results are
not substantively different when we drop those missing race from the analysis.


                                                                                                                 14
is more than two days, as this may be an indication of relatively poor health at the time of delivery (for

infants, see, for example, Phibbs and Schmitt, 2006).8

         In addition to age and race, our independent variable of interest – Medicaid eligibility – varies by

state, year and race. All analyses thus allow for arbitrary correlation of standard errors within state-year-

race cells (Moulton 1990; Donald and Lang 2001).9



Natality Files

         In addition to the delivery-related outcomes from the NHDS, we further assess the impact of

Medicaid expansions on infant health and the utilization of medical services by pregnant women using

data from individual birth records. Detailed information on all individual births occurring in the 50 states

and D.C. are submitted by hospitals to state vital registration offices, which is then reported to the

National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). Information on each birth includes date and place of birth

along with the demographic characteristics of the mother such as age, race, education, marital status, and

parity. We employ data from the Detailed Natality Files for the years 1985 through 1996, enveloping the

major Medicaid income eligibility expansions that took place. The sample is limited to women between

the ages of 18 to 39 who had non-plural births. Records from two small states are also excluded in order

to facilitate comparison with the results based on the NHDS sample and the construction of the implicit

IV estimates. This yields a final analysis sample of 39,238,023 births.

         We examine the effects of Medicaid expansions on pregnant women’s health care utilization, as

measured by the frequency and timing of prenatal care visits. In addition to the total number of prenatal


8
  The sample for our analysis of length-of-stay among infants consisted of 294,721 records after dropping 16,687
records for one of the reasons discussed for the sample of mothers. We imputed race for 52,003 infants based on the
race distribution of women aged 18 to 39 in the zip code, though again, our results are not sensitive to dropping
infants whose race was imputed.
9
  Errors are not clustered by sampling design unit, since no design information is extant for the NHDS prior to 1988.
Although weighted linear probability analysis of the effect of Medicaid eligibility (as the only covariate) on
Medicaid insurance status using the 1990 NHDS sample of mothers found that standard errors on the eligibility
variable are 2.3 times higher when allowing for clustering of errors among sampling design units compared to no
clustering, errors are actually slightly higher when allowing for clustering by state-year-race cell compared to
sampling design unit. The approach taken in this paper is therefore expected to result in comparable or conservative
standard errors compared to analyses that were able to cluster errors by sampling design unit.


                                                                                                                  15
visits over the pregnancy, two dichotomous indicators are constructed for whether prenatal care was

initiated on time (during the first trimester) or late (during the third trimester), respectively. An additional

indicator for whether prenatal care was adequate is also defined. Adequacy is based on the

Kessner/Institute of Medicine criteria, which considers both the timing and frequency of care (Kessner et

al., 1973). According to these criteria, prenatal care is considered adequate if it is initiated in the first

trimester and is composed of a minimum number of visits depending on gestation. Thus, for a normal 36-

weeks gestation period, adequate care constitutes first-trimester initiation and more than eight prenatal

care visits over the term. We examine standard measures of infant health: birth weight in grams, and a

dichotomous indicator for low birth weight (less than 2500 grams). While there are other, more specific

measures of infant health that one may consider, low birth weight remains a strong predictor of perinatal

health and may also be associated with long-term developmental outcomes (Hack et al., 1995). Focusing

on birth weight further allows a comparison of our results with those in the literature. Models estimated

for birth weight and low birth weight are adjusted for age of gestation, since the clinical literature

suggests that the ability of medical care to affect fetal growth may be greater than its ability to affect

prematurity, since relatively little is known about the causes of preterm delivery (Joyce, 1999; Hack and

Merkatz, 1995; Li et al., 1993).10 Specifically, the models control for the percent of births in each cell

which are very premature (gestation less than 32 weeks) and premature (32-36 weeks), in reference to

normal gestation (37 weeks or above).

         For computing convenience, specifications are estimated on cells collapsed by mothers’ age

groups (18-24, 25-29, and 30-34 relative to 35-39), race groups (white, black, other), state of maternal

residence and year of birth.11 Although the NCHS natality files are relatively complete, four states

(California, New York, Texas and Washington) had incomplete information on educational attainment



10
  Models estimated for gestation did not find any significant or consistent effects of Medicaid eligibility.
11
  Thus, for the full time-period analysis, there are 7,344 cells (51 states times 12 years times 4 age groups times 3
race groups). All models are weighted by cell frequencies. With this weighting scheme, models estimated on
collapsed cells lead to identical parameter estimates as those estimated on the individual records. Standard errors
are adjusted for arbitrary correlation within state, year, and race cells.


                                                                                                                    16
during various years from 1985 through 1991.12 Since all models are weighted by cell frequencies, this is

not a significant cause for concern. As a sensitivity check, we re-estimated all models omitting these four

states for the time periods during which the education records were incomplete. The results are quite

similar to those reported below.



Results

Effects of Medicaid Eligibility on Insurance Coverage of Pregnant Women

          The first question we examined was the effect of expanding Medicaid eligibility on the health

insurance status of pregnant women. Table 1 presents the estimates. For each type of insurance coverage

including uninsured or any insurance, we estimated several models that differ in the way Medicaid

eligibility is entered into the model, and in the control variables that are included. Medicaid eligibility is

first entered using a linear term, and next using both a linear and a quadratic term to allow for non-linear

effects. We also used two sets of control variables: one that excluded state-specific trends and one with

state-specific trends. In sum, we estimated four separate regression models for each type of insurance.

          Estimates in Table 1 indicate that Medicaid eligibility is positively associated with Medicaid

coverage and having any type of insurance, and negatively associated with private insurance coverage and

being uninsured. Estimates are quite sensitive to the inclusion of state-specific trends, which is consistent

with what has been noted in the earlier crowd out literature. Specifically, estimates in the top row (linear

specification) indicate that a 20 percentage point increase in Medicaid eligibility, which is the

approximate change that occurred over the 1985 to 1996 period (see Figure 2), is associated with 3.5

(with state trends) to 5.6 (without state trends) percentage point increase in Medicaid coverage among

pregnant women ages 18 to 39. Given that the mean rate of Medicaid coverage was approximately 0.2 in

1985 (see Figure 3), these estimates suggest that the Medicaid expansions during this period increased

Medicaid coverage by between 18 and 28 percent. Estimates in second row (quadratic specification)

                                                                                                             17
suggest a similar conclusion, although there do appear to be non-linear effects. Medicaid take-up (i.e.,

marginal participation) appears to increase with increases in eligibility. Based on estimates obtained from

models that include state-specific trends, the marginal Medicaid take-up rate is 0.122 when eligibility is

0.20 (20 percent of population is eligible) and 0.182 when eligibility is 0.30.

        In regards to private insurance coverage, estimates in the top row (linear specification) indicate

that a 20 percentage point increase in Medicaid eligibility is associated with a 1.9 (with state trends) to 2.9

(without state trends) percentage point decrease in private insurance coverage. Estimates in the second

row (quadratic specification) show that marginal declines in private insurance are greater with increases

in eligibility. Estimates from models that include state-specific trends indicate that the marginal decline

in private insurance is 0.005 when eligibility is 0.20 and 0.112 when eligibility is 0.30. The decreases in

private insurance coverage suggested by estimates in the top row represent approximately 50 percent of

the increase in Medicaid coverage, or what has commonly been referred to as crowd out. Moreover, these

estimates of crowd out do not depend on model specification even though the addition of state-specific

trends had a significant mediating effect on the estimates of the effect of eligibility. Allowing for non-

linear effects suggest virtually no crowd out at low levels of eligibility but up to 60 percent crowd out

when 30 percent of population is eligible.

        Consistent with these estimates of crowd out, expansions in Medicaid eligibility are associated

with smaller decreases in the proportion uninsured than increases in the proportion covered by Medicaid.

Estimates in the top row indicate that a 20 percentage point increase in Medicaid eligibility is associated

with a 1.6 to 2.7 percentage point decrease in the proportion uninsured; these percentage point changes

represent relative effects of between 9 to 16 percent given a mean proportion uninsured of approximately

17 percent in 1985 (see Figure 3). The effects of eligibility on uninsured are also non-linear; when

eligibility is 0.20, the marginal effect of eligibility on uninsured is -0.126, but when eligibility is 0.30, the

marginal effect of eligibility on uninsured is -0.07 (based on estimates controlling for state-specific

trends.).




                                                                                                              18
        To assess whether the results differ by race or time period, we conducted additional analyses. In

Table 2 we present estimates of the effect of Medicaid eligibility on health insurance status of white

women. Estimates in Table 2 are similar to those in Table 1, but there are some differences. Estimates in

Table 2 suggest that white women have relatively higher take-up rates than black women, having rates

that range from 0.17 when 20 percent of population is eligible to 0.25 when 30 percent of population is

eligible (based on the quadratic specification with state-specific trends). There also appears to be slightly

larger and more pronounced non-linear effects of eligibility on private insurance for white women.

Estimates obtained from models that include state-specific trends indicate that the marginal effect of

eligibility on private insurance is -0.05 when eligibility is 0.20 and it is -0.21 when eligibility is 0.30.

These estimates imply rates of crowd out that are significantly higher than those implied by the estimates

in Table 1. For white women, estimates from models that include controls for state-specific trends

suggest rates of crowd out of between 32 to 84 percent, as eligibility goes from 20 to 30 percent of the

population. Estimates relating to the effect of eligibility on uninsured are consistent with these large

estimates of crowd out; the marginal effect of eligibility on uninsured is -0.11 when eligibility is 0.20 and

-0.05 when eligibility is 0.30 (figures derived from estimates obtained including controls for state-specific

trends). In sum, estimates in Table 2 suggest that expansions in Medicaid eligibility initially decreased

the proportion of uninsured white women, but as eligibility increased, the expansions resulted in near

complete crowd out of private insurance and relatively little change in the proportion uninsured.

        In Table 3, we present estimates of the effect of Medicaid eligibility for years 1985 to 1991, the

period that witnessed the largest expansions in Medicaid eligibility (see Figure 2). We only discuss

estimates obtained from models that include state-specific trends. Overall estimates in Table 2 indicate

less crowd out of private insurance and more pronounced non-linear effects. Medicaid (marginal) take-up

rates increase with eligibility; when eligibility is 0.15, as in the beginning of period, (marginal) take-up

rates are basically zero, but when eligibility is 0.25 (highest during this period), (marginal) take-up rates

are 0.13. Similar nonlinearities characterize estimates of the effect of eligibility on private insurance.

However, estimates indicate no decline in private insurance and virtually no crowd out from Medicaid


                                                                                                               19
throughout most of the range of Medicaid eligibility observed during the period. It is not until eligibility

rises to 25 percent that it is negatively associated with private insurance. Given this pattern of results, the

marginal effect of Medicaid eligibility on the proportion uninsured is between -0.12 and -0.14.

        Our results of the effect of Medicaid eligibility on the health insurance coverage of pregnant

women are consistent with those reported by Dubay and Kenney (1997). The Medicaid expansions of the

late 1980s and early 1990s were associated with a significant and relatively large increase in Medicaid

participation, but substantially smaller decreases in the proportion uninsured because a large fraction of

the newly enrolled Medicaid participants previously had private insurance. The less than perfect

“experiment” of the Medicaid expansions warrants appropriate caution in reaching conclusions, but

assuming that the inclusion of state-specific trends, state unemployment rates and the fraction of single

men with private insurance addresses the endogenous nature of the Medicaid expansions, the results of

the current analysis suggest that Medicaid expansions for pregnant women induced a significant

substitution of private for public coverage and as a result, increased the cost of expanding public

insurance coverage. The problem was particularly severe for white women and for later years of the

expansions when eligibility reached relatively large portions of the population. In addition, the relatively

small changes in the proportion of the population that was uninsured as a result of the expansions,

approximately 10 percent or so, suggests that analyses of the effects of the Medicaid expansions on infant

health will have small population effects that may be difficult to detect reliably.



Effects of Medicaid Eligibility on Prenatal Care and Birth Weight—Natality Files

        Estimates of the effects of Medicaid eligibility on prenatal care and infant health derived from the

Natality files are presented in Tables 4 through 7. Statistical analyses of these outcomes are similar to

those for insurance. We conduct analyses using the entire sample for the 1985 to 1996 period and then

analyses by race and time period. However, because we expect Medicaid eligibility to affect low-

educated women the most, in some analyses we limit the sample to those with less than a high school

degree. Similar analyses could not be conducted for insurance because the NHDS does not provide


                                                                                                             20
information on education. For each outcome, we show estimates from two models: one that excludes

state-specific trends and one that includes these controls.

        Table 4 presents estimates for the entire sample for the period 1985 to 1996. We focus on

estimates obtained from models that include state-specific trends, as the inclusion of these controls

appears to affect estimates considerably. Focusing on the first row of Table 4, estimates indicate that

Medicaid eligibility is not significantly associated with the timing or number of prenatal care visits, birth

weight, or the incidence of low-birth weight. Estimates are also extremely small. For example, a 20

percentage point increase in Medicaid eligibility, which is approximately the change in eligibility that

occurred over this period, is associated with 0.02 (0.1 percent) fewer prenatal care visits; a 0.005

percentage point (0.7 percent) lower rate of adequate prenatal care; a 0.3 gram decrease in birth weight;

and a 0.0003 percentage point (0.6 percent) increase in the prevalence of low-birth weight. Estimates in

row 2 suggest equally small effects. While there is some evidence of nonlinear effects for the measures

of prenatal care, the range of marginal effects for the observed variation in eligibility is small and the

magnitudes of the marginal effects are also small and similar to those for the linear specification. Most

importantly, estimates suggest little evidence that Medicaid eligibility increased use of prenatal care or

improved birth weight.

        Despite the large sample size underlying estimates in Table 4 and the relatively precise nature of

the estimates, our analysis may lack statistical power to detect reliably expected effect sizes. The

explanation for this is the fact that Medicaid eligibility is associated with relatively small changes in

insurance status. Consider results (row 1) from Table 1 that suggest that a 100 percentage point increase

in Medicaid eligibility is associated with an 8 to 13 percentage point increase (decrease) in insurance

coverage (uninsured). Assuming that the effects of the eligibility expansions on prenatal care and birth

weight work only through increasing the proportion of the population with insurance, we would follow

equation (3) and multiply estimates in Table 4 by a factor of 8 to 13 to obtain the (instrumental variables-

LATE) effects of gaining insurance coverage on prenatal care and birth weight. Doing so yields a

relatively large range of estimates of the effect of insurance coverage. For example, if we construct a 95


                                                                                                             21
percent confidence interval around the estimate of the effect of eligibility on the incidence of low-birth

weight and multiply by a factor of 10 (roughly midpoint of 8 and 13), we obtain estimates of the effect of

insurance coverage on the prevalence of low-birth weight of between -1.4 to 4.7 percentage points, which

are large effects relative to the overall sample mean (5.6 percent), and even relative to the mean among

low educated mothers (6.5 percent). While this interval likely indicates no beneficial effect of Medicaid

on weight for gestational age, we cannot rule out a clinically important improvement (-1.4 percentage

points). An alternative way to illustrate this point is to multiply the standard errors of the estimate (linear

specification) of the effect of eligibility on low-birth weight by the same factor (10), which yields an

estimate of 0.016. Standard errors of this magnitude indicate that we could not reject an effect of

insurance coverage on the incidence of low birth-weight for gestational age of less than 3.1 percentage

points, which is a non-trivial effect. In short, the absence of a substantial effect of Medicaid eligibility on

insurance coverage raises the possibility that we do not have sufficient power to detect reasonably sized

effects of eligibility on prenatal care and birth weight. Only if insurance coverage has very large effects

would we be able to detect them reliably.13 Nevertheless, point estimates indicate that Medicaid

eligibility does not increase use and adequacy of prenatal care or improve birth weight.

        In Table 5, we present the estimates of the effect of Medicaid eligibility on prenatal care and birth

weight of white women. Note that estimates of the effect of Medicaid eligibility on insurance for this

group indicated high rates of crowd out and little change in the proportion uninsured. Therefore, we

would expect very little effect of the Medicaid expansions on prenatal care and birth weight for this

sample (assuming that the primary causal mechanism is a change in insurance). In fact, estimates in

Table 5 are very similar to those in Table 4, which is not that surprising given that white women

constitute nearly 80 percent of the sample used to obtain estimates in Table 4.




13
  On the other hand, if Medicaid expansions affected prenatal care and birth weight through other avenues (such as
increased access to medical care for the uninsured because of the cash infusion to providers from Medicaid
expansions) than solely by increasing the proportion of the population with insurance, we may expect larger reduced
form effects of eligibility.


                                                                                                                22
        One way to improve the statistical power of the analysis is to limit the sample to those most likely

affected by the Medicaid eligibility expansions (those with a high school degree or less) which we are

able to do only in the vital statistics data (thus not on the insurance outcomes) due to a lack of educational

information in the NHDS. Those with relatively less education should have higher Medicaid take-up

rates and larger changes in insurance coverage than those with more education because the latter group is

unlikely to be affected by the eligibility expansions. Therefore, we expect somewhat larger reduced form

estimates. Table 6 presents estimates pertaining to the low-educated sample.

        Estimates in Table 6 are slightly more suggestive of a beneficial effect of the Medicaid

expansions. The coefficients on Medicaid eligibility indicate that expansions in eligibility were

associated with an increase in the number and adequacy of prenatal care visits and an increase in birth

weight. Estimates for low-birth weight indicate an increase in prevalence—not the expected decrease.

However, estimates remain small in magnitude. For example, the estimate of the effect of eligibility on

birth weight indicates that a 20 percentage point change in eligibility is associated with a 1.3 gram

increase in birth weight. Further, if we assume a scaling factor of 5 (i.e., insurance coverage for this

group goes up by 20 percentage points as a result of a 100 percentage point increase in eligibility) for this

group, the instrumental variables (LATE) estimator for birth weight is 33 grams (1%).14 Magnitudes of

other estimates are equally small, although implied instrumental variables (IV) estimates related to the

prenatal care variables are non-trivial (using a scaling factor of 5). Implied IV estimates for the number of

prenatal care visits is 1.5. Estimates in the second row (quadratic specification) do not indicate any

significant nonlinear effects that substantially affect inferences.

        The final set of estimates we present are for the years 1985 to 1991, the period that witnessed the

largest increases in Medicaid eligibility. This is also the period that had the least amount of crowd out of

private insurance coverage and the greatest increase in the proportion of the population covered by

insurance, although that proportion remains a small fraction (0.12 to 0.14) of the population. Estimates


14
  The confidence interval of the implied instrumental variables (LATE) estimate of the effect of insurance on the
incidence of low-birth weight for gestational age is -0.011 to 0.029, which is a relatively large interval.


                                                                                                                    23
for this period are in Table 7. Here we again see some evidence that the Medicaid expansions had

beneficial effects: increased number and adequacy of prenatal care, and increased birth weight. However,

here too, estimates remain quite small in magnitude. Estimates of the effect of Medicaid eligibility on the

number of prenatal care visits and birth weight suggests that a 20 percentage point increase in Medicaid

eligibility is associated with a 0.21 increase in the number of prenatal care visits and 0.72 gram increase

in birth weight. If we use estimates from Table 3 to construct implied IV estimates, the (instrumental

variables) effect of gaining insurance coverage on the number of prenatal care visits is large—10.5 visits

(10 times 1.046). However, there is no correspondingly large estimate related to birth weight (or low

birth weight); the IV estimate for birth weight (low-birth weight) is small—35.9 grams (-0.002).



Effects of Medicaid Eligibility on Delivery Length of Stay, Cesarean Section and Location of Delivery

        An advantage of the NHDS is that we have information about additional health related outcomes

that are not available on Natality files: a dichotomous indicator of whether the infant or the mother stayed

in hospital more than two days, whether the mother had a Cesarean Section (C-section), and whether the

delivery occurred in a public hospital. A disadvantage of the NHDS is sample size, which is relatively

small for our purposes and results in relatively imprecise parameter estimates. Statistical analyses of

these outcomes are similar to those previously presented. Results are presented in Table 8.

        Estimates in Table 8 indicate that Medicaid eligibility is not associated with length of stay of the

mother or the infant; estimates from models that include state trends are small relative to the mean and not

statistically significant. For example, a 20 percentage point increase in Medicaid eligibility is associated

with a 0.8 percentage point decrease in the probability that an infant stayed more than two days and 1.4

percentage point increase in the probability that a mother stayed more than two days. Relatively long

lengths of stay may be an indicator of poor health, so the absence of any consistent association between

Medicaid eligibility and length of stay of the mother or infant accords with evidence from birth

certificates that found little evidence of an association between Medicaid eligibility and birth weight.

Medicaid eligibility is significantly associated with C- section. Focusing on estimates obtained from


                                                                                                           24
models that include state-specific trends, a 20 percentage point increase in Medicaid eligibility is

associated with a 2.4 percentage point increase in rate of C- section. For C-sections, there appears to be a

significant non-linear effect. The marginal effect of Medicaid eligibility on the probability of having a C-

section decreases slightly with eligibility; when eligibility is 20 percent, the marginal effect is 0.149, and

when eligibility is 30 percent, the marginal effect is 0.114.15 Finally, estimates in Table 8 indicate that

Medicaid eligibility is positively associated with delivering in a public hospital, but the estimate is

imprecise and not statistically significant.



Conclusions

         The relatively large proportion of the US population that is uninsured is a longstanding issue of

concern for researchers and policymakers. To address this problem, state and federal governments have

dramatically expanded Medicaid over the last twenty years to provide insurance for an increasingly large

proportion of poor and near-poor persons, and further expansions have been proposed as a way to expand

health insurance.

         Expansion of Medicaid may have several benefits besides providing insurance (e.g., indirect

income support), but an important rationale for expansion is that it will decrease the proportion of the

population that is uninsured, and as a result increase use of health care services and improve health. This

is the rationale that motivated the initial expansions in Medicaid that pertained to pregnant women. The

question we sought to answer was whether the initial expansions of Medicaid that were targeted at

pregnant women achieved these goals. Did the Medicaid expansions significantly reduce the proportion

of pregnant women who were uninsured? And did these expansions result in increased use of health care

services by pregnant women and improved birth weight? Surprisingly, there has been only one limited

analysis of the former question and while there has been several studies of the effect of Medicaid

expansions on use of services and infant health, there is no consensus conclusion.


15
   These marginal effects of eligibility on C-section rate imply implausibly large instrumental variables estimates of
the effect of becoming insured on C-section.


                                                                                                                   25
        Our analysis of the effect of the Medicaid expansions on the health insurance coverage of

pregnant women suggests that much of the increase in Medicaid participation that resulted from more

generous income eligibility thresholds came at the expense of private insurance coverage. Over the entire

period, we estimate that 50% of the increase in Medicaid participation came from private insurance.

Crowd out of private insurance was particularly severe among white women and at higher levels of

eligibility, which is consistent with the higher rates of private insurance coverage among white women

and women with higher incomes. For every newly insured woman, the government paid for at least one

additional woman who would have otherwise had private insurance. Indeed, for some demographic

groups, estimates indicate that approximately 80% of the increase in Medicaid came from private

insurance. Nevertheless, the Medicaid expansions did reduce the proportion of pregnant women who

were uninsured by approximately 10 to 15% from the level of uninsured in 1985.

        Given that the Medicaid expansions had a relatively small effect on the proportion of women

uninsured, we would not expect these expansions to have much of an impact on population health. In

fact, this is what we found in our analyses of the effect of the expansions on prenatal care, birth weight

and hospital length of stay. Changes in Medicaid eligibility were associated with very small changes in

prenatal care use, birth weight for gestational age and incidence of low-birth weight for gestational age.

However, we also attempted to assess whether gaining health insurance mattered by constructing

instrumental variables (LATE) estimates of the effect of gaining insurance on prenatal care and birth

weight. Unfortunately, we lacked the statistical power to achieve this goal with certainty. Instrumental

variables estimates suggest that the Medicaid expansions may have had some significant effects on

prenatal care and birth weight, particularly for low-educated women. We did find some evidence that the

Medicaid expansions and the increase in health insurance coverage that resulted from them were

associated with increases in the use and adequacy of prenatal care and an increase in birth weight of

approximately 35 grams (1%). There was very little evidence that the Medicaid expansions affected the

incidence of low-birth weight even for the low-educated group that seemed to increase use of prenatal




                                                                                                             26
care services the most. Similarly, we found little evidence that Medicaid eligibility was associated with

longer delivery length of stay for either the infant or the mother.

        Based on the evidence presented, we believe that the Medicaid expansions for pregnant women

had limited effects perhaps because of the significant crowd out of private insurance that occurs, or

because they increase the use of services that may have limited impact on birth weight. Future health

policy should take these findings into account when developing policies and programs to improve infant

health. The difficult part is to identify programs that are effective.

Dep. Var.
              The table reports coefficients from Ordinary Least Squares models. Standard errors are clustered by state, year and race cells, and reported in parentheses. All
              models contain state fixed effects, year fixed effects, state by race, and year by race fixed effects. Models control for age indicators (18-24, 25-29, 30-34, relative
              to 35-39), race (black, other race, relative to white), state unemployment rate (contemporaneous, one-year lag, one-year lead) and state-level private insurance
              rate for never married males. Models for birth weight and low birth weight also control for gestation (very premature: <32 weeks, premature: 32-36 weeks,
              relative to normal gestation: ≥37 weeks). Sample size is 22,144,278 observations. Significance is denoted as follows: *** p-value ≤ 0.01, ** 0.01 < p-value ≤
              0.05, * 0.05 < p-value ≤ 0.10.

The table reports coefficients from weighted linear probability models controlling for race, age categories (except for
infants), unemployment rate by state-year with one lead and lag, the fraction of never-married men aged 18 to 39 privately
insured by state and year, and race-specific year and state effects. Standard errors are correlated by state-year-race cell and
are in brackets. The sample size is 284,179 for maternal deliveries, and 294,721 for infants. ***significant at 1%, * *
