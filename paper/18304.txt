                                            ABSTRACT

The U.S. Federal Reserve used the Term Auction Facility (TAF) to provide term funding to eligible
depository institutions from December 2007 to March 2010. According to the Fed, the purpose of
TAF was to inject term funds through a broader range of counterparties and against a broader range
of collateral than open market operations. The overall goal of the TAF was to ensure that liquidity
provisions could be disseminated efficiently even when the unsecured interbank markets were under
stress. In this paper I use the TAF micro-level loan data and find that about 60 percent of TAF loans
went to foreign banks that pledged asset-backed securities as collateral for these loans. The data and
analysis illustrate the major role that foreign – in particular, European – banks currently play in the
U.S. financial system and the resultant currency mismatch in their balance sheets. The data suggest
that foreign banks had to borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank to meet their dollar-denominated
liabilities.

               An Empirical Analysis of the Fed’s Term Auction Facility



                                                   Abstract



The U.S. Federal Reserve used the Term Auction Facility (TAF) to provide term funding to eligible
depository institutions from December 2007 to March 2010. According to the Fed, the purpose
of TAF was to inject term funds through a broader range of counterparties and against a broader
range of collateral than open market operations. The overall goal of the TAF was to ensure that
liquidity provisions could be disseminated eﬃciently even when the unsecured interbank markets
were under stress. In this paper I use the TAF micro-level loan data and find that about 60
percent of TAF loans went to foreign banks that pledged asset-backed securities as collateral for
these loans. The data and analysis illustrate the major role that foreign – in particular, European
– banks currently play in the U.S. financial system and the resultant currency mismatch in their
balance sheets. The data suggest that foreign banks had to borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank
to meet their dollar-denominated liabilities.


1.     Introduction

The Term Auction Facility (TAF) program was one of the main tools used by the Federal Reserve
and the U.S. fiscal authorities during the financial crisis. The goal of this program – as described
by the Federal Reserve Bank – was to intervene in the interbank money markets because of the
diﬃculties experienced by banks in the United States and Europe. Initially, the Federal Reserve
Bank used open market operations to maintain the eﬀective federal funds rate near its target rate
and enacted several measures to encourage borrowing at the discount window.1 However, these
moves failed to stimulate the market as the Fed has expected. On December 12, 2007, therefore,
the Federal Reserve Bank introduced the Term Auction Facility. The TAF provided longer-term
financing to eligible depository institutions through auctions at predetermined dates. At its peak,
the TAF amounted to more than $500 billion and was the largest expansion on the Federal Reserve
   1
    To encourage banks to borrow at the discount window, the Federal Reserve Bank reduced the discount window
penalty rate from 100 basis points to 50 basis points on August 17, 2007, and extended the term of financing from
overnight to as long as thirty days.
Bank’s balance sheet. Lending through the TAF gradually faded away, and the final TAF auction
was conducted on March 8, 2010.
    One of the reasons for the introduction of TAF during the early stages of the financial crisis
was to provide banks with Federal Reserve liquidity without forcing them to face the stigma of
borrowing from the discount window. Indeed, according to the chairman of the Federal Reserve
Bank, the associated stigma made banks reluctant to use the discount window:

      In August 2007,..., banks were reluctant to rely on discount window credit to address
      their funding needs. The banks’ concern was that their recourse to the discount window,
      if it became known, might lead market participants to infer weakness – the so-called
      stigma problem.

      Speech at the Federal Reserve Board Conference on Key Developments in Monetary
      Policy, Washington, D.C., by Chairman Ben Bernanke (Bernanke (2009))

However, even borrowing from the TAF had a stigma attached to it, and as a result, data on the
loans that were made in TAF, as well as identity of the banks that participated in the auctions,
were not disclosed initially. Later, the Federal Reserve Bank disclosed data on the loans made
under the TAF, as well as information on the other credit and liquidity programs it used during
the crisis.
    While the eﬀectiveness of TAF in reducing rates in the interbank market has been debated by
both academic economists and policy makers (see e.g., McAndrews, Sarkar and Wang 2008 and
Taylor and Williams 2009), little is known about the identity of the banks that participated in
the auctions, the nature of the collateral used, and the terms on the individual loans. This paper
fills the gap by using the micro-level loan dataset released by the Federal Reserve. The TAF data,
which contain detailed information on the loans and the participating financial institutions, provide
a rare glimpse into the injection of emergency liquidity by the Federal Reserve Bank, as well as the
identity of the banks obtaining credit and in particular the type of assets they pledged as collateral.
    I find that foreign banks accounted for 58 percent of TAF lending, with a total amount of
$2.2 trillion, compared to $1.6 trillion for U.S. banks. During the auction of December 2007 and
through most of 2008, foreign banks accounted for the vast majority of the lending, with amounts
that ranged between twofold and fourfold the total lending to U.S banks. U.K.-based Barclays
was the largest borrower in the TAF, followed by Bank of America, Royal Bank of Scotland, Wells

                                                  1
Fargo, and Wachovia. Out of the ten largest borrowers, five are foreign banks, and out of the fifty
largest borrowers, more than thirty are from foreign countries.
   Next, I compare the collateral structure of domestic and foreign banks. I find that most of
the banks and financial institutions that pledged asset-backed securities (ABS) as collateral were
foreign – primarily European – banks. For example, the bank that pledged the largest amount of
ABS for a given loan is Société Générale (France), followed by Norinchukin Bank (Japan), Dexia
(Belgium), Barclays (U.K.), and UBS (Switzerland). Among the ten banks that pledged the largest
amounts of collateral there are only two American banks (State Street and U.S. Central Federal
Credit Union). Why did the Federal Reserve allocate the majority of TAF loans to foreign bank?
Why were foreign banks more likely to pledge the riskier asset-backed securities and collateralized
debt obligations (CDO) as collateral?
   One potential explanation is that the meltdown of the structured finance market and the severe
deterioration in the credit ratings of ABS necessitated liquidity injections to institutions that suf-
fered major loses due to their exposure to the structured finance market. However, U.S. banks that
borrowed from the TAF and had large exposures to ABS, such as Citibank and Bank of America,
did not pledge asset-backed securities at the same level as European banks. Thus, while some of
the Federal Reserve lending was probably aimed at injecting liquidity to financial institutions that
held securities that were illiquid at the time, this is unlikely to be the only reason for the dominance
of European banks in TAF.
   Another explanation for the large number of loans made to foreign banks is that these banks
suﬀered from a currency mismatch in their balance sheets. Many foreign banks were active players in
the creation and issuance of structured finance products. As money markets ground to a halt, these
banks required financing to meet the needs of rolling over their short-term liabilities. Furthermore,
foreign banks were also subject to a currency mismatch in managing their assets and liabilities.
While the main source of funding for some of these banks was based on demand deposits and other
forms of credit in their home countries that were denominated in their home currencies – mostly
the British pound and euro – many European banks issued liabilities in U.S. money markets that
were denominated in the U.S. dollar. Thus, not only were foreign banks subject to a roll-over risk,
but they also suﬀered from a currency mismatch and had to rely on special facilities such as the
currency swap lines between central banks including the European Central Bank, Bank of England,
and Swiss National Bank, and Federal Reserve Bank, as well as on special lending programs such

                                                   2
as the TAF. European banks were more likely to bid for TAF money because they were more
severely aﬀected by the financial crisis, given their exposure to currency mismatch between assets
and liabilities.
      The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides the institutional details of
the Term Auction Facility. Section 3 describes the dataset and provides summary statistics on the
evolution of the TAF over time. Section 4 displays the empirical analysis. Section 5 discusses the
Federal Reserve Bank’s lending to foreign banks. Section 6 concludes.


2.      The Term Auction Facility

Global money markets suﬀered serious disruptions in the summer of 2007 when the rates of in-
terbank term loans rose to unusually high levels.2 The TED spread – the diﬀerence between the
three-month London inter-bank oﬀered rate (LIBOR) and the three-month U.S. Treasury bill –
rose from its typical level of 30 basis points to about 50 basis points and then to 200 basis points
by the summer of 2007. This widening was a reason for major concern because the TED spread is
an indicator of perceived credit risk in the general economy. Moreover, according to a New York
Federal Reserve Bank research paper:

        [T]he volume of transactions in the inter-bank market declined, and borrowers reportedly
        often could not obtain funds at the posted rates. Since the LIBOR aﬀects interest rates
        on a wide variety of loans and securities (e.g. home mortgages and corporate loans),
        unusually high term rates can have disruptive eﬀects on the economy. (McAndrews,
        Sarkar and Wang 2008, 1)

The Federal Reserve Bank responded to the disruptions in the money markets with the traditional
tools of monetary policy – namely, open market operations to maintain the eﬀective federal funds
rate near its target rate. However, despite the Federal Reserve Bank’s eﬀorts in the overnight
funding market, the rates on term loans in the interbank market kept rising. In an attempt to
ease the strains in the money markets, the Federal Reserve Bank resorted to non traditional tools
of monetary policy. Perhaps the most important tool used for this purpose was the Term Auction
Facility.

      Term funding is typically made with maturity terms of one-month or longer.

   The TAF was introduced on December 2007 in the early stages of the financial crisis to provide
Federal Reserve liquidity funding by auctioning oﬀ short-term funding, without forcing banks to
face the stigma of borrowing from the Federal Reserve’s discount window. Under the TAF, the
Federal Reserve auctioned term funds to depository institutions. All depository institutions that
were eligible to borrow under the primary credit program of the Federal Reserve Bank were eligible
to participate in TAF auctions. All loans extended under the TAF were fully collateralized, and
the funds were allocated through an auction, in which participating depository institutions placed
bids specifying an amount of funds, up to a pre-specified limit, and an interest rate that they would
be willing to pay for such funds. The funds were allocated beginning with the highest interest rate
oﬀered until either all funds were allocated or all bids were satisfied. All borrowing institutions
paid the same interest rate, either the rate associated with the bid that would fully subscribe the
auction or, in the case that total bids were less than the amount of funds oﬀered, the lowest rate
that was bid. The TAF was created under the Federal Reserves standard discount window lending
authority granted under Section 10B of the Federal Reserve Act. The auctions were administered
by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, with loans granted through the twelve Federal Reserve
Banks.
   TAF funding supplemented the U.S. dollar funding received by global banks around the world
under the central bank swap facilities between the Federal Reserve Banks and the Banco Central
do Brasil, Bank of Canada, Danmark’s Nationalbank, Bank of England, European Central Bank,
Bank of Japan, Bank of Korea, Banco de Mexico, Reserve Bank of New Zealand, Norges Bank,
Monetary Authority of Singapore, Sveriges Riksbank, and Swiss National Bank.
   From the first facility on December 17, 2007, to the final TAF auction on March 8, 2010, the
Federal Reserve Bank conducted sixty auctions. The amount of term loans auctioned was initially
between $20 and $30 billion but was later increased to $50 billion and $75 billion. The facility size
increased to $150 billion in October 2008 and remained at that level until June 2009. During the
second half of 2009 and the first three months of 2010, the amount auctioned gradually declined,
and by the final auction in March 2010, only $3.4 billion was loaned out.
   Whether TAF was eﬀective in reducing rates in the interbank market has been debated by both
academic economists and policy makers. A working paper of the Federal Reserve Bank of New
York (McAndrews, Sarkar, and Wang 2008) provides empirical evidence that TAF has helped to
ease strains in the interbank market. In contrast, according to Taylor and Williams (2009,) TAF

                                                 4
had no impact on interest rate spreads. According to McAndrews, Sarkar, and Wang (2008), the
major problem in the money markets in 2007-2008 was lack of liquidity, and hence the TAF was
eﬀective because it provided central bank liquidity to the banking system when the interbanking
system collapsed. In contrast, Taylor and Williams (2009) argue that the main problem in the
market was not liquidity but rather counter-party risk, which TAF funding could not have solved.


3.       Data and Summary Statistics

The data analyzed here come from the Federal Reserve Bank disclosure of each of the individual
term loans provided under the TAF.3 The dataset lists 4,214 individual loans spanning the auctions
from December 12, 2007, until the last auction on March 8, 2010.
       The dataset includes micro-level detailed information for each loan contract on the contract
terms, the borrower’s identity, and the broad categories of the securities against which the loans were
made. The loan contract terms include the interest rate on the loan (in percent), the loan maturity
(in days), and the loan amount (in million of dollars). The dataset also provides information of
the borrower that includes the borrower’s name, city, and state.4 In addition, the Federal Reserve
Bank discloses information on the underlying collateral against which the loan was granted. In
particular, it reports the amount of unencumbered collateral (defined as the lendable value of
the borrower’s collateral), as well as the broad categories of the assets used as collateral. There
are twelve asset type categories in the data: commercial loans, residential mortgages, commercial
real estate loans, consumer loans, U.S. Treasury/Agency securities, municipal securities, corporate
securities, MBS and CMO issued by government-sponsored enterprises, mortgage-backed securities
(MBS) and collateralized mortgage obligations (CMO )issued by private corporations, asset-backed
securities, international securities, and other collateral. Finally, the dataset breaks down the dollar
value of collateral by broad credit rating categories.

3.1.      Loan Characteristics

Table 1 displays descriptive statistics for the main loan characteristics. As Panel A shows, the
average loan amount (in millions) is $906.1 million and the median is $125.0 million. The dispersion
in loan amount ranges widely, from a minimum of $1.4 million (First Merchant Bank of Indiana)
   3
    The data can be downloaded at http:www.federalreserve.govnewseventsreform taf.htm#datadesc .

    For foreign borrowers the dataset lists the city and state of their U.S. branch, which is in most cases New York
City.


                                                         5
to the largest loans of $15,000 million (to Bank of America, Barclays, Citibank, JP Morgan Chase,
Wachovia, and Wells Fargo). The average loan term is 45.6 days and ranges from 13 days to
85 days. The average annualized interest rate is 0.900 percent and ranges from 0.200 percent to
4.670 percent. As explained in Section 2, the TAF was conducted through auctions in which all
successful bids were subject to the same interest rate and loan terms. Thus, although loan amounts
vary across banks and over time, all banks borrowing in the same auction obtained loans with the
same interest rates and loan maturities.
   In addition to the loan amount there is strong heterogeneity in the amounts and types of
collateral posted by the borrowing banks. Borrowers pledged unencumbered collateral with an
average value of $4,285.4 million. The median collateral value is $571.0 million and the range is
from $5.1 million (Timberwood Bank) to $185,410.0 million (Bank of America). I also calculate
the ratio of the face amount of the loan to the value of the unencumbered collateral and report it
in the last row of Table 1. As the table shows, the average loan-to-collateral ratio is 0.334 and the
median is 0.286. Loan-to-collateral rates increased after the peak of the crisis as collateral values
increased and haircuts on collateral declined. For example, the average loan-to-value in 2008 was
0.255 compared to 0.370 and 0.460 in 2009 and 2010, respectively. Although the loan-to-collateral
ratios appear to be low and conservative, it is not clear whether these numbers are based on market
values or on face values of the underlying collateral.

3.2.   The Collateral Structure of TAF Loans

I now analyze the composition of collateral in TAF loans. Given that loan terms as well as loan rates
were determined at the auction level, the only sources of inter-bank variation were the amount of
the loan and the amount and type of the collateral. Indeed, banks pledged diﬀerent types of assets
as collateral for their loans, and most TAF loans were secured by numerous securities from diﬀerent
asset types. Table 2 provides a detailed analysis of collateral structure for the 4,214 TAF loans.
The table reports summary statistics for the dollar amount (in millions) as well as the number of
loans for which collateral was pledged in each asset category.
   The largest collateral category (based on the dollar amount of the assets pledged) is residential
mortgages. The mean amount of residential mortgages used as collateral is $3,786.3, and it was
used as collateral in 465 individual loans. The next largest category is asset-backed securities, which
according to the Federal Reserve definitions include securities collateralized by assets other than


                                                  6
first-lien mortgages, including collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). More than 1,301 loans were
backed by ABS and the mean collateral pledged in this category is $2,562.8 million and ranges from
$0.4 million to $25,953.7 million.
     The most popular asset class based on the number of loans that used it as collateral is commercial
loans, which were used in 2,291 loans, followed by commercial real estate and corporate securities,
which were used in 1,624, and 1,507 loans, respectively. Finally, U.S Treasury/Agency securities
were used in 833 loans with a mean collateral value of $348.8 millions.
     The dataset also breaks down the collateral pool by credit rating categories.5 Table 3 reports
summary statistics for the collateral assets by the major credit rating classifications. AAA-rated
U.S Treasury/Agency securities (including agency MBS and CMO) amounted, on average, to $650.3
million. The amount of other AAA-rated securities pledged as collateral was on average $1,845.8
per loan, and these were used in 1,859 loans. AA-rated and A-rated securities were used in 1,681,
and 1,817 loans, respectively, and accounted for about $380 million each of the collateral pool.
Other rating categories include BBB-rated (mean $238.0 million) and “other investment grade”
securities (mean $1,232.6).


4.     Empirical Analysis
4.1.    Determinants of Loan Characteristics

I begin the empirical analysis of TAF loans by analyzing the characteristics of the loans. The eight
OLS regressions reported in Table 4 use diﬀerent specifications to predict the determinants of the
loan terms. For each of the four loan determinants I report results from regressions that do not
include bank fixed-eﬀects (between analysis) and regressions that utilizes variation over time using
bank fixed-eﬀects (within analysis). As explanatory variables I use collateral dummy variables that
take the value of one if a particular asset is included in the collateral pool and zero otherwise. All
regressions include year×month fixed-eﬀects to account for time-varying eﬀects.6
     The table reports results for the following loan characteristics:loan amount (in logs), interest
rate, loan term, and loan-to-collateral ratio. However, it should be noted that because TAF loans
were granted at auction, the same interest rate and loan term applied to all banks participating in
   5
     The dataset reports asset types and credit ratings separately and hence does not enable classification that is
based on both credit ratings and asset class.
   6
     Although I use collateral dummy variables, the analysis yields similar results when using the actual share of
collateral in each asset category.



                                                        7
each auction. In contrast, the loan amount, the ratio of loan to collateral (the inverse of the loan
“haircut”), and the nature of the assets pledged as collateral varied across banks within an auction.
As Table 4 shows, the composition of the collateral has little explanatory power in bearing on loan
outcomes. First, few if any of the explanatory variables turn out to be significant in regressions that
use the interest rate or loan term as dependent variables. Second, the R-squared in the regressions
shows that the addition of bank fixed-eﬀects does not change the adjusted R-squared in the interest
rate and loan term regressions, indicating that bank-specific eﬀects had no impact on the loan rate
and maturity.7
       In contrast, collateral composition significantly aﬀected both loan amount and loan-to-collateral
ratio. As the first column shows, asset-backed securities, commercial real estate, international
securities, Treasuries, private mortgage-back securities, and consumer loans are associated with
larger loans, whereas municipal securities are correlated with smaller loans. However, given that the
regressions do not control for bank characteristics, it is likely that some of the collateral results are
driven by omitted variables. For example, if larger banks are also more likely to hold asset-backed
securities or international bonds, then the positive coeﬃcient in Column 1 might be capturing the
simple correlation between bank size and loan amount. In an attempt to address this concern, the
regression specification reported in Column 2 adds bank fixed-eﬀects to the analysis and hence uses
variation within bank from repeated loans in several TAF auctions over time. Indeed, as the second
column of the table demonstrates, only commercial real estate, Treasury, and private MBS survive
the addition of fixed-eﬀects and are still positive and significant. In addition, residential mortgages
and corporate bonds turn out to be positive and significant when fixed-eﬀects are added.
       Turning to the last two columns of the table, I find that loans secured by asset-backed securities
obtained loan-to-collateral ratios that are between -0.150 and -0.052 lower. Likewise, consumer
loans led to lower loan-to-value ratios, while loans secured by Treasuries had loan-to-collateral
ratios that were higher by 0.030. The results are consistent with the notion that haircuts on
collateral are used as an important tool for monetary policy. This is important especially when
non traditional monetary policy is conducted through auctions in which the interest rate and loan
terms do not vary across borrowers.
   7
    The high R-squared in the interest rate is completely driven by the year×month fixed-eﬀects since there was an
overall trend of declining interest rates throughout the TAF time period.

4.2.      The Evolution of TAF over Time

Figure 1 displays the evolution of the TAF lending facility size over time. As described in Section
2, the Federal Reserve Bank announced in advance the oﬀering amount in each auction. As Figure
1 shows, the initial auctions were smaller, with amounts that were between $20 and $30 billion.
The oﬀering amount was raised to $50 billion in the auction of March 10, 2008, and was further
increased to $75 billion on May 5th, 2008. While the amounts fluctuated between $25 and $75
billion in August and September 2008, the lending facilities increased dramatically to $150 billion
on October 6, 2008, during the peak of the financial crisis, and remained at that level until the end
of June 2009. The oﬀering amount gradually declined to $125 and $100 billion in July and August
2009, respectively, and later fluctuated between $75 and $25 billion. The final auction was held on
March 8, 2010 for $25 billion.
       Although Figure 1 plots the oﬀering amounts in each of the auctions and hence the potential
(the supply of funds), it does not show the amount demanded by banks that submitted bids for TAF
money or the amount that was actually loaned. Figure 2 supplements the information in Figure
1 by plotting both the total amount of proposition submitted by banks (the demand for loans)
(dashed line) and the amount that was actually awarded (solid line).8 As the figure illustrates, the
demand for funds exceeded the supply from the first auction in December 2007 until the auction
of September 22, 2008. For example, on December 12, 2007, the oﬀering amount by the Federal
Reserve was $20 billion, but the amount demanded by the 93 banks that submitted bids was $61.6
billion. In the auction of September 22, 2008, the facility was increased to $75 billion, but 85 banks
submitted bids totaling $133.6 billion.
       Following the Federal Reserve’s increase of the facility size to $150 billion in October 2008,
the amount of propositions submitted by banks was lower than the amount oﬀered by the Federal
Reserve Bank until the end of the TAF. In the October 8, 2008, auction – the first auction with a
facility size of $150 billion – 71 banks submitted bids totaling $138.1 billion. The largest amount
requested by banks was $142.5 billion, when 117 banks participated in the auction of February
9, 2009. The largest number of banks participating in a single auction was 124 (May 4, 2009),
compared to only 16 banks on November 24, 2008.
   8
    I use the notion of demand and supply here fairly loosely. Of course, given the auction structure, there was no
excess demand at a given rate.

4.3.      TAF Lending to Foreign Banks

Table 5 lists the number of loans, average loan size, and total amount loaned in each month from the
first auction in December 2007 through the final auction in March 2010. The table further breaks
down monthly lending by whether the borrowing bank is a U.S. depository institution or a foreign
bank.9 Overall, foreign banks amounted for 58 percent of the overall amount lent over time, with
a total amount of $2,214.688 million, compared to only $1,603,723 for U.S. banks. From December
2007 through most of 2008, foreign banks accounted for the vast majority of the lending, with
amounts that were between twofold and fourfold the total lending to U.S. banks. However, during
the peak of the crisis and following the collapse of Lehman Brothers, and especially in October and
November 2008, lending to U.S. banks exceeded borrowing by foreign banks. By April 2008 and
until the end of the TAF, foreign banks accounted again for the majority of TAF lending.
      Table 6 and Figure 3 present the fifty largest borrowers (measured by the total amount bor-
rowed). For each of the largest borrowers, Table 6 lists the total loan amount, the average loan size,
the number of loans obtained under the TAF, and the home country of the bank. Likewise, Figure
3 displays the largest fifty borrowers in a bar chart. As both Table 6 and Figure 6 show, U.K.-
based Barclays is the largest borrower, with a total amount of $232,283 million in forty-nine loans,
followed by Bank of America, with a total amount of $212,617 million in fifteen loans. The next
largest borrowers are Royal Bank of Scotland ($180,920 million), Wells Fargo ($153,953 million),
and Wachovia ($147,025 million). Furthermore, out of the ten largest borrowers, five are foreign
bank and out of the fifty largest borrowers, thirty-three are from foreign countries.

4.4.      The Collateral Structure of Foreign Banks

As I argued previously, the loan term and interest rate were determined at the auction level re-
gardless of the identity of the borrowing bank participating in the auction. In contrast, the size of
the loan and the collateral pledged by the bank were the only margins that both the bank and the
Federal Reserve Bank could adjust at the loan level. Given the importance of collateral in general
and in particular given the unique setup of the TAF, I now compare the collateral structure of
domestic banks to the collateral used by foreign banks. Table 7 presents summary statistics on the
usage of collateral by domestic and foreign banks. For each asset category reported by the Federal
Reserve the table lists the mean share of the asset category in the collateral pool, the standard
  9
      Foreign banks were eligible to participate in the TAF through their agencies or branches in the United States.


                                                          10
deviation of the share, and the number of loans pledging this asset as part of their collateral.
   The summary statistics are reported separately for domestic and foreign banks, and a two-
sample T-test for equal means is also presented. As Table 7 shows, foreign banks rarely used
residential mortgages as collateral – only 5 loans made to foreign banks were secured by residential
mortgages, compared to 460 loans to domestic banks. On the other hand, asset-backed securities
were used in 983 loans to foreign banks, compared to 318 loans to domestic banks. Furthermore,
asset-backed securities account for a larger share of the overall collateral pool in foreign banks
(9.323 versus 0.151, significant at the 1 percent level). As in the case of residential mortgages,
foreign banks used consumer loans in only 44 loans, while U.S.-based banks had consumer loans
in 1,043 loans. Private MBS/CMO are more prevalent in foreign banks (although their share is
slightly lower than in U.S. banks), and commercial real estate loans were used in only 222 foreign
loans. Other significant diﬀerences between foreign and domestic banks are that foreign banks were
less likely to use Agency MBS/CMO, U.S. Treasury/Agency, and U.S. municipal bonds and were
much more likely to pledge international securities as collateral.
   Table 8 supplements the results in Table 7 using regression analysis of the collateral composition
of foreign banks. For each of the main asset categories I use two dependent variables. The first
dependent variable is a dummy variable for whether a security type is pledged as collateral for a
particular loan – this variable captures the average tendency to use an asset as collateral. The
second dependent variable is the actual share of the collateral in each asset group conditional on
the asset being used as collateral. That is, while the first variable uses information on all loans, the
second variables captures only the cross-sectional variation within an asset category conditional on
its use. All regressions include year×month fixed-eﬀects as well as a control for the loan amount
(in logs) and a dummy variable that takes the value of one for foreign banks, and zero otherwise.
Regressions for which the dependent variable is a dummy variable are estimated using probit where
marginal eﬀects are reported. Table 8 confirms the univariate findings. Foreign banks are more
likely to use asset-backed securities, international assets, and Treasuries and are less likely to use
commercial real-estate.

5.       Why Foreign Banks?

Given that more than 58 percent of TAF lending went to foreign banks, it is important to un-
derstand why the Federal Reserve allocated its lending to foreign banks that are not under its
direct supervision. In addition, the information contained in the collateral structure of these banks
suggests that the collateral pledged by the foreign banks consisted of harder-to-value, riskier assets
such as asset-backed-securities. In particular, ABS held by the foreign banks are – according to the
data definitions provided by the Federal Reserve Board – collateralized debt obligations secured by
ABS, which were the securitized assets that declined the most during the crisis (Benmelech and
Dlugosz (2009)).

5.1.      Exposure to Asset-Backed Securities

One potential explanation for both the elevated lending to foreign banks and their usage of asset-
backed securities as collateral is that foreign banks were hit harder than U.S. banks and hence
required more liquidity. Given that many of these banks had exposure to assets that deteriorated
in value – mostly ABS and CDOs – these banks had weaker balance sheets.
       However, foreign banks were not the only banks that were exposed to ABS CDOs. Table 9
provides information on aggregate crisis-related write-downs as well as write-downs for some of
the largest financial institutions in the world.10 As the table demonstrates, as of October 2008,
Citigroup had written down $34.1 billion as a result of exposure to ABS CDOs, followed by Merrill
Lynch with $26.1 billion, and Bank of America ($9.1 billion). As of February 2009, the total value
of write-downs by financial institutions around the world was $520.1 billion, out of which $218.2
billion were due to exposure to ABS CDOs, representing 42 percent of total write-downs by the
financial sector. Write-downs driven by ABS CDOs were more than four times the size of corporate
credit-related write-downs. North American Banks accounted for the largest share of ABS CDOs
write-downs, followed by European banks. The European bank with the largest exposure to ABS
was UBS ($21,870 million), followed by Fortis Banks ($4,359 million), Royal Bank of Scotland
($3,609 millon) and Deutsche Bank ($2,092 million).
       If banks that were more likely to participate in the TAF were those that had worse balance sheets
  10
    The data are from Creditflux, a leading information source globally for credit trading and investing, credit
derivatives, structured credit, distressed credit, and credit research. This table is based on the results presented in
Benmelech and Dlugosz (2009).




                                                          12
due to exposure to structured finance products, we should expect the institutions with the most
exposure to ABS CDOs to borrow more under the TAF and pledge these securities as collateral.
However, mere exposure to structured finance assets does not seem to explain either the amount
of borrowing or the collateral used by the banks.
   Table 10 lists the fifty banks that pledged the largest amounts of asset-backed securities per
loan. As the table clearly shows, and consistent with Tables 7 and 8, most of the banks and financial
institutions that pledged ABS as collateral were foreign – mostly European – banks. For example,
the bank that pledged the largest amount of ABS for a given loan was Société Générale (France),
followed by Norinchukin Bank (Japan), Dexia (Belgium), Barclays (U.K.), and UBS (Switzerland).
Among the ten banks that pledged the largest amounts of asset-backed securities as collateral, only
two were American banks (State Street and U.S. Central Federal Credit Union).
   In contrast, the American banks that had the largest exposure and write-downs due to ABS
CDOs – Citigroup and Bank of America – had only modest borrowing secured by ABS. For example,
as Table 9 demonstrates, Citibank had the largest write downs due to ABS CDOs borrowed against
$760.8 million of ABS, compared to Société Générale with $16,352.0 million and UBS with $9,419.0
million. Thus, despite their exposure to ABS and structured finance assets, American banks were
less likely to obtain term funding through the TAF or to pledge asset-backed securities as collateral.

5.2.   The European Banks’ Dollar Crisis

Another explanation for the large number of loans made to foreign banks is that these banks suﬀered
from a currency mismatch in their balance sheets. Many foreign banks were active players in the
creation and issuance of structured finance products. As money markets came to a halt, these
banks required financing to meet the needs of rolling over their short-term liabilities. Moreover,
foreign banks were also subject to a currency mismatch in managing their assets and liabilities.
Although the main source of funding for some of these banks was based on demand deposits and
other forms of credit in their home countries that were denominated in their home currencies –
mostly the British pound and euro – many European banks issued liabilities in U.S. money markets
that were denominated in the U.S. dollar. Thus, not only were foreign banks subject to a roll-over
risk, but they also suﬀered from a currency mismatch and had to rely on special facilities such
as the currency swap lines between central banks including the European Central Bank, Bank of
England, Swiss National Bank, and Federal Reserve Bank, as well as special lending programs such


                                                 13
as the TAF.
   Indeed, foreign banks have played an important role in American financial markets during
the years leading to the financial crisis. According to Shin (2011): “The US-dollar denominated
assets of banks outside the United States are comparable in size to the total assets of the US
commercial banking sector, peaking at over $10 trillion prior to the crisis. The BIS banking
statistics reveal that a substantial portion of external U.S. dollar claims are the claims of European
banks against US counterparties.” Likewise, studies from the Bank for International Settlements
(BIS) by Baba, McCauley, and Ramaswamy (2009) and McGuire and von Peter (2009) show that
US dollar wholesale deposits and money market funds were an important source of funding for
European global banks in the years leading to the crisis.
   Moreover, Shin (2011) provides evidence based on data from the BIS that European global
banks raised their assets in the United States in the years leading to the crisis, increasing their
claims against U.S. borrowers by almost 40 percent from 2005 to 2007. Although European banks
had access to U.S. credit markets, they still had their core funding in their home countries in
European currencies. It was the currency mismatch between their assets – many in the form of
private-label ABS and CDOs – and their liabilities that made them vulnerable to the halt in U.S.
short-term lending markets.
   According to this view, European banks were more likely to bid for TAF money because they
were aﬀected more severely by the financial crisis, given their exposure to currency mismatch
between assets and liabilities. Shin (2011) draws similar conclusions from the fact that a large
fraction of TAF lending was originated to European banks. He writes:

     Two features stand out from the charts in Figure 11. The first is that the non-US banks’
     total borrowing is large relative to US banks’ borrowing. The relative magnitudes are
     roughly comparable at the peak. The second feature that stands out is the preponderance
     of European banks in the list of non-US recipients of TAF funding. The UK banks are
     especially prominent, led by Barclays, RBS and Bank of Scotland. The list also reveals
     some unlikely names, such as Norinchukin (the Agricultural Savings Bank of Japan)
     and the German landesbanks, who are likely to have ventured into US dollar lending in
     their search for higher yielding assets to deploy their large domestic deposit bases. (Shin
     2011, 17-18)


                                                 14
Thus, it is likely that the elevated lending to foreign banks and in particular to European banks
reflects their prominent role in the U.S. financial system, their involvement in the structured finance
markets – especially the private-name ABS and CDOs – and the currency mismatch in their balance
sheets.


6.     Conclusion

This paper provides detailed analysis of the Term Auction Facility plan using micro-level data on
the individual loans, the assets posted as collateral, and the identity of the borrowing banks. I find
that foreign banks accounted for about 60 percent of TAF lending and that the largest borrowers in
the program were mostly European banks. Moreover, most of the banks that pledged asset-backed
securities as collateral were European banks.
     I argue that the main reason for the large number of loans made to foreign banks is that
European banks suﬀered from a currency mismatch in their balance sheets. Many European banks
were active players in the creation and issuance of structured finance products, and as money
markets came to a halt, these banks required financing to meet the needs of rolling over their short-
term liabilities. These European banks were also subject to a currency mismatch in managing
their assets and liabilities. Although the main source of funding for some of these banks was based
on demand deposits and other forms of credit in their home-countries that were denominated in
their home currencies, they issued liabilities in U.S. money markets that were denominated in the
U.S. dollar. Thus, foreign banks not only were subject to a roll-over risk but also suﬀered from a
currency mismatch and had to rely special facilities such as the TAF.
     The data illustrate the scale of the operation of foreign – in particular European – banks in U.S.
financial markets. What precise role do European banks play in the American economy? What led
to their involvement in the U.S. financial system? These questions are left for future research.
