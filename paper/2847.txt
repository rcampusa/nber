                                      ABSTRACT




The securitization of fixed-rate mortgages suggests that the FRA/VA market

was fully integrated with capital markets by the early l98Os and that the

conventional market moved toward integration during the l98Os.        Assuming

full integration of FHA/VA5 via the GNMA securitization process, we first

estimate equations explaining near—par GNMA prices weekly for the 1981-88

period.       The price is then set equal to the new—issue price and, based

upon the preferred equation, the perfect—market retail coupon rate is

computed. Next we estimate equations (for three year segments of the

1971-88 period) explaining conventional commitment mortgage coupon rates

in terms of current and lagged values of this perfect-market coupon rate.

Finally, we examine differences between the perfect—market and actual

coupon rates and compute the impact of these differences on residential

capital accumulation.

                   Integration of Mortgage and Capital Markets and
        -              the Accumulation of Residential Capital

                     Patric H. Hendershott and Robert Van Order


      The fixed-rate home mortgage market appears to be fully integrated into

"the capital market" broadly defined.          That is, mortgage rates move in response

to changes in other capital market rates, and mortgage funds are readily

available    at going market rates.     Mortgage rates can diverge from other rates

becauae the "technical" characteristics        ——   call   provisions   in particular -—    of
mortgages    and other securities differ and the "price" of these characteristics

can change, but in a fully integrated capital market shifts in the demands for

or supplies of mortgage funds will not cause divergence to occur.

      The mortgage market was integrated gradually throughout the l970s and

first half of the l980s with the development of active markets for mortgage

pass-through securities.     Legislation in 1968 and 1970 established the

Government Hational Mortgage Association           (Ginnie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan

Mortgage Corporation    (Freddie Mac)   ,   and by 1971 the Ginnie Mae pass-through

program for government-insured    FHA/VA mortgages and the Freddie Mac program for

conventional mortgages were in operation.           Integration was stimulated     in the

l980s by the deregulation    of deposit rate ceilings and the erosion of thrift

tax subsidies, developments that eliminated thrift cost advantages              in funding

mortgages.

      Mortgage market integration has had conflicting effects on homebuyers.

During most of the l960s and 1970s, existence of specialized housing finance

institutions caused mortgage funds to be cheaper than they would have been with

full integration.     In contrast, during the credit crunches of 1969—70 and

1974-75 and during much of the early and middle l980s, when the traditional

housing finance institutions were under enormous pressures              and the conventional
                                              —2—




secondary    market had not yet exercised its full force, mortgage funds were

either unavailable or relatively expensive, and homebuyers would have

benefitted from a more integrated system.

         This paper explains how the market for fixed-rate mortgages         has developed

since 1971 and how this development has affected the accummulation             of

residential    capital.   We begin with a discussion of the most important change

in the market:      the growth in mortgage pass—through     securities.     We then test

how this change has altered the relationship between mortgage and Treasury

rates.     We do this by estimating    (1)   what the mortgage rate would have been had

markets been "perfect" and (2) how actual rates responded to changes in the

perfect—market rate for different subperiods of the 1971—88 time span.              The


perfect—marketrate adjusts Treasury rates for the value of the prepayment

option in mortgages.      The impact of an imperfect mortgage market on residential

capital accumulation      is then measured as the difference    between the

accumulation based upon the actual mortgage rate (and credit rationing              in the

1970s) and that based on the perfect rate (and no rationing)         .    The vehicle for

these calculations     is a modified version of the Housing Sector of the

Washington University Macro Model.


               I.   The Development   of Mortgage Pass-Through Securities

         In 1968, the Government Hational Mortgage Association       )Ginnie Mae) was

formed within the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development to

administer government mortgage support programs.          Two years later Ginnie Mae

began guaranteeing mortgage—backed       pass-through securities, GMMAs, representing

shares in pools of FHA/VA loans.        Investors in pass—throughs       receive a pro rata

share of the payments, both scheduled and early         (in the event    of prepayment or

default),    on the underlying mortgages.       While investors in whole FHA/VA loans

are insured by FHA or VA against loss of principal and interest,             investors    in

GNMA5 are guaranteed the full timely payment of principal and interest.

         In 1970, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) waa

chartered    to spur the development of a secondary market for conventional

mortgages.     As part of this effort, Freddie Mac introduced the first

conventional mortgage pass-through in 1971, the Mortgage Participation

Certificate     (PC)   .     While   Freddie Mac doesn't have a full faith and credit

Federal guarantee, the underlying conventional mortgage is not itself fully

insured.     Thus the Freddie Mac guarantee adds more value to the underlying

mortgage than does the Ginnie Mae guarantee.              In 1981, the Federal National

Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae)              initiated a conventional   mortgage-backed

security    (MBS(    program similar to Freddie Mac's PC program.          Fannie has

intermediated       in the more traditional sense, buying mortgages and issuing its

own debt, since 1938, and it has an implied guarantee             comparable   to Freddie

Mac's.

         Statutes limit the dollar value of loans that can be pooled into the

various pass-through securities.              The limit on GNMAs follows from the limit on

the underlying FHA and VA loans.             The 1988 limit, which varies regionally, is

$67,500 to $101,250.            These limits have changed little in the 1980s.        The

dollar limit on conventional loans that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac can

purchase,    the    conforming         limit, changes annually with a house price index,

but does not vary regionally.             The 1988 limit was $168,700 up 45 percent since

1985.    In 1987, over 90 percent of fixed—rate home mortgage loans             (85   percent
of dollar volume) was eligible for pooling by the agencies.

        The markets for fixed rate FMA/VA and conforming conventional loan pass-

throughs developed           at different rates.    The top half of Table 1 presents data

on the growth in the securitization            of fixed-rate FHA/VA loans.     The importance

of pass-througha           to the new origination market is measured as the ratio of GNMA

issues backed by 1—4 family loans to total originations             of these loans      (Ginnie
                                            —4—




Mae is prohibited from securitizing FMA/VAs over 18 months old)            .
                                                                               By the second

half of the 1970s, two-thirds of FRA/VA originations went into GNMA pools; by

the early 1980s four—fifths       did; since 1982 all FHA/VA5 have gone into GNMAs.

      The pass-through market for conforming conventional loans developed less

rapidly   )see the lower half of Table 1).         The best measure of the two agencies'

presence in this market is the share of new fixed-rate conventional FRMs

)generally defined as less than one year since origination)          eligible for agency

securitization    )under the conforming    limit) that is, in fact, securitized by

Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae.        Column 1 indicates pass—through issues backed by

new FRMs; the product of columns 2 and       3    is the total volume of FRM

originations,    conforming    and nonconforming.     Because roughly 80 percent of the

dollar volume of    F814   originations is under the conforming limit, the ratio of

pass-throughs    backed by new FRMs to 0.8 times FaN originations is an estimate

of this best measure.        In the early 1980s, less than 5 percent of newly—

originated conforming conventional       fixed—rate home mortgages    was securitized,

in contrast to 77 percent of FHA/VA5.        By 1986-87, though, over half of these

mortgages went into agency pass throughsJ

      The difference in the development of FHA/VA and conventional             pass-

throughs in the 1970s and early l980s stems largely from the historical

differences in the origination of FHA/VA and conventional mortgages.              Mortgage

bankers have tended to dominate the FRA/VA market, accounting             for 70 to 80

percent of originations )see top of table) versus only 7 to 15 percent of

conventional originations )see bottom of table), and they sell virtually all

their originations    to other investors.        Thus when an improved method for

selling mortgages    became available, mortgage bankers quickly took advantage of

the opportunity.     By the early 1980s, virtually all mortgage banker

originations were sold to Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac (some

conventionals    were sold to Fannie Mae for its portfolio)      .   In   contrast,
                                            —5—




depository institutions have dominated conventional originations         (80 to 90

percent);    and, at least until the 1980s, they tended to keep their originations

as portfolio investments.       Thus an improved selling method alone was not

sufficient to stimulate       the conventional pass-through market,    the explanation

for the increased securitization of conventional FRMs is best left for later in

the paper.



                      II.     Models of Mortgage Rates and Markets

      The last twenty years of mortgage—market         analysis have been dominated by

two rather extreme approaches.        The first emphasized   segmented markets

dominated by thrifts and ad hoc empirical approaches with proxies for effects

of rationing and regulations.        The more recent approach has emphasized

neoclassical    competitive markets,    implicitly at least on the grounds that the

rise of the secondary markets has made mortgages just another bond traded in a

very liquid market.

      Both approaches appear to have been right, but at different times.          The

first approach was a reasonable       one in the 1970s but has been supplanted   by the

neoclassical    version in the middle 1980g.      In this section we emphasize the

neoclassical,    competitive    model because it will be the basis of our empirical

work in section III.        We then discuss the segmented market version and how it

departs from the competitive model.

The Neoclassical Perfect Market Model:        Theory

      The neoclassical model applies recent work in financial markets under

perfect competition    (see, e.g., Black and Scholes      (1973), Brennan and Schwartz

(1977), and Cox, Ingersoll and Ross (1985)] to mortgages.         The models derive

prices for risky securities in a world free of both transaction costs and

arbitrage profits.
                                              -6—




         The underlying methodology as applied to mortgage and other markets (see

Brennan and Schwartz (1985) and Hendershott and Van Order                (1988) for


expositions applied to mortgage markets] comes from Black and Scholes' insight

that in perfect capital markets with enough independent assets a portfolio of

several assets can be set up that, at least over a short time period, exactly

replicates the returns of the asset to be priced.               From this portfolio, the

price of the aseet in question can, with some mathematical dexterity, be

determined.

         In mortgage markets the bulk of research has been on pricinq long-term

fixed—rate mortgages     [see Dunn and Mcconnell       (1981)   ,   Buser and Mendershott

(1984)   ,   Brennan and Schwartz   (1985)   and lCau et. al. [1986) ].      Most of the

analyses have abstracted from default risk and focussed on the borrower's
                                                                       in Section III of
option to prepay at par.       In our empirical explanations

Ginnie Mae prices or retail commitment          coupon rates on 80% loan—to—value loans,

this focus is appropriate because there is little default risk in 80% loan—to—

value loans      (maybe 3 to 8 basis points in coupon premium)           or Ginnie Maes.2

         An investor in a typical fixed—rate mortgage is long an amortizing 30—

year bond but short en American call on the bond.               Absent default risk and

transaction costs, the risk in holding the mortgage comes only from interest

rates and is composed of two parts:           the usual interest rate riak on the bond

and the interest rate risk on the option.           The combination of the two leads to

an asymmetry that is the central issue in mortgage pricing:                 when interest

rates rise, the mortgage investor loses because mortgage price falls, but when

rates fall, the investor's gains are limited because borrowers will exercise

their option to prepay at par.                                                        -




         This   option is most transparent in the case of the FHA/VA mortgages in

Ginnie Mae poo1s because those mortgages can be assumed by new house buyers.

Thus the financing and selling of the house are, in perfect markets, separate.
                                            —7—




But there are transaction costs, -and while people do seem to act qualitatively

as the model says, they do not prepay as ruthlessly as some early applications

of the models suggested.      This is apparent from both prepayment data, which

show only gradual changes in prepayment rates in the face of large interest

rate declines, and empirical     analysis of prepayments [e.g., Foster and Van

Order   (1985)   and Green and Shoven   (1986)].   Nonetheless,   the frictionless    model

is a good beginning, and it certainly captures the qualitative          properties    of

more complicated models.

        Tha basic idea of the model is depicted in Figure 1.         Line AM depicts the

value of a noncallable amortizing bond as a function of "the" interest rate.3

The bond has the usual downward sloping convex shape.          Line 8CM shows the value

of a mortgage that is callable at par, and the difference between the two

curves is the value of the call option.       The mortgage can never have a value

greater than par, and in fact the curve must become tangent to the par line.

This tangency is a first order condition for optimal exercise of the call (see

Hendershott—Van Order (1988) for a brief discussion)       .   Note that   the

relationship between value and interest rate is complicated.          For deeply

discounted mortgages, the relationship is just like that for the bond (the

option is too far out of the money to be valuable), but as value approaches par

the curve becomes concave rather than convex (traders refer to this as negative

convexity)

        Because of various transaction costs, mortgages are not generally           called

in the frictionless manner described here.         Transaction costs mean that the

mortgage value curve can be above par as rates fall (the OM line) but there

will be a tendency for the value to revert to par as rates become so low that

exercise is quite probable.     Hence, the value—interest      rate curve f or mortgages

can, in principle, have an upward sloping segment        (traders sometimes      call this

negative duration).
                                             —8—




      Empirical pricing models used on Wall Street (largely unpublished(

generally    take a probabilistic   approach to prepayment, assuming that the odds

of prepayment increase     (in a nonlinear    way( as the new-issue   mortgage rate

falls below the coupon rates on existing mortgages.          These models capture the

flavor of the option approach, but the changes in shape of the mortgage-value

curve, particularly in the range just below par (which is the range

corresponding    to new issuas( , are not nearly as striking as we depicted in

Figure 1.

Neoclassical    Perfect Market Model:    Empirical    Implications

      The option—oriented    pricing models, given a prepayment function, provide

exact predictions of mortgage price in a similar way to that in which the

Elack-Scholes    model provides an exact prediction of a stock option's price.        We

do not intend to use the model that way.           Rather we shall regress mortgage

price on the variables that the model tells us should affect the values of the

call option and the underlying      noncallable bond, and we shall see if

gualitative properties of the model hold up.          What the models suggest is that

the price of a standard fixed-rate mortgage should depend only on:           its coupon


rate, term to maturity,     market interest rates of various maturities, and the

volatility of the intarest rates.       More specifically:

       (l(   an egual rise in all market interest rates, holding the coupon
             constant, should lower mortgage price (except in the extreme negative
             duration case discussed above(

       (2(   a twisting of the yield curve (holding the "average" of rates
             constant( that increases the difference between long and short rates
             (the slope( should raise the value of a mortgage because the implied
             increased probability that interest rates will rise reduces the value
             of the call option.

       (3(   increases in volatility will lower mortgage value because4greater
             volatility raises the value of the homeowner call option.
                                                                  —9—




        (4) interactions           among the variables should matter.                       In particular:

                 a)     When the mortgage is at a big discount (the coupon rate is low
         -
                        relative to interest rates) the effect of volatility and slope
                                                                           ,

                        should be smaller because the option is out of the money.  Thus
                        slope and volatility should both be interacted with the
                        difference between the coupon rate and market rates.

                 b)     When rates are expected to rise, the effect of volatility
                        should be smaller because the option is less likely to be
                        exercised.  Thus volatility and slope should be interacted.

                 C)     When rates are                 expected  to fall and thus the expected mortgage
                 -      life is short,                 mortgage value will depend more heavily on short
                        term rates and                 less                  term rates. Thus slope
                                                             heavily5on long
                        squared should                 be included.

        In summary, if we write the price of a mortgage as:


             P =      M)c,r, A,   a)                                                                       (1)

Segmented Markets

      The perfect market model says that mortgage price       (or alternatively the

mortgage coupon rate for a given mortgage price) depends on a small number of

general capital market variables,    that the response to changes in those

variables is predictable and fast, and that mortgage price (or coupon rate)

does not depend on variables peculiar to the mortgage market, like details of

particular   lending institutions.

      This would have seemed like a silly model twenty years ago, when mortgage

lending was tied to particular institutions, the thrifts.        Portfolio

restrictions on savings and loans     (no corporate   loans, bonds, or equity issues)

encouraged   their investment   in residential mortgages,   and these investments

were especially profitable to thrifts owing to special tax advantages.        The tax


preference   was the ability of thrifts to compute loan loss reserves that far

exceeded a reasonable provision for normal losses, as long as thrifts invested

a large fraction of their assets in housing—related       loans or liquid assets


(Hendershott and Villani, 1980 appendix)    .   In   effect, thrifts were allowed to

transfer large portions of their before tax income to reserves, thereby

avoiding taxes.     Between 1962 and 1969, the transfer was limited to 60 percent

of taxable income; between 1969 and 1979, the fraction was gradually reduced to

40 percent; the Tax Reform Act of 1986 lowered the fraction to 8 percent.

      The incentive provided by the extraordinary        loan loss provisions for

investment in residential mortgages depends on the expected level of thrift

taxable profits     (with no profits, the incentive is zero) ,   the income tax   rate,

and the statutory fraction of income that can be transfered to reserves.

Assuming a one percent net pretax return on assets, the incentive was

substantial in the 1960s and 1970s.      In the l960s when the transfer fraction

was 60 percent, savings and loans would have accepted a three—quarters

percentagepoint lower pretax return on tax preferred housing-relatedassets
                                             —11—




than on comparable nonpreferred assets.          By 1979, when the transfer fraction

was down to 40 percent, they would have accepted a half percentage point less.

        In the 1960s and 1970s world, connections with capital markets were

tenuous and gradual.        A rise in interest rates could raise mortgage rates if it

increased     deposit rates, but deposit rates had ceilings.       Increased    rates might

cause deposit outflows,       i.e., disintermediation,   but that was gradual and to

the extent there was mortgage rationing (from state usury laws, FHA ceilings

and/or general sluggishness) the effect of rising market rates on mortgage

rates was slow and tenuous.          Hence most researchers at the time focussed on

things peculiar to the thrift industry, such as deposit rates and deposit

flows, rather than general capital market conditions.          If we regressed actual

mortgage price or rates during such a period on fictional mortgage prices or

rates predicted     by the perfect market model, we would expect to see a bad fit.

Moreover,     to the extent that the predicted price/rate had any effect, it would

be a lagged one.

        A separate issue is whether mortgage rates in the l970s were higher or

lower than they would have been in the perfect market case.           One might suspect

that they were generally lower owing to the large tax advantages until recently

enjoyed by thrifts, the portfolio restrictions that kept thrifts out of many

other lending activities, and the possibility that thrifts did not fully

appreciate the value of the call option borrowers were receiving.              Oeposit rate

ceilings probably lowered rates in some periods and raised them in others.


                             III.    Analysis of GNMA Price Data

        Roth (1988) analyzes the integration of mortgage and capital markets by

looking    at changes in the correlation      between conventional commitment mortgage

rates   and   Treasuries.    Me   finds that the correlation has increased over time
and is    currently quite high.       In this section we extend that sort of analysis
                                         —12—




by constructing a perfect mortgage-like    capital market rate, looking at lags in

the adjustment of conventional    commitment mortgage rates to perfect rates

(rather than to Treasury rates), and estimating whether observed mortgage rates

have been higher or lower than perfect capital markets would have warranted.

      Our analysis consists of two parts.       First, we assume that the GNMA

market has been integrated with capital markets since 1981.       This is because

GNMAs have full faith end credit guarantees and have traded like Treasuries,

with comparably low transactions costs and high volume, at least since 1981.

We   begin by estimating   a price equation for ONMA5.   The neoclassical model


says that the price of a GNMA should depend on its coupon and term, market

interest rates, and interest rate volatility, with properties discussed in

Section II.    We then estimate this equation, set price equal to the new—issue

price, and solve the equation for the perfect—market     retail coupon rate.

       Second, we regress conventional   commitment mortgage coupon rates on

current and past values of the estimated perfect-market       coupon rate taken from

the ONMA equation.    If markets are perfect, there should be no lag and the

coefficient    of the current rate should be unity.   We test this, and we also

look at the difference between actual and predicted rates over time to see when

actual mortgage rates were above or below the perfect—market rate.

GNMA Prices

       Our analysis of the determinants of mortgage prices is based upon weekly

GNMA price and coupon data from the DRI data base for the January 1981-July

1988 period.     These data are supposed to be for current-coupon,    near—par

mortgages;    in fact, the GNMA prices vary from 91 to 101.     The seven—year

constant maturity yield is the basic Treasury rate, and slope is defined as the

difference between the seven—year and six—month Treasury rates.        All interest

rates, including the mortgage coupon rate, are computed on a bond- equivalent

basis and are measured in percentage points,       Volatility is measured as the
                                        —13—



                                                                    20 weeks.
cumulative absolute change in the seven—year rate over the previous

                                                 because it will probably lag
Using historic volatility presents some problems

behind traders' expected volatility.

       The first equation explaining the ONMA price in Table 2 includes only the

coupon rate, the seven-year rate, the slope, and volatility.          The basic call—


option model is confirmed:     price is positively   related to the slope    (high


slope, lower probability of call) and negatively       related to volatility (greater


volatility; greater probability of call)   .   Price   is also positively and

negatively related, respectively,    to the coupon and seven-year Treasury rates,

with their coefficients being virtually identical in absolute velue.          The

latter is consistent with the proposition that an equal rise in the coupon rate

and all interest rates should not affect the price of a bond that is close to

par.   While the regression coefficients   are all statistically      significant at

the 0.01 level, the residuals    are positively   correlated.6     When a semi—

difference transformation is performed,    the coefficients      change little, and the

slope and volatility coefficients    are still 2 and 3 times their respective

standard errors.

       The third and fourth equations include the interaction of slope and

volatility with the spread between the coupon and seven—year rates.          A large

                                                                    be quite
spread says the option is in the money and thus mortgage price will

sensitive to slope and volatility.     In contrast, price should be relatively

insensitive when the spread is zero or negative.        As expected, the slope and

volatility coefficients   in the previous equations are now apportioned between

the straight variable and its interaction with the coupon—seven year spread,

with the latter having greater statistical significance.          As the spread

declines   (the mortgage goes to a discount), the impact of slope and volatility

 (the call value) decreases.
                                                  —14—




        The fifth and aixth equations        in Table       3   include the slope and volatility

square terms, as well as their product.                 Because interpretation    of these

equations is difficult,        Table 3 has been constructed,           partial derivatives   of


price with respect to volatility and slope are computed from equation 2-6 in

Table   2   for slope varying from —1.5 percentage points to +2.5 percentage points

and volatility ranging from one to five (three to five when the yield curve is

downward sloping)    ,   reflecting    the values generally        experienced over the 1971-88

period.     For a positively sloped yield curve, the partials are as expected:

positive and negative with respect to slope and volatility, respectively,                    and

smaller in absolute magnitude the more the mortgage is at a discount (the call

is less in the money)      .   For   negatively       sloped yield curves, though, the partial

with respect to slope is effectively zero, and the partial with respect to

volstility     is reduced in absolute magnitude.

        We ran similar regressions for the 1980—SB and 1982—Be periods, and we

ran regressions using the 10 year and             3   month Treasury rstes.      While in some

cases the signs of the cross partials were not as expected,                 the results were

broadly similar to those in Table 2.              We chose the 1981—SB regression because

it looked the most like what the neoclassical model says and, hence, is the

best perfect market benchmark.           None of the results that follow are changed

much if the other regressions are used.

Conventional Commitment Mortgage Rates

        To determine how the conventional mortgage market has been integrated

with capital markets generally, we regress retail conventional commitment rates

on the current and lagged one to eight week values of the perfect—market rate

implied by the GNMA price equation.           To obtain this perfect-market rate, we

solve the estimated price equation )2—6 in Table 2) for the coupon rate, set

the mortgage price equal to 100 less the actual points charged in the

conventional market )less one point presumed to equal origination                   costs)
                                              —15—




recompute   the coupon rate using the observed values of the other variables,

convert the rate to a mortgage (rather than bond-equivalent)               basis, and add 50

basis points for servicing and other costs.              The retail commitment   rate and

points are those obtained by the Federal Home Loan Hortgage Corporation in a
                                                                                      To the
weekly survey of 125 major lenders conducted since the spring of 1971.

extent that integration has occurred,         we should expect changes in the perfect—

market coupon rate to be reflected quickly and fully in the conventional

commitment rate.

      Table 4 contains the estimated coefficients             and standard errors, with the

semidifference    transformation,       for weekly data from the 1986—88, 1983-85,

                                                         These estimates   are summarized    in
1980—82, 1976—79, and 1971-75 time periods.

Table 5, which reports the cummulative          adjustment concurrently      and over two,


four, six, and eight week lags.          The shift toward integrated markets is

striking.     The percentage of the change in the GNMA rate that is reflected

instantaneously    in the retail conventional rate rises monotonically from

effectively    zero in the 1970s to 8 in the 1980—82 period, 16 in the 1983—85

period, and 59 in the 1986—88 period.           The fraction of the change in the GNMA

rate reflected    in the conventional rate within two weeks rises monotonically

from a sixth in first half of the l970s, to almost half in the early 1980s, to

over half in the 1983-85 period, and to nearly one in recent years.

      This shift is confirmed by direct regressions )specific results not

reported here) of the conventional          commitment    rate on proxies for the call


premium and current and lagged values of the seven—year Treasury rate.7                The

                                                                                       in the
percentage change in the Treasury rate that is reflected instantaneously

conventional     rate rises from    3   and 5 in the earlier periods to 20 for the

1984-86 period and 52 for 1986—88.           similarly,    the percentage reflected within

two weeks rises from 30 to 40 to 50 to 75.

Differences    in Actual and Perfect—Market     Commitment       Rates

      The first three columns of Table 6 list the annual average values of the

actual conventional mortgage commitment rate, our fictional perfect-market

rate, and the difference      between them for the 1971—88 period.8               The next column

contains the average yearly difference        between the actual GNMA coupon and the

estimated   coupon obtained by solving equation          (2-6)   in Table   2.     As can be

seen, these estimation errors are less than 1D basis points in all but two

years, 1982 and 1984, and less than 3D basis points in those.                    These errors

reflect our inability to fully specify all the nonlinearities               and interactions

in the pricing of GNMA5, as well as to measure the variables                (especially

volatility) precisely.      Thus the difference between the conventional error and

the GMMA error    (zero prior to l98D because we have no better estimate)               ,   is   our

best estimate of the difference between actual and perfect—market retail

conventional   commitment    rates, and the perfect-marketrate plus the GNMA error,

shown in the last column, is our best estimate of the perfect—market rate.

      The precise differences are, of course, subject to some error; the actual

rats is a survey rate and the perfect rate is computed from an empirical

equation estimated with some error.         Nonetheless,     the overall pattern of the

differences seems both systematic        and plausible    enough to be taken seriously.

The sctusl rate was three—quarters        of a percentage point below the perfect—

market rate in the 1971-75 period; a third of a point below in the 1976—SD

period;   and roughly half s point above the perfect rate in the 1982-86 period.

Beginning in the middle of 1987, the actual rate is very close to the perfect

rate, the conventional      conforming   fixed—rate mortgage market seemingly being

fully integrsted into capital markets.

     As explained above, the low mortgage rates in the l970s can be attributed

to tax advantages for thrift mortgage investments and portfolio restrictions

against nonmortgage    investments.       The switch in the 1980s reflects a sharp

relative shift of thrifts out of home mortgage investments.            Most strikingly,


the share of saving and loan total assets in home mortgages and agency

                                                                fell from 72 to 57

of savings and loan asset powers, and a regulatory enhanced aversion to

interest rate risk.     The reduced profitability eroded the tax incentives for

residential mortgage investment,          while the expansion   of powers and regulatory

                                                              also encouraged
aversion encouraged thrifts to invest more widely (the latter

switching    from FRM5 to    AP.Ms)

      The half percentage point premium in the early l9BOs provided the

incentive for the securitization          of conventional FRMs.    The premium covered the


start up costs of the securitizers          and the liquidity premium demanded by

investors.      As the volume of mortgage pools grew, bid/ask spread were bid down
                                                                 costs of the
 (and thus the liquidity      premium fell) , and the per dollar

securitizers     declined.    As a result, the yields on conforming conventional

loans fell by 30 basis points relative to those on nonconforming            loans

 (Hendershott and shilling,       1988)


       IV.    Imperfect Mortgage Market and Residential         Capital Accumulation

       The imperfect (subsidized) home mortgage market in the 1970s led to more

 residential capital accumulation than a perfect, fully—integratedmarket would

Also, with a perfectly integrated mortgage market, credit rationing would not

have existed.      This would have increased housing construction       during the

"rationing" periods,     but decreased construction during the subsequent              "catch

up" periods,      Obtaining   a measure of how residential     capital accumulation would

have differed had the mortgage market been fully integrated is the purpose of

this section.

          We first considered using a general equilibrium simulation model to

compute the long run equilibrium       impact.      However, the largely self-reversing

nature of the disturbances ——      higher   mortgage rates in the 1970s but lower in

the 1980s end greeter housing starts late in the cycle           (removal of rationing(

but lesser starts early in the next one (removal of catch up( ——           ruled       this

approach out; the long run impact is negligible.            We decided instead to modify

the residential investment sector of the Washington University Macro Model

(WIJMN(    and to simulate it.9   In what follows we first describe the WUMM

residential sector and our adjustments        to it and then report the simulations.

          The housing sector of WUMM determines residential investment,

disaggregated     into the value of single-family homes constructed,       the value of

multi-family homes constructed, the value of mobile homes shipped, and a

residual component consisting mostly of the value of additions and alterations

to existing residential structures.         Housing starts and the stock of houses,

both measured in units, are explained by a neoclassical model of investment in

which the equilibrium housing stock is determined by demographic factors, the

real after—tax cost of housing, and cyclical considerations.           Starts are

translated into completed units through a completion or phase-in schedule.

Finally, the value of residential      construction     is derived as the product of the
                                                                                   -
number of units completed      and an exogenous real value per completion.

        We adjust the WUMM sector in a number of ways.          First, for the 1971—1988

                                                       in the rental costs of
period we replace their secondary market mortgage rate

capital for owner-occupiedand rental housing,           respectively, with our computed

effective mortgage commitment        rate snd the WUMM corporate bond rate.       The

             commitment rate is the coupon rate adjusted for points.10            We switch
effective

from the secondary mortgage market rate in the rental coat of capital for

multifamily    housing to the corporate rate, rather than the mortgage commitment

rate, because we are not analyzing the impact of a perfectly integrated

                                     Second, we reestimate    the single-family    starts
multifamily    mortgage market.

equation using the effective mortgage rate and including

variable for the 1969-77 period.         Third, we endogenize    the real value of


single—family    completions.      The starts and real value equations follow

Hendershott     (1980)


        The model is first "adjusted" to reproduce history.          That is, add factors

are put into each equation so that all variables track historic values

precisely.     Two aimulationa are then run.        In both, the credit rationing

variable is set equal to zero.          In the second, the actual home mortgage rate is

replaced by the adjusted perfect-market         rate.

        The effect of removing credit rationing in the 1973.2 to 1975.4 period on

housing starts is illustrated in Figure
                                        2.          Rationing   aggrevated the slowdown

in single—family         starts in 1974—75 and reinforced    the 1976—77 recovery.      With a

                                                              have existed and this
perfectly     integrated mortgage market, rationing would not

housing cycle would have been less aevere.12            An extra 15 billion (1982$) of

housing would have been accumulated         by the first quarter of 1976, but by the

second quarter of 1978 the atock would have been back its original value, i.e.,

15 billion dollars of housing construction would have been pulled forward in

time.

      Next we anelyze the impect of shifting the mortgage rate to its perfect-

market path and setting the rationing variable to zero.            Figure 3 indicates the

impact on the rsal value of residential capital-           The 75 basis point increase

in the mortgage rate to the perfect market rate in 1971—73 lowers the real

stock by g billion    (1982$)   -   Then the impact of removing credit rationing comes

into play; the real value rises by 14 billion           (from —9 to +5)   and then reverses

itself by late 1978.      The additional   reduction in the real housing stock in the

late 1970s and early 1980s reflects the generally          lower level of real price of

single family units constructed.        We then see the effect of the perfect

mortgage rate falling from nearly a half point above the actual rate in 1980 to

a half point below in the 1981—86 period; the housing stock rises from nearly

12 billion below actual to 5 billion below in early 1983.            The difference

between the simulated stock and the actual then oscillates around this value

for the rest of the simulation period.


                                      IV. Conclusions

      The conventional wisdom that mortgage markets have gradually become

integrated   with capital markets is clearly consistent with the data.           The

fixed-rate   government   insured mortgage merket      (FHA/VA) appears to have been

integrated   by the early l980s, and the conventional FRM market became

integrated   during the l980s.      This integration accelerated     in the 1986—88

period when the share of newly—originated          conventional conforming fixed—rate

mortgages securitized by the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac jumped to 50 percent.

The regressions imply that virtually all of the adjustment to a cepital market

shock is completed within two weeks.        Beceuse our retail mortgage rate is a

list (ratherthan transaction) price, the lag may in fact be even shorter.

      Rates on fixed—rate conventional mortgage loans are currently        about what

one would expect given capital market (GNMA)       rates.   In contrast, conventional

rates were a half percentage   point   too low    in the l970s, owing to thrift tax

advantages and portfolio restrictions,    and a half point 'too high' in the

1982—86 period because thrift profits and portfolio restrictions        had

effectively disappeared.   This half point "excess' return on mortgages

stimulated development and use of the Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae pass-through

programs.   Since early 1987, rates on conforming FRM5 have been in line with

those on GNMAs.

      Had mortgage rates always been about right, housing production          would have

been less in the 1971—80 period and more in the 1981—83 span.         Moreover,

housing cycles would have been dampened.        On net, the residential housing stock

would be only slightly below today's level.

    The agencies also securitize             adjustable    rate and multifamily   mortgages.

Between 1975 and 1982, 8 to 16 percent of FHA multifamily                    mortgages   were

securitized            (Seiders, 1983 p.   ?) .    The securitizetion of conventional

conforming ARMs and multifamilies               by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac is a more

recent phenomenon.             In 1984—85, only 2 to       3   percent were securitized;    in l986

87, the percentage was still only about 10.                     The greater securitization      of

fixed—rate         single—family mortgages        relative to adjustable rate and multifamily

mortgages likely reflects both the greater standardization                    of the former and

the greater desire of originators               of ARMs to hold them in portfolio.

    Because default on a guaranteed             loan causes prepayment at par, default could

in principle affect required returns, but for the close to per loans that we

analyze the effect must be trivial.


    In general, the price is a function of a vector of interest rates, i.e., the

entire yield curve matters.                In some models (e.g., Cox, Ingersoll, Ross

(1985)   )   ,   all   interest rates can be written as a function of a single state

variable, the instantaneous            rate.      The Brennan-schwartz     papers look at two

rates, a long and a short rate.                A casual, but reasonable, simplification          is to

look at the yield on a Treasury of duration similar to the mortgage                        (but the

latter's expected duration itself depends on the slope of the yield curve)                           -




    Volatility         also has two offsetting effects on the value of the noncallable

bond.        Increased volatility of rates tends to increase expected capital gains

because of the convexity of the bond curve in Figure 1, which raises value, but

to the extent there is risk aversion, increased volatility lowers value.

    Let 'the'    market rate relevant to mortgage prices be a weighted average of

6 The correlation between residuals is
                                       generally close to, but less than,

unity.     A perfect positive correlation would mean that the unexplained part

followed a random walk, a property consistent with efficiency                   in the GNMA

market.    That the correlation is less than unity may be due to errors in

measuring volatility.


    Roth (1988)       presents regressions of changes in the commitment              rate on the

apread between the ten—year Treasury rate and the previous weeks commitment

rate.     The results are comparable.

    The rates in this table are not adjusted for points, i.e., they are the

coupon rates consistent with whatever points were chsrged.                    The adjustment

would not affect the differences                 between actual and perfect rates because the

adjustment to both rates would be identical.

g
    We had initially intended to use the full WUMM in order to take into account

numerous feedback effects.              For example, a stimulus to housing would raise

output, creating reinforcing multiplier                 and accelerator   effects.     On the other

hand, these would raise interest rates generally, offsetting some of the

stimulative effect on housing and causing a negative impact on nonhousing

capital.        We have not bothered to incorporate feedback effects because our

"disturbances"         are self reversing.

     The credit rationing variable is the PA variable used by Hendershott             (1980,

pp. 412—13)   .   Rationing wss    presumed to exist when the average quarterly       growth

rate in real adjusted deposits during the previous two quarters was less than

one—qusrter percent.         No evidence of rationing after 1978 could be found.


     Less severity in housing cycles would likely lower housing costs and prices

aNortgage banker issues are likely understated.            Thus originations and the mortgage

banker share are too low, and the share of originations securitized is too high.
