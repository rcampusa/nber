                                             ABSTRACT

In this paper we estimate the size of weekend effects for seven emotions and then explore their main
determinants for the working population in the United States, using the Gallup/Healthways US Daily
Poll 2008-2012. We first find that weekend effects exist for all emotions, and that these effects are
not explained by sample selection bias. Full-time workers have a larger weekend effects than do part-
time workers for all emotions except sadness, for which weekend effects are almost identical for all
workers. We then explore the sources of weekend effects and find that workplace trust and workplace
social relations, combined with differences in social time spent with family and friends, together almost
fully explain the weekend effects for happiness, laughter, enjoyment and sadness, for both full-time
and part-time workers, with significant but smaller proportions explained for the remaining three emotions
- worry, anger and stress.

1. Introduction
    Emotions, both positive and negative, are key measures of subjective well-being
(Durand and Smith, 2013; Helliwell and Wang, 2014; Kahneman and Krueger, 2006).
Recent empirical studies on emotions find evidence of variations through the week, often
called a day-of-week effect. Taylor (2006) finds that those who are interviewed on
Fridays report lower levels of mental stress than those interviewed in the middle of the
week, using the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS) data. Helliwell and Wang (2014)
find that people experience more positive emotions and fewer negative emotions during
weekends and statutory holidays than on weekdays in the Gallup/Heathways Daily Poll.
A few other studies also find similar weekend effects (Kennedy-Moore et al., 1992; Ryan
et al., 2010; Stone et al., 1985; Stone et al., 2012; Young and Lim, 2014). Although there
are significant weekend effects for all emotions, when assessed for a specific day, there
are no weekend effects for life evaluations (Helliwell & Wang 2014). This difference
helps to validate both emotional reports and life evaluations, since the former are
intended to reveal day-to-day changes, while the latter are intended to look beyond the
day-to-day variations in experiences to provide a broader measure of subjective well-
being.
    In this paper we focus more specifically on emotional weekend effects for the
working population. In this way we are able to assess more directly, for a comparable set
of respondents, the emotional effects of the social context, both on and off the job.
Consistent with the findings in Young and Lim (2014), we find that proportionate
weekend effects are larger for negative than for positive emotions: from weekends to
weekdays, the average levels of stress, anger, worry, and sadness decrease by 32.5%,
24.4%, 24.3%, and 9.6%, while the levels of enjoyment, happiness, and laughter increase
by 6.8%, 4.1%, and 3.3% respectively. However, this difference is largely due to the
greater general prevalence of positive emotions. When viewed as share of the respondent
population who feel any given emotion on weekdays and on the weekend, the outlier is
stress, which is felt by 15% more of the sample on weekdays than on weekends. None of
the other differences apply to more than 8% of respondents, and average about 4% of
respondents for both positive and the remaining negative emotions. We find that full-time

                                            1

workers have larger weekend effects than do part-time workers for all emotions, except
for sadness where the two effects are almost the same. The effects for full-time workers
are about twice as large as for part-time workers for happiness, enjoyment, anger, and
stress.
    We then show that weekend effects are not driven by selection bias. Some recent
studies argue that the day-of-week or weekend effects appearing in some datasets might
be due to possible selection bias in the choice of interview days (Taylor, 2006; Tumen
and Zeydanli, 2013). In other words, the subjective well-being responses might be
correlated with some observed or unobserved characteristics that affect individuals’
decisions to take interviews on specific days. Using the British Household Panel Survey,
Taylor (2006) deals with the selection bias and draws the conclusion that the day-of-week
pattern of job satisfaction is not substantially affected by the potential selection bias,
although the day-of-week pattern for mental well-being does become less significant after
adjusting for the likely bias. Tumen and Zeydanli (2013), using the same data, emphasize
the potential selection bias originating from unobservables, and suggest that the day-of-
week patterns may vary across countries. Seeing these possibilities, we also deal with the
selection issue in this paper. Since we are studying weekend effects rather than day-of-
week effects, we are mostly concerned about whether individuals’ answers depend on
whether they were interviewed on weekends or weekdays. Our tests show that selection
bias has no impact on the weekend effects we estimate.
    To establish the risk of selection bias we first compare the social-demographic
characteristics of weekend and weekday respondents. Some variables have statistically
equivalent means while the others have small differences that are rendered statistically
significant by the very large sample size. In these latter cases we check the standardized
differences of means, which are often used to test the sample balance in the Propensity
Score Matching method. We find that all the variables are quite balanced. We also
illustrate the distribution of propensity scores of being selected into weekends for
respondents who are actually interviewed on weekends and those who are interviewed on
weekdays. The two distributions are well matched.



                                            2

    Next we make a direct test for selection bias by exploiting the nice feature of our data
that people report yesterday’s emotions. The emotions for Sunday, Monday and Tuesday,
which are reported on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday respectively in the survey,
should not be affected by the weekend selection bias. The difference of emotions reported
for Sunday and Monday should therefore represent a non-biased weekend effect, while
the difference between the emotions reported for Tuesday and Monday should be very
close to zero. Our results show that the latter is zero or very close to zero, while the
former is much larger and always significantly greater than zero. This suggests that
weekend effect we observe is not primarily or even importantly driven by selection bias.
We further compare the weekend effect measured by the difference between emotions on
Sunday and Monday with the regular weekend effect based on all data and find that they
are very close to each other for every emotion. We know that the former is not subject to
selection bias, but the latter could be affected; the fact that they are very close to each
other shows that selection bias is approximately zero.
    Having established the validity of the weekend effect data, we then explore the
determinants of weekend effects. Stone et al. (2012) show that weekend effects for
emotions are smaller among older workers, particularly with respect to negative emotions.
Helliwell and Wang (2014) find that the weekend effect varies with gender, marriage
status, age, and working status. Young and Lim (2014) and Helliwell and Wang (2014)
both find that the variation of social time across days of week is an important determinant
of weekend effects. The quality of the social context at work has previously been shown
to influence both life evaluations and emotions (Helliwell and Huang, 2010; Helliwell
and Wang, 2014). We further confirm, as illustrated previously (Helliwell and Wang,
2014), that emotional reports (which refer to a particular day) will show weekend effects,
while life evaluations, which refer to life as a whole these days, do not show weekend
effects. Workers with better social contexts in their workplaces will show smaller
weekend effects. Our reasoning is that in a favorable workplace environment workers
tend to experience more positive emotions and fewer negative emotions than do other
workers, thus making weekend effects smaller for them than for workers in less happy
workplaces. In this paper, we examine the magnitude of the social context and social time

                                             3

!
influences in explaining weekend effects for each of the seven emotions.
    In our data we find that social time significantly increases on weekends and drops
during weekdays. Daily social hours on weekends and weekdays average 7.7 and 5.1
hours respectively for full-time workers, and 7.5 and 6 hours for part-time workers. We
find that workplace environment and social time together can almost fully explain the
weekend effects for happiness, laughter, enjoyment and sadness, for both full-time and
part-time workers, while the explained part of the weekend effects for worry, anger, and
stress ranges between 17.9% and 79.5%. We conclude that unfavorable workplace
environments and variations of social time are the major driving forces for the weekend
effects for the emotional well-being of the working population in the United States.
    The rest of paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we describe the data and
research methodology. In section 3, we report the estimates of weekend effect and show
that our results are not likely to be driven by the selectivity bias. In section 4 we explore
the determinants of weekend effects. Section 5 concludes.


2. Data and Methodology
    The data we use for this study come from the Gallup/Healthways US Daily Poll.
From the beginning of 2008, Gallup has randomly interviewed about 1,000 American
adults each day in the United States. By the end of 2012, the total number of respondents
accumulated in the data is 1.77 million. The Daily Poll includes a set of questions on
emotional well-being: for positive emotions we have happiness, enjoyment, and laughter,
and for negative emotions we have worry, sadness, anger, and stress. Laughter is a zero
to one scale response to the question “Did you smile or laugh a lot yesterday?” Other six
emotions are zero-to-one scale responses to the question “Did you experience the
following feelings during a lot of the day yesterday?” Emotion questions were asked on
every survey day, except for the stress question, which was not asked in 2011 and 2012.
    The survey includes the labor force status for each respondent, so that we can a
sample based on the working population. There are about 0.94 million working
respondents, accounting for 58% of all respondents. Among the working respondents,
nearly 80% are full-time paid workers.

                                             4

    The key explanatory variables are social hours and two measures of the quality of the
workplace social context. The social hours variable is a response to the question
“Approximately, how many hours did you spend, socially, with friends or family
yesterday? Please include telephone or e-mail or other online communication.” This
question was asked of all the respondents from 2008 to 2010, but in 2011 and 2012 only
10% and 5% of total respondents, randomly selected, were asked this question.
Respondents report numbers between 0 and 24. Among the answers, there are about 5%
of respondents reporting more than 16 social hours. To make this social hours variable
more reliable, we replace any value greater than 16 by 16. There are two questions on
workplace environment. One is “Does your supervisor always create an environment that
is trusting and open, or not?” The answer to this question is binary, 1 for “yes” and 0 for
“no”. 80% of respondents answer that the environment is trusting. Another question is
“Does your supervisor at work treat you more like he or she is your boss or your partner?”
The answer to this question is also binary, 1 for “partner” and 0 for “boss”. 62% report
having a “partner-like” boss.
    The survey also includes a number of socio-demographic variables, such as gender,
age, marital status, level of education, number of children under 18, monthly household
income, health insurance coverage and importance of religion. Monthly household
income refers to before-tax income from all sources, including wages and salaries,
remittances from family members living elsewhere, farming, and others. The response is
categorical, in which zero to ten stands for no income, under $60, $60 to $499, $500 to
$999, $1,000 to $1,999, $2,000 to $2,999, $3,000 to $3,999, $4,000 to $4,999, $5,000 to
$7,499, $7,500 to $9,999, and $10,000 and over, respectively. We construct the
numerical household income by replacing the categorical response by the mean of each
non-top category, and $18,000 for the top income category. There are about 0.78 million
working respondents reporting income. To reduce the impact of missing income on the
number of observations, we assign a zero value to log income when income is missing,
and a dummy variable which equals to 1 if the income is missing will be used together
with log income in regressions. The summary statistics for all the variables are reported
in Appendix Table A1.

      To show the size of weekend effects, we estimate the following model for each
emotion for full-time and part-time workers separately:
(1)    emotionit = α + β weekendit + X′it Γ + X′ct Ω + ε it ,
where i indexes individuals. The variable emotionit denotes one of the seven emotions.

weekendit is an indicator variable that equals to one if the emotions are for weekends or
statutory holidays. The vector X ′it denotes a set of individual- and household-level
covariates, which include respondent’s gender, age, age squared divided by 100, marital
status, education levels, household income, number of children, frequency of church
attendance, an indicator variable that equals to one if having health insurance, and a
dummy variable indicating the importance of religion in life. X′ct is a vector for state-

year fixed effects. ε it is the error term.

      To see how the weekend effect is varying with each respondent’s workplace
environment, we estimate the following model for full-time and part-time workers
respectively:
(2) emotionit = α + β weekend it + γ weekend it ∗ workit + θ workit + X′it Γ + X′ct Ω + ν it .

      The variable workit denotes the quality of the workplace environment. We have two

measures for workplace quality: one is a dummy variable that equals to one if
respondents report having a workplace is trustworthy and open, and the second is a
dummy variable that equals to one if respondents report having a supervisor who is more
like a partner than a boss. The two measures will first be included in the regression
individually and then together. ν it is the error term. This is a typical difference-in-

difference (DID) approach, where γ captures the difference in weekend effect by
workplace environment.
      Next we add the social time variables into Equation (2) to check how well weekend
effects are further explained by social hours. The equation is as follows:
(3) emotionit = α + β weekendit + γ weekendit ∗ workit + θ workit + S′it Ψ + X′it Γ + X′ctΩ + ν it ,

where S′it denotes a set of variables on social time, including log of social hours, a

dummy variable for zero social hour, and a dummy for zero to one social hour.

3. The Size of Weekend Effects for Positive and Negative Emotions
3.1. Descriptive results
Table 1 gives a detailed summary of the three positive emotions - happiness, enjoyment,
and laughter, and four negative emotions - worry, sadness, anger, and stress. In the table
we report the number of observations, estimated means and standard errors for each
emotion on weekends and weekdays, and weekend effects measured by the mean
difference of each emotion between weekends and weekdays, and the percentage of
change of emotion from weekdays to weekends. We can see that individuals generally
have higher levels of positive emotions and lower levels of negative emotions. Positive
emotions are higher on weekends than weekdays, with the reverse applying to negative
emotions. The weekend effect is statistically significant for each emotion. Moreover, the
effect is sizable, with absolute values ranging from 0.014 to 0.150, and the percentage
change ranging from 3.3% to 32.5%. The percentage improvements for negative
emotions from weekdays to weekends are generally larger than for positive emotions. For
example, the reductions in stress, worry, and anger are -32.5%, -24.3%, -24.4%
respectively, much larger than the improvement in enjoyment, 6.8%, the most improved
among the positive emotions. These differences primarily reflect the fact that the average
frequency is much less for negative than for positive emotions.


3.2. Regression results
In this section we show the estimates of weekend effects using Equation (1). We run OLS
regressions for each emotion, separately for full-time and part-time workers. For each
group, we run two models, one is the model only controlling for state-year fixed effects,
another including the state-year fixed effects and the full set of covariates described in
Equation (1): gender, age, age squared divided by 100, marital status, education levels,
household income, number of children, frequency of church attendance, an indicator
variable that equals to one if having health insurance, and a dummy variable indicating
the importance of religion in life. We report the coefficients of the weekend dummy in
Table 2. We find that the weekend coefficients for each emotion are almost the same in
the two models, which indicates that other covariates of weekend and weekday samples

                                            7

!
are well balanced, given the random sampling procedure. Moreover, the weekend effect
for full-time workers is larger than for part-time workers. For happiness, enjoyment,
anger and stress, the weekend effect for part-time workers is approximately half that for
full-time workers. The relative size is two-thirds for laughter, three-quarters for worry,
while almost equal for sadness.


3.3. Testing for selection effects
      As shown in Taylor (2006) and Tumen and Zeydanli (2013), the size of the day-of-
the-week effect may be affected by the potential bias of respondents’ self-selection into
specific days within a week. In this section we run a few tests to show that the impact of
selection bias in our data is fairly small, if not zero1.
      In Table 3 we test the balance of social-demographic variables for respondents being
surveyed on weekends and weekdays. Columns (1) and (2) report the mean of each
variable for respondents being surveyed on weekends and weekdays respectively.
Columns (3) and (4) show the mean difference between Weekends and Weekdays and the
corresponding standard error. We will find some small difference for some variables,
some of which are rendered statistically significant by the large sample size. In this case
we may check the standardized differences of means, which is a common way to check
sample balance in propensity score matching methods, following Lee (2013) and
Rosenbaum and Rubin (1985). Column (5) reports the standardized differences of means
calculated by the formula
                         !! !!!
(4)     ! ! !                          ,
                  !!! !"# !! !!"# !!

where !! and !! are the sample means for weekends and weekdays, and !"# !! and
!"# !! are the corresponding sample variances. We can see that the absolute value of
each standardized difference is smaller than 2.2. This is much smaller than the often-used
cutoff value 10. This confirms the similarity of the weekend and weekday samples.
      We also illustrate in Figure 1 the propensity scores for being selected for weekend
interviews. We use a probit model to estimate the propensity score. The variables used to
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

   We report the results only for paid workers, but the tests for full samples yield similar results.

                                                   8

estimate the propensity score of being selected into weekend include respondent’s gender,
age, age squared divided by 100, marital status, education levels, household income,
number of children, frequency of church attendance, an indicator variable that equals to
one if having health insurance, a dummy variable indicating the importance of religion in
life, and respondent’s full-time or part-time working status. The upper panel of Figure 1
shows the distribution of propensity scores for people who were actually interviewed on
weekends and weekdays, and the lower panel shows the distribution of propensity scores
for people who report emotions for weekends (who were interviewed on Sunday and
Monday) and weekdays (who were interviewed on Tuesday to Saturday). In both cases,
the distribution of propensity scores is quite similar for the two groups, which suggests
that each respondent has almost the same probability of being selected into weekends or
weekdays.
    The nice feature of the data is that people report yesterday’s emotions. Therefore the
emotions relating to Sunday, Monday and Tuesday which are reported on Monday,
Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, are not affected by possible selection bias.
Column (1) of Table 4 shows the difference in emotions between Sunday and Monday
and column (2) shows the difference in emotions between Tuesday and Monday. The
values in column (2) are all equal to or very close to zero, suggest that emotions are
stable across weekdays. The large differences between column (1) and column (2)
suggest that real weekend effects exist. Thus the weekend effect we observe is not driven
by selection effects. We then compare the weekend effect measured by the difference
between emotions on Sunday and Monday in column (1), with the regular weekend effect
based on all data in column (3). We know that the former is not subject to selection bias,
but the latter may be subject to certain level of selection bias. However, since the two
results are so similar, the bias must be negligibly small.


4. Exploring the Determinants of Weekend Effects
    In this section we explore the determinants of weekend effects. We first run OLS
regressions following Equation (2) to examine how weekend effects vary with workplace
social context, measured by reported workplace trust and type of supervisor (boss-like or

                                              9

!
partner-like). We further control social time variables following Equation (3). We report
the estimated weekend effect for happiness in Tables 5 and 6 for full-time and part-time
workers respectively. In each table, Models (1), (3) and (5) follows Equation (2) and
Models (2), (4) and (6) follows Equation (3). We control the dummy for non-trusting
workplace and its interaction with the weekend dummy in Models (1) and (2), the
dummy for boss-like supervisor and its interaction with the weekend dummy in Models
(3) and (4), and both workplace dummies and their interactions with the weekend dummy
in Models (5) and (6).
    From Model (1) in Table 5 we see that the weekend effect of happiness for full-time
workers in high-trust workplaces is 0.025, while for those reporting non-trusting
workplace environment it is 0.070, which equals to 0.025 plus the 0.045 coefficient on
the interaction term. This implies that the weekend effect is almost three times larger for
those working in a low-trust environment. Results in Model (3) using the alternative
workplace environment variable confirm the finding: full-time workers reporting boss-
like supervisor have weekend effects twice as do workers with partner-like supervisors. If
we include both indicators of workplace social context, as shown in Model (5), the
weekend effect of happiness for full-time workers reduces to 0.022, and that for
unfavorable environment (both indicators equal to 1) rises to 0.073. Workers with a boss-
like supervisor in a low trust workplace thus have weekend effects more than three times
as large as for those having a partner-like supervisor in a higher trust work environment.
    If we control also for the social time variable, the weekend effect for those full-time
workers reporting favorable workplace environment is reduced to zero, as shown in
Models (2) and (4), or even slightly negative (-0.003) as in Model (6). This suggests that
weekend effects for respondents with favorable workplace environments are only due to
the differing amounts of social time on weekends and weekdays. The weekend effect for
those reporting unfavorable workplace environments is now 0.041, 0.039, and 0.034 in
Models (2), (4) and (6) respectively, which is much smaller than the effect without
accounting for the difference in social time between weekends and weekdays.
    We observe similar patterns for part-time workers for the weekend effect of happiness
in Table 6. Without controlling for social time variable, the weekend effect for those

                                            10

!
reporting unfavorable workplace environments is always larger than for those reporting
favorable environments (by about 0.013). Moreover, accounting for social time
differences between weekends and weekdays reduces the weekend effect for those part-
time workers reporting favorable workplace environment to a level not significantly
different from zero.
    The results for happiness in Tables 5 and 6 are summarized in Panel A of Table 7, in
which we report weekend effects in different scenarios. To save space, we follow the
format of Panel A to report the results for the remaining positive emotions in Panels B
and C of Table 7, and for the four negative emotions in Panels A to D of Table 8.
    The weekend effect for enjoyment is reported in Panel B of Table 7. Without
controlling for the social time variable, the weekend effect for full-time workers is 0.042
and 0.140 for those reporting favorable environment and unfavorable workplace social
contexts. Holding social time constant, the two corresponding values reduce to 0.011 and
0.103. Thus controlling for social time reduces the weekend effect by about three-
quarters for those with good workplace environments, and by one-quarter for those with
socially unfavorable workplaces. If we compare the weekend effect for those who report
unfavorable workplace environments without accounting for social time, 0.140, with the
effect for those who report favorable environment after allowing for social time, 0.011,
the reduction is over 90%. The proportionate reduction is almost 90% (0.055 to 0.006)
for part-time workers. In Panel C of Table 7 we summarize the weekend effects for
laughter. We see that social time and the workplace social context together fully explain
the weekend effect.
    In the four panels of Table 8 we report the weekend effects for worry, sadness, anger,
and stress respectively. Compared to our previous results for positive emotions, the
explanatory power of workplace environment and social time is lower for all negative
emotions except sadness. Specifically, in the case of full-time workers, social time and
workplace environment together explain about half of the weekend effects for worry (-
0.110 to -0.056), 80% for anger (-0.088 to -0.018) and 40% for stress (-0.202 to -0.123).
For part-time workers the part of the weekend effect explained by the social context



                                            11

variables is one-third for worry (-0.079 to -0.051), 50% for anger (-0.026 to -0.013), and
20% for stress (-0.095 to -0.078).


5. Conclusion
    In this paper we estimate the size and sources of weekend effects for seven emotions
for the working population in the United States, using the Gallup/Healthways US Daily
Poll 2008-2012. We first find that weekend effects, measured as the difference in
fractions of the population reporting each emotion between weekends and weekdays, are
statistically and economically significant for all seven emotions. Moreover, full-time
workers have larger weekend effects than do part-time workers for all emotions except
for sadness, where the effects are similar for fulltime and part-time workers. We also
show that the weekend effects we find are not driven by selection bias.
    We then explore the sources of weekend effects and find that they are much smaller
for workers with good workplace social contexts, as indicated by high workplace trust
and a partner-like boss. Moreover, social time can largely or even entirely explain the
remaining weekend effects for positive emotions and sadness, for workers with favorable
workplace social contexts. The workplace social environment and social time together
almost completely account for the weekend effects for happiness, laugher, enjoyment and
sadness, for both full-time and part-time workers. The explanatory power is lower for the
remaining negative emotions. Taken together, the quality of the social contexts on and off
the job are the primary forces behind weekend effects in the subjective well-being of the
working population of the United States.

Notes: The first column shows the difference in emotions between Sunday (being surveyed on
Monday) and Monday (being surveyed on Tuesday). The second column shows the difference in
emotions between Tuesday (being surveyed on Wednesday) and Monday (being surveyed on
Tuesday). The third column shows the difference in emotions between weekends and weekdays.
The emotions on Sunday, Monday and Tuesday were reported on Monday, Tuesday, and
Wednesday respectively. If there is no real weekend effect, in other words, weekend effect is
solely driven by respondents’ self-selection (into weekends or weekdays), we should not observe
large difference between columns (2) and (3), because these effects are calculated from emotions
reported in weekdays. Moreover, since column (1) reports weekend effect under potential
selection bias (if any) while column (2) reports weekend effect without selection bias, the two
results are still very similar suggest that the section bias is minimal, if not zero. Standard errors in
parentheses are clustered at counties. +, *, **, and *** indicate significance at the 10, 5, 1, 0.1%
