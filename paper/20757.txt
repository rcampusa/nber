                                             ABSTRACT

An open question in the literature is whether families compensate or reinforce the impact of child health
shocks. Discussions usually focus on one dimension of child investment. This paper examines multiple
dimensions using household survey data on Chinese child twins whose average age is 11. We find
that, compared with a twin sibling who did not suffer from negative early health shocks at ages 0-3,
the other twin sibling who did suffer negative health shocks received RMB 305 more in terms of health
investments, but received RMB 182 less in terms of educational investments in the 12 months prior
to the survey. In terms of financial transfers over all dimensions of investment, the family acts as a
net equalizer in response to early health shocks for children. We estimate a human capital production
function and establish that, for this sample, early health shocks negatively affect child human capital,
including health, education, and socioemotional skills. Compensating investments in health as measured
by BMI reduce the adverse effects of health shocks by 50%, but exacerbate the adverse impact of shocks
on educational attainment by 30%.

1     Introduction
The importance of the family in fostering child human capital is well understood by

economists. How parents invest in children with different endowments is not well-

studied and there is no consensus in the literature. Becker and Tomes (1976) and

Tomes (1981) suggest that parental investments reinforce initial endowments, and that

such behavior increases inequality. Griliches (1979) conjectures that parental human

capital investments compensate for gaps in children’s endowments, and that the family

is an equalizing agent. A number of empirical studies find evidence for reinforcing

behaviors (Behrman, Rosenzweig, and Taubman, 1994; Rosenzweig and Zhang, 2009).

Other studies find empirical support for compensating behaviors (Behrman, Pollak,

and Taubman, 1982; Pitt, Rosenzweig, and Hassan, 1990).

    This paper contributes to this literature. It studies how early health shocks to

children affect intrahousehold resource allocation and the human capital formation of

children. For two reasons, early health shocks in developing countries are likely to nega-

tively affect children’s human capital accumulation and long-run outcomes (Strauss and

Thomas, 2007; Currie and Vogl, 2012). First, young children are especially vulnerable

to health insults in developing countries. For example, more than 10% of children suffer

from diarrhea in many developing countries such as Bangladesh (Strauss and Thomas,

1998). Second, in the absence of public health insurance and in the presence of per-

vasive poverty, a child affected by a health insult may not receive appropriate medical

treatment. Consequently, early health shocks may have long-lasting consequences. In

the absence of a well-functioning public education system, the consequences of an early

health shock may be exacerbated and thus impair human capital formation (Glewwe

and Miguel, 2007).

    This paper formulates and estimates a theoretical model with two channels through

which early health shocks affect child human capital formation. The first is a biological

channel operating directly through the production function for human capital. The

second is an intrahousehold resource allocation effect arising from parental responses

to the shock.

                                            1
   Parental responses to an early health shock on children may be more important in

developing countries with weaker health infrastructure and less well-established credit

markets and social protection systems. The absence of an old-age pension system and

the presence of tight credit constraint may drive parents to base their intrahousehold

resource allocation decisions on efficiency rather than on equity concerns. In this case,

parents are more likely to reinforce the harmful effects of an early health insult by

devoting less resources to the less-endowed child. The role of the family must be

considered when designing public policies to remedy the effects of inequality at birth

or the early childhood stage.

   Following recent developments in the economics of human capital (Cunha and Heck-

man, 2007; Heckman, 2007; Cunha, Heckman, and Schennach, 2010), our theoretical

analysis extends the conventional literature on intrahousehold resource allocation in

two ways. First, we allow for multidimensionality in human capital. The conventional

literature assumes a single dimension of human capital on which parents can com-

pensate or reinforce. Borghans, Duckworth, Heckman, and ter Weel (2008a), Cunha,

Heckman, and Schennach (2010), and Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz

(2011) extend the analysis of human capital from a single dimension to multiple di-

mensions and emphasize the cross-productivity of different types of human capital.

These studies focus on the human capital production process of individuals and do not

explore the implications of multidimensionality of human capital for the intrahousehold

resource allocation across children.

   Second, we examine the interaction of parental preferences and the human capital

production function in the intrahousehold resource allocation process. The conven-

tional literature focuses on parental preferences and has made special assumptions

about the role of human capital production in the intrahousehold resource allocation

process. For example, Becker and Tomes (1976) and Pitt, Rosenzweig, and Hassan

(1990) assume a linear production function with respect to child endowments, whereas

Behrman, Pollak, and Taubman (1982, 1986) assume a Cobb-Douglas technology. Un-

der both specifications, parental investment strategies are determined only by parental


                                           2
inequality aversion across children.

   Our paper combines the traditional literature on intrahousehold resource alloca-

tion with recent developments in the economics of human capital. We demonstrate

that parents can both reinforce and compensate human capital investment in differ-

ent dimensions of human capital in children. Whether parents exhibit a reinforcing,

compensating, or neutral investment strategy is ultimately an empirical question.

   We shed light on these mechanisms by estimating the effect of child early health

shocks on family investments. We use data from the Chinese Child Twins Survey

(CCTS), which contains detailed information on family health and educational invest-

ments for each child separately whose average age is 11. The sample is conducted in

a rural region exempt from the one child policy. To the best of our knowledge, CCTS

is the first census-type household survey on child twins around the world. We find

evidence of compensating investments in child health and reinforcing investments in

education in response to early health shocks for one twin child in the family. Our

empirical results show that, compared with the twin sibling who did not suffer from

negative early health shocks at ages 0-3, the other twin sibling who did received RMB

305 more health investments in the 12 months prior to the survey. This amount is

substantial and is more than one third of the average family investment in child ed-

ucation per year or about one half of maternal monthly wage. Offsetting this in a

different dimension, on average, the sick child received RMB 182 less on educational

investments than their twin siblings.

   We estimate the child human capital production function. Holding constant family

investments, the estimated coefficient on early health shocks in the production function

reflects only a biological effect. We separate the biological effect from the intrahouse-

hold resource allocation effect.

   Because family investments are chosen and unobservables in choice and outcome

equations are likely correlated, we correct for spurious correlation bias using 2SLS

with price and non-labor income as instruments. Our estimates show that family

investments have positive productivity effects and that early health insults negatively


                                           3
affect child outcomes, including health, education, and socioemotional skills.

   We also estimate a human capital production function excluding family invest-

ments. These reduced-form estimates correspond to the total effects of early health

shocks on child human capital. From them we can infer the importance of the in-

trahousehold resource allocation effect by comparing the reduced-form estimates with

the estimates from the structural production function. We find that reduced-form esti-

mates understate the biological effect by one-half for anthropometric measures, such as

body mass index (BMI), but overstate the biological effect by one-third for a number

of educational outcome measures.

   Our findings have important policy implications. When parents simultaneously

compensate in health investments and reinforce in educational investments across their

children, the effect of family investments on inequality in the society becomes more

nuanced. A multidimensional perspective on inequality is warranted. The overall level

of inequality is overestimated if one focuses solely on inequality in education because

inequality in health is reduced by family investments. Our estimates suggest that the

Chinese family appears to be a net equalizer in terms of child human capital investment

when both education and health are combined. Parental responses should be considered

when designing intervention policies to remedy the disadvantaged children because

parents can exacerbate or eliminate these effects by reallocating resources within the

family.

   Our results shed light on recent literature on the effect of early-life conditions on

late-life outcomes (Case, Fertig, and Paxson, 2005; Almond and Currie, 2011). Al-

though the literature has achieved a consensus on the negative effects of early-life

health insults on both short-run (Currie, Stabile, Manivong, and Roos, 2010) and

long-run outcomes (Smith, 2009), the role played by parental behavior remains un-

clear. The reduced-form estimates of the effect of early-life shocks that disregard in-

trahousehold responses do not necessarily represent a biological effect. When parents

make compensating and reinforcing investments along different dimensions of human

capital, the reduced-form estimates cannot be unambiguously interpreted as upper-


                                           4
       or lower-bounds of biological effects. Our empirical analysis suggests that reduced-

       form estimates of early health shocks on child health understate the biological effect,

       whereas those for child education overstate the biological effect. These results imply

       that caution must be taken in interpreting reduced-form estimates as biological ef-

       fects and confirms the importance of considering parental behavioral response when

       studying the consequences of early-life health insults.

           The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. We derive our theoretical model

       in Section 2. In Section 3, we describe the CCTS data used to test our theoretical

       prediction. Our econometric specification is presented in Section 4. We present the

       estimation results in Section 5 and conclude in Section 6.



       2     The Conceptual Framework
       This section analyzes child early health shocks, intrahousehold resource allocation, and

       child human capital formation. We show that an early health shock can affect child

       human capital through two channels: a direct channel (the biological effect through

       the production of human capital) and an indirect one (the intrahousehold resource

       allocation effect through parental responses). By introducing the multidimensionality

       of child human capital, we show that parents could compensate and reinforce along

       different dimensions of a child’s human capital with respect to an early health shock

       on one child.



       2.1     The Model

       We assume that each family has two children (ι = i, j).1 Each child has a two com-

       ponents of human capital: health (H) and a bundle of cognitive and socioemotional

       skills (C). We treat the latter as an aggregate in this section. Child prenatal endow-

       ment such as birth weight is ωιk ; parental human capital investments is Iιk , and child

   1
     It is natural to extend the model to a general case with n children in the family. However, fertility is a
parental choice. Twinning combined with the one-child policy serves as a natural experiment that fertility
is exogenous in our analysis, which is based on the CCTS.

                                                      5
       human capital is θιk , where k = H, C. We further denote a child’s characteristics such

       as gender and ethnicity by ξ, and parental characteristics by h. The human capital

       production function of type k for child i in family τ is specified as follows:


                                     k
                                    θi,τ = f k (ωi,τ
                                                 H      C
                                                     , ωi,τ    k
                                                            , Ii,τ , eH
                                                                      i,τ ; ξi,τ , hτ ),          (1)


       where eH
              i,τ is defined as a postnatal negative health shock affecting child i at early
                       k
                     ∂θi,τ
       stages, and   ∂eH
                             < 0. Child human capital is determined by the child’s endowments,
                       i,τ

       human capital investment, and health shocks. Parental and individual’s characteristics

       also affect the formation of child human capital. The production technology of health

       differs from that of cognitive skills. The production function is the same for all children

       in family τ , but may differ from one family to another.2

          In Equation (1), we assume that the health shock of child j does not directly enter

       child i’s human capital production function, although eH
                                                              j can indirectly affect child

       i’s human capital through parental investment. Thus, we assume away a contagious

       effect of early health shocks in the model, but we test this assumption in Appendix

       A.3 Second, we focus on health shocks; our data show that the most prevalent health

       shock is diarrhea.

          Parents are assumed to value child outcomes. They also care about their own

       consumption and leisure. Parental preferences are represented by utility function:


                                                 U = U (c, l, qi , qj ),                          (2)


       where c is parental consumption, l is parental leisure time, and qι is the quality of child ι.

       Denoting T as the parental labor supply and normalizing the parental time endowment

       to one, we have l + T = 1.4 Child quality is a combination of health and cognitive skills


   2
      We suppress the family subscript τ on the technology to simplify notation.
   3
      In Appendix A, we show that early health shocks measured in our empirical analysis are non-infectious
diarrhea.
    4
      Economists have stressed the importance of parental tutoring time as a determinant of child human
capital production. We ignore this argument in our analysis because the parental tutoring time in our sample
is small, and we find little effect of early health shocks on parental tutoring time.

                                                             6
       such that qι = q(θιH , θιC ). Both children have the same quality function. However, they

       may have different qualities because the endowments, early health shocks, and human

       capital investments could be different. The budget constraint is specified as follows:

                                                XX
                                         pI (               Iιk ) + c + wl = Y + w,                                   (3)
                                                 ι      k


       where pI is the price of human capital investment and is assumed to be independent

       of the type of investment; w and Y are parents’ wage rate multiplied by time available

       (assumed to equal 1) and non-labor income. The price of parental consumption is

       normalized to one. We further assume that parents provide all the resources for their

       children’s human capital.5



       2.2     Child Early Health Shock and Parental Responses

       We now analyze how parents adjust intrahousehold resource allocation in response

       to an early health shock on their children. The parents’ problem is to maximize the

       utility function (2) subject to the budget constraint (3) and production technology (1).

       If the utility function and production function are strictly concave and continuously

       twice-differentiable, then the existence, uniqueness, and continuity of the solution to

       the intrahousehold resource allocation problem directly follow. We denote the optimal

       human capital investment of type k in child i as a function of the following form:


                         Iik∗ = ψ k (ωiH , ωiC , ωjH , ωjC , eH    H
                                                              i , ej , ξi , ξj , h, pI , w, Y ).                      (4)


                                                                                         ∂Iik∗               ∂Iik∗
          A reinforcement strategy for investment of type k arises if                    ∂eH
                                                                                                 ≤ 0 and     ∂eH
                                                                                                                     ≥ 0,
                                                                                            i                   j

       i.e., parents put less investment of type k in the child who has suffered from an early

       health shock and place more investment in the child if his or her twin sibling has
                                 ∂Iik∗          ∂Iik∗                          ∂Iik∗               ∂Iik∗
       suffered. In this case,   ∂eH
                                          −     ∂eH
                                                        ≤ 0. In contrast, if   ∂eH
                                                                                       ≥ 0 and     ∂eH
                                                                                                           ≤ 0, we say
                                    i              j                              i                   j

       that parents use a compensatory strategy in investment of type k in children. Thus,

   5
    This assumption is approximately valid in the context of developing countries where public education
and medical insurance are absent, which is discussed in later sections.

                                                                 7

        −   ∂eH
                    ≥ 0.
   i           j

    The definition of reinforcing or compensating strategies does not presuppose any

specific model of intrahousehold resource allocation. The parameters determining

which type of strategy parents adopt depends on the specific model employed.

    For example, Behrman, Pollak, and Taubman (1982) assume a Cobb-Douglas pro-

duction function and a CES parental utility function. They show that the optimal

investment strategy is uniquely determined by parental preference parameters. Con-

versely, Almond and Currie (2011) assume a CES production function and a Cobb-

Douglas parental utility function. Thus, the optimal investment strategy is uniquely

determined by production technology parameters. We show that, in general, the opti-

mal investment strategy reflects a combination of parental preference and production

technology in the general case.

    In a more general model with multidimensional human capital, the child human

capital investment strategy reflects not only parental preferences but also the pro-

duction technology available to them. Parents can compensate and reinforce along

different dimensions of human capital with respect to early health shocks.

    Family investment can exacerbate inequality in one dimension but, at the same

time, ameliorate inequality in another dimension. Our analysis does not impose par-

ticular functional forms. Appendix B discusses the consequences of specific choices

further.



2.3         Early Health Shocks, Parental Responses, and Child

Human Capital

Early health shocks affect child human capital through two different channels: a bio-

logical effect and a behavioral effect. From Equation (1), the total effect of an early

health shock on child i on the child’s human capital k can be decomposed as follows:


                              dθik   ∂θik   ∂θik ∂Iik
                                   =      +     ·     .                             (5)
                              deH
                                i    ∂eH
                                       i    ∂Iik ∂eH
                                                   i
                              |{z} | {z } |{z} | {z }
                                  A    B       C    D


                                           8
The term on the left hand side (A) is the total effect of an early health shock, which

corresponds to the reduced-form estimate in the literature. The first term on the

right hand side (B) is a biological effect that directly operates through the production

function and is assumed to be negative. The second term (C · D) is a behavioral

effect that operates through parental responses in adjusting family investment. The

behavioral effect is the product of the productivity effect of the investment (C) and

the intrahousehold resource allocation effect (D). In general, the effect of an early

health shock is generally not the same as the biological effect. We assume that the

productivity effect of family investment is positive, an assumption tested below. The

sign of the behavioral effect is determined by the intrahousehold resource allocation

effect, which cannot be determined a priori, and can vary across different dimensions

of human capital.

   The reduced-form estimate (A) is interpreted as an upper- (lower-) bound of the

biological effect if we know that the parents adopt a reinforcing (compensatory) strat-

egy (which is characterized by the sign of D). We can separate the biological effect (B)

from the behavioral effect by estimating Equation (1) controlling for family investment.

By comparing the estimate of the biological effect (B) with the reduced-form estimate

of the total effect (A), we can quantify the importance of the behavioral response in

family investments to account for the total effect of early health shocks on child human

capital.



2.4        Early Health Shocks, Parental Labor Supply, and Con-

sumption

Early health shocks to children could result in external effects on other family members.

In this paper, we study the effect of early health shocks on parental labor supply and

consumption. The optimal parental labor supply (T ∗ ) and parental consumption (c∗ )

is a vector function of the following form:


                    y = y(ωiH , ωiC , ωjH , ωjC , eH    H
                                                   i , ej , ξi , ξj , h, pI , w, Y ),   (6)

                                                   9
where y = (T ∗ , c∗ ). Adopting specific function forms in the example presented in

Appendix B, we show that child early health shock decreases parental consumption

but increases parental labor supply.



3     Data

3.1     The Chinese Child Twins Survey (CCTS)

The Chinese Child Twins survey (CCTS) was conducted by the Urban Survey Unit

(USU) of the National Bureau of Statistics in late 2002 and early 2003 in Kunming,

China. Kunming, which is the capital city of Yunnan Province, has a total population

of approximately 5 million. Yunnan is a relatively under-developed province located

in the far southwestern corner of China.

    To the best of our knowledge, CCTS is the first census-type household survey on

twin children. The survey includes almost all households with twins aged between 6

years and 18 years living in Kunming in 2002. The average age of the twin children

is 11. The households have been initially identified by the USU on the basis of the

2000 population census according to whether the children have the same birth year

and month and whether they have the same relationship with the household head. The

addresses of these households are then obtained from the census office, and the presence

of twins is verified with a visit to the household. Starting from 2,300 pairs of potential

twins identified in the census, 1,694 households with twins are successfully interviewed.

The survey covers an extensive range of information about family investment in each

child separately and child outcomes, in addition to a wide range of demographic, social,

and economic information at the household level. See Rosenzweig and Zhang (2009)

for a detailed description of the CCTS.

       3.2     Descriptive Statistics

       We now describe the variables in our data that are the empirical counterparts of those

       in the theoretical analysis. Table 1 tabulates the descriptive statistics. Early health

       shocks (eH ) are defined by a dummy variable that indicates whether a child suffered

       from a serious disease from ages 0 to 3. The complete list of diseases include serious

       diarrhea, calcium deficiency, asthma, fracture, attention deficit disorder, heart disease,

       serious hearing difficulties, whooping cough, stammer, and serious eyesight problems.

       The first three constitute 92% of the serious diseases suffered by children, and such

       a number is consistent with the case for children in developing countries.6,7 Table

       1 shows that the prevalence rate of early health shocks in our sample is 9%. We

       address potential concerns with various types of measurement errors in constructing

       the variable of child early health shocks in Appendix C.

     Unfortunately, we cannot distinguish between mental and physical diseases because the former has low
prevalence in our sample.

          Our main dependent variables are measures of the family investments in children

       in the 12 months prior to the survey (I κ ). The investments are separately recorded

       for each child. Health investments include money spent on medical treatments and on

       the purchase of medicine or health products.8 Educational investments include school

       tuition and money spent on purchasing books and stationery, hiring home tutors, and

       attending tutoring class. We note that the medical and educational investments on

       children constitute a substantial fraction of the family income. Educational investments

       on one child alone amount to RMB 912 per year out of a per capita family income of

       RMB 3,030 per year.

           The CCTS covers rich information for measuring child human capital. As measures

       of child health θH , we use anthropometric indicators (i.e., height, weight, and BMI)
                         

       and general health status, which are all reported by both parents. We use child aca-

       demic and schooling performance to measure child educational outcomes. As measures

       of academic performance (components of θC ), we use both objective (exam transcripts)

       and subjective (self-reported evaluations in comparison with the class norm) measures

       in two different subjects: literature and mathematics. They are compulsory courses

       from primary school to high school (from age 6 to 18). We also analyze several outcomes

       related to school performance, which are recorded from transcripts. They include good

       student awards, awards in contests, grade repetition, and whether the child often does

       naughty actions in class as reported by teachers.

          Our data are also rich in terms of socioemotional measures, which are categorical

       and reported by both parents. We have four measures: always feels lonely, easily

       distracted, easily frightened, and emotionally unstable. These variables are derived

       from the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) used by CCTS. The SDQ is

       one of the most commonly used instruments for screening child psychiatric morbidities.

       See Du, Kou, and Coghill (2008) for the discussion on the reliability and validity on

       Asian children of SDQ.

          We also analyze the effect of early health shocks on parental labor supply (T )
   8
    Grossman (2000) also measures medical care by personal medical expenditures on doctors, dentists,
hospital care, prescribed and nonprescribed drugs, nonmedical practitioners, and medical appliances.

                                                 13
       and consumption (c). Parental labor supply is measured as days worked per month.

       Parental consumption is measured as the total expenditure on cigarettes, alcohol,

       clothes, and cosmetics in the past six months prior to the survey. The consumptions

       are separately recorded for mothers and fathers.

          Birth weights are used to proxy child pre-birth endowments (ω). This variable is

       used to measure both health and cognitive endowments. We have three variables for

       measuring child characteristics (ξ): age, gender, and birth order.9 The variables of

       maternal age, ethnicity, and schooling years are used to proxy parental characteristics

       (h).

          We use both the rural hukou and maternal working sector to proxy wages (w) and

       medical and educational prices (pI ). The rural indicator is commonly used to proxy

       for wages in studies in developing countries because of the large wage gap between

       rural and urban areas (Johnson, 1947; Rosenzweig, 1980). We also use hukou to proxy

       the price of health services. At the time of the survey, the medical insurance system

       was almost completely absent in rural areas, whereas medical expenditures on children

       could be partly reimbursed for urban residents. Although public education is not free

       in both urban and rural areas at the time of the survey, the quality of education in

       urban areas is higher than that in rural areas. Note that Chinese residents find it

       difficult to change their hukou.

          The maternal working sector is a good variable proxying for prices on health and

       educational investments. Child medical treatment and education are usually subsidized

       by the government if mothers are working in the public sector. Moreover, job turnover

       from public to private sectors is rare for Chinese women. We use household asset as a

       proxy for non-labor income (Y ). The household asset is a score generated by using the

       factor analysis (Kolenikov and Angeles, 2009). The durable goods used to generate the

       household asset scores include washing machine, refrigerator, air-conditioner, shower

       heater, water dispenser, sterilized cupboard, motorcycle, care, radio/recorder, color

   9
     The one-child policy is strictly implemented in urban areas in Kunming. However, households in rural
areas are encouraged to have one child, but are exempted from the strict one-child policy, although they are
allowed to have two children at most (Family Planning Commission of Yunnan Province, 2003).

                                                    14
television, video recorder, video displayer, hi-fi, camera, telephone, and mobile phone.

    Finally, column (5) of Table 1 shows substantial within-twin-pair variations in early

health shocks, family investments, and child outcomes. For example, the within-twin

standard deviations accounts for about 35% of the total sample standard deviations of

child early health shocks. This ratio is as high as 62% for child health investments.



4      Our Econometric Model and Its Identification
This section presents our econometric model and a discussion of how we identify it.

We first analyze how parents respond to early child health shocks. We linearize the

optimal human capital investment Equation (4) as a first-order approximation and

add a disturbance term (ki,τ ), which is assumed to reflect measurement errors in the

investment of type k specific to child i in family τ ; and assume that children are treated

symmetrically (so that statistically they are exchangeable):


     k
    Ii,τ = α1k eH      k H       k         k         k         k         k               k
                i,τ + α2 ej,τ + α3 ωi,τ + α4 ωj,τ + α5 ξi,τ + α6 ξj,τ + α7 ζτ + (µτ ) + i,τ .   (7)


The assumption of symmetry implies that the coefficients are the same across children.

We normalize the coefficient on parental preferences (µτ ) to be 1. ζτ is a vector of

variables including the price for human capital investment (pI ), wage rate (w), non-

labor income (Y ), and other observable parental characteristics, which is denoted as

κ. We denote µ as the unobserved parental characteristics or preferences. Thus,

h = (κ, µ). Both ζτ and µτ are shared by twin siblings. Unlike Equation (4), we

do not make the distinction between health and cognitive endowments because we

have only one variable—birth weight—to measure prenatal endowment in our data

set. Conditioning on the unobservable µτ , we further assume ki,τ to be i.i.d.

    The major problem in identifying the own effect (α1k ) and cross effect (α2k ) of an

early health shock on family investment is that the early health shock may reflect

unobserved parental preferences µτ . For example, on the one hand, parents who prefer

child human capital may be more likely to report that their children have suffered

                                                 15
       from early health shocks even if their children did not. On the other hand, these

       parents may spend more on human capital investments. In this case, the least squares

       estimates of Equation (7), ignoring unobserved parental characteristics or preferences,

       would be biased. If the cross-sibling effects are symmetric and equal, we can eliminate

       this source of bias by the following within-twin fixed-effects (FE) estimator:


                   ∆Iτk = (α1k − α2k )∆eH     k    k          k    k          k
                                        τ + (α3 − α4 )∆ωτ + (α5 − α6 )∆ξτ + ∆τ ,                 (8)


       where ∆ is an operator of within-twin difference. We test the symmetric regression

       assumption of cross-sibling effects below and find that it is not rejected in our data.

          We are interested in the estimates of α1k − α2k in Equation (8) which reflect parental

       investment strategy or the intrahousehold resource allocation effect of human capital

       investment of type k. If parents reinforce investment of type k in response to an early

       health shock on child i, then α1k − α2k < 0; compensation implies that α1k − α2k > 0. The

       self and cross effects reflect the interaction between parental preference and production

       technology. Our theory predicts that parents could make compensating and reinforcing

       investments along different dimensions of human capital in response to an early health

       shock. Therefore, the signs of α1H − α2H and α1C − α2C are not necessarily the same.

          Our basic identifying assumption is that the within-twin variation in the error term

       of Equation (8) is uncorrelated with the within-twin variation in early health shocks.

       This assumption may not necessarily hold. For example, the within-twin difference in

       individual specific prenatal endowment might not be fully controlled for by ∆ω, leading

       to a correlation between ∆e and ∆. If so, ∆e would be endogenous in Equation (8),

       and the OLS estimates of Equation (8) would be biased.10

          We measure early health shocks by serious diseases at ages 0-3 as discussed in the

       section above. Diseases can either reflect a random shock which is consistent with

       the definition of early health shocks in the model, or be an indication of an individual-

       specific health endowment. In other words, though early health shocks may or may not

  10
     A similar issue has been extensively investigated in the literature on twin-based estimation of returns
to schooling (Griliches, 1979; Bound and Solon, 1999; Neumark, 1999).

                                                    16
       be exogenous in Equation (7), what we need for identification is that the within-twin

       variation in early health shocks is random and exogenous in Equation (8).

          We propose and implement a test to examine the identifying assumption. We

       assume that the unobservables in health shocks are uniform across children with a

       family and that elimination of a family fixed effect eliminates any spurious correlation.

       A test of this assumption compares the OLS estimates of the coefficients of (7) for

       the sick and healthy child. The difference in the OLS estimates should accord with

       effects estimates of Equation (8). Thus, we test differences of estimates obtained from

       OLS versus estimates obtained from a fixed-effects procedure. If there are unobservable

       individual-specific prenatal endowments and eH
                                                    ι and  are correlated in Equation (7),

       the null hypothesis of symmetry and the equality in Equation (9) would not hold.12

       We test and do not reject this restriction in our empirical analysis reported below.

          We then analyze the effect of early health shocks on child human capital. By

  11
      We ignore other covariates in the equation to simplify our discussion. We further assume that no
contagious effect of early health shocks exists. The result below stands if the contagious effect is symmetric
between twin siblings.
   12
      The cross-equation restriction also applies if eH is measured with errors which are related to family
investment behavior. See the discussion in Appendix C.

                                                     17
linearizing the production function (1) as a first-order approximation and by adding a

disturbance term that reflects measurement errors (ui,τ ), which are individual-specific,

we specify the following regression equation:


               k
              θi,τ = β1k eH      k         k k       k         k
                          i,τ + β2 ωi,τ + β3 Ii,τ + β4 ξi,τ + β5 κτ + µτ + vi,τ ,   (10)


where κ denotes observable parental characteristics. The cross-sectional variation in

early health shocks may reflect the unobservable parental characteristics. For example,

better child-rearing practice may lead to less early health shocks and, at the same time,

more child human capital. To remove the possible bias induced by unobserved parental

characteristics, we use the following Fixed Effect (FE) specification:


                  ∆θτk = β1k ∆eH    k   k    k        k
                               τ + β2 ∆Iτ + β3 ∆ωτ + β4 ∆ξτ + ∆vτ ,                 (11)


where β1k captures the biological effects corresponding to the first term on the right-

hand side of Equation (5), which is expected to be negative; β2k measures the produc-

tivity effect of family investments, which is expected to be positive.

   Because family investment is a parental choice, we need to worry about simultane-

ous equations bias. We use a 2SLS method to estimate Equation (11). The theoretical

analysis guides us to choose the instrumental variable (IV). The price of investments

(pI ), wage rate (w), and non-labor income (Y ) in the family investment equation (4)

are excluded from the production function (1). However, these variables drop out from

the within-twin differences of Equation (11). We thus use pI , w, and Y interacted with

the within-twin variation in child prenatal endowment and characteristics (∆ω ∗ Y ,

∆ω ∗ pI , ∆ω ∗ h, ∆ξ ∗ Y , ∆ξ ∗ pI , and ∆ξ ∗ h) as IVs for within-twin variation in

investments (∆I k (k = H, C)) in Equation (11). Specifically, we use two types of in-

teraction terms as IVs for within-twin difference in health or educational investment.

The first type includes the interaction terms between the within-twin difference in birth

weight and the household and parental level variables, and the second type includes

the interaction terms between the within-twin difference in gender and the household


                                              18
and parental level variables. The household and parental level variables include a rural

indicator, maternal working sector, age, ethnicity, and schooling years.

    Administrative data usually do not have information on family investments in chil-

dren’s human capital. Thus, the recent literature on health economics does not estimate

health production functions. Instead, the literature specifies a reduced-form regression

equation that ignores the intrahousehold response such as:


                       ∆θτk = φk1 ∆eH    k        k
                                    τ + φ2 ∆ωτ + φ3 ∆ξτ + ∆uτ .                    (12)


The reduced-form estimate of φk1 captures the total effect of an early health shock on

child human capital, and corresponds to the left hand side of Equation (5). When

β2k 6= 0 and α1k − α2k 6= 0, β1k differs from φk1 . The total effect deviates from the

biological effect. To compare our results with those in the literature, we also perform

the reduced-form estimation in our empirical analysis. By comparing β1k with φk1 , we

can qualitatively infer the importance of the intrahousehold resource allocation effects

by using Equation (5).



5     Empirical Evidence

5.1     Child Early Health Shock and Family Investments

Before presenting the estimation results of the investment equation, we first examine

the determinants of early health shocks. The results are reported in Table 2. Column

(1) reports the OLS estimates. We find that low birth weight is positively correlated

with the probability of suffering early health shocks. We also observe that males are

more likely to suffer. Results also show a positive correlation between maternal school-

ing and the probability of reporting children suffering from early health shock. We

interpret this positive correlation as a reporting bias that is commonly found in the

literature on health economics (Strauss and Thomas, 1998). If the reporting bias is

determined by parental observed and unobserved characteristics, the issue of reporting


                                          19
bias can be addressed by the within-twin FE estimation because these parental charac-

teristics are removed by within-twin differences. The FE estimates in column (2) show

that the occurrence of an early health shock is unrelated to birth weight. In column

(3), we report regression of the within-twin difference in early health shocks on both

within-twin differences in birth weight and gender and other level covariates. We find

that the within-twin variations in early health shocks are uncorrelated with the level

variables. Therefore, the results in Table 2 do not reject our identifying assumption of

the randomness of within-twin variation in early health shocks.

Note: Columns (1) and (2) report the OLS and within-twin fixed-effects estimates, respec-
tively. In column (3), we regress the within-twin differences in early health shock on both
within-twin differences in birth weight and gender and other variables at the household level.
Standard errors are in brackets; * significant at 10%; ** significant at 5%; *** significant at

         We now turn to our main estimation results about child early health shocks and

     family investments in children. Column (1) in Table 3 reports the OLS estimates


                                              21
of Equation (7) with respect to health investments. We find that the own effect of

an early health shock on the health investment is significantly positive, whereas the

cross-sibling effect is almost zero. We also find that being a male, being born at

first parity, maternal schooling years, and household asset are positively correlated

with child health investments. By contrast, the variable of “born in rural areas” is

negatively correlated with child health investment.

   To test the symmetry assumption of cross-sibling effects, we use the same sample

as in column (1), but employ the family health investment in child j as a dependent

variable. The results are reported in column (2). We then conduct a Wald test. The

χ2 statistic is 18.87, and the p-value is 0.34. These findings indicate that we cannot

reject the symmetry assumption. Therefore, we conduct an FE estimation of Equation

(8) with respect to health investments. The results are reported in column (3). On

the basis of these estimates, we find that the gap in health expenditures on average

increases by RMB 305 (1.39 ∗ 225) in favor of the sick twin child, which amounts to

more than one third of the average family investment in child education per year.

   To test the null hypothesis that within-twin variations in early health shocks are

exogenous such that ∆e and ∆ are uncorrelated in Equation (8), we conduct a Wald

test on Equation (9). If any individual specific component is omitted from Equation

(8) such that ∆e and ∆ are correlated, within-twin variations in early health shocks

would be endogenous. Thus, the equality in Equation (9) would break down. We

report the test result at the end of column (3). The χ2 statistic is 0.14, and the p-value

is 0.71. Therefore, the null hypothesis is not rejected.

   Table 4 presents the estimates on child early health shock and family educational

investment. Column (1) reports the ordinary least square (OLS) estimates of Equation

(7) with respect to educational investments. In contrast to the estimates with health

investments (column (1) in Table 3), we find that the own effect of an early health

shock on educational investment is not statistically significant, although the estimate

is negative. In contrast, we find that the cross-sibling effect is positive. The other

covariates, namely, child age, maternal age, maternal schooling years, and household

asset are significantly positively correlated with child educational investments, whereas

the covariate “born in rural areas” is negatively correlated with child educational in-

vestment.

   The result of testing the symmetry assumption of cross-sibling effects is reported at

the end of column (2). The χ2 statistic is 19.39 with a p-value of 0.31. We cannot reject

the symmetry assumption. Therefore, we conduct the FE estimation of Equation (8)

with respect to educational investments. The results are reported in column (3). We

find that, in contrast to the estimates with health investment, the gap in educational

expenditures increases by RMB 182 (0.2*910), on average, in favor of the healthy child.

The χ2 statistic of testing the cross-equation restriction (Equation (9)) is 0.70, and the

p-value is 0.41. We cannot reject the null hypothesis that no endogenous within-twin

variation exists in early health shock.

   Summarizing Tables 3 and 4, our results indicate that parents adopt a compensating

strategy with respect to health investment and a reinforcing strategy with respect to

educational investment in response to an early health shock which affects one of the


                                           24
twin children.

   We also estimate the family investment equation by different subsamples based on

hukou status, maternal education, household wealth, and gender composition of twin

children. We find significant differences in the compensating and reinforcing patterns

across subsamples. First, the increase in health expenditures in favor of the sick twin

in rural areas is not accompanied by a corresponding decrease in educational expendi-

tures. In urban areas, instead, the fall in the amount of educational resources on the

sick child almost exactly offsets, in monetary terms, the amount redistributed to pay

for the medical expense. Second, both the compensating health investment and the

reinforcing education investment are more precisely determined when mothers have a

higher education level. Third, there is no significant difference in the compensating

health investment behavior between poor and rich households. In contrast, the rein-

forcing education investment behavior is more significant in rich households that that

in poor households. Finally, we find significant differences by gender. The compen-

sating health investment and the reinforcing education investment are more significant

in the female twin than male twin samples. The results are reported and discussed in

Appendix D.

   Our results have important implications. First, the results are consistent with our

two major observations in the theoretical analysis on the intrahousehold resource al-

location. The reinforcement or compensatory child human capital investment strategy

reflects not only parental preference but also production technology. Furthermore, par-

ents can compensate and reinforce along different dimensions of human capital with

respect to an early health shock on one child, which helps us reconcile the seemingly

conflict findings in the literature.

   Second, the results deepen our understanding of the role of family investment in

the overall level of inequality in a society. Our estimates indicate that intrahouse-

hold resource reallocation in child investment is not trivial. The gap in educational

investment between sick and healthy children accounts for up to one-fifth of the aver-

age educational investment per person. The gap in health investment is even larger.

Therefore, the family plays an important role in accounting for the difference in invest-

ment in children. However, the role of family in this case is complicated. On the one

hand, parents increase the gap in educational investment by allocating more resources

to the child suffering from early health shock. In this regard, the family increases the

overall level of inequality in the economy. On the other hand, parents decrease the gap

in health investment by allocating more resource on the sick child. Thus, in terms of

health investment, family decreases inequality. If we focus on educational investment,

then the role of family as an inequality mitigator may be understated.

   Finally, our empirical results clarify the interpretation of the recent reduced-form

estimates on early-life conditions and late-life outcomes. When parents make com-

pensating and reinforcing investments along different dimensions of human capital,

these reduced-form estimates cannot be unambiguously interpreted as upper- or lower-

bounds of the biological effects. Our estimates on intrahousehold resource allocation

suggest that the reduced-form estimates underestimate the biological effect of an early

health shock on health, but overestimate the biological effect on education. To empir-

ically verify this prediction, we estimate the child human capital production function

below.

       5.2     Early Health Shocks and Child Human Capital

       5.2.1    Child Health

       We next examine the effects of early health shock on child human capital by estimating

       the production function (11). Health investment is an endogenous variable in the child

       human capital equation. As discussed above, we use a 2SLS estimator. Guided by our

       theoretical model, we use ∆ω ∗ Y , ∆ω ∗ pI , ∆ω ∗ h, ∆ξ ∗ Y , ∆ξ ∗ pI , and ∆ξ ∗ h as the

       IVs for ∆I k (k = H, C) in Equation (11). Specifically, the IVs include the interaction

       terms between the within-twin variations in birth weights and gender and the level

       variables, which include a rural indicator, maternal working sector, age, ethnicity, and

       schooling. The results in Table 2 show that these level variables are uncorrelated with

       the within-twin variation in early health shocks.

          The first panel in Table 5 reports the 2SLS estimates of the child health produc-

       tion function.13 Conditional on the health investment, the estimate of early health

       shock captures the biological effect. We find a long-lasting negative biological effect of

       early health shocks on the child’s later health status. The estimates are statistically

       significant at a high level of 1% for three out of four measures. We also find that the

       productivity effects of the health investment are consistently positive. The estimates

       are statistically significant at the 5% level for current weight and BMI.

          To compare our results with those from the recent literature in health economics

       and to qualitatively gauge the importance of intrahousehold resource allocation effect,

       we also estimate the reduced-form of Equation (12). Table 3 shows that parents take

       a compensatory investment strategy in health investments, and the intrahousehold

       resource allocation effect is positive. The first panel of Table 5 shows a significantly

       positive productivity effect of health investment. By using the formula of Equation

       (5), we expect that the reduced-form estimates understate the biological effect of early

       health shock on later health status.

          This prediction is confirmed by the reduced-form estimates, which are reported in

  13
    We report only the estimated coefficients on early health shock and health investment in the paper.
The full results are reported in Appendix E.

      the second panel of Table 5. The reduced-form estimates are also consistently negative,

      indicating that the direct biological effects, which are negative, outweigh the positive

      intrahousehold resource allocation effects. We find that the reduced-form estimates

      substantially underestimate the biological effects. Take the dependent variable of BMI

      as an example (column (3)), the reduced-form estimate (-0.20) accounts for one half of

      the biological effect (-0.40). Almost the same proportion of the negative biological effect

      (-0.42) is accounted for by the reduced-form estimate (-0.26) with respect to weight

      (column (2)). The results have important implications, suggesting that although the

      negative effect of an early health shock may persist throughout the life-cycle of children,

      remediation is possible. In other words, the negative effects can be partly offset by

5.2.2   Child Education and Socioemotional Skills

We next examine the effects of an early health shock on child education by estimating

the child education production function (11). The same set of variables are used as

IVs for educational investment as discussed above. Panel 1 in Table 6 reports the

2SLS estimates of early health shocks on child educational achievements, both per-

ceived and actual. We find that the twin child affected by an early health insult has

poorer academic achievement compared with the healthy child. The productivity ef-

fects of educational investments on academic achievements are consistently positive

across the four measures, but are generally imprecisely estimated. We also conduct

the 2SLS estimation of early health shocks on child schooling performance. The re-

sults are reported in the third panel of the table, which shows that an early health

insult negatively affects the child’s schooling performance. We further observe that

educational investments exert a positive productivity effect on the child’s schooling

performance.

   The reduced-form estimates are reported in Panels 2 and 4. We find that the

reduced-form estimates are consistently larger than the 2SLS estimates in terms of

absolute values. The result suggests that the reduced-form estimates overstate the

negative biological effect of early health shocks on child education. By comparing the

2SLS estimates with the reduced-form estimates, we find that the biological effects con-

stitute a major part of the total effect for most measures of child educational outcomes.

The result suggests a strong cross-productivity effect of health shocks on education,

as reported in Cunha, Heckman, and Schennach (2010). The intrahousehold resource

allocation effect has also played an important role. Take the transcript recorded score

of literature as an example (column (1)), the intrahousehold resource allocation effect

accounts for about one-third of the total negative effect of an early health shock.

          With regard to the effect of early health shocks on child socioemotional skills, Panel

       1 in Table 7 reports the 2SLS estimates. The importance of these skills in determin-

       ing an individual’s income and other well-beings has been increasingly recognized by

       economists (Borghans, Duckworth, Heckman, and ter Weel, 2008b). We find that the

       twin child who suffered from early health shock at ages 0-3 has inferior personality

       traits. When we use the SWQ to measure the child’s socioemotional skills, the esti-

       mates show that children who experienced early health shock are more likely to feel

       lonely, be easily distracted, easily frightened, and be emotionally unstable. Although

       the estimates of productivity effects of educational investment are consistently nega-

       tive, the estimates are only statistically significant in column (3) with the measure of

       being easily frightened. The results suggest that educational investment may not be an

       important determinant of the development of socioemotional skills.14 Panel 2 reports

       the reduced-form estimates. By comparing the reduced-form estimates with the 2SLS

       estimates, we find that biological effects constitute a major part of the total effects

       except for the measure of being easily frightened (column (3)).

    Cunha, Heckman, and Schennach (2010) also use the education investment as the augment in the
production function of socioemotional skills.

      5.3      Child Early Health Shock and Parental Labor Supply

      and Consumptions

      Finally, we investigate how an early health shock on one child affects parental labor

      supply and consumption. We specify the following regression equation:


                                  yτ = ϕ1 d + ϕ2 ω τ + ϕ3 ξτ + ζτ ϕ4 + υτ ,                        (13)


      where yτ measures parental labor supply or consumption in household τ ; d is a dummy

      variable indicating whether the household has only one twin child who suffered from

      early health shock; ω is the average birth weight of the twin children. Equation (13) is



                                                      33
a linear approximation of the optimal parental labor supply or consumption function

(6) with slight modifications. First, we estimate Equation (13) for mothers and fathers

separately. We use the mean of birth weights to measure child prenatal endowments.

Child characteristics are the same between twin siblings except for gender. We then

use two dummy variables to measure children gender composition. The first variable

indicates that both children are boys, and the other variable indicates that both are

girls. Second, given that within-twin variation in early health shock is uncorrelated

with the unobservable characteristics, which is tested above (Table 2), we add d in

the regression equation. Thus, ϕ1 renders us a causal interpretation even if we ignore

the unobservable parental characteristics when estimating Equation (13). Finally, the

added disturbance term υτ reflects measurement errors.

   The estimation results are reported in Table 8. We find that in households with

only one twin child who suffered from early health shock, the father is significantly less

likely to spend money on goods for himself, and the mother is significantly more likely

to work. Therefore, if we take other family members except the twin children into

account, then our results imply that the within-twin FE estimates of child outcomes

understate the overall negative effect of an early health shock in a family.

      6      Conclusions
      This paper studies how child early health shocks affect intrahousehold resource alloca-

      tion and child human capital formation. We formulate a theoretical model that early

      health shocks can affect human capital through two channels: a direct channel—the

      biological effect through the production of human capital—and an indirect one—the

      intrahousehold resource allocation effect through parental responses. By introducing


                                                    35
multidimensionality of human capital, parents could compensate and reinforce along

different dimensions with respect to early health shocks on children. By using the

CCTS data, we find evidence of compensating investment in child health but of reinforc-

ing investment in education. We further estimate the child human capital production

function. The results confirm that early health insults negatively affect child human

capital, ranging from health and education to socioemotional skills. Reduced-form esti-

mates, which ignore intrahousehold allocation process, understate the biological effect

for health, but overstate the biological effect for some educational outcomes.

   Our results have important implications for evaluating the role of the family in

the overall inequality in the economy. When parents can simultaneously reinforce and

compensate family investments on children along different dimensions of human capital,

the effects of intrahousehold resource allocation on inequality become complicated. On

the basis of our estimates, we conclude that the family appears to be a net equalizer

in terms of family investment in financial terms. Our findings also emphasize the

importance of accounting for parental behavioral responses to early health shocks.

Intrahousehold responses should be considered when designing public interventions to

remediate negative health shocks on children, because parents can partly offset the

effect of public interventions by reallocating resources within the family.

   Future research on the intrahousehold resource allocation and human capital for-

mation is desirable. First, with recent progress on human capital production tech-

nology, estimating a structural model separating production technology from parental

preference would be valuable. This approach is difficult because any structural pa-

rameter of production technology can be re-parameterized as parental preference and

vice-versa. We would need exogenous variations in either parental preference or pro-

duction technology to solve the identification problem. Second, consistent with the

empirical literature based on sibling or twin data, our regression analyses use linear

specifications. Relaxing the linearity specification in the estimation would be fruitful.

However, this approach relies on the development of the econometrics of non-linear

fixed-effects estimators. Finally, fertility decisions should be explicitly introduced in


                                           36
the next generation of models of intrahousehold resource allocation.
