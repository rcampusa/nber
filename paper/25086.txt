                                         ABSTRACT

Analyzing account-level data from an account aggregator, we find that households increase
consumption when they receive (expected) tax refunds, as if they face liquidity constraints.
However, these same households smooth consumption when making payments in other years,
primarily by transferring funds among liquid accounts. Even households carrying credit card debt
smooth consumption when making payments, and even highly-liquid households spend out of
refunds. This behavior is inconsistent with pure liquidity constraints or hand-to-mouth behavior
and most consistent with a mental accounting life-cycle model.

1         Introduction
        A central feature of consumer behavior is that many consumers delay spending out of
expected income until it arrives. The leading theoretical explanation—exemplified by the
buffer stock model—is that some people are financially constrained and so delay consumption
until income arrives. Another leading model assumes that some households are hand-to-
mouth consumers, spending income as it arrives. These theories of the consumer are central
components of modern New Keynesian macroeconomics.
        Our study presents a novel and robust consumption pattern that fits neither prototype
models. We use high-frequency account-level data to document that when faced with antici-
pated income, households—across the liquidity spectrum—increase consumption on the date
of cash flow arrival. In contrast, when faced with anticipated payments, the same house-
holds keep their consumption level intact and use liquid reserves or credit to fund payments.
Among the models that we review, this asymmetric consumption pattern is best explained
by a model of mental accounting that would lead to different economic dynamics and policy
prescriptions from leading macroeconomic models.
        Specifically, we study the consumption responses of households as they file their U.S.
federal income tax returns, receive refunds, and make payments in different years.1 House-
holds in our select sample—and so to some extent in the population—exhibit an asymmetry
in consumption behavior when it comes to negative and positive cash flows. When faced
with tax payment, households do not cut consumption but instead make account transfers
in advance of payments. Even low-liquidity households in our sample maintain stable con-
sumption. Yet, these same households, in other years, increase consumption in response to
the arrival of expected tax refunds. Even the most liquid household-years do so, albeit at
lower rates. The latter observation has been interpreted as evidence of liquidity constraints.2
Thus, households in our sample shield consumption from decreases in income when making
transitory payments but at the same time follow a heuristic to consume out of transitory
    1
     In using variation in tax refunds, we follow Souleles (1999), who studies the consumption response to
the arrival of tax refunds, as well as the contemporaneous work of Farrell, Greig, and Hamoudi (2019).

increases in income.
       Our sample and data come from a large administrative account-level dataset from an
account aggregator that contains every transaction into or out of linked checking, savings,
and credit card accounts at a daily frequency from 2011 through 2015.3 For a subset of
more than 300, 000 household-years, we can observe a reasonably complete financial picture
of the households, and identify the date of tax filing and the date and amount of tax refund
or payment in the current and previous year. We focus on a subsample of households that
receive tax refunds in some years and make payments in other years so that our results are
not driven by differences in the types of households that receive refunds or make payments.
       While our administrative data have many advantages, they come with two caveats. First,
administrative data track transactions, not consumption. Consequently, we measure only a
subset of consumption spending that we can clearly identify as spending on consumer goods
and services (retail, restaurants, etc.). The second caveat is that our sample is not a random
sample of the U.S. population, both because households have to select into the account
aggregation service and because they have to file taxes in a way that creates an observable
transaction in the data. In particular, our sample omits households that postpone payment
by filing an extension and those that take up refund anticipation loans instead of receiving
refunds (issues we discuss in detail in Sections 2 and 7). Thus our sample is likely to be more
liquid than the typical American household, and indeed our measures of liquidity confirm this
conjecture. Further, our select sample may also be more financially sophisticated. However,
this sample has some advantages for our analysis. From an a priori standpoint, our finding
of excess sensitivity of consumption to predictable refunds is less likely to be due to liquidity
constraints than it would be in the population.
       We measure the consumption response to expected income changes by regressing con-
sumption spending on distributed leads and lags of refunds and tax payments, and dis-
tributed leads and lags of an indicator of tax filing interacted with news about tax status
learned during return preparation. The leads and lags of filing and news serve two purposes.
First, and particularly important for payments because they sometimes occur contempora-
   3
    We build on research on consumption using high-frequency data (e.g., Stephens, 2003, 2006; Broda and
Parker, 2014) and account-level data (e.g., Agarwal and Qian, 2014; Gelman, Kariv, Shapiro, Silverman, and
Tadelis, 2014; Baker, 2018; Olafsson and Pagel, 2018; Aydin, 2019; Olafsson and Pagel, 2019).

Figure 1. Consumption and Fund Transfers Around Tax Payment or Refund
The figure presents consumption and fund transfers around tax payment and refund dates, as functions of
payment or refund amounts. Panel A shows the abnormal consumption in the month prior to the tax refund
or payment dates. Panel B shows the abnormal consumption in the month of the tax refund or payment
dates. Panel C shows the abnormal fund transfers into the observed accounts in the month prior to the tax
refund or payment date. Panel D shows the abnormal transfers out in the month following the tax refund or
payment date. The markers show averages at every 5% of the data for those who received refunds, and every
10% of the data for those who made payments. The shaded region represents two standard errors confidence
intervals.

neously with filing, they control for the impact of information arrival so that we can cleanly
measure the effect of an anticipated tax payment or refund arrival. Second, they measure the
convolution of the impulse response of spending to information about taxes and the average
pattern of its arrival relative to the date of filing.
               Our main findings are conveyed by Figure 1, which plots average consumption spending
and fund transfers after de-meaning by both household-year and calendar day for different
payment and refund amounts and in the month before and in the month after the refund or
payment date.
               First, we observe a striking asymmetry between the consumption response to refunds and

                                                                        3
the response to payments (Figure 1, panel B). Consistent with a large literature, households
spend a significant part of their tax refund on consumption (including on nondurable con-
sumption, such as restaurants) in the month following receipt. In contrast, in years when
they make tax payments, these same households do not reduce consumption spending fol-
lowing making the payment. This result is novel, in part because few papers have studied
the consumption response to decreases in income.4
       According to our regression estimates, people spend over 7% of their refunds on con-
sumption during the month following refund receipt, an amount that increases slowly to
15% over several months. These responses underestimate the true increase in consumption
(by roughly a factor of 2) because we cannot definitively classify some account transactions.
This spending increase starts the day of refund arrival, and there is no increase in spending
related to the timing of the refund arrival prior to the day of arrival. In contrast, the con-
sumption response to payments is economically and statistically insignificant, and unrelated
to the precise day of payment.
       Second, panel A of Figure 1 shows that households do not adjust consumption down in
the month prior to making a payment or up in the month before getting a refund. We also
find no response in our regression analysis as well as no change in consumption in response
to the information about future cash flows that arrives as tax returns are prepared and filed.
       Third, households actively manage liquidity to smooth consumption ahead of payments
but not refunds (Figure 1, panels C and D). In years when households receive refunds, they
make transfers only after receipt. In contrast, households smooth consumption through tax
payments by increasing transfers among accounts in the month before making the payment
by about a third of their anticipated payment. These transfers are mostly among observed
   4
     Notably, Gelman, Kariv, Shapiro, Silverman, and Tadelis (2020) studies transitory unexpected declines
in income and conclude that “even workers with surprisingly low liquid assets can smooth consumption using
low-cost methods to shift the timing of payments for committed forms of expenditure.” In contrast, both
Christelis, Georgarakos, Jappelli, Pistaferri, and van Rooij (2019) and Fuster, Kaplan, and Zafar (2018) find
that people respond in surveys that they would cut consumption more in response to transitory negative
than positive income shocks. The few other studies of consumption responses to decreases in income have
almost exclusively focused on permanent or highly persistent decreases. Shea (1995b), Stephens (2001),
Ganong and Noel (2019), and Jorring (2018) find substantial declines in spending in the event of wage cuts
in union contracts, and permanent worker displacement, when unemployment benefits expire, and when
mortgage payments rise. Conversely, Souleles (2000) and Aguiar and Hurst (2005) find that consumption is
well smoothed when college expenses start and when people retire, respectively.



                                                     4
checking and savings accounts rather than from outside (likely nontransaction) accounts. We
also find that households increase transfers in response to the news learned about upcoming
payments or refunds prior to and at filing. Finally, households in our sample have substantial
liquidity on average and they manage liquidity over longer horizons: in years when they make
payments, households have accumulated somewhat higher balances in their core accounts.
       We provide evidence that these findings are not driven by either the endogeneity of the
timing of the filing of tax returns (results hold separately for households filing in each month)
or heterogeneity across households. While payment and refund status are also endogenous,
determined in part by past income not subject to withholding, Gelman, Kariv, Shapiro,
and Silverman (2019) provides evidence that this endogeneity does not cause consumption
asymmetry. As we discuss in Sections 5 and 7, that analysis finds no sharp difference between
the propensity to spend in response to refunds versus payments in a quantitative life-cycle
model.
       We show that this consumption asymmetry occurs throughout the distribution of liq-
uidity, which is further evidence that spending response to refunds for these households is
an unconstrained choice. Households in the bottom tercile of the ex-ante distribution of
liquidity have large propensities to consume out of refunds.5 But in this same sample of
households with low liquidity, households do not cut consumption prior to or when making
payments, inconsistent with financial constraints driving the response to refunds.
       We also find that for household-years in the top tercile of the distribution of liquidity,
households do not cut consumption when making payments. But they still increase spend-
ing when refunds arrive, albeit at a lower rate than low-liquidity households. This spending
behavior among liquid household-years is consistent with a growing body of evidence that
even highly liquid households have substantial spending responses to predictable increases
in liquidity (Parker, 1999; Kueng, 2018; McDowall, 2019).6 These findings imply that a
propensity to consume out of predictable increases in income that decreases with liquidity is
   5
     This finding is consistent with the literature comparing consumption responses of households with differ-
ent levels of liquidity starting with Zeldes (1989), followed by a large literature including Jappelli, Pischke,
and Souleles (1998), Agarwal, Liu, and Souleles (2007), Aaronson, Agarwal, and French (2012), and Kaplan,
Violante, and Weidner (2014).

     And with papers that find that the propensity to consume is persistent rather than purely driven by
liquidity (See Parker, 2017; Aguiar, Bils, and Boar, 2020).



                                                       5
not necessarily indicative of liquidity constraints. For many households in the population,
liquidity constraints very likely determine behavior. However, in our nonrepresentative sam-
ple, households can smooth consumption but choose not to. Hence, the well-documented
excess sensitivity of consumption to increases in expected income in the population is not
purely driven by constraints.
   We discuss these findings in light of the theories that are commonly used to explain
household behavior. Among the theories, the models most consistent with our results are
models of mental accounting (Thaler, 1999). Our empirical evidence matches the predictions
of the behavioral life-cycle model of Shefrin and Thaler (1988), in which households maintain
three mental accounts: current income, current assets, and future income. Specifically, an
anticipated tax refund is considered future income (which a rule of thumb prevents house-
holds from consuming). When the refund is received, it has a similar status as a “bonus from
work,” part of which is consumed upon arrival and part saved. Payments, on the other hand,
are viewed as unrelated to the income–consumption process and therefore are funded from
less liquid savings accounts and do not impact the consumption process. In general, because
models of mental accounting are based on observations of behavior, their predictions are
generally limited, which has led to limited empirical testing. Shefrin and Thaler (1988) also
propose that households divert funds out of their sight to savings accounts (as opposed to
transaction accounts) as a mental commitment device. Under the assumption that savings
accounts can provide commitment, the hyperbolic discounting model of Angeletos, Laibson,
Repetto, Tobacman, and Weinberg (2001) also fits most, but not all of the behavior we find
in our sample and also provides more testable predictions.
   In sum, households in our sample consume more when their refunds arrive as if many
are liquidity constrained. But they appear, in fact, to be choosing not to draw on existing
liquid savings, as if they are what Olafsson and Pagel (2018) refers to as the ‘liquid hand-to-
mouth.’ But inconsistent with a simple hand-to-mouth heuristic, these same households do
not reduce consumption when making payments. These consumers instead follow a different
heuristic, accessing liquid savings for making payments but not for smoothing consumption
prior to refund arrival. Rather, they consume or even impulsively splurge when refunds
arrive (as in Agarwal, Chomsisengphet, Meier, and Zou, 2019; Ben-David and Bos, 2020).

2     U.S. Individual Income Tax Returns
    This section describes the U.S. tax system and how it generates cash flows with two key
features. First, the income tax system causes both expected inflows and outflows of funds,
allowing us to measure the effect of the sign of the cash flow rather than the effect of the
source of the change in liquidity. Second, we can identify news about future cash flows and
the timing and amount of cash flows using the structure of the U.S. individual income tax
system. We can, therefore, separate the effect of the arrival of news about future after-tax
income from the arrival of the change in income.
    The U.S. individual income tax covers all sources of household income in each calendar
year. For most labor income, employers withhold income taxes from workers’ pay during
the calendar year, typically following Internal Revenue Service (IRS) guidelines based on
pay and family structure. The employer remits these funds to the IRS during the year.7 By
the end of January of the following year, people receive information on the previous year’s
income and tax withholding from their employers, banks, and investment firms. They then
fill out tax return forms—some variant of the IRS 1040 tax form and additional schedules—to
calculate their total taxes owed and submit (file) their returns by the April 15th deadline.8
    If the withholding (and estimated taxes paid) exceed taxes due, the household receives a
refund of the difference, typically a few weeks after filing.9 If the taxes due exceed the amount
previously paid, then the household must remit payment by the April deadline. However,
any household can also file for an extension that pushes the deadline back to October 15 but
also leads to possible interest and penalty charges. If the household has paid at least 90% of
its total taxes by the April 15 deadline, then the unpaid balance accrues interest at roughly
3.5% during the years in our sample. If the household has not paid at least 90% of taxes by
April 15, then it must pay an additional penalty of 0.5% per month, for an annual rate close
   7
     No corresponding system exists for most capital income. Instead, as interest and dividends are earned
and as capital gains are realized, taxpayers accrue liabilities without withholding, which leads many higher-
wealth taxpayers to make additional estimated tax payments during the year.

     People with low incomes or no taxes due do not have to file. Married individuals can file taxes jointly.
The actual deadline is delayed when April 15th falls on a Sunday.

     IRS Publication 2043 indicates that 90% of refunds were processed within 21 days of filing. For exam-
ple, see for 2013: https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-prior/i1040--2013.pdf. See also Slemrod, Christian,
London, and Parker (1997).

to 10%. Ultimately, long-term nonpayment leads to legal penalties that can include wage
garnishment and/or incarceration.
       To measure when households file returns, we take advantage of the fact that many house-
holds use online tax-preparation companies such as TurboTax to help them fill out and file
their tax forms. These tax preparation companies also offer customers the ability, for a fee,
to receive their refunds immediately from the company instead of with delay from the federal
government.10 While these fees are not large, on the order of $25–$35, because the refunds
are expected within weeks, the implicit annualized interest rates on these short-term loans
are large.
       As we describe in the next section, because of the way we measure tax filing, payments,
and refunds, our sample omits both people who postpone payment until after April 15
and those who choose to receive their refunds immediately from their tax preparer. The
implication of this sample selection is that our sample under-represents people who are
significantly liquidity constrained, which in turn bolsters our conclusion that the consumption
responses to refunds that we find are not solely drive by liquidity constraints.
       In our data and in the population, most households receive refunds, a pattern we expect
for three reasons. First, simple inertia would lead to a refund status for most households
because default withholding rates and estimated-tax worksheets are structured so that most
households following these guidelines receive a refund. Second, households seeking to opti-
mize their withholding have an incentive to choose lower withholding and pay taxes later, but
also a countervailing incentive to avoid significant underpayment and the associated penalties
and interest. Jones (2012) shows that inaction is a dominant feature of withholding behavior.
Gelman et al. (2019) shows that a rational model with uncertainty over income and penalties
for under-withholding can also explain the share of households that over-withhold. Finally,
the earned income tax credit (EITC) leads many low-income households to have a negative
tax liability for the calendar year and so to receive a refund. Our sample likely contains few
such households.11
  10
    In this case, the actual refund is paid to the company instead of to the taxpayer.
  11
    Although households cannot choose negative withholding or estimated tax payments, households with
children who qualify for the EITC can file a W-5 form with their employer and receive up to 60% of the
EITC credit early.



                                                  8
    We treat these tax payments as reductions in after-tax income, and tax refunds as in-
creases in after-tax income. We construct our measure of news based on the fact that
households uncover information about their refund or taxes due when they fill out their tax
forms before filing. Thus, information about future cash flows arrives during the period
before filing, and the cash flow happens at, or more typically during, the period after filing.
The timing of the arrival of information is based on a household choice. The timing of the
arrival of any tax refund is partly based on the endogenous filing date and partly due to the
largely random delay between filing and disbursement by the IRS. Finally, payment of taxes
is determined by the household, subject to the costs of missing the April 15th deadline.



3     Data and Variable Construction

3.1    Data Source

    The data we use were provided by a free online account aggregator. This service allows
households to view their financial information such as account balances and spending by
category. The service also assists with financial management, such as offering alerts for
upcoming bills or approaching credit limits. Users sign up and provide access to account
information for accounts across different financial institutions. Once someone signs up, the
aggregator has access to the household’s account information, and there is low attrition in
our sample.
    The raw data cover daily transactions for 2.7 million households from July 2010 to May
2015 and include all checking, savings, debit card, and credit card transactions for any bank
account once linked to the service by the household. We observe permanent household
identifiers, and the date, amount, and description of every transaction, in a form such as is
typically found on monthly bank or credit card statements.


3.2    Variable Construction

    We use the text of each description in conjunction with the data provider’s categorization
of each transaction to map financial transactions into economic concepts as follows.


                                              9
    First, we identify federal tax refunds and payments by querying the transaction descrip-
tions. Such transactions are easily identified via queries for “us treasury des tax” and “irs
treas tax,” among other terms.12 To remove unusual tax activity such as that occurring
through business owners, we exclude any household-year containing more than one such
tax refund or payment. We further remove any household that has ever incurred a tax
payment or tax refund of over $10,000, in large part because the very few households that
made payments greater than $10,000 are quite different from most of our sample along many
dimensions.13
    Similarly, we identify tax-preparation transactions by querying for payments to Turb-
oTax, H&R Block, TaxAct, or TaxSlayer using electronic payment, debit cards, or linked
credit cards. We designate the filing date of the household as the transaction date of the tax-
preparation software. We exclude household-years that have tax-preparation transactions on
multiple days (as would be the case for a family filing separately on different days). We also
implicitly exclude household-years that elect to deduct the preparation charges directly from
their refunds (since we would not observe a payment associated with filing).
    We construct a measure of consumption spending that consists only of outflows that we
are highly confident represent spending on consumption. Consumption is defined as the
sum of outflows on the following categories: gas, restaurants, retail, groceries, cash, en-
tertainment, health care, travel, utilities, miscellaneous bills (e.g., gym memberships), and
insurance. To ensure that consumption is not mechanically related to taxes, we exclude from
it any filing fees or tax payments. These outflows are primarily those that the household
makes via debit cards and online bill payments as well as those on linked credit cards. Im-
portantly, we are unable to categorize outflows made by check. Our measure of consumption
spending, thus, understates actual consumption spending not only because of categories that
  12
     Conventional tax refunds and payments are easily identified in the data using the keywords “us treasury
des tax,” “irs treas des tax,” “irs treas tax,” and “irs usataxpymt.” Our main analysis uses only these.
However, when we predict a refund, we also use refunds paid directly to households by tax preparers. Many
tax-preparation software companies, such as TurboTax, allow customers to pay their tax-preparation fees
directly from their refund rather than beforehand at the time of filing. In this event, the government first
deposits the funds with TurboTax, which extracts the customer’s tax-preparation fee plus an additional
service charge and then deposits the remaining balance into the customer’s bank account. Such transactions
are identified in the data by querying for “sbtpg,” “tax products p,” “block bank des hrbb,” “block bank
hrbb,” and “republic trs.”
  13
     We confirmed that our results are very similar if we instead truncate at $20,000.


                                                    10
we omit from our measure out of caution, but also all those made by checks.
       We adjust this measure of consumption to account for the fact that we only observe
payments to unlinked cards, not spending on these cards. To overcome this issue, we scale
up observed credit card spending by the household-specific ratio of annual payments to all
credit cards (linked and unlinked) divided by the payments to linked credit cards (separately
for each household-year).14 We drop all household-years with scaling factors above 2 since,
for these households, we observe less than half of their credit card spending on consumption.
The scaling factor has a median of 1.083 and an average of 1.167. Our estimated consumption
responses are only slightly larger due to the scaling-up of credit card spending, consistent
with the 16.7% implied by the average scaling factor.
       We likewise construct a savings and debt payment measure as the sum of outflows on the
following categories: mortgages, auto loans, net investing (flows to investing accounts minus
flows from investing accounts), net credit card payments (credit card payments minus credit
card expenditures), and other loan repayments (e.g., student loans). We also construct a
measure of miscellaneous payments that captures payments we cannot definitively categorize
into either consumption or savings. This variable is equal to the sum of the following
categories: checks and otherwise uncategorized outflows. Given that we omit miscellaneous
payments from consumption, we are likely understating true consumption. We measure
income based on direct deposits, which captures labor income, pension income, and Social
Security distributions.
       Our data do not directly contain account balances so we construct two measures from the
information we do have. First, we use “net interest earned” as a proxy for each household’s
liquidity, which we construct as the interest earned on all checking and savings accounts less
the interest paid for balances carried on credit card accounts. Second, some “interest earned”
transactions include information about the account balance in the text of the transaction
description. We extract account balances for about 5% of household-years for which we
observe balances in this way for all bank-linked accounts.
  14
     This process does not bias our results if households randomized which card was used for any given
transaction or, more reasonably, if the choice of card is independent of the timing and amount of the tax
variables in our estimating equation (3). We confirm that our results are similar without this adjustment as
reported in Table A.II in the Appendix.



                                                    11
3.3       Sample Construction

       The central question that we investigate is whether households react differently to cash
payments versus cash receipts. To answer this question in our empirical setting, we need to
keep household characteristics as constant as possible. Doing so ensures that the effects we
document result from neither within-household variation nor across-household differences.
Therefore, we focus on the subsample of households that we observe both making tax pay-
ments and receiving refunds across different years in our sample period.
       We arrange our data into household-years running from October 1 to September 31.15
We drop household-years for which all necessary variables are not present, as described in the
previous subsection. Further, to ensure we have active users rather than dormant account
holders, we impose a simple activity filter for households. We require that households have
at least 25 transactions of at least one dollar each month.
       We next require that the tax filing date precedes the tax refund or tax payment date.
However, due to small differences across financial institutions in how quickly transactions
post to different accounts, we allow the tax-payment date to precede the tax filing date by
no more than two days. Such a scenario would occur if an individual pays a tax-preparation
fee with a debit card that takes two days to post while paying their taxes with a credit
card that posts immediately. On average, refunds are received 10.2 days after filing, and
payments are made 8.6 days after filing. To limit our sample to more typical refunds, we
require that both the filing date and refund or payment date occur before June 1. Finally,
in addition to observing the refund or payment for a given tax year, we require that we also
observe a refund or payment in the year prior for reasons explained in Section 4.1.
       The resulting distribution of tax payments and refunds is shown in Figure 2. Panel A
shows the distribution of tax payments/refunds in our broad sample. Panel B shows the
distribution for households that make a payment in at least one year and receive a refund
in at least one year, which is our main sample. The distribution of refunds and payments is
more symmetric in our main sample than in the original broader sample.
  15
    Each year consists of 365 days, with the exception of 2015, when our sample ends, which consists of 237
days.

3.4                        Sample Statistics

            After applying all filters except that each household must receive at least one refund
and make one tax payment in our sample, our baseline sample contains 307,702 household-
years from 196,565 unique households, which leads to a dataset with 102 million household-
day observations. The summary statistics for this broad-sample population are presented
in Appendix Table A.I. Our original dataset consists of households that have selected to
use the aggregator. It appears to be broadly representative of the population with some
exceptions.16 From this population, we use the subset of households that are observed to
have at least one refund and one payment (in different years). The summary statistics for
this, our main sample of households, are presented in Table 1.
            As shown in Table 1, the average daily income is $187.79, corresponding to an average
annual salary of $68,543. The distribution of salary is shown in Figure 3, which illustrates
the income distribution of our initial broad sample (panel A) and final sample (panel B)
relative to U.S. Census data.17 As shown, households in our sample vary widely in income.

     Relative to U.S. Census, households in our sample are well dispersed geographically, though we have
high concentrations of households in California, New York, and Texas. See a detailed distribution of the
sample in Baugh, Ben-David, and Park (2018), who use the same broad sample.

Table 1.       Summary Statistics
This table presents summary statistics for our final sample, which includes only households that make a tax
payment in one year and receive a tax refund in another. Refund − Payment ($) is the average refund (less
payment) amount across household-years. Predicted Refund ($) shows the average predicted refund size.
News Amount ($) is the difference between the realized refund and the predicted refund. To ensure that
the prediction is unbiased, we use households that only make payments or only receive refunds to make this
prediction, so the mean is nonzero. Filing to Ref/Pay (days) is the number of days between filing and the
subsequent payment/refund. I(Linked Credit Cards) is an indicator variable that equals one if the household
has one or more credit cards linked to the account aggregator, and zero otherwise. I(Unlinked Credit Cards)
is an indicator variable that equals one if the household has one or more unlinked credit cards, and zero
otherwise. I(Any Credit Cards) is an indicator that equals one if the household has either linked or unlinked
credit cards, and zero otherwise. Net Flow ($) is the difference between inflows and outflows to the core
accounts. Consumption ($) is observed consumption. Scaled Consumption ($) is the Consumption variable
scaled up to compensate for the presence of unlinked credit cards. Savings and Loans ($) shows payments
to savings accounts (net investing outflows, net transfers out) and net loan payments (mortgage, auto loan,
and net decrease in credit card debt). Misc Payments ($) is the sum of checks and uncategorized outflows.
Income ($) is observed income. Net Interest ($), Interest Expense ($), and Interest Earned ($) are net
interest, interest expense, and interest earnings, respectively. Finally, Net CC Charge ($) is all linked credit
card expenditures after excluding tax-related transactions (such as filing fees and tax payments made on
credit cards).

We also have a disproportionate number of very low-income accounts, perhaps because we do
not identify all income correctly. More generally, while the distribution of our initial sample
corresponds to the U.S. distribution reasonably well, our final sample of households tends to
be higher income. To some extent this is to be expected because the income that we observe
is net of taxes and benefits such as 401k contributions, health care premiums, etc.

            Household consumption averages $100.24 per day (corresponding to $36,588 annually) in
directly observed spending and $116.97 per day (corresponding to $42,694 annually) when
scaled up to account for spending on unlinked cards. Of the households in our sample, 81%
have credit cards linked to the aggregator, 83% have credit cards that are not linked to the
aggregator, and 97% have at least one credit card that is either linked or unlinked.
            In our broad sample, 90% of household-years receive a refund. In our final sample, 56% of
household-years receive a refund. The average value of Ref und − P ayment is $2,339 for the
broad sample and $509 in our final sample. In untabulated results, we find that, conditional
on receiving a refund, the average refund is $2,805 in our broad sample and $2,121 in our
final sample. Thus, the average refund is quite large since it constitutes 37% of an average
household’s monthly income (= $2, 121 / ($68, 543 / 12)) in our broad sample. Conditional
on making a payment, the average payment is $1,687 in our broad sample and $1,574 in our
final sample.
            Table 1 also shows that the average household files on March 17, and that there is
significant variation: the standard deviation of filing date is 27.5 days. In untabulated
results, we find that the average household makes a payment on April 4 or receives a refund

on March 19, and again there is large variation across households (standard deviations of
28 and 26 days for filing and refund dates, respectively). The average distance between
filing and refund or payment is 9.7 days, with a still substantial standard deviation of 13
days. Table 2 provides more details and shows that there is substantial variation in refund
and payment dates across months, and in the number of days between filing and refund or
payment.
    Table 2, panel A, shows the distribution of filing dates throughout tax season. The overall
distribution has a slight bimodal tendency, driven by the relatively higher propensity of
households with refunds to file early and households with payments to file near the deadline.
Table 2, panel B, shows the delay in days between filing and refund receipt and filing and
tax payment separately. This delay for refunds is a function of IRS processing, determined
in part by regional processing center delays at different times and by the complexity of the
given return. This delay for payment is largely a function of whether households pay when
they file or choose instead to pay right before the deadline, although many payments fit
neither scenario.

4        Estimation Method

4.1       Information Acquired during Tax Preparation and Filing

       We measure the news about the future amount of tax refund or payment as the difference
between the actual amount paid or received and the expected amount. We compute the
expected amount using information on the previous year’s amount and take the residual
from the equation below as a measure of the information revealed by tax preparation.
       To set the notation, let Ref undh,y be the amount of any refund received in year y and be
zero if a payment is made that year, and analogously for P aymenth,y . We run the following
regression:


Ref undh,y − P aymenth,y = β0 + β1 Ref undh,y + β2 P aymenth,y + β3 1[Ref undh,y > 0] + ηh,y (1)


where 1[·] denotes the indicator function. We run this regression on the broad sample of
households rather than the final sample since the final sample is selected on the outcome
of refunds and payments. The predictive regression has a fit goodness (R2 ) of 50%.18 Our
measure of information about tax information uncovered during filing, or “news,” is the
residual in this regression, which we denote by


    N ews Amounth,y = Ref undh,y − P aymenth,y − Eh,y−1 [Ref undh,y − P aymenth,y ].                         (2)


       The distribution of N ews Amount is shown in Table 1 for our final sample, and in
Appendix Table A.I for the broader sample. Whereas the average N ews Amount in the
broader sample is zero, the average N ews Amount in the final sample is −$885. This
difference reflects our selection of households with both payments and refunds, who then
have worse outcomes on average because payments are more prevalent than in the larger
sample used for estimating N ews Amount.
       This empirical model is identified from cross-sectional variation and has a short time
  18
     Adding the previous year’s income and its interaction with the previous year’s indicator variable leads
to only a trivial increase in fit. Adding two years’ prior income as well leads to a slightly greater increase in
fit (about 1%) but a large decline in sample size.



                                                       17
dimension; consequently, it effectively endows agents with knowledge of the increase in aver-
age refund over the few years we study. This assumption is supported by the fact that this
was a period without a federal tax reform and with few changes in tax law more generally.
Consistent with this stability, according to the IRS, average refunds declined reasonably
steadily by $82 per year from their peak in 2010.19 To the extent that households did not
anticipate these declines, as our empirical model assumes, our measure of news could be
slightly upward biased on average.


4.2       Estimation of Responses to Cash Flows and Information

       We summarize household behavior in two ways. First, we present transparent plots of
the data as in Figure 1 in the Introduction. We de-mean the average value of Yh,y,t , both by
calendar day and by subtracting the average value of Yh,y,t for the household over the seven
months that exclude the two months before and three months after the refund or payment.20
We create 10 equally sized bins of tax payments and 20 equally sized bins of tax refunds,
and compute the average value of tax payment or refund along the x -axis in the 30 days
before or after the payment or refund.
       Second, we estimate and display the impulse responses of household consumption spend-
ing (and other account flows, e.g., savings, income, and interest) to the arrival of a refund
or the making of a payment. We model the spending response as linear in amount but
with a different slope for refunds than for payments (linear with a kink at zero). We also
estimate (and so control for) the arrival of information by estimating in the same regression
the impulse response to the news uncovered prior to and at filing, allowing the spending
response to be affine in amount of news, but with different slopes for positive and negative
news about tax amount (that is, affine with different coefficients on good and bad news).
       To be precise, let Ref undh,y,t be the amount of refund received on day t in year y and be
zero on all other days of that year or if a payment is made that year. Define P aymenth,y,t
analogously and let F ileh,y,t be an indicator variable for the day t of year y on which house-

     The resultant de-meaned value of Yh,y,t is interpreted as abnormal Yh,y,t with seasonality and household-
year effects stripped away.

N ews Amounth,y,t is the amount of news only on the day of filing, similarly to the way
that Ref undh,y,t and P aymenth,y,t are the amounts only on the day a refund is received and
a payment made, respectively. Finally, let P osN ewsh,y,t = max[N ews Amounth,y,t , 0] and
N egN ewsh,y,t = max[−N ews Amounth,y,t , 0].

where Y is an account inflow or outflow measure, αh,y is a household-year-specific intercept,
and τt is a day-specific intercept. K is set to the maximum identifiable lag. The βk , γk , and
φk coefficients capture the prior, contemporaneous, and lagged response of the dependent
variable to news about a refund or payment (β̂k ), to the date of filing (φ̂k ), and to getting
a refund or making a payment(γ̂k ). The responses to refunds, payments, and news are
measured as a share of the refund, payment, and news, respectively. Thus, for example,
when Y is consumption spending, γ̂k+ measures the increase in consumption caused by the
arrival as a share of the refund amount k days after the refund arrives, and β̂k− measures
the increase in spending caused by the arrival of information as a percentage of the news
uncovered during filing k days after filing. We refer to these coefficients as the marginal
propensity to consume out of refunds and out of negative news.21
       Most of the identification of β̂k and φ̂k comes from the “event time,” which is relative to
the day of filing. Similarly, for identification of γ̂k , event time is relative to the day a refund
arrives or the payment is made. The day fixed effects (τt ) control for the average spending
on a particular calendar day, so that the typical fluctuations on weekends, holidays, spring
months, and during tax season do not bias our results. Finally, the household-year fixed
  21
    We include the leads and lag F ile (in addition to its interactions with the amount of news) for two
reasons. First, although presumably a quantitatively small effect, as uncertainty is resolved, precautionary
saving may decline. Second, the household may learn information unrelated to the amount of news about
refund or payment during return preparation, as we discuss in Section 8. In practice, omitting this term
makes very little different to any of the other coefficients


                                                        19
effects (αh,y ) absorb any correlation between the average household-specific level of outflows
and refund or payment amount. Such differences in our data arise not only due to differences
in economic circumstances such as standard of living but also due to possible differences in
the scope of our measurement, such as the share of actual consumption spending that we
identify as such.
     We smooth the daily impulse responses by imposing that the daily coefficients are con-
stant within weeks from k = −28 to −15 days, and for k > 14 days. Standard errors allow for
arbitrary heteroscedasticity, within-day correlation, and within-household-year correlation in
uh,t .
     We report cumulative impulse responses of our regression estimates from equation (3),
which are simply the sums of estimated coefficients over k up to some κ. For example, for
consumption and γ + , the impulse response at κ, κk=−28 γk+ , is the total marginal propensities
                                                P

to consume out of the refund starting 28 days before receiving the refund up to κ days after,
controlling for seasonal factors, individual differences, and the effect of news gathered during
and shortly before filing. Standard errors for the cumulated daily total are calculated for the
endpoint of each discrete interval (using the variance-covariance matrix of the coefficients).



5        Asymmetric Consumption Responses
     In this section, we present our main finding: In our sample, households have different
consumption responses to expected increases and expected decreases in income. The follow-
ing sections investigate why. Section 6 shows that the asymmetric response is not driven
purely by liquidity because it occurs for the most and least liquid households in our sample.
Section 7 shows that households have substantial liquidity and use liquidity management
to smooth consumption through payments but not refunds. Section 8 shows that, despite
making transfers across accounts in response to bad news about refunds and payments,
households do not adjust consumption in response to such news.


Consumption Response to Tax Refunds Our first result is that households increase
consumption spending when they receive refunds but do not decrease spending when they

The figure shows the cumulative consumption response to making tax payments (panels A and C) and the
arrival of tax refunds (panels B and D). Panels A and B show the response of all transactions classified as
consumption. Panels C and D show the subset of transactions classified as restaurants. The x -axis represents
the number of days after the tax payment or receipt of refund. The y-axis shows the propensity to spend
out of payment or refund. These responses are computed from equation 3. The shaded region represents
two standard errors confidence intervals. Standard errors are doubled-clustered at the household-year and

of consumption spending. Each impulse response shows the cumulative increase in spending
as a percentage of refund and as a percentage of payment starting 28 days before the refund
arrived or payment was made. These cumulative spending responses are also reported in the
first row of Table 3 (and the responses for unscaled consumption are reported in Table A.II).
                                             Figure 4, panel B, shows that people consume about 8% of their refunds over the month
following receiving a refund, a number which rises to 15% of their refund over the following
three months. The spending increase starts the exact day on which the refund arrives. We


                                                                                                21
find no evidence of increases in consumption spending prior to the day of arrival (related to
the timing of refund arrival rather than filing).


Consumption Response to Tax Payments In contrast to the consumption response
to refunds, the response to payments is small and statistically indistinguishable from zero.
Panel A of Figure 4 shows the change in spending around the time when households make
a tax payment, controlling for the arrival of information about payment. There is a slight
decline in consumption that accumulates to (an insignificant in both senses) 4% of payment
after four months. We also find no evidence of any decline in spending around the day
of payment as we might have expected given the strong response to refunds on the day of
arrival. These results focus on the response to cash flow but confirm the temporal pattern
of the spending asymmetry displayed in Figure 1, panel B, which showed that month-after
spending increases linearly with refund amount and does not decrease with payment amount.
       Because our measurement of consumption is conservative, our estimated propensities to
consume out of refunds are surely underestimates. The response of outflows that we cannot
characterize—which primarily consist of checks and so is probably mostly consumption—
has a pattern and magnitude very similar to that of consumption. The final row of Table 3
shows that miscellaneous payments exhibit the same asymmetry as our baseline consumption
measure. If miscellaneous payments were consumption, then the propensity to consume out
of refunds would be 17% after a month and 28% after four months, which are more than
twice as large as our baseline, conservative estimates.22


Strictly Nondurable Consumption Response to Tax Refunds and Payments Pan-
els C and D of Figure 4 show the same response of consumption to payments and refunds,
but only for a narrow and easily identifiable type of consumption: spending at restaurants.23
These panels show that spending on restaurants exhibits the same clear asymmetry, con-
sistent with consumption rising substantially in response to refund receipt but being stable
  22
     Around tax payments, miscellaneous payments rise instead of falling as they would if tax payments were
reducing consumption. This increase possibly reflects payment of state and local taxes. Note that our results
for our baseline consumption measure hold almost identically using only households in states without state
income taxes.
  23
     We use the classification of restaurant transactions provided by the debit card and credit card providers,
so this includes everything from fast food chains to gourmet dining experiences.

around the time tax payments are made. Panels C and D also rule out the interpretation
that only spending on durable goods increases, which could then just represent an increase
in savings/investment. Thus, our estimated spending responses are neither purely driven
by spending on durable goods nor spuriously driven by miscategorized or misinterpreted
account outflows.
    We again emphasize that our results are unlikely to be driven by differences across house-
holds that receive refunds and those that make payments because all households in our sample
both make payments and receive refunds (in different years). However, one possibility is that
the asymmetric response is due to households that slip into our sample by making a small
payment or getting a small refund in just one year. Figures A.I and A.II in the Appendix
show that this is not the case: The asymmetry remains when we drop household-years with
amounts less than $2,000 and, more severely, when we require households to have a refund
and a payment each greater than $2,000. Pursuing this point further, in theory we could
identify the asymmetry purely from differences within the same household by interacting
the day-of-the-year effects with the individual effects, but doing so makes inference very
imprecise. Instead, we confirm that we find the same results when we interact the individual

                                                         23
effects with indicators for day of the week, month of the year, the first three days of the
month, the last three days of the month, and the 14th to the 16th of the month (a total of
30 time fixed effects; see Figure A.III in the Appendix).24
       However, it is important to note that households can differ across years, and in particular,
they do have different amounts of liquidity. We address this issue in detail in Sections 6 and 7.
Before doing so, we first address two final possible concerns with our results so far.


The Timing of Refunds and Payments Could the consumption asymmetry be driven
by the endogeneity of the timing of filing? People can always postpone payment until
the deadline in mid-April.25 A bias from this source seems unlikely because we find the
asymmetric consumption response for many different, more homogeneous subgroups of our
sample.26
       For example, consider the possibility that the spending response to refunds is driven by
years in which households have little liquidity and receive large refunds so that they cannot
smooth consumption in these years. Panels A and B of Figure 5 show that there is a large
asymmetry in consumption response among only those households expecting either payments
or small refunds. This subsample contains only household-years in the lowest quintile of the
expected value of Ref und − P ayment. In this subsample, Ref und − P ayment averages
−$62.40 (a payment, relative to a refund of $564 in the whole sample) with a standard
deviation of $2, 966.
       Focusing more closely on the issue of timing, the consumption asymmetry is observed for
people independent of when they file their taxes. Panels C and D of Figure 5 show that we
find the same asymmetry for households filing in each month of the year. Households filing
in April are partly those with substantial liquidity who are not constrained, and yet we find
  24
      It is also true that persistent differences across households within the canonical model, such as from
differences in impatience, would not produce our main consumption asymmetry. More impatient and so
more illiquid households should have a stronger sensitivity of consumption to cash flows, should withhold
less, and thus should be more likely to make payments. Thus, differences across households in impatience or
liquidity would lead households with lower spending reactions to be more likely to get refunds.

      Of households that file in February and owe taxes, 33% pay in April, and the average time between filing
and payment is 23 days. Of those that file in March, 47% pay in April, and the mean time between filing
and payment is 12 days.
   26
      As we discuss in both the Introduction and Section 7, ours is a select sample that excludes households
that choose to postpone payments past the April 15 deadline.

Figure 5. Consumption for Small Expected Amounts and Early/Late Filers
The figure shows the consumption response to making tax payments (panels A and C) and to the arrival of
tax refunds (panels B and D). Panels A and B show the response among the subsample of household-years
with small expected amounts, defined as the bottom quintile of expected amount (refund less payment).
Panels C and D compare the consumption response of early versus late filers. Early filers are defined as
those who filed their returns before March. Late filers are those who filed their returns in April. The
dotted lines represent two standard errors confidence intervals. Standard errors are doubled-clustered at the
household-year and at the calendar-date levels.

substantial spending out of refunds. Alternatively, households who file and pay taxes late
have the least time to save and prepare to smooth consumption. Yet, these households also
both smooth consumption over payments and spend out of refunds. This lack of difference
in spending responses by month constitutes evidence against a specific behavioral theory in
which some people have self-control problems that lead them to both procrastinate filing and




                                                                                 25
accumulate little liquidity.27 The lack of differential spending responses to refund arrival
also suggests that liquidity constraints are not the main reason for the high propensity
to consume out of refunds on arrival. Optimizing households that are short on liquidity
should file earlier to better smooth consumption. Thus, if liquidity constraints were driving
spending from refunds, we would expect much higher spending responses among households
filing earlier (and revealing that they are liquidity constrained). In fact, panel D shows only
small differences.


Mismeasurement and Robustness Could mismeasurement generate our finding of an
asymmetric consumption response? Both the timing and amount of news about refund
or payment are measured with error. Measurement error is particularly a concern for the
consumption response to payments because most payments are made within three days of
filing, whereas no refunds arrive on the day of or day after filing, and most arrive two or more
weeks after filing. Our statistical procedure thus might not cleanly separate the consumption
response to filing and news from the response to payment.28
       However, payments are on average associated with bad news, and households should
respond to bad news by decreasing consumption or at least not increasing it. Thus, if
our procedure were not cleanly separating the effect of making a payment from the effect
of filing and news about payment, we would be biased toward finding a larger decline in
spending in response to making payments, not the insignificantly small changes we actually
find. Further evidence is provided by the differential effect on the exact day of payment and
refund.29 Thus, this type of mismeasurement cannot account for our asymmetry.
       Moreover, our main asymmetry is a very robust result. We find the asymmetry when
  27
      Another related theory is that households that have time-consistency problems are sophisticated about
these problems, i.e., understand their bias and act to correct it. In this case, households with time-consistency
problems value the commitment of filing later (rather than simply always intending to file tomorrow and
failing to do so until the deadline). The prediction for naı̈fs or sophisticates is the same: People who file
later are those most likely to spend when a refund arrives.
   28
      Because there is always a temporal delay between filing and refund, our methodology has much more
power to separately identify the response to news and the response to refunds.
   29
      To validate our estimation strategy, we confirmed that it measures the effect of the news and cash flows
on the tax-induced cash flows with near perfect accuracy (which we found required daily data rather than
data collapsed to the weekly level). For Ref und − P ayment, there is a 100% response to refund arrival and
a −100% response to payments, and no response to news. The filing fee is estimated to rise by $45 on the
day of filing, or almost exactly the average filing fee, but the effect is estimated to decay over time.



                                                       26
the equation is estimated with a log dependent variable and indicators of refund, payment,
positive news, and negative news. We find similar results if we instead (i) omit the controls
for the arrival of news about tax status, (ii) interact the amount of the refund or payment
with the timing of filing as a control (instead of interacting the amount of news about future
taxes), and (iii) control for the news that arrives but with the timing related to the cash
flow rather than filing. Finally, this result does not just apply to the somewhat atypical
sample of households that regularly both make payments and receive refunds. As we show
in Figure A.IV in the Appendix, we find the same asymmetric consumption response in our
broad sample of all households regardless of whether they ever make payments or receive
refunds.
    We conclude that our main finding is unlikely to be due to a variety of possible biases.
Therefore, the consumption responses to cash flows are asymmetric. People increase expen-
ditures on consumption substantially after refunds arrive, but do not reduce expenditures
when and after they have to make a payment.



6     Asymmetric Consumption Smoothing, by Liquidity
    In this section, we show that liquidity constraints have a limited role in driving the asym-
metric consumption response. Households exhibit the consumption asymmetry across the
liquidity distribution. First, households do not reduce consumption in response to payments
even in the household-years in which they are in the lowest tercile of liquidity. Thus, even
households with low liquidity have sufficient funds and debt capacity to stabilize consump-
tion. Second, these same households wait until arrival to increase spending in response to
refunds even in the household-years in which they have substantial liquidity, although the
increase in spending is more modest.
    Two different properties of liquidity are useful for interpreting these results. First, in the
U.S. population, low liquidity is persistent in both survey and account-level data. Thus, low
or high liquidity is significantly a household characteristic. Second, however, liquid wealth
does vary some over time, particularly for wealthier households. Section 7 documents that in
our data liquidity in checking and savings accounts is endogenous and related to impending


                                               27
payments: People adjust their liquidity around tax time and have slightly more liquidity in
years with payments.


Households with Low Liquidity Our primary measure of liquidity is based on the small
subsample of accounts for which we can observe the account balance from a text line in the
account (e.g., “$0.16 interest earned for average daily balance of $3,810.72.”). Because we
“observe” balances in this way for all core accounts in January for just under 5% of our
sample, we present results for the both our main sample of households that receive refunds
in some years and make payments in other years and our broad sample that does not impose
this restriction (as described in Table A.I).
       Figure 6 presents our main results for households with low ex-ante liquidity according to
their January balance for the bottom tercile of our main sample and the bottom quintile of
our broad sample.30 Panels A and B show the excess consumption spending around payments
and refunds (as in panels A and B in Figure 1 but for larger vertical axes). Households with
low liquidity smooth consumption when making payments and yet these same households
nevertheless increase consumption when receiving refunds in other years when they also have
low liquidity.
       Panels C and D show the same results from our estimation of equation (3) (as in pan-
els C and D in Figure 4 but for larger vertical axes). Controlling for seasonal patterns and
the timing of filing and information about taxes confirms this result: households with low
liquidity spend an even greater fraction of their refunds when they arrive than the typical
household, and yet they still smooth consumption through payments. The propensity to
spend from rebates is more than one and a half times the average. This pattern is strong
evidence that low liquidity is not driving the spending response to refunds since it is not hin-
dering the smoothing of consumption through tax payments. These results are quite robust
across different measures of liquidity, as we note just below, including looking at households
that pay interest on credit card balances.
       We emphasize again that these results are from a sample of households that neither take
up refund anticipation loans nor postpone payment until the later tax deadline, and so are
  30
    There are about 3,935 household-years in each tercile of our main sample and about 8,323 household-
years in each quintile of our broad sample.

Figure 6. Consumption Response for Households with Low Account Balances
Panels A and B show the abnormal consumption around tax payment and refund dates, as a function of
payment and refund amounts for household-years with low liquidity based on January account balances.
For households in our similar sample (those who make tax payments in some years and receive tax refunds
in other years), we take the bottom tercile of observed account balances, resulting in a sample of 3,935
household-years with an average account balance of $2,228. For households in our broader sample, we take
the bottom quintile of observed account balances, resulting in a sample of 8,323 household-years with an
average account balance of $999. The markers denote averages at every 5% of the data for those who
received refunds, and every 10% of the data for those who made payments. Panels C and D show the
cumulative response of external savings and debt payments to making tax payments and receiving refunds,
respectively. The horizontal axes measure days since payment or refund arrival. The shaded region represents
two standard errors confidence intervals. Standard errors are doubled-clustered at the household-year and
at the calendar-date levels.

less likely to be liquidity constrained than the general population. In the population and for

show little evidence that households have lower consumption in the month before making
payments and some evidence that households with high liquidity have higher consumption
in the month following the receipt of a refund. The evidence is statistically weak in our
main sample, due to losing 95% of our sample, but quite strong for the broad sample. Pan-
els C and D shows the same results for our regression analysis. For our similar sample, the
point estimate of the spending response to refunds is only just slightly smaller than that of
the entire sample but is only on the edge of statistical significance. For the broad sample,
the evidence for a substantial spending response is much more statistically significant (but
requires stronger identifying assumptions to be interpreted as causal).
   Optimizing households that both have liquidity and try to stabilize their standard of
living should not cut consumption prior to or after making tax payments or receiving tax
refunds. We confirm that prediction for tax payments.
   These results are quite robust across different measures of liquidity. For example, house-
holds filing in February—who might be less liquid if they are impatient to get refunds—have
stronger spending responses (as shown earlier in Figure 5, panels C and D). Further, we verify
these results for a larger subsample of our data by measuring liquidity based on net interest
earned during November, December, and January. Net interest earned is interest earned on
all checking and savings accounts less interest paid on linked credit card accounts. While the
sample is larger, this measure is less precise as a measure of liquidity due to different interest
rates. Figures A.V and A.VI in the Appendix show that we find very similar results for low
and high liquidity households, defined as those in the lowest and highest terciles (quintiles)
of our main (broad) sample. Finally, we also confirmed these findings for other proxies for
liquidity, such as splitting households by income during the three months prior to February
of each year, and classifying households expecting small refunds or payments as less likely
to be constrained.


Implications Even less-liquid households smooth consumption through making tax pay-
ments, which shows that these households are not actually constrained and that their spend-
ing out of refunds even when more liquid is unlikely to be driven by liquidity constraints or
financial frictions. The finding that households with lower liquidity have larger consumption

Figure 7. Consumption Response for Households with High Account Balances
Panels A and B show the abnormal consumption around tax payment and refund dates, as a function of
payment and refund amounts for household-years with high liquidity based on January account balances. For
households in our similar sample (those who make tax payments in some years and receive tax refunds in other
years), we take the top tercile of observed account balances, resulting in a sample of 3,934 household-years
with an average account balance of $90,761. For households in our broader sample, we take the top quintile
of observed account balances, resulting in a sample of 8,322 household-years with an average account balance
of $108,463. The markers denote averages at every 5% of the data for those who received refunds, and every
10% of the data for those who made payments. Panels C and D show the cumulative response of external
savings and debt payments to making tax payments and receiving refunds, respectively. The horizontal axes
measure days since payment or refund arrival. The shaded region represents two standard errors confidence
intervals. Standard errors are doubled-clustered at the household-year and at the calendar-date levels.

responses to expected increases in liquidity than households with higher liquidity is consis-
tent with many previous findings in the literature, which, as we have noted, focuses almost
entirely on expected increases in income or liquidity. The problem with interpreting this
pattern as driven solely by liquidity constraints is that there is no consumption response to
payments, even for households with lower liquidity, implying that households can and do
manage their finances so as to smooth consumption.


                                                                                              31
   One interpretation is that these households have a mental rule that prohibits them from
tapping liquid savings for spending in anticipation of refunds but not in anticipation of
payments. To be clear, liquidity surely plays a role in household consumption behavior
in general, and the management of liquidity plays a role in the smoothing of consumption
through payments, as we show in the next section. However, in our sample, the negative cor-
relation between liquidity and spending out of refunds appears to be driven by a correlation
between the behavioral propensity to spend from refunds and liquidity.


The Endogeneity of Liquidity As we discuss in the next section, we find that in years
when households make payments, they have slightly higher account balances in January.
While this difference is small, and so cannot account on its own for the different responses
to refunds and payments, it is consistent with households taking action to optimally smooth
consumption over tax payments and not taking action to smooth consumption through refund
arrival.
   However, there is another form of endogenous liquidity that rises from the structure
of the U.S. tax system. Households that receive a lot of nonlabor income (that is not
subject to automatic withholding) are likely to have more wealth and are more likely to
make payments. But Gelman et al. (2019) shows that in a model of liquidity constraints,
this feature has a quantitatively small effect on the propensity to spend out of tax refunds
and payments. Specifically,in that paper, households with stochastic nonlabor income face
an approximation of the U.S. tax system. The model is calibrated to match the observed
distribution of payments and refunds and generates an average propensity to spend out
of refunds of 30%. Most importantly for our purposes, the model implies relatively little
variation in consumption reaction across the range of payments and refunds. The propensity
to spend rises by only 6% of payment/refund from a payment of $4,000 to a refund of $4,000.
The rise is smooth, without even a kink at zero. Thus, this source of endogenous liquidity
is unlikely to be the cause of our results.
   In sum, because there is no consumption response to payment, even for the least liquid
household-years, we conclude that even these households have plenty of liquidity to stabilize
consumption. Further, the most liquid household-years wait until refund arrival to increase


                                              32
spending, although the increase is more modest for this most liquid group. Households appear
to be choosing to increase consumption only once refunds arrive but perfectly smoothing
consumption through payments, mostly, as we now show, by tapping into liquid funds.



7     Asymmetric Liquidity Management
    Our evidence so far has shown that households smooth payments but not refunds. One
possibility is that households have little liquidity on average and that there is a fixed cost
associated with accessing liquidity, such as due to complexity or an actual cost (e.g., taxation
of capital gains). If this were the case then households could be willing to pay these costs to
avoid large declines in consumption when making payments but not to increase consumption
slightly ahead of refund arrival.
    In this section, we show that households in our sample appear to be quite liquid on average
across the distribution of refunds and payments. They make payments by accumulating
slightly more wealth in core accounts by January in years when they owe more taxes. And
they then make transfers, almost entirely among observed, liquid accounts—e.g., from a
savings to a checking account—both in response to an upcoming payment and in response to
news uncovered during tax preparation and filing about higher payments or lower refunds.
Households do not adjust earnings ahead of refunds or payments. Because these internal
transfers are nearly costless to make in terms of time or money, asymmetric consumption
behavior appears to be due to mental costs or heuristics.


Account Balances As described in Section 6, we can observe account balances for a
subset of our households by examining the text of interest transactions. While these balances
ignore debt capacity on credit cards and liquid funds outside of the observed accounts, the
balances that we do observe suggest that our sample of households has substantial liquidity,
particularly relative to the amount of the typical payments and refunds (see Figure 2).
    Panel A of Figure 8 plots the median and 25th percentile of the distribution of balances in
January in each range of payments and refunds. These households have a significant amount
of liquidity throughout the distribution of refunds and payments. The distribution is also

somewhat skewed. Across this same distribution, households have on average $15,000 to
$24,000 in liquid funds, far above the typical payment and refund amounts.
          The median displayed in panel A reveals both slightly higher balances in years of pay-
ments and a slight V-shape. To some extent, these are both mechanical. Given our sample,
a household that will make payment is more likely to have received a refund in the previous
year, which, at least ceteris paribus, would raise the account balance. The V-shape arises
because higher-income households tend to make larger payments and receive larger refunds,
and have more wealth and a higher transaction demand for liquidity.
          Panel B of Figure 8 plots the median and 25th percentile of the distribution of abnormal
account balances, defined as the balance relative to the household mean January balance
across years. The median difference in the account balance in a year when the household
will make a payment is no different than in a year when the household will receive a refund.
The 25th percentile of this distribution shows, if anything, that there are more households
with relatively low account balances in years when they receive refunds than in years when
they make payments. The inverted V-shape of the 25th percentile is a natural consequence
of higher-income households having both greater year-to-year volatility of account balances

and higher payments or refunds.


Account Transfers The pattern of transfers that households in our sample make reveals
that both they accumulate liquid wealth following refunds and that they have liquid wealth
and draw it down prior to making tax payments. Panel C of Figure 1 in the Introduction
showed that households smooth consumption through tax payments by increasing transfers
into either observed account (including transfers from one account to another) in the month
before making a payment. These transfers are equivalent in amount to about a quarter of
the anticipated payment.
    We find an almost identical result from our estimation of equation (3), which measures
the cumulative response to payment from 29 days before it is made, controlling for the arrival
of information about the payment. The first number in Table 4 shows that upcoming pay-
ments cause households to increase transfers into the observed accounts (including internal


                                                        35
transfers) by 25% of the upcoming payment. Similarly confirming Figure 1, the arrival of a
refund increases transfers, but only following arrival, and presumably from checking accounts
into savings accounts. More than 40% of the refund amount is transferred into the observed
accounts in the four months following the arrival (first row of Table 4, panel B). Note that
these transfers do not include transfers out of observed accounts into presumably less-liquid
saving accounts, as we discuss after this analysis of transfers into observed accounts. Both
sorts of transfers “save” funds that are then presumably available for the years in which the
household makes payments.
       We also find that households manage liquidity and make transfers in response to news
about payments or refunds. Panel A of Figure 9 shows that households also increase transfers
into their accounts when they learn that they will either owe more taxes than expected or
receive lower than expected refunds. We find no corresponding reaction to good news. Thus,
households react to bad news by moving funds across accounts to be able to make payments,
but they do not move funds to increase consumption in response to goods news (a result
confirmed by the analysis of the consumption response to news in the next section).
       Perhaps the nonresponse of households to good news about taxes is because households
expecting large refunds are constrained. That is, households who are saving to make pay-
ments or who are only expecting to receive small refunds can save less and consume a little
more in response to news that they will owe less taxes this year. Panels C and D of Figure 9
rule out this hypothesis, using the broad sample of all households (for reasons of statistical
power). Households expecting payments or small refunds also react to bad news about the
tax amount but do not respond to goods news.31
       The response of transfers to upcoming payments, to the arrival of refunds, and to bad
news all confirm what we see in the simple plots in Figure 1. Households actively prepare
to make payments. They transfer funds to smooth consumption. But they do not transfer
funds to raise consumption in advance of refunds.


Debt Payments and Transfers from External Accounts Only a small share of these
transfers in advance of payments come from accounts other than the observed checking and
  31
    We find the same result with less precision for panels C and D for our baseline sample of households, as
shown in Figure A.VII in the Appendix.

household-years in our broad sample with small amounts of expected payments or refunds, defined as being
the bottom quintile of absolute expected refunds or payments. The x -axis represents the number of days after
households filed their tax returns. The y-axis shows the dollars response per $100 payment or refund. The

savings accounts. We aggregate all transfers to financial accounts outside of these core
accounts and all debt payments (including to credit card accounts) to measure net external
savings (or reduction in debt). Panel A of Figure 10 shows that households reduce debt
payments and external savings in response to impending payments. But this net dissaving
accounts for only 5% of the upcoming payment. Comparing rows 1 and 2 of Table 4, we
see that this accounts for only one-fifth of the 25% of payment amount transferred into the
account in the 28 days prior to payment. Thus, most transfers we observe are from internal
rather than external accounts.
                          Panel C of Figure 10 confirms this result by simply plotting the abnormal dissaving from

external accounts (reduced loan payment, decreases net savings). Households accumulate
less than $500 from these external sources. Panel C of Figure 1 in comparison shows a large
increase in transfers among core accounts. We conclude that while transfers rise prior to
payment, tax payments are largely made using funds in observed, liquid accounts.
                                In response to refunds, panels B and D of Figure 10, and panel B of Table 4 all show that
the arrival of a refund causes a subsequent increase in external savings and debt payment.
Taking panel B of Figure 10 for example, the cumulative increase in transfers to noncore
accounts rises to 13% of the refund three months following arrival. Comparing rows 1 and 2
of panel B of Table 4 shows that this is still only a third of total transfers observed, meaning


                                                                                              38
that most transfers triggered by tax refunds also occur among core accounts.


Earned Income and Consumption Smoothing Households could, in theory, increase
earnings to increase liquidity and make tax payments, but we do not find any increases in
income inflows to their accounts ahead of an expected payment (final row of Table 4).32


The Dynamics of Account Balances Given the modest increases in consumption, mis-
cellaneous outflows, and external savings and debt repayment following refunds, we try to
measure changes in core account balances over time in response to refunds (and decreases
in response to making payments). We create synthetic measures of account balances by
cumulating inflows and outflows over time. Unfortunately, because the evolution of account
balances is highly variable across households and over time, our estimate of the impact of tax
payments on account balances has very low power; nevertheless, (statistically insignificant)
points estimates suggest that balances rise by 20% of payments in advance of payment and
then a month after the payment have fallen by more than 100% of the payment (row 3 of
Table 4). In response to refunds, our results are also noisy, but now statistically significantly
different from zero. We estimate that core account balances rise during the month ahead
of refunds by 22% of the refund, and points estimates suggest that account balances have
risen by the entire refund amount by two months after arrival, but 95% confidence intervals
contain more reasonable estimates (including roughly 50% of the refund amount).33
    To address the issue of low power, row 4 of Table 4 shows the response of a proxy for core
account balances, the probability of an overdraft. The decline in overdrafts before payments
confirms that balances rise prior to payments. Similarly, the overdraft probability confirms
that balances fall after payments and rise following refunds (all consistent with the balances
in core accounts).


Delay of Tax Payments and Refund Anticipation Loans A final way that people
might manage liquidity is by delaying payment. Could our main asymmetry be driven by
  32
     We also find no evidence that income responds to any news about the tax amount, or that it falls before
or after refund receipt.
  33
     For the interested reader, Appendix Table A.II displays the cumulative response of all categories of
account inflows and outflows in one place.


                                                    39
this asymmetry in the tax system? That is, households do not actually have to pay taxes
due at the April 15 deadline. Instead, they can postpone payment and borrow at reasonable
interest rates and potentially face penalties from the government. Ultimately, of course,
taxpayers who fail to pay their taxes face the possibility of incarceration, so this strategy is
not without risk, but borrowing from the government is an option in the short term.
       We note that the institutional structure is actually roughly symmetric. Households can
delay payment and borrow from the government, but they can also borrow in advance of a
refund. That is, once taxes are filed, the payment from the government provides sufficient
collateral that most tax preparers and preparation programs will advance the refund to the
taxpayer upon filing (e.g., TurboTax Refund Advance in some states). Thus, for both refunds
and payments, the taxpayer has a high-interest-rate option that would allow them to smooth
consumption.34
       We conclude that, in practice, people have a roughly symmetric opportunity to postpone
payment even further (and suffer interest penalties) or to borrow against refunds (and pay
high interest rates). This type of liquidity management occurs but is not the source of our
asymmetry.
       In sum, households smooth consumption through payments by accumulating more wealth,
by reacting to bad news when it arrives, and by transferring funds (primarily) among liquid
accounts. They also manage funds to accumulate slightly more liquid assets by January in
years when they owe more taxes. And yet, they do not take these actions to smooth con-
sumption in response to refunds but instead increase consumption following refund arrival.



8        Lack of Consumption Response to News
       This section shows that households do not adjust consumption prior to payments or
refunds as news arrives. Nor do they adjust consumption in response to impending payments
or refunds, or when making a payment.
       In theory, households with a lot of liquid wealth should increase consumption in response
  34
     People who delay payment to October 15 (or later) do not appear in our sample. Nor do people who
take out refund anticipation loans. Thus, the asymmetry we observe is for the sample of households that
follow the “normal” route and receive a refund or make their payment on time.


                                                  40
to good news about a refund or payment and should reduce consumption in response to
bad news about a refund or payment symmetrically. But these responses should be trivial
because tax refunds and payments are small fractions of wealth and lifetime income.
   Alternatively, if households are forward-looking, smooth consumption, and face occa-
sionally binding liquidity constraints, then theory predicts that the reaction of consumption
to negative news should be larger than the reaction to positive news—the reverse of the
asymmetry we observe for positive and negative expected cash flows. Households that have
few funds and face tightly binding liquidity constraints are unable to adjust consumption in
response to positive or negative news about future cash flows. Quantitatively significant and
asymmetric consumption responses arise only for households that are “weakly” constrained
or close to constrained. Households that are weakly constrained do not respond to good news
but do cut spending in response to negative news that is large enough to (probabilistically)
relax their constraints. Households that are close-to-constrained will respond to bad news
but will not increase spending fully in response to good news that (probabilistically) imposes
a future binding constraint.
   This discussion assumes that return preparation provides information about payment or
refund and not about future non-tax income or current wealth. That is, we assume that
while the household may learn about the previous year’s income, this information is only
relevant for tax status condition on their (known) current financial wealth, current after-
tax take-home pay, and expected future non-tax income. If this assumption were incorrect,
then the estimated responses to news would also include the response to information about
current wealth or future income.
   We find that households do not decrease consumption in response to bad news about
their refund or payment amount, nor do they lower consumption in advance of making tax
payments. First, as shown in panel A of Figure 1 in the Introduction, consumption does not
decline in the month before making a payment (that is, relative to the timing of the “cash
flow” rather than filing) or rise once the payment is made.
   Second, and more importantly, there is no economically significant change in spending in
the period before filing related to the size of the news uncovered during the preparation of
taxes prior to filing. Panels A and B of Figure 11 show these (lack of) consumption responses

to good and bad news, respectively, relative to the event time of tax filing (and controlling
for the consumption response to making a payment or receiving a refund).
                          Finally, we again examine the subsample of households that are likely to make payments
or receive small refunds. Households that are liquidity constrained by a future payment may
adjust consumption nearly completely in response to news about the value of that payment.
Those expecting small refunds may also be able to respond, while those expecting large
refunds may simply be too constrained to respond to news. Panels C and D of Figure 11
report results based on our broad sample and show no statistically significant response of
consumption to bad news about future payment or refund. However, we find some decline in

                                                                        42
consumption in response to positive news, which suggests that, at least for this subsample
of households who do not all receive both payments and refunds, positive news about pay-
ments may be negative news about resources for consumption, such as investment wealth.
Figure A.VIII in the Appendix shows no significant effects for either positive or negative
news for our baseline sample (and point estimates suggest that positive news increases con-
sumption and negative decreases it).
    While panels A and B of Figure 11 show that households do not adjust their consumption
as news arrives, could our findings be due to mismeasurement of news about taxes uncovered
during filing?
    First, households might have biased expectations about their refunds and so our measures
of news could be incorrect. An arbitrary pattern of bias could lead to arbitrary bias in the
effect of news and filing on spending. However, if the bias has a central tendency, this average
bias would lead to a spending response to filing. Pessimism, like precautionary saving, would
appear as an average increase in spending around filing as households get good news that
they are receiving more money than expected. But prior evidence suggests that households
have reasonably accurate and unbiased estimates of taxes (Smeeding, Phillips, and O’Connor,
2000; Jones, 2012; Porto and Collins, 2017; Caldwell, Nelson, and Waldinger, 2018).
    Second, it could simply be that households learn information about their future tax
payment or refund far earlier than our statistical model suggests. If our measure of news
and/or its timing were unrelated to the information uncovered during filing, then we would
find no response of consumption or any other variable to news. In fact, our measure of news
does contain information, and households react to this information. Figure 9 shows that
households make transfers in response to our measure of news.



9     Theory: Refunds, Tax Payments, and Consumption
    This section contrasts our results with the prediction of the main theories of household
behavior that explain the previously observed high marginal propensity to consume out of
transitory income.




                                              43
Buffer-Stock Model In models with liquidity constraints, spending responses to expected
refunds and payments may be asymmetrically constrained.35 Households can always increase
savings to prepare to make a tax payment. But households with limited liquidity cannot
always borrow to increase spending in anticipation of a tax refund.36 Thus, a model with
liquidity constraints predicts different responses to news about refunds versus payments, as
we find. However, in contrast to our findings, the buffer-stock model predicts: (i) no spending
increase in response to refund arrival for liquid households, (ii) a decline in consumption prior
to payment, (iii) increases in spending shortly before refund arrival, and (iv) large changes
in response to news about payments (or small refunds) for the least liquid households (see
Figure 5 and discussion).
    While we also find no spending responses to news while people prepare their taxes, this is
not a strong rejection of the buffer stock model for two reasons. First, for liquid households,
tax refunds and payments are small relative to lifetime income; as such, the consumption
responses to news are predicted to be small (relative to the power of our tests). Second, for
relatively less liquid households who are expecting to make payments and thus who should
have stronger responses, the power of our tests is weak and we cannot rule out some response
to information.


Mental Accounting In models of mental accounts (Thaler, 1985; Shefrin and Thaler,
1988; Arkes, Joyner, Pezzo, Nash, Siegel-Jacobs, and Stone, 1994), households use rules of
thumb to determine their income and consumption paths. The theory is driven by empirical
observations (Thaler, 1999) and hence is limited in its predictions. In a specific framework,
Shefrin and Thaler (1988) proposes a theory of consumption and saving based on a behavioral
life-cycle. According to the theory, households maintain three mental accounts: current
income, current assets, and future income. The current income mental account contains
regular income and funds consumption. Hence, consumption tracks current income, and
households’ consumption is hypersensitive to income. Current assets are less liquid and are
  35
     Shea (1995a) investigates this asymmetry in aggregate data and shows that aggregate consumption
responds more to predictable decreases in income than to predictable increases.
  36
     Or if they can borrow, they may choose not to make the effort or pay the fixed cost to obtain credit, or
they may choose not to pay the higher interest rate on unsecured borrowing, or they may choose not to take
on the costs associated with turning less liquid assets into consumption.


                                                     44
saved for future use (e.g., retirement). The future income account is reserved for anticipated
income (e.g., future inheritance), and households follow a rule of thumb of not consuming
out of it until arrival (even if the arrival is guaranteed).
       In the context of our empirical setting, the behavioral life-cycle theory of Shefrin and
Thaler (1988) predicts our main findings. Anticipated tax refunds are classified as future
income until their actual arrival, and hence are not consumed ahead of time. Upon arrival,
refunds join the same pool as income from work and consumption, but because refunds are
not regular income, they are viewed like bonuses and so are partly consumed and partly saved.
Shefrin and Thaler (1988) argue that households use less-liquid accounts to store current
assets as a commitment mechanism against frivolous consumption. Thaler (1994) proposes
that a higher saving rate could be acheived simply by changing the mental classification of
tax refunds—by depositing refunds into retirement accounts (e.g., IRAs).37
       Shefrin and Thaler (1988) does not explicitly discuss tax payments. However, it is plau-
sible that tax payments would be considered as external to the income–consumption cycle
that takes place in the current income account. As such, households would use their liquid or
less-liquid assets to fund payments without lowering consumption. An interesting possibility
is that people mentally associate the tax payment with the source of the income that caused
the additional taxes. Thus, people who have lots of dividends or capital gains (realized or
just distributed by mutual funds) and therefore owe taxes feel that it is appropriate to pay
from these investment accounts. While this may be the case, this does not explain much
of the behavior we document. Transfers from non-core accounts such as brokerage accounts
make up very few of the transfers that we observe prior to payment.
       The predictions of a model of hyperbolic discounting with a commitment saving device
are quite similar (Angeletos et al., 2001). A rational hyperbolic saving model predicts some
anticipatory spending ahead of refund arrival; in our empirical setting, however, the economic
costs of transferring funds from a savings account to a checking account are negligible.
  37
     Shefrin and Thaler (1988) predicts that a tax cut without a change in the withholding rate should result
in a greater saving rate because tax refunds will increase over time and would be considered a “bonus” (part
consumed and part saved). In contrast, higher net income would be considered as destined to consumption.
Sahm, Shapiro, and Slemrod (2012) compare the response of consumption to rebates and reductions in
withholding. Feldman (2010) shows that saving rates decline the year following a decrease in the tax
withholding requirement.



                                                     45
Hand-to-Mouth and Models of Inattention Other theories of consumer behavior have
quite different implications and predict symmetric spending responses. If households are
living hand-to-mouth (as in Campbell and Mankiw, 1989) or behave as target savers as in
the Reis (2006) model of inattention, they consume their income (or some constant fraction
thereof). In this case, spending should increase with refund receipt but also fall with tax
payment. Further, if households are target spenders, consumption spending should not
respond to news, refund, or tax payment. Although in Reis (2006) these rules are time-
dependent, households might instead follow state-dependent or more sophisticated rules in
which their propensity to spend on arrival is related to the size of the utility loss caused
by spending behavior that deviates from that of the fully attentive model (e.g., Caballero,
1995).



10       Final Discussion
   We observe a specific sample of households that increase spending when they receive an
anticipated tax refund, consistent with prior research measuring the presence of probabilistically-
binding liquidity constraints or hand-to-mouth behavior (Zeldes, 1989; Olafsson and Pagel,
2018). This effect is stronger for less liquid households, a finding that again has been in-
terpreted as evidence of liquidity constraints. However, this behavior does not appear to be
driven by a lack of liquidity: These same households completely smooth consumption when
making anticipated tax payments, implying that they have the liquidity to smooth consump-
tion through refunds. They smooth consumption primarily by moving funds around among
savings and checking accounts prior to making payments as well as when bad news about
taxes due or refunds arrives. People bring in a small fraction of their payments from outside
accounts. They also accumulate slightly higher account balances in January in years when
they face higher payments or lower refunds.
   Thus, in our sample, people can weather temporary declines in income without cutting
consumption, and therefore they spend out of tax refunds largely by choice rather than due to
liquidity constraints. This behavior is consistent with a heuristic in which the savings account
is reserved for lumpy or necessary costs like tax payments and not used for discretionary


                                              46
current consumption. Among the models describing household behavior, our results best
match mental accounting behavior (Shefrin and Thaler, 1988), and our study provides a
relatively clean test of its predictions.
   Our results have important implications for at least two types of policies. First, the
behavior that we document would lead to quantitatively different dynamic responses to
income shocks in economic models. Because these consumers choose not to spend out of
future income, their responsiveness to information about future income or interest rates
would be limited and not determined by the distribution of liquid wealth. Similarly, their
response to changes in current income would differ by sign but not be as dependent on
liquidity. In macroeconomic models such as heterogeneous-agent New Keynesian models,
these features would alter the response of consumption demand both to economic shocks
and to policy responses ranging from fiscal transfers to forward guidance.
   Second, Shefrin and Thaler (1988); Thaler (1994) argues that in models where people
behave in the way that we find they do, savings would be higher if tax refunds were larger
(i.e., higher withholding rate) and if they were deposited into households’ savings accounts
(e.g., retirement saving accounts) directly instead into households’ checking accounts.

Table A.I.         Summary Statistics: Broader Population
This table presents summary statistics for our broad sample, which includes households that either make a
tax payment or receive a tax refund. Refund − Payment ($) is the average refund (less payment) amount
across household-years. Predicted Refund ($) shows the average predicted refund size. News Amount ($)
is the difference between the realized refund and the predicted refund. To ensure that the prediction is
unbiased, we use households that only make payments or only have refunds to make this prediction, so
the mean is nonzero. Filing to Ref/Pay (days) is the number of days between filing and the subsequent
payment/refund. I(Linked Credit Cards) is an indicator variable that equals one if the household has one
or more credit cards linked to the account aggregator, and zero otherwise. I(Unlinked Credit Cards) is an
indicator variable that equals one if the household has one or more unlinked credit cards, and zero otherwise.
I(Any Credit Cards) is an indicator that equals one if the household has either linked or unlinked credit
cards, and zero otherwise. Net Flow ($) is the difference between inflows and outflows to the core accounts.
Consumption ($) is observed consumption. Scaled Consumption ($) is the Consumption variable scaled up
to compensate for the presence of unlinked credit cards. Savings and Loans ($) shows payments to savings
accounts (net investing outflows, net transfers out) and net loan payments (mortgage, auto loan, and net
decrease in credit card debt). Misc Payments ($) is the sum of checks and uncategorized outflows. Income
($) is observed income. Net Interest ($), Interest Expense ($), and Interest Earned ($) are net interest,
interest expense, and interest earnings, respectively. Finally, Net CC Charge ($) is all linked credit card

Table A.II.       Cumulative Changes as a Percentage of Refund or Payment
This table shows the cumulative response (in percentage of refund or payment) of different account measures
to expected payments and refunds. The cumulative response is calculatedPfrom day −29, P      i.e., one month
                                                                             κ                  κ
prior to the payment or refund. The cumulative response is calculated as k=−29 γk+ and k=−29 γk− , for
different horizons κ from the estimation of equation 3 on the measure of consumption spending. Standard
errors, shows in parentheses, are clustered by the household-year and calendar day.

Figure A.I. Consumption Response for Households Not Making Small Payments
or Receiving Small Refunds
The figure shows the consumption response to making tax payments (panels A and C) and the arrival of
tax refunds (panels B and D). The sample includes all household-years for which the payment or refund is
greater than $2,000 in magnitude, resulting in a sample of 21,476 household-years. Panels A and B show
the response of all transactions classified as consumption. Panels C and D show the subset of transactions
classified as restaurants. The x -axis represents the number of days after the tax payment or receipt of
refund. The y-axis shows the propensity to spend out of payment or refund. These responses are computed
from equation 3. The shaded region represents two standard errors confidence intervals. Standard errors are
doubled-clustered at the household-year and at the calendar-date levels.

Figure A.III. Consumption Responses Controlling for Household-Level Day and
Month Spending Patterns across Years and in a Large Sample of Households
The figure shows the consumption response to making tax payments (panels A and C) and the arrival of tax
refunds (panels B and D). Panels A and B show the response of all transactions classified as consumption.
Panels C and D show the subset of transactions classified as restaurants. Unlike the other figures, these
responses are not computed from equation 3. Rather, we estimate these responses without filing or news
independent variables. Further, we introduce several new fixed effects into this specification: household ×
calendar month, household × day of week, household × first three days of month, household × last three
days of month, and household × 14th to 16th of month. Due to these household fixed effects, we require each
household to have at least three years of data in our sample. After applying the above filters, our sample
consists of 34,999 household-years. The x -axis represents the number of days after the tax payment or receipt
of refund. The y-axis shows the propensity to spend out of payment or refund. The shaded region represents
two standard errors confidence intervals. Standard errors are doubled-clustered at the household-year and
at the calendar-date levels.

Figure A.IV. Consumption Response to Payment of Taxes and Arrival of Refunds
in the Broad Sample of Accounts
The figure shows the consumption response to making tax payments (panels A and C) and the arrival of tax
refunds (panels B and D). Panels A and B show the response of all transactions classified as consumption.
Panels C and D show the subset of transactions classified as restaurants. The x -axis represents the number
of days after the tax payment or receipt of refund. The y-axis shows the propensity to spend out of payment
or refund. These responses are computed from equation 3. In this figure, we alleviate the requirement that
households make a payment in at least one year and receive a refund in at least one year. The resultant
sample consists of 307,702 household-years. The shaded region represents two standard errors confidence
intervals. Standard errors are doubled-clustered at the household-year and at the calendar-date levels.

Figure A.V. Consumption Response for Households with Low Liquidity as Mea-
sured by Net Interest
Panels A and B show the abnormal consumption around tax payment and refund dates, as a function of
payment and refund amounts for household-years with low liquidity based on net interest received during
November, December, and January preceding tax season. For households in our similar sample (those that
make tax payments in some years and receive tax refunds in other years), we take the bottom tercile of
net interest earned, resulting in a sample of 18,285 household-years with an average net interest earned of
negative $77.40 per month. For households in our broader sample, we take the top quintile of net inter-
est earned, resulting in a sample of 49,101 household-years with an average net interest earned of negative
$111.61 per month. Since interest rates on checking/savings are close to zero over this time period, this
implies a revolving credit card balance of roughly $500 ($600 in the broad sample). The markers denote
averages at every 5% of the data for those who received refunds, and every 10% of the data for those who
made payments. Panels C and D show the cumulative response of external saving and debt payment to
making tax payments and receiving refunds, respectively. The horizontal axes measure days since payment
or refund arrival. The shaded region represents two standard errors confidence intervals. Standard errors
are doubled-clustered at the household-year and at the calendar-date levels.

Figure A.VI. Consumption Response for Households with High Liquidity as Mea-
sured by Net Interest
Panels A and B show the abnormal consumption around tax payment and refund dates, as a function of
payment and refund amounts for household-years with high liquidity based on net interest received during
the November, December, and January preceding tax season. For households in our similar sample (those
that make tax payments in some years and receive tax refunds in other years), we take the top tercile of net
interest earned, resulting in a sample of 18,277 household-years with an average net interest earned of $9.87
per month. For households in our broader sample, we take the top quintile of net interest earned, resulting
in a sample of 49,090 household-years with an average net interest earned of $10.89 per month. Because
interest rates on checking/savings are close to zero over this time period, this cutoff suggests a balance of
at least roughly $500 ($600 in the broad sample). The markers denote averages at every 5% of the data for
those who received refunds, and every 10% of the data for those who made payments. Panels C and D show
the cumulative response of external saving and debt payment to making tax payments and receiving refunds,
respectively. The horizontal axes measure days since payment or refund arrival. The shaded region repre-
sents two standard errors confidence intervals. Standard errors are doubled-clustered at the household-year
and at the calendar-date levels.
